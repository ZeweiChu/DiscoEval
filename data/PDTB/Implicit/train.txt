6	Solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot , because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited	The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem : He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting , so he does n't have to play the same Mozart and Strauss concertos over and over again
8	Richard Stoltzman has taken a gentler , more audience-friendly approach	Years ago , he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi , which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen 's `` Quartet for the End of Time
8	and now goes on the road with piano , bass , a slide show , and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop , with a few notable exceptions	Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set , the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening
8	But you ca n't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman 's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight	He believes in what he plays , and he plays superbly

5	And so it went through the first half : an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none that would disturb or challenge a listener	Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues : Bill Douglas , pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from Yale , and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez
9	Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues : Bill Douglas , pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from Yale , and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez	An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas , beginning with `` Golden Rain , '' a lilting , laid-back lead in to the uptempo `` Sky , '' which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers

8	The end of the first half , however , brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for : the pop singer Judy Collins , who appears on `` Inner Voices	Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever , Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell 's `` For Free '' -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist , to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas 's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing , `` Deep Peace

5	Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half ? Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone	Either way it was a pity
2	Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it	He warned us in advance that `` New York Counterpoint '' lasts 11 1/2 minutes
9	He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate , jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson 's images , this time of geometric or repeating objects , in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich 's piece and Mr. Stoltzman 's elegant execution of it	The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker , Ornette Coleman , Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez , with pictures for the Douglas pieces
8	The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker , Ornette Coleman , Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez , with pictures for the Douglas pieces	It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club , but like the first half , much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable

2	That 's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant	In a labor-intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile.They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile plants

5	The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants	The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies

1	In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds	At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility
8	The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop	They attached a second gene , for herbicide resistance , to the pollen-inhibiting gene.Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants , which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed . The laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible.The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants , leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed

6	In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co	One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant 's pollen
2	Plant Genetic 's approach `` interesting '' and `` novel , '' and `` complementary rather than competitive	There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds
8	Plant Genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops.That 's because pollination , while easy in corn because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton	It 's one thing to say you can sterilize , and another to then successfully pollinate the plant

8	What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue	Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ( $ 352 million ) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks , led by Industrial Bank of Japan , were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand 's civil-service pension fund.Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid , most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week

2	With Japan 's cash-flush banks aligned against it , though , raising money may be difficult	Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market , they might be able to scuttle borrowings there , too
8	New Zealand 's finance minister , David Caygill , lashed out at such suggestions	He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd. , an investment bank 80 % -owned by the National Provident Fund , and would n't bail it out . `` It may very well be what the Japanese banks want , '' he told Radio New Zealand . `` I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests

8	No less significant than the Japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries	Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other
2	Both sides are jealously guarding their turf , and relations have been at a flashpoint for months	The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business.Meanwhile , the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks
8	In the past year , both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses	Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed cardholders to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account , attracting the wrath of banks.And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas , a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms

2	This week was uneventful for the CD market	The major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month Treasury bill rates '' in the past two weeks
2	The major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month Treasury bill rates '' in the past two weeks	Banks that adjusted payouts on CDs in the most recent week made only fractional moves
6	The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday	The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.04 % , up from 7.90 %
7	The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.04 % , up from 7.90 %	The average three-month issue rose to 8.05 % from 7.77 %
2	Typically , banks offer CD yields higher than those on Treasury bills , which are considered the safest short-term investments	banks need a competitive edge to sell their products
6	Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields	The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90 % , down from 7.93 %
1	The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90 % , down from 7.93 %	For longer-term CDs , yields were up
6	For longer-term CDs , yields were up	The average two-year and five-year jumbos were up 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.91 % and 7.96 % , respectively
8	Among the major banks surveyed by Banxquote in six regions of the country , 8.33 % is the highest yield available	It is offered by the flagship banks of New York 's Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in the one-year maturity only
5	It is offered by the flagship banks of New York 's Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in the one-year maturity only	The yield is offered across a range of maturities at San Francisco 's BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co
1	The yield is offered across a range of maturities at San Francisco 's BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co	Just two weeks ago , BankAmerica 's yields in many of those maturities was 8.61 %
2	Still , on average , the major California banks have the highest yields on CDs , according to Banxquote	The average yield there on six-month issues is 8.32 %
4	But as the French embody a Zen-like state of blase when it comes to athletics ( try finding a Nautilus machine in Paris ) , my fellow conventioners were having none of it	The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing ( ballooning to you ; the brothers Montgolfier , French of course , were the world 's first hot-air balloonists
2	As in : `` You went ballooning ? ? ! ! In France	Americans have followed Malcolm Forbes 's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way
2	Americans it seems have followed Malcolm Forbes 's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way	During the past 25 years , the number of balloonists ( those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighter-than-air test ) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand , with some estimates running as high as 10,000
5	During the past 25 years , the number of balloonists ( those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighter-than-air test ) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand , with some estimates running as high as 10,000	Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the U.S. , including the world 's largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs -- the nine-day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons , some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda , Garfield or a 12-story-high condom
0	or a 12-story-high condom	The condom balloon was denied official entry status this year
8	But in Epinal , a gray 16th-century river town adjacent to France 's Vosges mountain region , none of these Yankee-come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident	Ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work
1	Ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work	Feeling the naggings of a culture imperative , I promptly signed up
8	I 'm not referring to the traditional champagne drenching during the back-on-terra-firma toast	I 'm talking about landing in a canal
7	I 'm talking about landing in a canal	In a porous wicker basket
7	I 'm talking about landing in a canal.In a porous wicker basket	With a pilot who speaks no English
5	In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order ( the baskets hold no more than four passengers	When it was n't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `` chase car , '' listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie
9	When it was n't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `` chase car , '' listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie	After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields
5	After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields	It 's hard not to feel that God 's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world , even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how `` belle '' it all was
2	No wonder	We were coming down straight into their canal
2	We were coming down straight into their canal	See , the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you ca n't steer
8	that you ca n't steer.And neither can your pilot	You can go only up or down and ride the air currents
2	and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour	When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion
1	When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion	Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel , well , airborne in a picnic basket
9	What 's he doing ? '' hissed my companion , who was the only other English-speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white	Attention , '' yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal
9	Attention , '' yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal	You bet attention , '' I yelled back , leaping atop the propane tanks , `` I 'm wearing alligator loafers
9	You bet attention , '' I yelled back , leaping atop the propane tanks , `` I 'm wearing alligator loafers	Our pilot simply laughed , fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us , oh , a good 12-inches above the water level
9	Our pilot simply laughed , fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us , oh , a good 12-inches above the water level	We scuttled along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again
9	Eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in	I looked at my watch
5	that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground , punching all the air out of it , rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer	It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning
2	me nursing an espresso and my ego	A whole morning of ballooning and I had been off the ground barely 30 minutes
1	As for the ride back to camp , our pilot and all the other French-speaking passengers clambered into the chase car	My American companion and I were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket
2	My American companion and I were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket	As we streaked by a blase gendarme , I could n't resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting
6	Differences between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on the usefulness of intervention to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing	Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , who had dissented from the Treasury 's policy , told lawmakers , `` I became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market
0	Rep. John LaFalce ( D. , N.Y. ) said Mr. Johnson refused to testify jointly with Mr. Mulford and instead asked to appear after the Treasury official had completed his testimony	A Fed spokesman denied Mr. LaFalce 's statement
2	West Germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter	The solution is stronger domestic growth { in Germany }
2	Five officials of this investment banking firm were elected directors : E. Garrett Bewkes III , a 38-year-old managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department ; Michael R. Dabney , 44 , a managing director who directs the principal activities group which provides funding for leveraged acquisitions ; Richard Harriton , 53 , a general partner who heads the correspondent clearing services ; Michael Minikes , 46 , a general partner who is treasurer ; and William J. Montgoris , 42 , a general partner who is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer	The board increased by one to 26 members
5	The board increased by one to 26 members	In the past year , one inside director resigned , while three others retired
8	But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable , they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank	Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined
1	Tanks currently are defined as armored vehicles weighing 25 tons or more that carry large guns	The Soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks , which are as light as 10 tons
2	But the issue is stickier than it seems	France , Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks
6	Defining combat aircraft is even tougher	The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks , then argued for exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are `` solely defensive
2	The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks , then argued for exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are `` solely defensive . '' NATO has n't budged from its insistence that any gun-carrying plane has offensive capability	The dispute over that issue , according to one U.S. official , is a `` potential treaty stopper , '' and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve it
2	Other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals	It 's just going to be sloppy , both on our side and theirs { the Warsaw Pact 's }
8	So far , neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President Bush has allowed	They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude
2	The bottom line is that if we can get that { Warsaw Pact } superiority brought down to parity , we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible	about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate
5	Two of the 757-200s are new aircraft to be delivered to American Trans Air , the main subsidiary of Amtran Inc. , in December 1991 and January 1992	Four of the planes were purchased by International Lease from Singapore Airlines in a previously announced transaction

5	The venture would be the latest in Coke 's rapid expansion of overseas investment	So far this year , it has put nearly $ 700 million into bottling operations in Australia , New Zealand and France
2	That 's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area , it sees an economic and demographic gold mine	In countries such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore , economies are growing , resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks
2	In the past , however , Coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures	By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas , Coke has been able to improve bottlers ' efficiency and production , and in some cases , marketing
0	By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas , Coke has been able to improve bottlers ' efficiency and production , and in some cases , marketing	Coke has tended to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country
8	a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate	In Singapore , per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the U.S
2	where per-capita consumption is n't as high as in Singapore	Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets
0	Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets	he could n't say whether that is the direction of the talks
8	The Aga Khan , meanwhile , agreed to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg-based Ifint S.A. , another Agnelli family company , for 7.45 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 's capital	His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares , which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies
2	Your Oct. 2 page-one article on people riding so-called `` railbikes '' on railroad tracks was a disservice to your readers	It unfortunately encourages others to engage in a highly dangerous and illegal activity that only a very few are doing now
6	The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue	President Bush in June vetoed a measure passed by Congress and said he would n't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year 's debate on the issue
8	The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the White House had said it would accept	Under the agreement with the House and Senate leaders , the minimum wage would rise from the current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991
1	Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ 4.25 an hour by the end of 1991 , coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer	Under the compromise , the $ 4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier , while the training subminimum would be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan
2	Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately	With congressional elections next year , GOP leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers
2	With congressional elections next year , GOP leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers	Republicans have been imploring the White House to compromise on the wage issue
7	The House is scheduled to vote this week on the compromise , as a substitute to a new Democratic bill , itself watered down from last spring 's version	The Senate will probably vote not long afterward
6	Some Democrats thought they might have compromised too much	Rep. Austin Murphy ( D. , Pa. ) , chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee , said they might have done better `` if we 'd held their feet to the fire
5	Rep. Austin Murphy ( D. , Pa. ) , chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee , said they might have done better `` if we 'd held their feet to the fire	Mr. Kennedy suggested Democrats `` yielded a great deal '' on the size of the increase , but he cited concessions from the White House on the training wage , which he said make it `` less harsh
5	With only 16-year-olds to 19-year-olds eligible , 68 % of workers getting less than $ 4.25 an hour , who are adults , wo n't be subject to the training wage	the compromise has `` adequate safeguards , so the youth are not exploited and older workers are not displaced
5	Houston Lighting 's current situation has some positive aspects , including managing `` very well '' the construction and commercial operation risks of Units 1 and 2 of the South Texas Project nuclear power plant	Capital requirements will be declining and no new generating facilities will be required for several years
5	Scott C. Smith , formerly vice president , finance , and chief financial officer of this media concern , was named senior vice president	Mr. Smith , 39 , retains the title of chief financial officer
8	Moreover , such a sale could help Armstrong reassure its investors and deter the Belzbergs , who own a 9.85 % stake in the Lancaster , Pa. , company	Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition
2	Analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to Armstrong and Shaw , the market leader in the U.S. carpet industry , with an estimated 17 % to 20 % share	Shaw , based in Dalton , Ga. , has annual sales of about $ 1.18 billion , and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong 's brands , sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names
5	Yesterday , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Shaw 's shares closed ex-dividend at $ 26.125 , up $ 2.25	Armstrong 's shares , also listed on the Big Board , closed at $ 39.125 , up 12.5 cents

8	I do n't think it provides much new information on the economy	So far this year , the index of leading indicators has risen in four months , fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month
2	but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators	Because the figures are based on a small sample , the department said it is 90 % confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between 5 % and 23 % during the month
1	The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan	This measure had dropped sharply in August
0	This measure had dropped sharply in August	that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index , the influence of this component has been reduced
8	Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September	These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods , lead times on vendor deliveries , orders for new plant and equipment , and backlogs of orders for durable goods
1	that 61 % do n't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later	The remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in
1	Although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates , 60 % of the executives said they would prefer that the Fed keep inflation-fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates	The other 40 % said the Fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down
5	After various adjustments , they produced a 0.5 % rise in the index for August and a 0.2 % rise for September	September , and the change from August , are : from 1.11 in the previous month
8	The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities	As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant 's performance
5	Bids totaling $ 515 million were submitted	Accepted bids ranged from 8.38 % to 8.395 %
7	Bids totaling $ 475 million were submitted	Accepted bids ranged from 8 % to 8.019 %
5	Accepted bids ranged from 8 % to 8.019 %	The bank holding company will auction another $ 50 million in each maturity next Tuesday
2	It 's also unnecessary	Amateur spy-chaser Clifford Stoll is a real person , or as he might waggishly put it , a surreal person
5	He is 37 , an astronomer with impressive credentials , and something of a genius at making computers do his bidding	He once described himself as a `` Berkeley Hippie , '' and played the role well ; obligatory ragged jeans , a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional , including , for a time at least , formal marriage to his `` sweetheart , '' Martha Matthews
10	He also is an entertaining writer , combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work	In `` The Cuckoo 's Egg '' ( Doubleday , 326 pages , $ 19.95 ) , he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts over 18 months to catch a computer spy
6	The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans , accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB	One of them , 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover , allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S. , searching for secrets
2	One of them , 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover , allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S. , searching for secrets	He probably did n't penetrate any top-secret files , but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates , Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski , $ 15,000 for some of the material Hess collected
5	He probably did n't penetrate any top-secret files , but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates , Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski , $ 15,000 for some of the material Hess collected	They promised yet more for really good stuff
2	Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo 's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds , making them surrogate parents	The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing/electronic mail program called Gnu-Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT & T.Using Gnu-Emacs , the spy could substitute a bogus `` atrun '' program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix system every five minutes

9	Using Gnu-Emacs , the spy could substitute a bogus `` atrun '' program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix system every five minutes	Once his cuckoo 's egg was laid , he could enter Unix and become a `` super-user , '' with access to everything
9	and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab 's computers	He discovered a 75-cent discrepancy in the charges made to various departments for computer time and traced it to a user named `` Hunter
2	and traced it to a user named `` Hunter , '' who had no valid billing address	Mr. Stoll suspected the intruder was one of those precocious students who has fun breaking into computers
10	and traced it to a user named `` Hunter , '' who had no valid billing address	Mr. Stoll suspected the intruder was one of those precocious students who has fun breaking into computers
9	But after much tracking , it became evident to Mr. Stoll that the hacker was not on the Berkeley campus or even in California	Finding him became an obsession for Mr. Stoll
6	Finding him became an obsession for Mr. Stoll	He made a midnight requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab 's computers
5	He made a midnight requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab 's computers	After discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named Joe Sventek , he rigged up an alarm system , including a portable beeper , to alert him when Sventek came on the line

6	but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies	The White Sands missile range and CIA contractor Mitre Inc. were among the targets
5	When the hacker moved , Mr. Stoll moved too , calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion	Sometimes , if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file , he would drag his keychain across the terminal to create static or slow the system down to frustrate his quarry
6	and he had the impression other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape	The CIA told him it does not do domestic counterespionage
5	The CIA told him it does not do domestic counterespionage	One learns a lot from this book , or seems to , about crippling federal bureaucracy
8	One learns a lot from this book , or seems to , about crippling federal bureaucracy	Seems to '' because it 's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll
8	Finally , he got help	Tymnet is a major network linking computers.One of its international specialists , Steve White , took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll 's hunt , ultimately tracing the hacker to West Germany
10	Eventually , Mr. Stoll was invited to both the CIA and NSA to brief high-ranking officers on computer theft	He savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned-up chaps
9	He savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned-up chaps	Back in Berkeley , he was violently scolded by a left-wing lady friend for consorting with such people
2	Back in Berkeley , he was violently scolded by a left-wing lady friend for consorting with such people	He became angry in return
2	He became angry in return	He had developed a hatred for the hacker and a grudging appreciation of the federal `` spooks '' who make national security their business

8	At that price the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines	In the price range it 's a tremendously high-performing product
2	the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications	This clearly demonstrates that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company

8	The thing it says about Mips is that they 're on a roll right now	They 're getting some major wins
5	Last month , for example , Mips agreed to supply its computers to Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and France 's Groupe Bull	Sony Corp. , Tandem Computers Inc. and Digital Equipment have agreed to sell MIPS computers and companies such as Japan 's NEC Corp. and West Germany 's Siemens A.G. have agreed to make Mips chips under license
2	The machine is essentially a mainframe computer	Suddenly CDC ( Control Data ) has a competitive product to fight back against the VAX9000 , '' a machine Digital announced last month
7	The machine uses a single processor , which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors	The computer can process 13.3 million calculations called floating-point operations every second

2	Instead the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress	The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law
9	The RTC has projected that it will require between $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in temporary working capital	The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold
8	But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny	To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible
2	But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital	If working capital financing is not provided the RTC may have to slow { S & L sales } or dump acquired assets through fire sales

5	Under the agreement , Healthcare , a manager of health-care facilities , said it would pay HealthVest $ 3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $ 1.1 million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities	In return , HealthVest agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and remedies against Healthcare during the 120-day period
2	After the payment , Healthcare still will be $ 6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest , a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare	Healthcare has given HealthVest a 12 % note for that overdue amount , to be repaid over three years
1	In addition , Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $ 2.7 million to $ 3 million to HealthVest during the standstill period , to be paid when Healthcare successfully completes asset sales	Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $ 4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month , the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note

2	But then Judge O'Kicki often behaved like a man who would be king -- and , some say , an arrogant and abusive one	While his case may be extreme , it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges
8	Last March , nine months after the judge 's swearing-in , the state attorney general 's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than 10 years of `` official oppression '' in Cambria County , a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania	The allegations , ranging from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness , paint a disquieting picture

4	The judge , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began this week , vehemently denies all the allegations against him , calling them `` ludicrous '' and `` imaginative , political demagoguery	He blames the indictment on local political feuding , unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them

2	My name is judge , '' Judge O'Kicki told a car salesman in Ebensburg when he bought a new red Pontiac Sunbird in October 1984 , according to the grand-jury report	The dealership dutifully recorded the sale under the name `` Judge O'Kicki
2	The arrogance of a judge , his demeanor , the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint	Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong

6	Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report	When the judge bought his new Sunbird from James E.

Then , as an additional precaution , the car dealership took the judge 's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents . But when the judge received his payment book , he disavowed the deal . `` There was no loan , there is no loan , there never shall be a loan , '' the judge wrote the bank on his judicial stationery , according to the report

2	The bank acquiesced	It refinanced the judge 's loan , lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade-in that had n't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up 1981 Chevy Citation the dealer had to repair before it could be resold
2	The incident was n't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank	Two years later , he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $ 10,000 loan was `` absolutely onerous .

9	Separately , a federal judge hearing Mr. Hunt 's bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $ 65.7 million settlement between Mr. Hunt and Minpeco S.A. , another major creditor in the case	The Peruvian minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $ 251 million against Mr. Hunt
9	In addition to turning down the compromise , Judge Harold C. Abramson said he would allow a claim of only $ 19.7 million	Minpeco attorneys said they would appeal the decision to a federal district court

8	An increasing number of big Japanese investors are buying up U.S. home mortgages that have been pooled and packaged for sale as interest-bearing instruments known as mortgage-backed securities	As much as 10 % of new U.S. mortgage securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association , or Fannie Mae , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , or Freddie Mac , now flow into Japanese hands
3	You ca n't say it 's a `` tsunami '' ( tidal wave ) , but we 're making some headway	Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago
8	Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago	The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here

7	Earlier this year , Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank , had no trouble selling out a special $ 570 million mortgage-securities trust it created for Japanese investors	Industrial Bank of Japan , which claims to be the biggest Japanese buyer of U.S. mortgage securities , says it will more than double its purchases this year , to an amount one official puts at several billion dollars
1	Last year , there were only several big investors who were interested	This year , some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot
2	First , they are safe	While they are n't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government , as Treasury bonds are , it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary
8	Second , they are liquid	The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ 900 billion , or nearly half of the $ 2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued
8	Third , they offer high yields	At the moment , some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities
8	But there is a risk	Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time , issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity
2	issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity	That 's a headache for long-term investors , since it forces them to reinvest their money
8	But they did n't lose touch with the U.S. issuers	Since 1985 , Japanese investors have bought nearly 80 % of $ 10 billion in Fannie Mae corporate debt issued to foreigners
5	In addition , further packaging of mortgage-backed securities , such as Blackstone 's fund , have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do n't have to	Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments

6	Institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill	Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record
7	Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record	Does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values , and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period
7	Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record ? Does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values , and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period	Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy
1	However , the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted , they survive forever	Although the current management team may be outstanding , who will be the CEO in 10 years
7	Although the current management team may be outstanding , who will be the CEO in 10 years	Although the five-year strategy may be excellent , what will be the strategy in 25 years
6	The solution to this problem is a time-limited poison pill	The limit could range from three years to seven years , depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan
9	The limit could range from three years to seven years	At the end of this period , the poison pill would be eliminated automatically , unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current shareholders
8	One rare example of a time-limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by Pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from Texaco	Pennzoil 's poison pill covers five years in order to give current management enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner
8	Another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup Inc. , a diversified holding company	The State of Wisconsin Investment Board , which owned about 7 % of the company 's voting stock , worked with management to devise a time-limited poison pill.This pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders

's $ 610 million purchase of the Exxon Building , part of Rockefeller Center , in 1986	In Los Angeles , Arco Plaza was sold to Shuwa Corp. for $ 620 million in 1986 , and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. paid $ 300 million for Atlanta 's IBM Tower last year
2	Many Japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country 's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties	Mitsubishi Estate 's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan
8	Mitsubishi Estate 's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan	Those who have no money and are n't buying think it 's right to refrain , but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention
6	Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources	In asset terms , Mitsubishi Estate is the largest real estate firm in Japan
8	In asset terms , Mitsubishi Estate is the largest real estate firm in Japan	The core of its holdings is 190,000 square meters of incredibly expensive property in the Marunouchi district , the business and financial center of Tokyo , often jokingly called `` Mitsubishi Village
2	At the time , Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center	Mitsubishi built the government 's dream development in exchange for the official decision to locate Tokyo 's central railway station there

5	In the year ended March 31 , 57.4 % of its total revenue came from office building management	Its earnings can rise 10 % to 12 % annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases

2	Warner Communications Inc. has filed a $ 1 billion breach-of-contract suit against Sony and the two producers	Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio
2	But it may amount to little more than posturing	the two have continued on-again , off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks , and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week
2	Instead , Sony is likely to agree to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses , such as the record club of Sony 's CBS Records unit	Warner has surpassed Sony as the largest record company , but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like CBS
8	One , for example , came from CBS Records Chairman Walter Yetnikoff	In his affidavit , Mr. Yetnikoff accused Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross of having an `` antiSony , anti-Japanese bias '' and said that Mr. Ross had tried to talk him out of letting Sony buy CBS Records two years ago for that reason
2	But despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff , officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities	Time executives such as the company 's president , N.J. Nicholas have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the Guber-Peters duo , and were never directly drawn into the fray
2	But that does n't mean Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects	studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year

6	Chivas Class is n't the first such promotion	Last year , J & B Scotch offered 500 TWA frequent flier miles in exchange for a label
8	But the scope of Seagram 's Chivas promotion sets it apart	The current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three-to-five-year direct marketing plan

8	That the membership number has even kept close to its 1976 size is the result of the `` graying '' of the church	Many of the enthusiastic young `` Moonies '' of the Nixon era who remained faithful to Father Moon are now parents , producing new members by procreation rather than conversion
2	The reputed wealth of the Unification Church is another matter of contention	For a while in the 1970s it seemed Mr . Moon was on a spending spree , with such purchases as the former New Yorker Hotel and its adjacent Manhattan Center ; a fishing/processing conglomerate with branches in Alaska , Massachusetts , Virginia and Louisiana ; a former Christian Brothers monastery and the Seagram family mansion ( both picturesquely situated on the Hudson River ) ; shares in banks from Washington to Uruguay ; a motion picture production company , and newspapers , such as the Washington Times , the New York City Tribune ( originally the News World ) , and the successful Spanish-language Noticias del Mundo . Yet these purchases can be misleading
8	Yet these purchases can be misleading	Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from South Korea and Japan , minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages
2	Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from South Korea and Japan , minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages	Those teams of young fund-raisers selling flowers , peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near $ 20 million a year during the mid-to-late 1970s , but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr . Moon 's lavish international conferences , speaking tours , and assorted land buys
6	Mr . Moon 's two English-language U.S. newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain	Start-up costs for the Washington Times alone were close to $ 50 million , and the total amount lost in this journalistic black hole was estimated at $ 150 million by 1984
0	which are a further drain	that not even their editors know for sure how much these show-piece publications , along with the newspapers , have cost Mr . Moon
5	Many American church-owned businesses , such as a $ 30 million factory to build fishing vessels , are defunct	Some components of the American church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year
5	Some components of the American church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year	The relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests -- and press scrutiny -- in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and austere than the thousand-person get-togethers in fancy digs and exotic locales of years past
8	According to veteran watchers of Unificationist affairs , such as Dr. J. Gordon Melton , director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion , almost all operations are being drastically reduced as Mr . Moon now concentrates more on developing his empire in the Far East	Everything is going back to Korea and Japan
2	Everything , '' one non- '' Moonie '' senior consultant to the Unification Church recently told me in an interview , `` is going back to Korea and Japan	Europe had proved even less hospitable than North America

8	So Mr . Moon is in retreat , refocusing on the Far East	South Korea and Japan continue to be profitable
5	South Korea and Japan continue to be profitable	Moon 's Tong'Il industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in China , where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting converts even in the wake of the bloody massacre in Tiananmen Square
8	According to senior consultants to the church , Mr . Moon has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the Chinese government to build an automobile-parts plant in Guangdong Province , an area of China with a substantial Korean minority	Mr .

5	Employees wore identification badges listing not only their names but also their dates of hire	No one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken first , so younger employees seldom spoke up at all
5	But in 1986 , the badges and the `` do n't speak out of turn '' rule were abolished -- early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight train	In recent years , Nissan has instituted flex-time work schedules and allowed employees to dress casually , even in blue jeans

0	And in a Japanese corporate first , Nissan recently opened the first coed company dormitory for single employees at the suburban Tokyo technical center	We had lots of internal debate about this one
0	This corporate glasnost is a big reason Nissan , after years of making lackluster cars and lousy profits , has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits , ranging from the sleek Maxima sedan and Porsche-like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao , a minicar sold only in Japan	The company 's turnaround is far from complete
2	The company 's turnaround is far from complete	many crucial tests are just beginning
2	The big one : A company 's culture ca n't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge	Atsushi Muramatsu , Nissan 's executive vice president for finance , helped set the tone in December 1986 , when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery
8	Atsushi Muramatsu , Nissan 's executive vice president for finance , helped set the tone in December 1986 , when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery	This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us , '' he said
5	This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us , '' he said	Yutaka Kume , who took the helm as Nissan 's president in June 1985 , added simply , `` I am deeply disappointed
2	No wonder	Nissan , Japan 's second-largest auto maker and the world 's fourth-largest , was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival , Toyota Motor Corp. , but also by Honda Motor Co. , the most successful Japanese car company in the U.S. but a relative pipsqueak in Japan
5	Nissan 's market share in Japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade	Its U.S. sales sagged , partly because of price increases due to the rising yen
5	Its U.S. sales sagged , partly because of price increases due to the rising yen	Worst of all , Nissan was preoccupied with management infighting , cronyism and corporate rigidity

1	The oldest designer got to work on the dashboard	The next level down did doors
2	The next level down did doors	If a new person got to work on part of the speedometer , that was a big deal
2	This system produced boring , boxy cars that consumers just were n't buying	Desperately hoping to spark sales , Nissan transferred 5,000 middle managers and plant workers to dealerships
6	Some town-watching excursions were downright comic	One group of middle-aged manufacturing men from the company 's Zama plant outside Tokyo was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city
6	Other trips were more productive	Mr. Kume himself visited Honda 's headquarters in Tokyo 's upscale Aoyama district
9	Later , Nissan borrowed other Honda practices , including an engineering `` idea contest '' to promote inventiveness	One engineer developed a `` crab car '' that moves sideways
0	so much so , in fact , that some older employees have resisted	Nissan handled the die-hards in a typically Japanese fashion : They were n't fired but instead `` were neglected
6	Despite the pain of adjusting , the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars	A year ago , the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan , the $ 17,699 Maxima , which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans ; it replaced its boxy , pug-nosed body with sleek , aerodynamic lines
8	A year ago , the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan , the $ 17,699 Maxima , which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans	it replaced its boxy , pug-nosed body with sleek , aerodynamic lines
2	A year ago , the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan , the $ 17,699 Maxima , which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans ; it replaced its boxy , pug-nosed body with sleek , aerodynamic lines.Since then , Nissan also has launched new versions of the $ 13,249 240SX sporty coupe and 300ZX sports car.The restyled 300ZX costs as much as $ 33,000 and is squared off against the Porche 944 , which begins at $ 41,900.Besides new styling , the new Nissans have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems	All three new models are outselling their predecessors by wide margins
6	Nissan helped develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme	The chairs are S-Cargo seats , and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the Pao 's oversized speedometer
2	All these vehicles have sharply improved Nissan 's morale and image -- but have n't done much for its market share	Nissan had 29 % of the Japanese car market in 1980 before beginning a depressing eight-year slide that continued through last year
2	that continued through last year	Strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide , but even the 25 % market share that Nissan expects in 1989 will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade
2	Nissan concedes that it wo n't recoup all its market-share losses in Japan until at least 1995 , and even that timetable might prove optimistic	Everyone else is going to catch up '' with Nissan 's innovative designs
8	Everyone else is going to catch up '' with Nissan 's innovative designs	Nissan 's pace of new-model hits will slow just as arch-rival Toyota unleashes its own batch of new cars
2	Why	So far , Nissan 's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential
1	So far , Nissan 's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential	In compact and subcompact cars , the bread-and-butter sales generators for Japanese auto makers , Nissan still trails Toyota and Honda
9	that that will start to change this fall , with its new version of the Stanza compact sedan	The Stanza has been a nonentity compared with Honda 's hugely successful Accord and Toyota 's Camry
2	Nissan instead has kept its new Stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6 %	at $ 11,450 , Stanza prices start $ 749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine
1	at $ 11,450 , Stanza prices start $ 749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine	Accord prices start at $ 12,345
2	Even if the new Stanza succeeds , Nissan will remain behind in the subcompact segment , where its Sentra does n't measure up to the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla	Nissan will introduce a completely revamped Sentra next fall
8	Nissan started advertising Infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit American showrooms	The ads featured fences , rocks and pussy-willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves
2	The ads featured fences , rocks and pussy-willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves	The ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other U.S. auto advertising
8	On the other hand , Nissan 's sales goals for Infiniti are modest compared with Toyota 's targets for Lexus	Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $ 38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedans each month , sending about 2,000 of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan.Toyota wants to sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedans next year in the U.S. alone
1	Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $ 38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedans each month , sending about 2,000 of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan	Toyota wants to sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedans next year in the U.S. alone
2	that Nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus	Infiniti is Nissan 's big business move for the 21st century
8	Infiniti is Nissan 's big business move for the 21st century , and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away	Despite plans to add two new Infiniti models next year , bringing the total to four , Infiniti wo n't show profits for at least five years
2	These days Nissan can afford that strategy , even though profits are n't exactly robust	Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ( $ 868 million ) in the fiscal year ended last March 31 , a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier , when the company lost money on operations
8	Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ( $ 868 million ) in the fiscal year ended last March 31 , a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier , when the company lost money on operations	Nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales
6	The big reason : For all its cost-cutting , Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota	In its last fiscal year , Nissan 's profit represented just 2.3 % of sales , compared with 4.3 % at Toyota
2	In its last fiscal year , Nissan 's profit represented just 2.3 % of sales , compared with 4.3 % at Toyota	To help close the gap , Nissan recently established a top-level cost-cutting committee
2	Nissan is the world 's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world 's key economic arenas -- the U.S. , Japan and Europe	That gives it an enviable strategic advantage , at least until its rivals catch up , but also plenty of managerial headaches
8	We are in a transitional phase from being a Japanese company to becoming an international company based in Japan	that Nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all U.S. operations , just as it 's doing in Europe
2	Already , personnel officials are talking about the need for a `` Phase Two '' cultural-reform effort of some sort	We are still only half way through the turnaround of this company , and there are many more things to do

2	Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations , the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders	Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home
2	Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home	that a meeting with the leader of the U.S. could help bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics , whose support he needs
2	For his part , Mr. Bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. Gorbachev 's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in Eastern Europe	A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it
2	that the December meeting , which was announced simultaneously in Moscow , will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers	By doing it in this manner we can have more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances , things of that nature for public consumption
2	As the two sides plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year , they found it useful , I would say even necessary , to hold an interim informal meeting	Although no specific agreements are expected that does n't mean they will be without an agenda
1	The president specifically mentioned U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic	Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade
8	Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade	He recently told a small group of American businessmen in Moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S. , possibly at the 1990 summit
2	that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S. , possibly at the 1990 summit	a trade agreement would give them Most-Favored Nation status , which would lower the tariffs on Soviet exports to the U.S
2	In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- Pravda yesterday reported that three million Soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005	Economists in Moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits
2	Do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation , or arms control , or the environment	Those things will all come up , but in a fairly informal way
8	This is vintage George Bush	This was George Bush 's own idea
8	This was George Bush 's own idea	It 's George Bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly
2	one other issue the Soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions	that , given the meeting 's setting at sea , Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact
8	That theme has been a recurring one for Soviet military officials for much of this year	They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets ' area of greatest strength -- the U.S. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- Washington 's area of greatest superiority
2	One of the reasons Bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering , former President Reagan 's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik , Iceland	That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting American allies
8	it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the December meeting	Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary , who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev 's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe
2	Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary , who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev 's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe	While flying home from those discussions , Mr. Bush drafted a letter to Mr. Gorbachev suggesting an informal get-together to precede their formal summit next year

2	that its board had approved `` after an in-depth discussion , '' a letter to the Bank of Italy outlining measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches	The central bank had ordered BNL to come up with a suitable program by yesterday
2	Maybe he did n't start it , but Mohandas Gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today	The Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India
0	The Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India	Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment
5	His policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment	I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them
2	It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change	Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it
1	Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it	There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it
6	There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it	The case of Rosa Parks , the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus , comes to mind as an illustration
1	The public has a tendency to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience	It is true that both are non-violent , but there is a fundamental difference between them
8	It is true that both are non-violent , but there is a fundamental difference between them	Lawful demonstrations , such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others , are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government.Civil disobedience , violent or non-violent , is intentional law breaking

8	but , before we get on with that , let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations	They are useful to call public attention to grievances , but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute
2	They are useful to call public attention to grievances , but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute	The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns , militant gestures , accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics
2	The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns , militant gestures , accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics	Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews
5	At best , demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative	at worst , they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking
2	Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile	Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing , auto trashing , arson , window breaking , looting , pocket picking and general hooliganism
8	Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania	There are better ways to promote a cause
0	it is difficult to justify	Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass , minor property destruction , blocking traffic and the like
2	Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass , minor property destruction , blocking traffic and the like	these are small prices to pay for galvanizing action for the all-important cause

2	I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country 's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat	Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict
2	Even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their defections , thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists	It is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned
1	It is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned	Worse , it remained to a well-meaning but naive president of the United States to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in Vietnam
1	Under the guise of `` healing the wounds of the nation , '' President Carter pardoned thousands of draft evaders , thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war 's `` immorality	The precedent having been set , who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the U.S. yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over

2	Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law , and no second invitation will be required	This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations
8	This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations	Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause

2	For the paper industry specifically the deal will spur a wave of paper-company takeovers , possibly involving such companies as Union Camp Corp. , Federal Paperboard Co. and Mead Corp	that Georgia-Pacific 's offer , the first hostile bid ever among major players in the paper industry , ends the unwritten taboo on hostile bids , and will push managements to look closely at the industry 's several attractive takeover candidates

8	But such a combination also presents great risks	At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects
2	Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be	Depending on how far down you go , it may be difficult to pay off that debt

0	According to Avery , for the year ended Sept. 30 , 1988 , Uniroyal Chemical had sales of $ 734.2 million and a net loss of $ 47.1 million	that the loss was magnified by accounting adjustments and that the company 's loss was smaller on a cash basis
8	In a related development it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers , Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May , surrendered warrants and preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery 's common shares	On a fully diluted basis , the two raised their stake to 68 % from 51 %
1	In January 1989 , the two men acquired the non-packaging assets of Triangle , including a controlling stake in Avery and , by extension , Uniroyal Chemical	that unless it sold Uniroyal , its ability to service debt would be hurt and Avery 's shareholder value would `` continue to erode

8	Those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs	On Friday , when only a dozen common stocks hit 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange , five were gold-mining issues , and another four were utilities
5	On Friday , when only a dozen common stocks hit 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange , five were gold-mining issues , and another four were utilities	On Monday , when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs , six were utilities or golds
2	At first glance , gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows	After all , gold prices usually soar when inflation is high
2	But the two groups have something very important in common : They are both havens for scared money , stocks for people who hate stocks	It 's as if investors , the past few days , are betting that something is going to go wrong -- even if they do n't know what
2	Still , a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares	The primary overriding thing is that people are frightened
2	that people are frightened	The aftershocks of Oct. 13 ( when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points ) are still reverberating
8	Beyond that , money managers and analysts see other problems	Inventories are creeping up ; car inventories are already high , and big auto makers are idling plants.Takeover fever has cooled , removing a major horse from the market 's cart

2	Britain 's unsettled political scene also worries some investors	The gyrations in the British government '' add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market
8	The gyrations in the British government '' add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market	One of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed up pretty bad
2	Utilities are a classic example	Even in recessions , people continue to use electric power , water and gas at a fairly steady rate
2	Mr. Wachtel points to Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. as examples	They 're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share earnings
5	Gold stocks are n't cheap on this basis , either , with many selling for 20 times earnings or more	Even utility stocks are n't all that inexpensive , at an average of 14 times earnings
2	But the two groups represent a further step in defensiveness	If gold stocks and utilities continue to lead , it may signal that the market is in for rough times
8	That 's just what Joseph Granville expects	We are going to explode lower
2	We are going to explode lower	Anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible
5	Anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible	You do n't want to own anything long except gold stocks
6	One reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows	Last Friday , 96 stocks on the Big Board hit new 12-month lows
2	Robert Stovall , a veteran New York money manager and president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Securities , has money in both gold and utility issues	we could very well have { an economic } slowdown , beginning very soon if not already
8	In such a climate , utility stocks look good to him	He favors FPL Group Inc. , Florida Progress Corp. , TECO Energy Inc. , Wisconsin Energy Corp. , and Dominion Resources Inc
8	The appeal of gold issues is that `` they 're a counter group	You go into them because they move counter to the general market
5	You go into them because they move counter to the general market	that gold stocks had been down so long they were `` ready for a bounce
2	that `` you do n't buy { gold stocks } based on powerful fundamentals	In addition to having high price-earnings ratios , most pay puny dividends , if any
8	In addition to having high price-earnings ratios , most pay puny dividends , if any	The earning power { of gold mining companies } is restricted unless the gold price hops up over $ 425 an ounce
2	it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold	My outlook is for a decline of about 10 % in corporate profits '' in 1990
8	But `` a bunch of utilities '' should post profit increases	Among utilities , Drexel currently favors Entergy Corp. and General Public Utilities Corp
8	It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world 's environmental problems ( `` Is Science , or Private Gain , Driving Ozone Policy ? '' by George Melloan , Business World , Oct. 24 )	To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted
2	To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted	that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure
2	that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure	Even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny-wise and pound-foolish
8	The reason environmentalists `` do n't mind seeing new crises arise '' is because there are new crises	Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago
6	Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago	that the Pomton Lakes Reservoirs in northern New Jersey , which supply the tristate area with drinking water , are riddled with toxic PCBs
8	that the Pomton Lakes Reservoirs in northern New Jersey , which supply the tristate area with drinking water , are riddled with toxic PCBs	This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group 's ploy to create a market
2	Mr. Melloan 's column was right on the money , but I wish it could have gone one step further	As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer , I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory ( named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth 's atmosphere ) and the Montreal Protocol
5	that he knew of no recent changes in the trend	that there are studies by Norwegians , Russians and the Max Planck Institute that show either unchanging or declining UV-B at the surface
1	This , in turn , threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written	My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission , the Environmental Protection Agency , Friends of the Earth , etc . were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited
9	My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission , the Environmental Protection Agency , Friends of the Earth , etc . were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited	When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study , I was urged to get back to the agenda topic , which was , ironically , a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs , the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario
5	But this is almost an underground activity	To my knowledge , no government entities , including the EPA , are pursuing UV-B measurements
5	To my knowledge , no government entities , including the EPA , are pursuing UV-B measurements	The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion `` establishment '' meetings , of which I have attended many
2	that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by CFCs	While recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened , I intend to urge that UV-B be monitored whenever I can
2	Although , like all scientific theories , it had its initial opponents , few experts question the connection now	The discovery of the ozone `` hole '' over Antarctica and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to CFC concentrations
1	In the September issue of Scientific American , Thomas E. Graedel , distinguished member of the technical staff at AT & T Bell Laboratories , and Paul J. Crutzen , director of the air chemistry division of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz , West Germany , wrote , `` It is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons , particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion	Mr. Melloan quotes Peter Teagan and invokes the name of Arthur D. Little Inc. to support his statement
8	However , unlike Messrs.Graedel and Crutzen , who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry , Mr. Teagan has no special expertise in the area	He is a mechanical engineer , not an atmospheric chemist
0	MiniScribe also has n't filed any financial statements for 1989	such statements should be ready by the end of November

0	The company also faces delisting by the National Association of Securities Dealers	The company continues to trade in the over-the-counter market with an exception to listing requirements
5	The company continues to trade in the over-the-counter market with an exception to listing requirements	MiniScribe filed a status report with the NASD on Monday , detailing its efforts to comply with listing requirements and requesting an extension of the exception , but has n't received a response
5	the board still has n't acted on most of the internal report 's recommendations , pending restatement of the balance sheet	that he expects to make a recommendation within a few weeks on whether MiniScribe should file its own lawsuits against former company officers and directors
6	By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise , Wright and Tower , the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution	An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in , say , West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not
5	The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal , sensitive and intimate facts	Traditional standards of relevancy and importance ( `` is this something the public ought to know '' ) will be replaced by a much broader test ( `` is this something the public is interested in knowing
5	The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal , sensitive and intimate facts.Traditional standards of relevancy and importance ( `` is this something the public ought to know '' ) will be replaced by a much broader test ( `` is this something the public is interested in knowing '' ) .And , since the public has always been fascinated by gossip and voyeurism , reporters and editors will strain for creative angles to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships , activities of family members , and all matters about mental and physical health.Similarly , visual images will be more vivid , sensational and , sometimes , gruesome	One consequence of the trend toward tabloid standards of taste will be fierce attacks from politicians who will find sufficient evidence of abuse to arouse an already cynical public to control the press
2	The seemingly mundane action has important implications for banks ' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities	The Fed 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite
2	Over the past two years , the Fed has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms	Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses
9	As many as 50 of his employees at Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ride with him	When they return to their desks at 1 p.m. , they have pedaled 20 miles
2	But today , the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever	One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market Specialized helped create , turning out mountain bikes with such well-known names as Schwinn , Peugeot , Raleigh and Nishiki
8	Thus , Mr. Sinyard 's company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them , by developing new products specifically for mountain biking.At the same time , though , it must become more structured to better manage its growth	Accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a unicycle
1	The big word around Specialized is passion	What I hope to bring to this is another word : process
2	Mr. Eidsmo is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry who were hired to bring the free-wheeling , fast-growing company under tighter control	We had a lot of problems
6	We had a lot of problems	While the company 's sales were soaring , `` We still had a system that was probably appropriate for $ 10 million to $ 20 million in sales
5	While the company 's sales were soaring , `` We still had a system that was probably appropriate for $ 10 million to $ 20 million in sales	What felt good that day was done that day
2	Since his arrival in May , Mr. Eidsmo has put in place techniques learned while working for Citicorp , such as management-by-objective , detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends	We 're finally getting -- and it 's been very painful -- some understanding of what the company 's long-term horizon should begin to look like
2	But it 's risky	You do n't want to lose the magic '' of the company 's creative drive
6	Hoping to stay ahead of the pack , the company is emphasizing innovation	At a recent trade show , convention-goers lined up to view a new Specialized bike frame that weighs just 2.7 pounds -- a pound less than the lightest mountain-bike frame on the market
5	At a recent trade show , convention-goers lined up to view a new Specialized bike frame that weighs just 2.7 pounds -- a pound less than the lightest mountain-bike frame on the market	By replacing the frame 's steel lugs with titanium ones , Mr. Sinyard 's company plans to make its next generation of frames even lighter
9	It currently costs $ 750 , though Mr. Sinyard thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between $ 200 and $ 250	He was able to slash the price of the company 's least expensive mountain bike to $ 279 from $ 750 in
2	But demands on the company 's creativity are certain to grow	Competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain-bike market Mr. Sinyard 's company once had virtually all to itself
8	Competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain-bike market Mr. Sinyard 's company once had virtually all to itself	mountain biking is `` growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this

5	To get a piece of the business , Nike Inc. , Beaverton , Ore. , introduced a line of mountain-bike shoes	About a month ago , Michelin Tire Corp. , Greenville , S.C. , began selling mountain-bike tires , for years a Specialized stronghold
6	Competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too	Trek Bicycle Corp. , which accounts for one-quarter of the $ 400 million in annual sales at its Milwaukee-based parent , Intrepid Corp. , entered the mountain-bike business in 1983
5	A subsidiary of a Taiwanese holding company with world-wide sales of $ 150 million , Giant is one example of the sudden globalization of Mr. Sinyard 's once-cozy market niche	Schwinn Bicycle Co. , Chicago , established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland China and Hungary to sell bikes
5	Schwinn Bicycle Co. , Chicago , established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland China and Hungary to sell bikes	In the past year , Derby International Corp. , Luxembourg , has acquired such major brands as Peugeot , Raleigh and Nishiki
2	In response to the internationalization of the business , Mr. Sinyard 's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries	The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales

8	Managers of junk funds were bolstering their cash hoards after the September cash crunch at Campeau Corp	Junk-portfolio managers raised their cash position to 9.4 % of assets in September from 8.3 % in August
1	Junk-portfolio managers raised their cash position to 9.4 % of assets in September from 8.3 % in August	In September 1988 , that level was 9.5 %
2	Investors in all funds will seek safety in the coming months	Among stock funds , the conservative growth-and-income portfolios probably will remain popular
1	Secretary of State Baker , we read , decided to kill a speech that Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert , was going to give to a student colloquium , the National Collegiate Security Conference	We keep wondering what Mr. Gates wanted to say
4	Perhaps he might have cited Mr. Gorbachev 's need for `` a stable currency , free and competitive markets , private property and real prices '' and other pie-in-the-sky reforms	Perhaps he 'd have called for `` a decentralized political and economic system '' without a dominant communist party
5	If Mr. Gates had been allowed to say these things , we would now be hearing about `` discord '' and `` disarray '' on foreign policy	Dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope Mr. Gorbachev would fail , just as they were when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments
8	In fact , he did	the quotes above are from Mr. Baker 's speech of two weeks ago
8	So far as we can see , there is no disagreement among Mr. Baker , Mr. Quayle , the Mr. Gates we 've read , or for that matter President Bush	They all understand point one : Nothing the U.S. can do will make much difference in whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds with perestroika
1	They all understand point one : Nothing the U.S. can do will make much difference in whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds with perestroika	Perhaps Mr. Gates would emphasize more than Mr. Baker the many hurdles the Soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed
2	that Mr. Gorbachev 's problems result from the failure of his own system	They can be relieved only by changing that system , not by pouring Western money into it
8	They can be relieved only by changing that system , not by pouring Western money into it	GATT membership will not matter to Donbas coal miners short of soap , nor will a START treaty make any difference to Ukrainian nationalists
2	On the other hand , so long as Mr. Gorbachev is easing his grip on his empire , everyone we 've heard agrees that the U.S. can benefit by engaging him	If a deal can be made to cut the world 's Ortegas loose from Moscow , why not
5	If a deal can be made to cut the world 's Ortegas loose from Moscow , why not	We do n't expect much good from nuclear-arms control , but conventional-arms talks might demilitarize Eastern Europe
5	Mr. Baker may want to avoid criticism from Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , but as Secretary of State his audience is the entire Free World , not just Congress	In any case , he 's likely to find that the more he muzzles his colleagues , the more leaks will pop up all around Washington
5	In any case , he 's likely to find that the more he muzzles his colleagues , the more leaks will pop up all around Washington , a lesson once learned by Henry Kissinger	Letting officials express their own nuances can be educational
6	Letting officials express their own nuances can be educational	that in Rome yesterday Defense Secretary Cheney said that European euphoria over Mr. Gorbachev is starting to be tempered by a recognition of `` the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with
1	It is in the Western interest to see Mr. Gorbachev succeed	The odds are against him , as he himself would no doubt tell you
2	Even if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret , these are not very complicated thoughts	Surely there is someone in the administration , maybe Bob Gates , who could explain them to college students , or even schoolchildren

Jordan was elected to the board of this transportation services concern	Mr. Jordan has served as executive director of the United Negro College Fund , director of the Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council and attorney-consultant to the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity
9	Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant , ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads	The killers fled with less than $ 100
2	Sen. Strom Thurmond ( R. , S.C. ) recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty	The ultimate punishment will protect the law-abiding from the vicious , cruel individuals who commit these crimes
2	The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings	Most murders are state crimes
8	Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking	Senate Republicans , after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation , have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee
5	Senate Republicans have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee	The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year
2	For one thing , it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences , let alone be executed	Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare
5	In fact , only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years , according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee 's Democratic staff	The last federal execution before the Supreme Court 's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963 , meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years
8	In that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud	It 's distracting attention from serious issues
1	but that is n't the point	that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes
8	this bill has made race a major part of the death-penalty debate	Before the bill left committee , Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass . ) attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner . The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond , who complained that it would `` kill '' capital punishment
5	The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond , who complained that it would `` kill '' capital punishment	A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion
6	And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings , in two important ways	It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past
2	That burden is very difficult , if not impossible , to meet	How do you prove a negative
2	How do you prove a negative	Since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing , executions everywhere might come to a halt
0	At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks , and against black defendants compared with white defendants	Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence
2	The Kennedy amendment would , in effect , legislate around the Supreme Court ruling	Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals
6	But if it survives , it could prompt other statutory changes	It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance
5	Robert Kornreich , an attorney for the Telerate holders , told Judge Hartnett the Dow Jones offer is `` arrogant '' and `` hostile	He accused Dow Jones of `` using unfair means to obtain the stock at an unfair price

6	Nothing was going to hold up the long-delayed settlement of Britton vs.Thomasini	Not even an earthquake
5	The walls shook	the building rocked
2	the building rocked	For a while , it looked like the deal -- not to mention the courtroom itself -- was on the verge of collapse
9	The judge came out and said , ` Quick , let 's put this on the record	I said , ` NOW ?
5	A 10-gallon water cooler had toppled onto the floor , soaking the red carpeting	Lights flickered on and off
5	Lights flickered on and off	plaster dropped from the ceiling
10	Lights flickered on and off ; plaster dropped from the ceiling , the walls still shook and an evacuation alarm blared outside	The four lawyers climbed out from under a table
2	And the lawyers were just as eager as the judge to wrap it up	We were never going to get these insurance companies to agree again
0	Indeed , the insurance adjusters had already bolted out of the courtroom	The lawyers went to work anyway , duly noting that the proceeding was taking place during a major earthquake
6	The insurance adjusters think differently	I did n't know if it was World War III or what , '' says Melanie Carvain of Morristown , N.J
2	I did n't know if it was World War III or what	Reading the settlement into the record was the last thing on my mind
8	Elaborating on the concern about doctors ' sacrificing earnings in order to spend `` talk time '' with patients , we are finding the quality of the time spent is the key to true rapport	Even brief conversations can show caring and trust , and need not restrict the efficiency of the communication or restrain the doctor 's earnings
2	The issue is far-reaching	Right now , the American populace is spending about 12 % of our gross national product on health care
6	with foreign auto makers beginning car and truck production in the U.S	With companies such as Honda Motor Co. , Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. running so-called transplant auto operations , Japanese auto production in the U.S. will reach one million vehicles this year
8	Unless the market goes to 19 million units we have the inescapable fact that the transplants are adding capacity	The Japanese-managed plants eventually will have the capacity to build some 2.5 million vehicles in the U.S
5	Revco reacted cautiously , saying the plan would add $ 260 million of new debt to the highly leveraged company	It was Revco 's huge debt from its $ 1.3 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code

8	The Revco bonds are high-yield , high-risk `` junk '' bonds	holders have $ 750 million in claims against Revco
1	the nation 's second-largest drugstore chain was a valuable company , despite its financial woes	Its problem is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red
8	and demographics are helping pharmacies	The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs
5	Last week , Revco 's parent company , Anac Holding Corp. , said the company reported a loss of $ 16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter , compared with a loss of $ 27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter	Sales were $ 597.8 million , up 2.4 % from the previous year
5	The offer consists of $ 410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes	Acadia would sell up to 10 % of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution , but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares
8	Revco was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal	They want to pretend it does n't exist
8	It 's certainly a responsible offer	It 's not an effort to steal the company '' in the middle of the night
4	Copper futures prices failed to extend Friday 's rally	Declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down
8	Also , the premiums paid by the U.S. government on a purchase of copper for the U.S. Mint were lower than expected , and acted as a price depressant	The mint purchases were at premiums about 4 1/2 cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper.At the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound
1	The mint purchases were at premiums about 4 1/2 cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper	At the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound
5	All this has led to prolonged selling in futures , mostly on the part of computer-guided funds	Prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas , which added to the selling
2	The reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply	that as production improves , the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies
0	Japan normally depends heavily on the Highland Valley and Cananea mines as well as the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea	Recently , Japan has been buying copper elsewhere
5	But as Highland Valley and Cananea begin operating , they are expected to resume their roles as Japan 's suppliers	According to Fred Demler , metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , New York , `` Highland Valley has already started operating and Cananea is expected to do so soon
5	It has n't been operating since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners	A recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks
5	According to Drexel 's Mr. Demler , the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly , which may be one reason why the situation did n't affect prices much	that , if there was any concern , it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in Chile
1	that stocks of copper in U.S. producers ' hands at the end of September were down 16,000 metric tons from August to 30,000 tons	Outside the U.S. producer stocks at the end of August were 273,000 tons , down 3,000 tons from the end of July
1	and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the U.S. at the end of July stood at 123,000 tons , down from 125,000 tons in June	The high point of foreigners ' copper stocks this year was 136,000 tons at the end of April , according to Mr. Demler
5	The prices of most corn , soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the Midwest continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the 1988 drought	Buying by the Soviets has helped to prop up corn prices in recent weeks , but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums
8	Futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved	The December contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents a pound at 74.35 cents
8	that Brazil and Colombia had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement	Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags
1	The reports said Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags	These reports were later denied by a high Brazilian official

4	Last week 's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli	There was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance
8	When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers ' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later , some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy	Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed
6	For example , while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state , strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market	Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet ( council
0	Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet ( council	Permission is far from automatic
2	Permission is far from automatic	The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers
1	Private dressmaking , for example , is allowed in 10 Soviet republics but banned by five	shoemaking is allowed in seven but illegal in nine
5	All independent media activity is now illegal , which perhaps is not surprising , but so is the manufacture of perfume , cosmetics , household chemicals and sand candles	Medical cooperatives , among the most successful in the U.S.S.R. , are banned from providing general-practitioner services ( their main source of income ) , carrying out surgery , and treating cancer patients , drug addicts and pregnant women
5	The first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold	the second bans cooperatives from buying `` industrial and food goods '' from the state or other cooperatives
2	Along with some other revealing indicators , these developments suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls , he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought	Mr. Gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods
8	Mr. Gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods	He told the Congress of People 's Deputies on May 30 : `` We do not share this approach , since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country
5	that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter	Most important , this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed
8	The emergence of Russian corporatism had been anticipated in journalist George Urban 's introduction to a series of colloquies -- `` Can the Soviet System Survive Reform ? '' -- published this spring	Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless Russo -- corporation-socialist in form , nationalistic in content and Oriental in style -- that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness
8	The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an `` organic '' society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified , and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation	This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and `` harmonic '' society
5	This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and `` harmonic '' society	The key to the creation of the `` organic '' state lay in the formation of `` natural '' groups that would undertake the role of decision-making
2	The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress	In doing so , he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market
2	Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini	The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it
2	At the same time , he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed	It is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor
2	At the same time , the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine Western-style political pluralism	The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev 's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism
8	The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev 's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism	An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R. , particularly the Democratic Union , allege that they show `` terroristic tendencies
2	An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R. , particularly the Democratic Union , allege that they show `` terroristic tendencies '' and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims	It is possible that , in perpetuating such myths , the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism
2	Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task , however , as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor , capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo	If he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system , he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition , and to re-establish control in Eastern Europe
2	The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations but in its economic prescription	Contrary to widespread belief , Mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time
5	Contrary to widespread belief , Mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time	it is doubtful whether Soviet-style corporatism will make Soviet trains run on time , or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately crave

9	The sweep by the A 's , whose pitchers and home-run hitters dominated the injury-prone Giants , will only make things worse for ABC , owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc	The network had been expected to have losses of as much as $ 20 million on baseball this year
2	It is n't clear how much those losses may widen because of the short Series	Had the contest gone a full seven games , ABC could have reaped an extra $ 10 million in ad sales on the seventh game alone , compared with the ad take it would have received for regular prime-time shows
8	ABC , in anticipation of a four-game sweep , limited its losses by jacking up the number of commercials it aired in the third and fourth games	A World Series telecast typically carries 56 30-second commercials , but by the fourth game ABC was cramming in 60 to 62 ads to generate extra revenue

2	From a reading of the somewhat scant English-language medical literature on RU-486 , the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around	This is not only because it kills the unborn , a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient , zapping only 50 % to 85 % of them depending on which study you read ( prostaglandin , taken in conjunction with the pill , boosts the rate to 95 % ) .By contrast , surgical abortion is 99 % effective . Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.It is time-consuming ( the abortion part alone lasts three days , and the clinical part comprises a week 's worth of visits ) , bloody ( one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion , although for most it resembles a menstrual period , with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days ) , and painful ( many women require analgesic shots to ease them through ) .Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects . Timing is of the essence with RU-486.It is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy , when it is markedly less effective.That is typically about a three-week window . So far , all the studies have concluded that RU-486 is `` safe . '' But `` safe , '' in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project , means `` there 's been no evidence so far of mortality . '' No one has researched the long-term effects of RU-486 on a woman 's health or fertility . The drug seems to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken.Some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again : The studies have reported repeaters in their programs.But there are no scientific data on this question . Rather ominously , rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects , Lancet , the British medical journal , reported in 1987.However , Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu , the French physician who invented RU-486 , wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys.The drug has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES , the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it

8	Over time , through benchmark surveys , the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered	The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. ( net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad ) , some exports by professional firms ( a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine ) , and improved data from travel and tourism

1	A few months later , under pressure from the United Steelworkers of America , LTV instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans	Because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans , LTV would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans
2	The agency also concluded that LTV 's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization	In September 1987 , it ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans
8	In May , a federal appeals court in New York agreed that the agency acted unlawfully	The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans

1	That is for the future	Already , scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that , for the first time , can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer

1	Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level	Today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state
2	Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes	When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check
8	that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves	the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged
8	In recent months , researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert	An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged
2	so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired	A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom one copy is damaged early in life , is especially prone to cancer
2	The Dedham , Mass. , couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50 % chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma	he carried a damaged gene , having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old
2	that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and , therefore , faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer	It made our New Year
5	This test was the first to predict reliably whether an individual could expect to develop cancer	Equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth , made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja , has opened a field of cancer study , which in recent months has exploded
8	Equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth , made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja , has opened a field of cancer study , which in recent months has exploded	It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer
5	It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer	this basic research will begin showing results there soon
9	To date , scientists have fingered two of these cancer-suppressors	Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986
2	the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix	that if people inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families
5	The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects	He theorized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other
9	that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other	The tumor developed when the second , normal copy also was damaged
8	Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No . 13 from a parent who had had the disease	Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing
2	Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing	He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer
10	Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer	The team used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell
2	The finding riveted medicine	It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer
2	It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer	It was extraordinarily satisfying
2	It was extraordinarily satisfying	I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers
9	But in Baltimore , Dr. Vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School , believed Dr. Knudson was right , and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers	His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm 's tumor
2	Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer	He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages
8	He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages	It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages
0	They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells	Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged
8	Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged	If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out , benign polyps would develop
5	If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out , benign polyps would develop	If both copies of a second gene were then deleted , the polyps would progress to malignancy
2	If both copies of a second gene were then deleted , the polyps would progress to malignancy	It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop
2	Their report galvanized other molecular biologists	It was the confirming evidence we all needed that { gene } losses were critical to the development of a common tumor
9	But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy	They focused on chromosome 17
2	They focused on chromosome 17	For months the Johns Hopkins researchers , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 , looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells
2	For months the Johns Hopkins researchers , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 , looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells	Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene
5	that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher , Arnold Levine , had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones	The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53
6	Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too	Researchers in Edinburgh , Scotland , have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies
2	Researchers in Edinburgh , Scotland , have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies	that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families , the gene , when inherited in a damaged form , may predispose women to the cancer
8	The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer	that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene
8	At the same time , the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes	Dr. Vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involved in colon cancer
7	Dr. Vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involved in colon cancer	Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer , a researcher in Great Britain , are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer , thought to be on chromosome 5
1	Where these discoveries will lead , scientists can only speculate	Already two major pharmaceutical companies , the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies
8	new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes	The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes
5	The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes	It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far

8	Two Minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making `` various untrue statements	These federal-court suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that Easy Eggs were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of Michael 's production capacity
5	that by year end it wo n't be using any shell eggs	The Miami fast-food chain , owned by Grand Metropolitan of Britain , expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually
2	Still , caution is advisable	Michael 's break-even volume on Easy Eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product

2	But some time ago , researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood	Cincinnati-based P & G took an interest
2	Cincinnati-based P & G took an interest	it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol
5	One of the studies , done at the University of Minnesota , tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels	After 16 weeks , the group that took three daily teaspoons of Metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels , and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins , the so-called bad cholesterol

5	The flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals	that Americans might someday , in various forms , ingest too much psyllium
8	Currently , there is a lull in the psyllium war	The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe
5	But the agency has n't yanked psyllium off store shelves	If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium , other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products
5	It 's going to be a sensational thing , '' says Mr. Krishnamurthy of P & G in Bombay	Says psyllium exporter Mr. Patel : `` I just got back yesterday from the U.S.In the newspapers , on the radio and TV , psyllium is everywhere
6	But the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers	They only know of one use for the crop , as a laxative , and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop , they think of the seed as a marginal crop , something to grow between summer wheat crops
2	Psyllium 's not a good crop	You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined
2	Even at the Basic Chemicals , Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Export Promotion Council , the government agency that promotes the seed , the psyllium boom is distant thunder	The staff brags about psyllium 's hefty contribution to American regularity , without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol
2	without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol	The council 's annual report has psyllium on its last page , lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and `` Nux vomica , '' a plant that induces vomiting
2	In one way , the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves	They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year
8	But there 's a catch	Sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities
8	This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop	Psyllium needs sandy soil , dew during the first few weeks , and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing

2	One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 %	Small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness

1	China 's leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 Hong Kong	That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation 's democracy movement
1	Outflows of people and capital from Hong Kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s	that , given its robust economy , Hong Kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows
1	A widely held assumption all along has been that , given its robust economy , Hong Kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows	With interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since June 4 , that assumption no longer seems so safe
8	Investment and emigration plans take time to come to fruition	Only four months have passed since the Beijing massacre , and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact
2	The only consensus is that more money and people may leave Hong Kong than had been thought likely	This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy 's prospects

5	Though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility , most Wall Street firms remain open to handle program trading for customers	Trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds , which dwarf Wall Street firms in terms of the size of their program trades , will continue to launch big programs through the stock market
8	and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits	They will do it every chance they get

2	We have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating artificial volatility	There is no question that investor confidence ( in the stock market ) is critical
8	Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security	Current rules permit investors to put up less cash for futures than for stocks

5	Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants , Akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders ( $ 1.88 billion ) on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance	During the same period , the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets
2	The fibers business now accounts for only 20 % of Akzo 's sales	We have definitely become less cyclical
2	Still , Akzo has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal : a large presence in the U.S. market for prescription drugs	prices for U.S. pharmaceutical companies remain too high , making it unlikely that Akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area
3	Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit	Akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year

2	We 're sorry to see Nigel Lawson 's departure from the British government	He is a politician with the courage of true conviction , as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40 %
6	The early omens scarcely suggest so wholesome an outcome	The Fleet Street reaction was captured in the Guardian headline , `` Departure Reveals Thatcher Poison
2	British politicians divide into two groups of chickens , those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling	So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher
8	The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates , conservative , free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps	There are the strict monetarists , who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates
5	There are the strict monetarists , who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates	There are the supply-side globalists , who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates
3	In the British case , Mr. Lawson is the closest thing in London to a supply-side globalist	He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in Britain , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the European Monetary System
2	In the British case , Mr. Lawson is the closest thing in London to a supply-side globalist	He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in Britain , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the European Monetary System
1	He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in Britain , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the European Monetary System	While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else , Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist , inclined to defend floating rates to the death
8	that Mr. Lawson 's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling	They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden capital inflows
3	At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir Alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound	To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a policy Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous
2	But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector , laying the seeds of protectionism	Mr. Lawson , though not allowed to join the EMS , chose to `` shadow '' the deutsche mark
2	Mr. Lawson , though not allowed to join the EMS , chose to `` shadow '' the deutsche mark	He reaped inflation along with rapid growth , no doubt validating Sir Alan 's predictions in the Prime Minister 's mind
5	So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of Albion	We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson 's resignation , and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy , John Major
8	We should also add Mr. Lawson 's own explanation , as we understand it	Unlike the U.S. , Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages
5	Unlike the U.S. , Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages	The wage stickiness , which OECD studies confirm is particularly high in Britain , gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation
5	Unlike the U.S. , Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages.The wage stickiness , which OECD studies confirm is particularly high in Britain , gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation	Inflation is easier to spark and harder to control
5	Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates , though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one	that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise
2	that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise	Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity
4	In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial , for example , and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate	For that matter , perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency
8	For that matter , perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency	We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher 's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany
5	We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher 's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany	Perhaps the shock would have been less if they 'd fixed to another low-tax , deregulated , supply-side economy
2	that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus	that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation
4	In particular , `` shadowing '' a currency is anything but fixing	it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility
2	All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy	Better to have a true monetarist policy , just for the experience
2	What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remains to be seen	They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy , that is to say , stagflation
1	They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy , that is to say , stagflation	This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn
2	This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn	reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation
2	This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn ; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation	Our advice is this : Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts , and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money
4	This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn ; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation	Our advice is this : Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts , and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money
4	This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn ; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation	Our advice is this : Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts , and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money
2	Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts , and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money	This was the version of supply-side economics that , in the late 1970s and early '80s , worked in America and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts Britain today
2	he hopes to improve client service	Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients , of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed , must -- follow

6	Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task	He is n't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman
5	He is n't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman	Under his watch , office politicking was often rampant in the agency 's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year
2	The one thing Mr. Phillips clearly does have going for him is continuity , although it is n't certain if that will be enough	The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top . . . and Graham is obviously a long-term member of the Ogilvy Mafia , as we call it
8	that the company 's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious , oversized new New York headquarters	The move , budgeted at about $ 7 million , actually came in at about $ 10 million

8	The net loss for the quarter was $ 43.1 million against a year-earlier loss of $ 106 million	The loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc. , as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations
5	For the year , sales were up 5.6 % to $ 6.97 billion compared with $ 6.61 billion in fiscal 1988	Sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of I. Magnin , Bullock 's , and Bullocks Wilshire
1	The $ 833.6 million figures includes the new acquisitions	Excluding those businesses , earnings before interest , taxes and depreciation for 1988 would have been $ 728.5 million
8	The company estimates its total debt at about $ 5.2 billion	This includes $ 4.6 billion of long-term debt , $ 457.5 million in short-term debt , and $ 95.7 million of the current portion of long-term debt
2	that he expects the company to `` benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors	While our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes , we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want

5	The sale , which had been expected , is part of KKR 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February	Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit
8	Louis Gerstner Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR , called the sale a `` significant step '' in the company 's divestiture program , as well as a `` a strategic divestiture	Since KKR bought RJR in February for $ 25 billion of debt , it has agreed to sell nearly $ 5 billion of RJR assets

1	Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S. , but RJR 's overall share of the roughly $ 5.1 billion market is less than 5 %	Nestle 's share of 7 % before Friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc. , which have about 40 % and 36 % of the market , respectively

6	The result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening	Six months ago , government approval for an ANC rally was inconceivable
8	Equally inconceivable is that the ANC , given the chance to hold a rally , would extend a hand , albeit warily , to the government	In a message read out at the rally , exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo , who ca n't legally be quoted in South Africa , said the country was at a crossroads and that Mr. de Klerk `` may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country '' if he chooses a `` path of genuine political settlement

2	Westinghouse 's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner	The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade
5	The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade	Already this year , it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp. , among others
2	Westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing	In the past , the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals
8	its venture with Mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition , particularly in the U.S. , from such European competitors as Asea Brown Boveri AG , Siemens AG , and British General Electric Co	Under the agreement , Westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner , and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment
8	The Westinghouse-Mitsubishi venture was designed as a non-equity transaction , circumventing any possible antitrust concerns	Westinghouse carefully crafted the agreement
8	that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which , unlike utilities , are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new plants	Westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years
2	Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared	The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade

2	A quake that measures two on the Richter is n't twice as severe as a `` one '' -- it 's 10 times worse.A `` three '' is 10 times 10 again , and so on	That put the `` seven '' of Oct. 17 in perspective for me
2	That put the `` seven '' of Oct. 17 in perspective for me	Think I 'll buy one of those `` I Survived '' T-shirts after all
8	By Richterian standards , the show that the Oakland Athletics put on Friday and Saturday nights , in putting a mercifully swift end to the game 's Longest Short Series , rated somewhere between a 10 and an 11	but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs
8	The joke here is that the Giants lost by de fault	That 's geologically correct , but a trifle unfair otherwise
2	but a trifle unfair otherwise	They showed up , but did n't -- or could n't -- challenge
5	I went out to Todd { Burns , the A 's reliever } and told him that we were n't gon na let this guy beat us	I told him to make Mitchell reach for everything
8	I told him to make Mitchell reach for everything , and that 's what we did	The ball he hit was n't a strike
5	The ball he hit was n't a strike	If it had been , he mighta hit it out
5	But if the A 's had n't won in four , they would have prevailed in five , or six , or seven	The best team won this Series
2	The best team won this Series , which is more unusual than it may sound	Baseball ai n't football , where the good teams beat up on the bad ones
5	Baseball ai n't football , where the good teams beat up on the bad ones	The best baseball teams win six of 10 games and the worst win four of 10
2	The best baseball teams win six of 10 games and the worst win four of 10	that several recent champions of the world according to us ( as in U.S. ) might not have ranked No . 1 in many polls
6	that several recent champions of the world according to us ( as in U.S. ) might not have ranked No . 1 in many polls	That list includes last season 's champs , the Los Angeles Dodgers , who rode a miracle home run by Kirk Gibson and two faultless pitching performances by Orel Hershiser to a five-game triumph over a bewitched , bothered Oakland crew
2	These A 's , however , got few grades as low as B on their 1989 report card	They led the Major Leagues in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one for the American League pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals
5	They led the Major Leagues in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one for the American League pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals	The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from Giants ' manager Roger Craig after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old Series record
8	The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from Giants ' manager Roger Craig after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old Series record	that he might play his outfielders deeper , `` maybe on the other side of the fence
6	The A 's offensive showing in the Series got an A , as in awesome	Their 85 total bases broke a record for a four-game set
5	Their 85 total bases broke a record for a four-game set , and their nine home runs tied one	Eight Oakland players hit homers , with centerfielder Dave Henderson getting two , both on Friday
5	Their 85 total bases broke a record for a four-game set , and their nine home runs tied one.Eight Oakland players hit homers , with centerfielder Dave Henderson getting two , both on Friday	Rickey Henderson , the do-everything leadoff man , had nine hits and set or tied four-game Series marks for triples ( 2 ) and stolen bases ( 3 )
2	The sole A not to homer was cleanup hitter Mark McGwire , their regular-season leader with 33 , and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in Game Three that stopped a Giant rally while the issue still was in doubt	Think I 'll redo my image -- get this changed to a glove
2	Even with that power show , though , the Oakland Series ' star , certified by the Most Valuable Player award , was a pitcher , Dave Stewart	He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One , and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake
5	One was that , despite his 62 regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News , he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due	The other is that he 's an Oakland native , and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to quake-hit areas last week
8	he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy	Give me four or five more Series with these guys , and I do n't care if I ever win a Cy Young
2	that Sandy Alderson , the team 's general manager , felt obliged to dampen it	People change , teams change , '' he cautioned
5	People change , teams change	It 's easier to get worse than better in this game
10	The last Series sweep , by the Cincinnati Reds , came in 1976 , which also was the first year of baseball player free agency	It was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous , `` big market '' teams to monopolize the best talent
5	Twelve different clubs have won titles in the 14 seasons since its advent	The number includes such unstylish burgs as , well , Oakland
4	But in the real world , you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off	Speed is a component of quality -- one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers
2	Companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations	Managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed , and shift some responsibility for analyzing , improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees
8	One team at the Federal Express Ground Operations station in Natick , Mass. , focused on a particularly time-sensitive operation : the morning package sort	Every morning , tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the Natick Ground Station from Boston 's Logan Airport , carrying the day 's package load.In peak periods that load may include 4,000 pieces.The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery , so couriers can be on the road by 8:35

2	The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery , so couriers can be on the road by 8:35	No customer is present at the morning package sort , but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction
2	We 're committed to deliver the customer 's package by a stated time , usually 10:30	The sooner our vans hit the road each morning , the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation
9	until we completed our data gathering	We used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good

9	to identify those couriers and subgroups that were doing the most to reduce package-sort cycle time	Winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner out with their spouses
6	Monitoring shows that the Natick team 's new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort	The vans leave at least 15 minutes earlier , on average , than they used to
2	each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal , submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule	We cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly , because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team
5	The team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals	The team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate
8	that managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage	Managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction
2	Managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction	They effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time

5	Under current copyright laws , it is considered `` fair use '' to reproduce copyrighted material for one 's personal use or for use by one 's family or friends , while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited	that most people consider home copying for such personal use a `` right '' -- a right , moreover , that was exercised by 40 % of Americans over the age of 10 in the past year
4	Switzerland 's most famous raider says he is n't one	Werner K. Rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly
8	And in little more than a decade of being friendly the 46-year-old Mr. Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire	He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies
9	This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs	Mr. Rey bought a controlling stake in Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982 , building up the little-known engineering company with European and U.S. acquisitions

9	Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in London he learned that a large packet of Bally 's shares was up for sale	Looking into Bally , he could hardly believe what he saw : a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs ; it had 7,000 employees
5	Looking into Bally , he could hardly believe what he saw : a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs	it had 7,000 employees
2	But such tactics were alien to Switzerland in 1976	Eventually , Mr. Rey was forced to sell his Bally shares to the weapons maker Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the Swiss old boys ' network
5	Mr. Rey made 50 million Swiss francs on the sale	Bally was not an unfriendly takeover

10	In 1979 , his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the Swiss metals works Selve , based in Thun	With the nonferrous metals business undermined in Switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs , this looked like a dull undertaking
2	But Mr. Rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country 's major producers	the increased efficiency has perked up the industry

9	A major boost to Mr. Rey 's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60 % of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks	They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad
9	They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad	In 1987 , Mr. Rey bested leading publishing houses to take over Switzerland 's Jean Frey AG , a major producer of magazines and newspapers
2	And with the recent acquisition of 30 % of Winterthur-based machinery manufacturer Gebrueder Sulzer AG , Mr. Rey has enjoyed the status of white knight	Sulzer preferred him to financier Tito Tettamanti , whose secretive raid on the company 's stock had led to a bitter battle

2	In August , Omni unexpectedly bought Inspectorate 's 80 % stake in Harpener AG of West Germany , a land-rich company	it makes sense for Inspectorate-Adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help

2	The U.S. had been under pressure from several Cocom members , especially France , West Germany and Italy , to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools , which those countries argued were now widely available to East Bloc countries from non-Cocom members	For several years some European countries have complained that outdated Cocom lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security

2	If a TV weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast , Donald H. Straszheim surely understands	The chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the Midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction
2	and he 's right	Since the last time he traveled this way several months ago , he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession
8	in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988 , Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds	It said long-term interest rates , then above 9 % , could drop to 7 % by the end of 1989 , so bonds , which benefit from falling rates , would be a good buy
8	But this September he took a detour if not a U-turn	He softened the talk about a recession
8	Two well-known colleagues who believe Mr. Straszheim was right the first time are David Bostian Jr. and A. Gary Shilling , both of whom run their own New York research firms	Mr. Bostian said in August that his macroeconomic index signaled recession
5	Mr. Bostian said in August that his macroeconomic index signaled recession	Mr. Shilling , who was Merrill Lynch 's chief economist from 1967 to 1971 , has heralded a recession for months
2	Mr. Shilling , who was Merrill Lynch 's chief economist from 1967 to 1971 , has heralded a recession for months	My own personal opinion is that Don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet
1	that `` it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time	That 's the forecasting business
2	However risky the business , it 's brisk these days	Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator
4	This is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities	This is the commercial version

8	In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital Management in Minneapolis , in contrast , the firm 's money managers seem ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall	Alfred Harrison , the manager , shoves Mr. Straszheim 's handout back at him
5	It 's all in this handout you do n't want to look at	We could still have a recession '' at some point
8	that the new outlook , though still weak , does n't justify calling a recession right now . `` It 's all in this handout you do n't want to look at.We could still have a recession '' at some point	One of Mr. Straszheim 's recurring themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white

5	The opposition Labor Party leader , Neil Kinnock , in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class , denounced Mrs. Thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet	The British press , making a mountain out of a molehill , precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government
8	Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute	Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark.Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy
1	Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark	Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy
2	Until his resignation , Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark	When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40 % , Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark
2	With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark	To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 %
5	To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 %	This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls
2	This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind	The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls
8	The reason is simple	When a country cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency
8	It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates	Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship
2	The price of attracting capital -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit	To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise
0	To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise	This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit
2	Consequently , Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit , renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row	Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. Lawson in office
2	It is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound	The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40 % , the flow abroad of British capital slowed , to 50 billion pounds ( $ 79 billion at the current rate ) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency

8	the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s	The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment , instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates
2	The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment , instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates	This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle
8	First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction.Then , when the currency falls , interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate	This policy is totally mindless

1	Well , the arrogant East Coast media have spoken again ( `` Going for the Green , '' editorial , Oct. 17 )	Having resided in the great state of California for the past seven years , I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air ; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil ; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing
1	suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are `` whacky '' and referring to so many citizens as `` la-la activists	Strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the East Coast activists who seek to clean up Boston Harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste
1	While there are no easy low-cost solutions , simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state , the nation and the world	If nothing else , such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action

9	In the opener , Sony Corp. would agree to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in a transaction valued at close to $ 5 billion	Shortly after that , Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million and offer its co-chairmen , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , the chance to run Columbia
9	Shortly after that , Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million and offer its co-chairmen , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , the chance to run Columbia	Mr. Peters would fly to New York with the intention of telling Warner Communications Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross that Guber-Peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for Warner
2	That 's where the two scripts would diverge	In affidavits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in connection with the $ 1 billion breach-of-contract suit Warner brought against Sony for hiring the two producers , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story.Warner tells another
1	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story	Warner tells another
5	he was `` shocked '' when Mr. Ross refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them	he reminded Mr. Ross that Robert Daly and Terry Semel , the top executives of the Warner Brothers studio , had `` repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept '' an offer such as Sony 's
5	Tell them that they do n't have a job	You can take them with you
2	Warner denies Mr. Ross ever said any such thing , and , in fact , denies virtually everything Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits	Tomorrow , Warner will file another batch of documents contending that `` the essence of everything these guys are saying is basically lies
9	Tomorrow , Warner will file another batch of documents contending that `` the essence of everything these guys are saying is basically lies	Thursday , a judge is scheduled to rule on Warner 's motion seeking to block the Guber-Peters duo from going to Columbia
5	The matter may never even be tried in court	Warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations , but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired
1	but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired	it is willing to settle the matter out of court
5	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do n't have much to gain from a protracted battle	Sony , for its part , could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high , choosing instead to find someone else to run Columbia
6	but other murkier issues will play a big role	Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner 's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up
1	Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner 's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up	Warner denies such an agreement was made , and disputes the Guber-Peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter
6	Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides ' current business dealings	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at Warner , notably the Sylvester Stallone film `` Tango and Cash
5	Mr. Peters says in his affidavit that the movie 's staff was told last week that Warner was `` taking over '' the picture , and another producer would be giving all of the orders	Over his objections , Mr. Peters says , the film 's release date was moved up `` by many months '' to December , and plans for a soundtrack `` worth millions of dollars '' were dropped
8	Hubert de la Bouillaire , an editor on the film , backs Mr. Peters in a separate sworn declaration	Mr. de la Bouillaire says Warner Brothers production president Mark Canton called him Oct. 19 and said Mr. Peters is `` off the picture
5	Mr. Peters is `` off the picture	If he calls you up , just tell him everything is fine
2	to screen the picture without telling stars Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell or Mr. Peters	The less they know , the easier it is for us

5	he brought to lunch a release document Warner had agreed to in 1988 , when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid to buy part of MGM/UA Entertainment Co. to run the MGM studio	he had crossed out `` MGM '' with a red pen and written in `` Columbia , '' giving the document to Mr. Semel
5	he had crossed out `` MGM '' with a red pen and written in `` Columbia , '' giving the document to Mr. Semel	Mr.Semel said absolutely nothing to indicate Warner would have any objection to our assuming management positions at Columbia
4	Mr. Semel , in his affidavit , does n't mention any hugging or congratulating	He says he told Mr. Guber he could n't sign any documents and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters , would have a very negative impact on Warner
9	he told Mr. Guber he could n't sign any documents and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters , would have a very negative impact on Warner	he would contact Mr. Ross and Warner Brothers Chairman Robert Daly
2	But Sony is a problem	Warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge Japanese company controlling important segments of the U.S. entertainment business
8	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters took encouragement from Warner studio executives such as Mr. Semel and Mr. Canton too literally	According to this theory , Warner executives , hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers , encouraged Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company
2	the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract	They are like a mini-studio ; they have 50 projects in development for Warner
6	Even White House budget director Richard Darman had trouble finding a silver lining in the report	I suppose you could say the good news is that the deficits are not heading up , '' he said , `` but you ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we 're not
1	The 1989 deficit would have been nearly $ 10 billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as Congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on Sept. 30	Because the Resolution Trust Corp. could n't spend the money fast enough , the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal 1990
1	The law sets a deficit target of $ 100 billion for fiscal 1990	A partisan fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt , triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law
5	The White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year	Neither side showed any sign of retreating
1	In all , federal outlays amounted to $ 1.143 trillion in 1989 , up 7.5 % from the previous year	Federal revenues rose 9 % to $ 990.79 billion
6	a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year did n't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared	The Treasury marked up its forecast by $ 17 million in July , but that proved to be about $ 5 billion too optimistic
8	Outlays for the month totaled $ 105.39 billion , up from $ 87.57 billion a year earlier	The increase reflects spending on the S & L rescue as well as payroll and Social Security checks normally issued in October that were issued in September this year because Oct. 1 fell on a Sunday
0	Consumers Power Co. , now the main unit of CMS Energy , ran into financial problems over its $ 4.2 billion Midland nuclear plant	CMS is nearly done converting the Midland plant to a gas-fired cogeneration facility at a cost of $ 600 million

2	Sansui is a special case	It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen
8	But analysts say Sansui is a special case.It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen	If you find sound , healthy companies in Japan , they are not for sale
2	Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases	If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies were n't deterrents enough , webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers
0	that this was not the company 's finest hour	Sansui was once one of Japan 's premier makers of expensive , high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles
1	Some of Sansui 's fellow audio-specialty companies , such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp. , responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own , by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields , including laser disks or portable cassette players	Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses
2	As the yen soared in recent years , Sansui 's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle	While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories , Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia
2	Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia	Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with '' changes in the marketplace
2	his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future	Attitudes { toward being acquired } are still negative , but they 're becoming more positive
2	Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around	Sansui is a perfect fit for Polly Peck 's electronics operations , which make televisions , videocassette recorders , microwaves and other products on an `` original equipment maker '' basis for sale under other companies ' brand names
6	Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir , who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman	He took Polly Peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980
9	He took Polly Peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980	In September , it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.

5	forcing huge debt on the proposed new company	The debt , estimated at $ 4.7 billion , could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term
2	That money also would have to be borrowed	In effect , McCaw has forced LIN 's hand by bidding $ 1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month
2	We 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to	that the company would n't be profitable until 1994 or later
1	Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $ 115 to $ 125 a share	They value McCaw 's bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a share
1	They value McCaw 's bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a share	The previous BellSouth pact was valued at about $ 98 to $ 110 a share
1	McCaw , the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S. , already owns about 9.4 % of LIN 's stock	In response to BellSouth 's amended pact , the Kirkland , Wash. , company extended its own offer to buy 22 million LIN shares for $ 125 apiece

5	Over the weekend , McCaw continued to call for an auction of LIN	McCaw to escalate the bidding again
8	This game is n't over yet	At some point , it will become non-economical for one company
1	McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause	Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices
2	We 're very pleased with the new deal	We did n't expect BellSouth to be so responsive
1	BellSouth 's `` back-end protection was flawed previously	this is a superior deal to McCaw 's
2	this is a superior deal to McCaw 's	We 're surprised
2	We 're surprised	We did n't think a sleeping { Bell } mentality would be willing to take on dilution
2	But Kenneth Leon , a telecommunications analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares	How many shares will be around in 1995
2	How many shares will be around in 1995 ?	There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile
8	BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings	the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter
5	For 1988 , BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion	Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $ 3.90 a share , or $ 1.9 billion , but now those estimates are being scaled back
8	Indeed , McCaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement	Urging LIN directors to conduct `` a fair auction on a level playing field , '' McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served `` with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94 % of all cellular { potential customers } in the nation 's top 10 markets
8	Their motivation , however , has a strong practical aspect : Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks	The most controversial form of program trading , stock-index arbitrage , is `` making it tough for traders to make money
1	The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading is n't known , as it is on the New York Stock Exchange , where it amounted to more than 13 % in September	Estimates from traders put it at less than 5 % of Nasdaq 's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares
8	Other market-maker gripes : Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market	Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves , a condition known as illiquidity
1	they do so only for customers , however	Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients ' accounts
9	That 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash , when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled	Market makers , to cut costs , slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n't selling
5	market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress	On days when prices are tumbling , they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will
2	On days when prices are tumbling , they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will	In such an environment , market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares
2	But this skittishness is creating liquidity problems in certain OTC stocks	It 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to { take the orders
8	It 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to { take the orders }	No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks
1	they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher	Sometimes { traders } lose sight of that
2	These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index	When the computers say `` sell , '' the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
6	This gap eventually closes , but slowly	Three days later , as of Friday 's close , the Nasdaq Composite was down 6 % , compared with 5.9 % for the industrial average , 5.7 % for the S & P 500 and 5.8 % for the Big Board Composite
5	The main reason for this lag is that individual investors own 65 % of the OTC market 's capitalization , according to Mr. Hardiman , much more than on the Big Board	Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs
1	The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.39 , or 1.2 % to 452.76 on Friday	For the week , the index dropped 3.8 %

9	Mr. Perry paused to scan the crowd	I see we have about half the audience working for us , '' he said , tongue in cheek
1	I see we have about half the audience working for us	The other half , we may have before long
2	Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously	their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions
2	First Unilever , the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant , spent $ 2 billion to acquire brands such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden	It now holds the No . 3 position at U.S. department-store cosmetic counters
8	Then Procter & Gamble Co. agreed to buy Noxell Corp. for $ 1.3 billion	That acquisition , to be completed by year end , will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines , making P & G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets
2	P & G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper , sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , sparking fear	Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics , there 's little doubt they will shake up the industry
6	to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies	Likely changes include more emphasis on research , soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing
2	But some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business	Estee Lauder Inc. , Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives
5	Estee Lauder Inc. , Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives	Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year , and since most products can be easily copied by competitors , they 're loath to test them with consumers
4	Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods , it does n't mean they are packaged goods	They 're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars
8	Unilever and P & G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits	Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research
5	Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research.P & G , in particular , rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing	Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field
6	P & G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business	Consider Oil of Olay , which P & G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985
9	Consider Oil of Olay , which P & G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985	The moisturizer , introduced in 1962 , had a dowdy image
3	The moisturizer , introduced in 1962 , had a dowdy image	Oil of Olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged
2	P & G set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin.It also redesigned Oil of Olay 's packaging , stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look.Moreover , P & G shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her mid-30s vowing `` not to grow old gracefully	The company says sales have soared
6	Goliaths like Unilever and P & G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals	Next year , Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy
1	Next year , Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy	Without P & G 's backing , Noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $ 5 million to $ 7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands
8	Without P & G 's backing , Noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $ 5 million to $ 7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands	Packaged-goods companies `` will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive

1	Rumors that Unilever is interested in acquiring Schering-Plough Corp. 's Maybelline unit are widespread	Unilever wo n't comment
2	The presence of Unilever and P & G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics	While the two are among the world 's biggest advertisers , most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads
5	Nearly 70 % of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets , according to Andrew Shore , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc	That figure has been inching up for several years
5	That figure has been inching up for several years	As the trend continues , demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase
9	That figure has been inching up for several years	As the trend continues , demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase
2	The packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products	Unlike the old-line cosmetics houses , Unilever and P & G both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products
8	that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands	There will be more emphasis on quality
2	There will be more emphasis on quality	You 'll see fewer gimmicks
6	But success for Unilever and P & G is far from guaranteed , as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business	In the 1970s , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies , including Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies
1	In the 1970s , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies , including Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies	only Schering-Plough , which makes the mass-market Maybelline , has maintained a meaningful business

2	Unilever already has experienced some disappointment	The mass-market Aziza brand , which it acquired in 1987 along with Chesebrough-Pond 's Inc. , has lost share , according to industry analysts
2	The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing , where Unilever is concentrating its efforts , may prove even more treacherous	In this niche , makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions
2	In this niche , makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions	Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned , careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important
1	Over the past week , the president has agreed to keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing	That was n't always the way the Reagan administration handled such matters
9	Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so	Congress never fully trusted former CIA chief William Casey and National Security Adviser John Poindexter to honor the ban
4	The new understanding did n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light	It emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics that followed this month 's failed coup attempt in Panama
6	that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult	that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator , Manuel Noriega , if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life
6	The senators responded in kind	Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been `` a meeting of the minds '' with the White House , and that the committee had given Mr. Bush `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years

Boren happily told reporters that there had been `` a meeting of the minds '' with the White House , and that the committee had given Mr. Bush `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years	Sen.

6	There still are some details to be nailed down	Mr. Bush is reserving the right in `` rare '' instances to keep Congress in the dark , asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee does n't recognize

5	The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer , the untested John Major , need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again	Mrs. Thatcher has to come to terms with European economic integration , beginning with the European Monetary System , which Britain is committed to joining fully someday
8	It sounds like the work of a decade , but the deadline is late 1991 , when Mrs. Thatcher is expected to call another national election	that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable
2	that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable	She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation , high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit
8	supporters wonder if her steely , autocratic ways are the right formula today	There 's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher 's style of management has become a political liability
5	The prime minister 's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson -- confused the financial community	Last week , the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up : Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters , the adviser , announced his resignation within an hour
2	The confusion could be costly	Currency traders , suspecting Mr. Major wo n't defend the pound strenuously , sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark
5	Currency traders , suspecting Mr. Major wo n't defend the pound strenuously , sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark	Analysts expect further jitters this week
2	A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate , currently 15 %	That could shove a weak economy into recession
5	That could shove a weak economy into recession	Economists have been anticipating a slump for months , but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought
8	but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought	Britain 's economy `` is developing rapidly toward no-growth
5	A mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991 while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992	Recovery could be hampered if Britain 's major trading partners in Europe , which are enjoying robust economic activity , cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991
2	That would leave Mrs. Thatcher little room for maneuver	For the Tories to win the next election , voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand
5	For the Tories to win the next election , voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand	Though Mrs. Thatcher does n't need to call an election until June 1992 , she would prefer doing so in late 1991
2	Though Mrs. Thatcher does n't need to call an election until June 1992 , she would prefer doing so in late 1991	If the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year 's time , she will be very vulnerable
9	There 's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community	It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
6	It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System	At a June EC summit , Mrs. Thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership , saying Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements
2	Since then , the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join	Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as `` half-baked '' in an article being published in an American economics journal
6	Since then , the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join	Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as `` half-baked '' in an article being published in an American economics journal
5	Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as `` half-baked '' in an article being published in an American economics journal	That produced little reaction from his boss , reinforcing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for avoiding full EMS membership
2	Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue	Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership
2	Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt authorities move interest rates	Mrs. Thatcher `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners
6	As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change	We wo n't have any more of this wayward behavior , '' says Sir Peter Hordern , a backbench Tory member of Parliament
2	We wo n't have any more of this wayward behavior	The party is fed up with sackings of good people

8	Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18	The women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share each did
5	Not unexpectedly , wives , whether working or non-working , did by far the most -- about 80 % of the shopping , laundry and cooking , and about two-thirds of housecleaning , washing dishes , child care and family paper work	Only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half
8	This pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples	In these families , husbands took on 80 % more chores than in couples with only grammar school education
2	It is clear that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the wife/mother	Her share decreases , but only slightly
5	State governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills	Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance
5	that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10 % -- of residents start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged	Another one-third are already on Medicaid when they enter the nursing homes , a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated
8	But a remarkably high percentage -- over half -- are private payers throughout their stay , even a fairly lengthy one	About one-third pay out of their own pockets , while the rest are covered throughout by Medicare , private insurers or the Veterans Administration
8	Graduate students are taking longer than ever to get their doctor of philosophy degrees	the time between college graduation and the awarding of a Ph . D. has lengthened by 30 % over the past 20 years , with the average gap now ranging from about 7.4 years in the physical sciences to 16.2 years in education
6	October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost , the official Soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation 's media	For one of the superstars of glasnost , Vitaly Korotich , editor of the trail-blazing weekly Ogonyok , Friday , Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation
2	Why had Mr. Korotich been called	that he was taking my butt to the Central Committee so they can . . . '' whack , whack , whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm

2	The government is nervous	According to Mr. Korotich , who was present , Mr. Gorbachev 's publicized tongue-lashing of the press on Oct. 13 was more of a plea : `` Be careful boys ; use good judgment.We 're standing in gasoline , so do n't smoke

9	In fact , a very high-ranking Soviet official told an American official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated	The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador , the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda , Victor Afnasjev , was replaced by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev 's
2	The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador , the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda , Victor Afnasjev , was replaced by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev 's	Brezhnevite holdovers have more to fear from Mr. Gorbachev than the verbal spanking he gave to the press
1	When Mr. Korotich took it over in 1986 , it sold 250,000 copies	today it sells 3.4 million
2	Glasnost has made celebrities of men like Mr. Korotich	Prevented by the Communist Party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet , he stood as an independent candidate for Congress from his native Ukraine and won with 84 % of the vote
5	Prevented by the Communist Party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet , he stood as an independent candidate for Congress from his native Ukraine and won with 84 % of the vote	The same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the Party , he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the Korotich party
2	But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are , there is a fragility to glasnost	Censorship is n't a Marxist invention
8	Censorship is n't a Marxist invention	The czars were no civil libertarians
6	The czars were no civil libertarians	As late as the 1890s , the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines
5	As late as the 1890s , the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines	It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan 's wives
4	So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society	It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history
5	It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history	It is public relations of the highest sophistication , that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point
6	What is that point	Will Ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika
2	I 'd be destroying myself , '' replies Mr. Korotich , who then asks , `` What would that accomplish	His answer reveals his vulnerability
8	it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture	It is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders
8	Judge Albert Green , in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago , also recognized the suit , filed last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf , as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers	The plaintiffs accused Irving of paying less interest than promised in a marketing brochure

8	Federal Reserve critics used to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policies	that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt
2	But under Alan Greenspan that has changed	A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow
2	Indeed , his caution has become legendary within the government	He fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in dozens of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems
9	He fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in dozens of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems	After thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed
8	Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge	Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets
6	Mr. Greenspan 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed 's ranks	A `` senior Fed official '' spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times , saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed
5	And , while the mutinous Fed member has n't gone public , some Fed governors , most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent	Ironically , the anonymous official 's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan
10	And , while the mutinous Fed member has n't gone public , some Fed governors , most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent	Ironically , the anonymous official 's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan
6	Ironically , the anonymous official 's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan	At a hearing last week , Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that `` Chairman Greenspan 's '' announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a `` very important statement
1	Chairman Greenspan 's '' announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a `` very important statement	that he was n't sure whether Mr. Greenspan `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report
6	when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets	A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system
8	Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault	Signs of growing weakness in the economy , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates
2	The administration 's concerns are understandable	The economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers
6	The economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers	Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled
5	Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled	Factory payrolls and production fell in September
8	In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road	Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % .But if the Fed eases too soon , Mr. Greenspan fears , prices may begin to accelerate again next year
5	So far , Mr. Greenspan 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well	His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession
8	to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession	We 've gotten through two stock market crashes , and we 've gone through an election without any major problems
2	We 've gotten through two stock market crashes , and we 've gone through an election without any major problems	I think you have to give Greenspan a good rating
6	But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes	The Fed 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting early next year
9	The Fed 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting early next year	If that happens , Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target
5	If that happens , Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target	Already , Congress is toying with legislation to curb the Fed 's independence
5	Already , Congress is toying with legislation to curb the Fed 's independence	If the economy turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum
6	the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist	A judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases , from arson to securities fraud , without missing a beat
5	A new specialty court was sought by patent experts , who believed that the generalists had botched too many important , multimillion-dollar cases	Some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field
5	Now only three of the 12 judges have patent-law backgrounds	The latter two and Judge Daniel M. Friedman , 73 , are approaching senior status or retirement
6	so patent lawyers and research-based industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court	Several organizations , including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association , have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds
8	Several organizations , including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association , have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds	The associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training
8	Their effort has received a lukewarm response from the Justice Department	We do not feel that seats are reserved ( for patent lawyers )
6	The Justice Department 's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court , Judge H. Robert Mayer	I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law

7	Its relationship with parent General Electric Co. had been frayed since a big Kidder insider-trading scandal two years ago	Chief executives and presidents had come and gone
8	it 's at a turning point	By the end of this year , 63-year-old Chairman Silas Cathcart -- the former chairman of Illinois Tool Works who was derided as a `` tool-and-die man '' when GE brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987 -- retires to his Lake Forest , Ill. , home , possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns

2	Wall Street is understandably skeptical	Through the first nine months of the year , Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds , with a 2.8 % market share , up slightly from 2.5 % in the year-earlier period , according to Securities Data Co
1	In 1988 , Kidder eked out a $ 46 million profit , mainly because of severe cost cutting	Its 1,400-member brokerage operation reported an estimated $ 5 million loss last year
1	In fact , Kidder is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading	in that controversial business , only Morgan Stanley & Co. rivals Kidder

2	President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president	that he might not rely on Congress to pass the line-item veto law he seeks
8	that he might not rely on Congress -- which has n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority -- to pass the line-item veto law he seeks	Mr. Bush is considering simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power , exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right

6	Moreover , in the relatively unregulated Indian stock markets , investors frequently do n't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue	A prospectus in India does n't always tell a potential investor much
5	A prospectus in India does n't always tell a potential investor much	Some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms
6	Some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues , in such an unregulated environment , could lead to a mega-crash	The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects , '' says G.S . Patel , a former chairman of the giant , government-run mutual fund , the Unit Trust of India
8	The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects	They 're going to have mega-problems
1	The $ 6 billion that some 40 companies are looking to raise in the year ending March 31 compares with only $ 2.7 billion raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year	In fiscal 1984 , before Mr. Gandhi came to power , only $ 810 million was raised
5	And it is n't the only giant issue : together , the top four issues will raise $ 1.3 billion	Convertible debentures -- bonds that can later be converted into equity shares -- are the most popular instrument this year
6	When Mr. Gandhi came to power , he ushered in new rules for business	He said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside India and benefit from economies of scale.If the output was too great for the domestic market , he said , companies should export
8	India 's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded , but they have started to think big	and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past
5	Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi 's policy , and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past	The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market , which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled banks , where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16 %
8	The second factor spurring mega-issues is political	Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November , and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress ( I ) Party will lose
2	Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November , and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress ( I ) Party will lose	Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. Gandhi 's , and possibly more restrictive
2	that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections	but India 's industrialists have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations
5	that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections	but India 's industrialists have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations
6	So far , the mega-issues are a hit with investors	Earlier this year , Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $ 355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed
7	Earlier this year , Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $ 355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed	Essar Gujarat Ltd. , a marine construction company , had similar success with a slightly smaller issue
7	Earlier this year , Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $ 355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed.Essar Gujarat Ltd. , a marine construction company , had similar success with a slightly smaller issue	Larsen & Toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month ; bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed
5	I do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market only a sagging tendency	The `` markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before
8	In the past , the government controlled the markets indirectly , through its tight grip on industry itself	Various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much ; and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans
2	But now , with large amounts being raised from investors , the government 's dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect	The Securities and Exchange Board of India was set up earlier this year , along the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , but New Delhi has n't pushed the legislation to make it operational
2	Mega or non-mega , we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved	Disclosures are very poor in India
6	Disclosures are very poor in India	the big questions -- `` Do you really need this much money to put up these investments ? Have you told investors what is happening in your sector ? What about your track record ? -- `` are n't asked of companies coming to market
7	Do you really need this much money to put up these investments	Have you told investors what is happening in your sector
7	Have you told investors what is happening in your sector	What about your track record
5	The engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant Reliance textile group	Although Larsen & Toubro had n't raised money from the public in 38 years , its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market
6	Although Larsen & Toubro had n't raised money from the public in 38 years , its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market	Reliance floated a $ 357 million petrochemical company in 1988 that was , at the time , the largest public issue in Indian history
1	Larsen & Toubro , for example , says	Unlike other companies , it has n't pin-pointed specific projects for the funds
5	Someone must monitor where the funds are deployed	There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds
5	There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds	They 're trying to plug the various loopholes , but they 're totally unprepared for this
1	Because of the large amounts of money being raised , the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used , some analysts fear that there could be a few mega-crashes , which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of 1986	The government insists that such a possibility is low
8	The government insists that such a possibility is low	It says that despite loose regulation of the market itself , its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes
1	Finnair and SAS said they plan to swap stakes in each other	Neither disclosed details pending board meetings next month
5	that SAS would take a stake of at least 6 % in Finnair , valued at about $ 40 million at current market prices	Finnair would receive SAS shares valued at the same amount
5	that it received permission late Thursday from U.S. antitrust regulators to increase its Jaguar holdings past the $ 15 million level	Ford got a similar go-ahead earlier in October
5	In late trading Friday , Jaguar shares bucked the downward tide in London 's stock market and rose five pence to 725 pence ( $ 11.44 )	Trading volume was a moderately heavy 3.1 million shares
1	Trading volume was a moderately heavy 3.1 million shares	In the U.S. , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts were among the most active issues Friday in national over-the-counter trading where they closed at $ 11.625 each , up 62.5 cents
5	British government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond 15 % before the end of 1990 without government permission	The British government , which owned Jaguar until 1984 , still holds a controlling `` golden share '' in the company
8	With the golden share as protection , Jaguar officials have rebuffed Ford 's overtures , and moved instead to forge an alliance with GM	Jaguar officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with GM that would preserve Jaguar 's independence , but no deal has been announced
2	it 's willing to bid for all of Jaguar , despite the objections of Jaguar chairman Sir John Egan	that Ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder 's meeting and urging that the government and Jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990
2	Ford officials will seek a meeting this week with Sir John to outline their proposal for a full bid	Any discussions with Ford could postpone the Jaguar-GM deal , headed for completion within the next two weeks
8	Jaguar and GM hope to win Jaguar shareholders approval for the accord partly by structuring it in a way that would n't preclude a full Ford bid once the golden share expires	There 's either a minority { stake } package capable of getting Jaguar shareholder approval or there is n't If there is n't , { the deal } wo n't be put forward '' to shareholders
8	There 's either a minority { stake } package capable of getting Jaguar shareholder approval or there is n't	If there is n't , { the deal } wo n't be put forward '' to shareholders
5	Union sentiment also could influence shareholder reaction to a Jaguar-GM accord	GM 's U.K. unit holds crucial talks today with union officials about its consideration of an Ellesmere Port site for its first major engine plant in Britain

2	I 'll always be with you , Jack	Do n't worry
4	Of course that was n't the actual conversation the late anti-war activist , protest leader and founder of the Yippies ever had with his brother	It 's a script pieced together from interviews by CBS News for a re-enactment , a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. Hoffman 's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression
8	The segment is soon to be broadcast on the CBS News series `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news	It is the New Journalism come to television
2	who is n't new to the character	He was Mr. Hoffman in a 1979 Los Angeles production of a play called `` The Chicago Conspiracy Trial
2	Television news , of course , has always been part show-biz	Broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an audience
7	Since its premiere Sept. 16 , the show on which Ms. Chung appears has used an actor to portray the Rev . Vernon Johns , a civil-rights leader , and one to play a teenage drug dealer	It has depicted the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie
7	It has depicted the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie	On Oct. 21 , it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson , who was abducted in March 1985 and is believed to be held in Lebanon
8	On Oct. 21 , it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson , who was abducted in March 1985 and is believed to be held in Lebanon	The production had actors playing Mr. Anderson and former hostages David Jacobsen , the Rev . Benjamin Weir and Father Lawrence Jenco
6	ABC News has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry	Prime Time Live , '' a new show this season featuring Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer , has a studio audience that applauds and that one night ( to the embarrassment of the network ) waved at the camera like the crowd on `` Let 's Make a Deal
0	that one night ( to the embarrassment of the network ) waved at the camera like the crowd on `` Let 's Make a Deal	ABC stops short of using an `` applause '' sign and a comic to warm up the audience
4	ABC stops short of using an `` applause '' sign and a comic to warm up the audience	The stars do that themselves
1	News programs , particularly if they score well in the ratings , appeal to the networks ' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 for a one-hour program	Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that
8	Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated `` tabloid TV '' shows as `` A Current Affair	That show , whose host is Ms. Chung 's husband , Maury Povich , has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case , the Rob Lowe tapes , what have you
8	Nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at CBS News	At 555 W. 57th St. in Manhattan , one floor below the offices of `` 60 Minutes , '' the most successful prime-time news program ever , actors wait in the reception area to audition for `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung
6	The network deals a lot with unknowns , including Scott Wentworth , who portrayed Mr. Anderson , and Bill Alton as Father Jenco , but the network has some big names to contend with , too	James Earl Jones is cast to play the Rev . Mr. Johns
7	James Earl Jones is cast to play the Rev . Mr. Johns	Ned Beatty may portray former California Gov . Pat Brown in a forthcoming epsiode on Caryl Chessman , the last man to be executed in California , in 1960
5	CBS News , which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks , now hires featured actors beginning at $ 2,700 a week	That is n't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes , or even Connie Chung for that matter
4	CBS News is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Middletown , Pa. , with something less than a cast of thousands	It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras
2	CBS News is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Middletown , Pa. , with something less than a cast of thousands	It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras
2	It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras	On Oct. 20 , the town 's mayor , Robert Reid , made an announcement on behalf of CBS during half-time at the Middletown High School football game asking for volunteers
5	There was a roll of laughter through the stands	They 're filming right now at the bank down the street , and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards
5	and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards	They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama
2	No way	I think re-enactments stink
5	Though a re-enactment may have the flavor , Hollywood on the Hudson it is n't	Some producers seem tentative about the technique , squeamish even
6	Re-creating events has , in general , upset news traditionalists , including former CBS News President Richard S. Salant and former NBC News President Reuven Frank , former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and the new dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism , Joan Konner	Says she : `` Once you add dramatizations , it 's no longer news , it 's drama , and that has no place on a network news broadcast
8	and that has no place on a network news broadcast	They should never be on
6	Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man	That includes his companion of 15 years , Johanna Lawrenson , as well as his former wife , Anita
2	This is dangerous and misrepresents Abbie 's life	It 's a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself
2	that dramatization `` makes the truth flexible	It takes one person 's account and gives it authenticity
8	The executive producer of `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' Andrew Lack , declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show , in particular	I do n't talk about my work
1	but says CBS News is `` aware '' of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman 's former wife	Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment
2	he was concerned at first that the script would `` misrepresent an astute political mind , one that I admired , '' but that his concerns were allayed	The producers did a good job of depicting someone `` who had done so much , but who was also a manic-depressive
9	Last year , Dentsu started HDM , a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France	A few months ago , Dentsu acquired 69 % of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars ( US $ 4.6 million )
5	A few months ago , Dentsu acquired 69 % of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars ( US $ 4.6 million )	Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries
2	What is driving Dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe	If we do n't do something . . . we wo n't be able to catch up with demand
5	If we do n't do something . . . we wo n't be able to catch up with demand	Our president said acquisition is an effective method
1	Last year , Dentsu 's foreign business accounted for less than 10 % of total billings , but the company is aiming at 20 % in the near future	So far , it appears cautious about taking the big step
6	Though Dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines , it is laying the groundwork for international growth	It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad
5	For the year ended March 31 , Dentsu sales rose 19 % to $ 8.9 billion from $ 7.5 billion , and net income jumped 59 % to $ 102 million from $ 64 million	Dentsu 's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam , the world 's second-largest ad agency , according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age
2	But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers	On its own , Dentsu 's muscle in Japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-Japanese clients
6	But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different	Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry
3	The show , one of five new NBC series , is the second casualty of the three networks so far this fall	Last week CBS Inc. canceled `` The People Next Door

2	Despite the inevitable comparison with Compaq , however , Texas Instruments ' new notebook wo n't be a direct competitor	While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers , Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers
5	The introductions also mark Texas Instruments ' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for the past several years	Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world 's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976 , the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on-board processing ability
5	Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world 's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976 , the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on-board processing ability	It stopped selling a standard personal computer a while ago
1	Now that is about to change , as Texas Instruments begins marketing two 14-pound laptop PCs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives	The laptops are not revolutionary and , indeed , are tardy in a market first opened by GRiD Systems Corp. , now a unit of Tandy Corp. , almost two years ago
6	But the notebook , with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk , is more innovative	Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery , the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches , has a 20-megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22 % larger than Compaq 's

2	Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first	The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters '' in the U.S. as well as in Great Britain and Europe
8	Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses	Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company , which , in turn , accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy

6	But some large insurers , such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , do n't purchase reinsurance , but fund their own program	A few years ago , State Farm , the nation 's largest home insurer , stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure

2	The administration should now state that if the { February } election is voided by the Sandinistas . . . they should call for military aid	In these circumstances , I think they 'd win
6	Mr. Ortega 's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves	I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers
5	It 's never very clear who starts what	that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire
6	Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega 's wavering as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections	Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections

1	Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules	If the exchange falters in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor , the Commodity Exchange
8	Only three weeks earlier , the Merc had turned to one of its own executives , 40-year-old R. Patrick Thompson , to replace Rosemary T. McFadden as president	Mr. Thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the Merc 's tarnished reputation as an exchange whose floor traders do n't follow the rules very well
1	Ms. McFadden had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman , chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange	that he was looking for a president who would be `` responsive to the needs of the membership and the board
9	By contrast , the Comex in July imported a highly regarded outsider , Arnold F. Staloff , as its president	Mr. Staloff , 44 , was a senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products
6	Mr. Thompson is n't bereft of experience with new products , however	For the past two years he and the exchange 's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract , seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market
1	Our members are eager to begin trading this contract , so we expect no difficulty in attracting locals to the natural gas pit	The educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two

5	Earlier this year , the U.S. attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big Chicago exchanges	Federal authorities in New York started investigating exchanges in May , though no indictments have been handed down there
2	So far they have issued scores of subpoenas , some of which went to members of the New York Merc	Mr. Thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas
6	In a recent General Accounting Office study , the Merc was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules	It levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years
1	that its compliance director , Kevin P. Conway , who then was responsible for policing the exchange 's busy oil and metal pits , `` was engaged in other personal business activities on Exchange time , '' including out-of-state trips , according to a New York Merc report prepared last year	Mr. Conway is no longer at the exchange
1	We had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance	We recognized the problem and took care of it
5	We recognized the problem and took care of it	that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed

5	The GAO has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent , verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud	The Merc is now cooperating with the Comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail
2	Another major electronics problem faces Mr. Thompson -- the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours	In January , the New York Merc signed a letter of intent with the Chicago Merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called Globex

5	Friday 's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets , according to PaineWebber 's Mr. Frawley	Most traders will be looking to buy { on } pullbacks
5	the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets	According to Mr. Frawley , floor traders say there is good support for December gold in the $ 374 to $ 375 per ounce area , around $ 5.20 an ounce for December silver and in the $ 485 to $ 490 an ounce range for January platinum
5	the price action for all of last week is the best he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year	last week 's activity in gold could portend a move to $ 390 an ounce for the December contract

2	But now the companies are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply	Third-quarter profits fell at several companies

6	New York City bonds have been beaten down for three straight weeks	On Friday , some issues fell nearly one point , or close to $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount

9	that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight	The explosion sent shards of metal flying , severing the DC-10 's hydraulic or control systems , and led to the crash that killed 112 people
8	The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City	Among the issues the board will examine is whether United Airlines , a unit of UAL Corp. , should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks
5	that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as `` hard alpha '' -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago	there was n't any way to detect the flaw at that time , and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur
2	The FAA already has ordered that all 232 disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber	Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident `` wo n't happen again
5	Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City-type accident `` wo n't happen again	that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue and `` will comply fully with the required inspections
2	that the recalls will have no impact on GE 's engine production	The CF6-6 series engines are n't being manufactured any more
2	To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen	These measurements can indicate temperature changes
5	Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap , a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age	Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes
5	Instead , the Dunde ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s , decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s , then higher temperatures again through last year	Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings
2	The result is that instead of the Pentagon 's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases , the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30	The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees
7	House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) helped secure $ 49.7 million for his state , or more than double the Pentagon 's budget	West Virginia , home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd , would receive $ 21.5 million -- four times the military 's request
7	West Virginia , home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd , would receive $ 21.5 million -- four times the military 's request	Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request
7	Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request	Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less , their increases above Pentagon requests -- 640 % and 430 % , respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures
6	The swift passage of the bill , which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week , contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $ 66.8 billion measure funding housing , environmental , space and veterans programs	By an 84-6 margin , the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday , but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration
2	but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere	Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to disguise as much as $ 1 billion in spending
8	For example , a House-Senate conference ostensibly increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $ 592 million , or more than $ 200 million above what either chamber had previously approved	Part of the increase would provide $ 90 million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor facility in Mr. Whitten 's Mississippi
2	The bill 's managers face criticism , too , for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent	Conservatives , embarrassed by Republican influence-peddling scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development , have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a Democratic-controlled Congress
2	Conservatives , embarrassed by Republican influence-peddling scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development , have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a Democratic-controlled Congress	HUD Secretary Jack Kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week
7	Within discretionary funds for community development grants , more than $ 3.7 million is allocated to six projects in Michigan , home state of a subcommittee chairman , Rep. Bob Traxler	House Speaker Thomas Foley won $ 510,000 for a project in his district in Washington state
1	The powerful Democrat had first wanted to add language relaxing environmental restrictions on two mills on the Hamakua coast that are threatening to close	When this plan met resistance , it was agreed instead to take money from HUD to subsidize needed improvements in two settling ponds for the mills , which employ an estimated 1,500 workers , according to Mr. Inouye 's office
2	Dennis Farney 's Oct. 13 page-one article `` River of Despair , '' about the poverty along the Mississippi , fanned childhood memories of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern Arkansas , only a few miles from the river	Although we were white , the same economic factors affected us as affects the black people Mr. Farney writes about
1	Although we were white , the same economic factors affected us as affects the black people Mr. Farney writes about	Fortunately , an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old
9	These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers , people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life	Following World War II , when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families , the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security , no skills in the workplace , no hope for their future except welfare
4	Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves	The people of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open , river traffic to increase , government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students
1	Because we refuse to face the tough answers , the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees , for the media and politicians	Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism , teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance
7	Does the Delta deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents , black and white , do not realize racism alienates potential employers	Should we focus on the region 's infant-mortality rate when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards , mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways ( abstinence or contraceptives ) of decreasing teen pregnancy
8	Should we focus on the region 's infant-mortality rate when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards , mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways ( abstinence or contraceptives ) of decreasing teen pregnancy	Delta problems are difficult , not impossible , to solve -- I am just not convinced that we are ready to solve them yet
8	I would like to issue a challenge to corporate America	The next time expansion plans are mentioned at the old company and somebody says , `` Aw heck , guys , nobody can do it like Japan or South Korea , '' I wish you would butt in and say , `` Hold it , fellas , why do n't we compare prices and use our own little Third World country
5	The next time expansion plans are mentioned at the old company and somebody says , `` Aw heck , guys , nobody can do it like Japan or South Korea , '' I wish you would butt in and say , `` Hold it , fellas , why do n't we compare prices and use our own little Third World country	We would even save on freight

5	that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8 % , or 400 people	The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul , during which it also lost as many as 400 employees
0	Mobil alluded to the work-force cuts last week when it took a $ 40 million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring	that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters
5	During the coming months , layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous	For greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction
8	For greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction	The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations
1	investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts	Now , the nationwide average yield on a six-month CD is just under 8 % , and 8.5 % is about the best around
2	But investors looking for alternatives are n't finding it easy	Yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago
6	There are , however , some alternatives that income-oriented investors should consider	Short-term municipal bonds , bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices they mention -- and not just as a way to get a higher return
2	A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense	People should remember their money is n't all or nothing -- they do n't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it
2	Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators	Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years
5	For an investor paying tax at a 33 % rate , a seemingly puny 6 % yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9 %	Rates approach 6.5 % on five-year municipals
2	Some of the more cautious CD holders might like `` pre-refunded '' municipals	These securities get top credit ratings
2	But they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead	Bond resale prices , and thus fund share prices , move in the opposite direction from rates
8	Consider , for instance , two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that were both yielding 8.6 % on a recent day	The Short Term Bond Fund , with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years , would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6 % if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about 6.6 % if rates rise by the same amount
8	You get equity-like returns '' from bonds if you guess right on rates	If interest rates do n't change , bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields
6	These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts : Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn , but a 10 % penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1/2	Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities , or certificates of annuity
8	Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities , or certificates of annuity	An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years , after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities
2	to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present , when rates seem headed down	With average maturities of a month or so , money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates , with a slight lag
2	Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates	If rates unexpectedly rise , the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund
5	the number of sudden , unexplained deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was 17 compared with just two in 1985	At least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year
1	With proper warning , diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food	The anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia
6	We do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar	The human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster
2	Reports of Dr. Toseland 's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there	Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines -- Britain 's equivalent of the U.S. FDA -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. Toseland 's findings
5	they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin , but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths	the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product
5	most of the British diabetics who died had been taking a human-based insulin made by Novo/Nordisk , a Danish manufacturer	None of the diabetics were using Lilly 's insulin
8	that , `` given an ideal world , we 'd have a nice , neat , orderly process	We 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget
1	We 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget	This city does n't work that way
1	This city does n't work that way	With a five-year defense plan costing more than $ 1.6 trillion , it 's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in Washington
1	This wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures	As it is , we identify national goals and the threats to these goals , we shape a strategy to counter these threats , we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy , before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces
8	As it is , we identify national goals and the threats to these goals , we shape a strategy to counter these threats , we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy , before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces	These procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper , and each year , their end product -- the Five Year Defense Plan -- promptly melts away
8	The graph on the left shows how this happens	Compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations
8	Compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations	The Pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats
2	Strategy , however , is about possibilities , not hopes and dreams	By ignoring costs , U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions
1	That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others : bean counters , budgeteers , and pork-barrelers	These people have different agendas
8	Reform starts in the Pentagon	Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process
8	Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process	They ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program
5	This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning	There is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning
8	Two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action	Step 1 cleans up our books
2	Step 1 cleans up our books	Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money , an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ 100 billion
2	That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ 45 billion	To make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $ 45 billion
0	The 1990 plan also assumes inflation will decline to 1.7 % by 1994	Most forecasters , including those in the Congressional Budget Office , assume inflation will be in excess of 4 % in each of those five years
5	The graph on the right ( which assumes a 4 % rate of inflation ) , places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations	Note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations
5	Scenario 1 , known as the `` Constant Dollar Freeze , '' reimburses the Pentagon for inflation only -- it slopes upward at 4 % per year	and it reduces the baseline by $ 106 billion between 1990 and 1994
8	Scenario 3 , the `` Current Dollar Freeze , '' has been the approximate position of the House of Representatives for about four years	It freezes the budget at its current level , and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994
2	It freezes the budget at its current level , and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994	This reduces the baseline by $ 229 billion
2	Scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the House and the Senate ; it splits the difference between Scenarios 1 and 3 , by increasing the budget at 2 % per year	It reduces the baseline by $ 169 billion
1	Finally , Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2 % per year for the next five years -- a total reduction of $ 287 billion	This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction , perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union
9	The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses	They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made , an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations , the impact on national security , and the best strategy for working around these limitations
2	If , for example , they choose to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber , they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions -- as they moved toward lower budget levels	These trade-offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the B-2 became prohibitive
1	Anyway , ZBB 's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia	A strategic review is fundamentally different
2	A strategic review is fundamentally different	It would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions : Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve U.S. goals
5	It might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible Congress	This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress , and unfortunately , there is some truth to it
2	But in the end , it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons	To say that the Pentagon should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke Congress into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the Pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest
2	it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives	If we want meaningful priorities , we must understand the trade-offs they imply before we make commitments
2	While Wall Street 's tough times and lower U.S. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar , weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors	By default , '' the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days
3	By default , '' the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days	We 're close to the bottom '' of the near-term ranges
7	In late Friday afternoon New York trading , the dollar was at 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen , off from late Thursday 's 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen	The pound strengthened to $ 1.5795 from $ 1.5765
2	With the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of U.S. economic weakness and the recent decline in U.S. interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments , traders say the dollar is still in a precarious position	They 'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar
2	Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after Mr. Lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats	With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies , `` you do n't have a confirmation '' that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works
2	While the pound has attempted to stabilize , currency analysts say it is in critical condition	Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week 's low of $ 1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members
6	While the pound has attempted to stabilize , currency analysts say it is in critical condition	Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week 's low of $ 1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members
1	Although the Bank of England 's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that Britain 's slowing economy is headed for a recession , it is widely believed that Mr. Lawson 's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks	If there are any signs that Mr. Major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge , that currency is expected to fall sharply
1	The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year	The pound was at 2.8896 marks late Friday , off sharply from 2.9511 in New York trading a week earlier
1	But such an increase could be viewed by the market as `` too little too late	The Bank of England indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged Friday by declining to raise the official 15 % discount-borrowing rate that it charges discount houses
5	The dollar has a `` natural base of support '' around 140 yen because the Japanese currency has n't been purchased heavily in recent weeks	The yen 's softness apparently stems from Japanese investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase U.S. bond issues and persistent worries about this year 's upheaval in the Japanese government
0	We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' was `` crafted primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin '' with a premise `` based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled	Perhaps even more offensive is the statement , `` It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy
1	Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the National Council on the Handicapped , all appointed by President Reagan	You depict the bill as something Democratic leaders `` hoodwinked '' the administration into endorsing
4	You depict the bill as something Democratic leaders `` hoodwinked '' the administration into endorsing	The opposite is true : It 's the product of many meetings with administration officials , Senate staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials
5	The opposite is true : It 's the product of many meetings with administration officials , Senate staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials	Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' as a model for bipartisan deliberations
2	Most National Council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities	We know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act : to be told there 's no place for your child in school ; to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair ; to be denied employment because you are disabled
1	Your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation the `` Lawyers ' Employment Act	For the 43 million people with disabilities and their families , this legislation is the `` Emancipation Proclamation

2	Hong Kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest-rate futures for a long time	The contract was first proposed more than two years ago
9	but shortly afterward , the colony 's markets were hit hard by the October 1987 global stock crash	The subsequent drive to reform Hong Kong 's markets also has embroiled the interest-rate futures contract
5	the new contract essential to the revival of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange	that without a healthy futures exchange , Hong Kong 's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer
8	The contract will be based on the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate , or Hibor	It is almost a carbon copy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's Eurodollar contract , which is based on the three-month Eurodollar rate , the rate paid on U.S.-dollar deposits in London banks
8	If the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong	The contract is definitely important to the exchange
8	Two years ago , the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be futures centers	After only 17 months , its main contract had grown to be the second-largest stock-index-futures contract in the world
6	Trading in Hang Seng index futures remains crippled by the experience	Volume for the entire month of September totaled only 21,687 contracts , compared with a daily average of 27,000 in the month before the 1987 crash
8	the futures market has shown itself to be resilient in two recent tests	While Asian markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the Oct. 13 plunge in New York stock prices , futures trading in Hong Kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly.That was also the case in the days following the June 4 massacre in Beijing , which caused a sharp drop in Hong Kong stock prices
8	Most important to the contract 's success is the commitment of Hong Kong 's big financial institutions , especially the two leaders , Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. and the local subsidiary of Britain 's Standard Chartered Bank PLC	The two big banks were instrumental in designing the new contract
1	In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 %	Just a few months ago , the three-month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5 % , while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11 %
2	Despite the initial support expected , trading in the contract is likely to start slowly	The wounds from the 1987 crash have n't yet healed , and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse -- by those who bet the Hang Seng index would fall -- have been settled
5	The wounds from the 1987 crash have n't yet healed , and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse have been settled	Companies and financial institutions familiar with Hong Kong remain wary of trading in its futures market
2	that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the Hong Kong dollar is n't a widely traded currency	the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading 500 to 1,000 lots a day

8	That 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on Continental stock exchanges during last week 's global market turbulence	They say the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way many European exchanges trade stocks
8	but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe 's weaknesses	the problems on European exchanges included market-system breakdowns , delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading suspensions
9	a frustrated Scottish Amicable fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called James Capel & Co. , a London brokerage firm	The firm did the trade in seconds on the London stock exchange 's SEAQ automated-quotation system

5	By Wednesday , frustrated Belgian brokers reopened the market by using the time-honored method of quoting stocks with chalk on a blackboard	The Belgian computer system finally was repaired and restarted on Tuesday of this week
2	In France , more than half the top 25 blue-chip stocks did n't open until Wall Street rallied late in the European trading day	The rally transformed some big sell orders into big buy orders , solving an order-imbalance problem
8	Belgium was closed for two days , France closed for a couple of hours , Germany was stuck	It was a nightmare
2	The switch to the London market during such turbulent times is significant	For one thing , the size of the affected market is enormous
5	the European stock markets account for some 22.5 % of global stock market capitalization , with an estimated value of $ 2.175 trillion , according to Morgan Stanley Capital International	The Continental markets alone contribute about 14.3 % of estimated world market capitalization of $ 9.671 trillion
2	that despite the economic restructuring associated with European Community efforts to develop a single market by 1992 , European stock trading remains a highly fragmented and very localized activity	Against this backdrop , one thing that does n't seem likely to result from 1992 is a single European stock market
6	Meantime , brokers on the Continent are worried , too , mostly by the potential loss of business	I would be much happier if this volume { in German stocks } were in Frankfurt rather than London , '' says Dieter Bauernfeind , head of international equity sales at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt

1	But it 's just one of those things that happened	Investors can be assured now that this kind of problem can never occur again
2	that the charter will force EC countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations	Workers and management would lose the `` flexibility and diversity '' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions
2	But the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over Britain	We still have serious differences with the text
2	the charter would put poorer EC countries such as Spain , Greece and Portugal at a disadvantage	It would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours
2	Indeed , lower wages are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries	Increasing labor costs would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier-free EC market planned for after 1992
1	that producing a charter acceptable to both Britain and European industry is n't an unattainable goal	The charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights
2	One possible political solution would be for the commission to present the action program in late November , before the adoption of the charter at a summit of EC governments on Dec. 8 and 9	This would leave Britain free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program

2	Mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seems under control for now	The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices
8	The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices	After years of wild swings , oil prices over the last 12 months have settled at around $ 15 to $ 20 a barrel
5	Not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again	The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within OPEC
2	The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within OPEC , producer of more than 40 % of the non-Communist world 's crude	A recession or new OPEC blowup could put oil markets right back in the soup
2	Also , the new stirrings are faint , and some question their extent	Drilling activity is still far below eight years ago , there 's no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink
8	something has changed	It does n't appear to be getting worse
2	It does n't appear to be getting worse	That in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic
2	Though modest , the change reaches beyond the oil patch , too	The same roller-coaster prices that halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets
1	The same roller-coaster prices that halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets	Now , at least some predictability has returned , for everyone from economists to motorists
2	And consumers `` should be comfortable	I do n't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price
2	The catalyst for all this has been OPEC	About a year ago , it ended an on-again , off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from Houston to Caracas into recession
8	About a year ago , it ended an on-again , off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from Houston to Caracas into recession	Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters
5	In addition , global petroleum demand has been climbing	It is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day , or up to 2 % annually , for years to come
2	For OPEC , that 's ideal	The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently
2	The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently	Consumers offer security of markets , while OPEC provides security of supply
8	To promote this balance , OPEC now is finally confronting a long-simmering internal problem	At its November meeting , it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy Persian Gulf members that can produce far more oil than their allotments

2	Being held well below capacity greatly irritates them , and has led to widespread cheating	OPEC has repeatedly raised its self-imposed production ceiling to legitimize some of that unauthorized output
6	That would send prices plummeting from what some gun-shy U.S. oil executives still regard as too low a level	Patrick J . Early , president of Amoco Corp. 's oil-production unit , says that despite recent stability , he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending
6	The view of some others in Big Oil is very much { similar to } Amoco 's outlook	Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations
5	A mile and a half away looms the 150-foot-tall rig of the Sniper , due to be pumping by December	Talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells
8	It is more aggressive than most , but it is n't the only company with a new attitude , as it found when it went looking for a partner for the Sharpshooter	We went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect Five were interested
2	Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. became the partner , ponying up more than half of the $ 600,000 in drilling and start-up costs	Mitchell will get a half-interest in the oil
1	A kind of no-mistakes mentality '' had been stifling activity	Now `` everybody is a lot more optimistic
2	At this price , $ 18 plus or minus , and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago , the economics are pretty good	If you know you 've got stability in price , you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years
6	The activity is enough to move some oil-service prices back up a little	Some drill-bit prices have risen 5 % in the past month

2	Still , there is money to be made	Most oil companies , when they set exploration and production budgets for this year , forecast revenue of $ 15 for each barrel of crude produced
1	Most oil companies , when they set exploration and production budgets for this year , forecast revenue of $ 15 for each barrel of crude produced	Prices have averaged more than $ 2 a barrel higher than that
8	So , according to a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey , companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end	40 % of those surveyed report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988 's
6	Funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable	Texaco may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects
5	Texaco may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects	Outside investors , scarce since '86 , are edging back
2	Outside investors , scarce since '86 , are edging back	Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn
6	The appetite for oil-service stocks has been especially strong	Contractors such as Parker Drilling Co. are raising cash again through stock offerings , and for the first time in years , two oil-service companies recently went public
8	and for the first time in years , two oil-service companies recently went public	They are Grace Energy Corp. of Dallas and Marine Drilling Co. of Houston

5	I sense that it 's going to continue to grow	That 's the word
8	Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation	Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments
2	Thus , rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal , I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk	the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large
8	If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return , I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk , as I am sure your pros do	Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk
2	Moreover , your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio	A four-stock portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk
8	This means the returns can vary a great deal	Mr. Dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only $ 112,383 by randomly selecting four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month
2	Your Investment Dartboard article misses the target	The fact that stock pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of 12 months has no bearing on the efficient-market theory
8	For example , your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month are , on average , 22.5 % riskier than holding the market portfolio according to Value Line 's Beta estimates	James Morgan 's pick for October -- Dynascan -- is a substantial 35 % riskier than the market portfolio

8	The robberies also have set off a controversy involving the airlines	Agents say airlines , which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets , should be doing more to catch the thieves by confiscating the tickets when they 're used . `` They have the most sophisticated computers in the world , '' says Mr. LLerena . `` They ought to be able to do this . '' But airlines say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized scanners to check tickets at the gate

5	Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation	Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a `` temporary '' reduction when it is not
8	Your Sept. 29 page-one story on the House-passed capital-gains plan is a good example	You lead readers to believe that the House reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only
5	You lead readers to believe that the House reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only	You virtually ignore the tax-reducing power of indexation , which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate
2	the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the House would not be temporary , but permanent	I hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature -- indexation
8	That the motivation for the two-year reduction to 19.6 % is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest	The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses
2	To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense	A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation
2	A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation	Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest

2	Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1 % or 2 % a year	The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs
1	Under the initial proposal , for example , banks would have been required to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted	The final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses , which appears on the balance sheet
8	The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest rate contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held	It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments

9	they managed to induce bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the poisons produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough	Laboratory tests showed that non-toxic versions of the poisons are capable of inducing an immunity to whooping cough
8	they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis toxin , which could be used as a safe vaccine	they have been able to pluck the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium.It turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin , only one was responsible for the toxin 's virulence . Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes , minus the one that caused the virulence , would have been transferred to another bacterium , called E. coli , which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin they did this , but the toxin did n't induce immunity to whooping cough . The scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused virulence.Then , using a new technique ( called homologous recombination ) for introducing genes into cells , they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism.These bacterial `` cousins '' ordinarily do n't make the toxin.But the genes were accompanied by a piece of DNA , called a promoter , that turns the genes on . The new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which , because of the mutant virulence gene , was no longer toxic

8	Much of the family 's mystique remained	Although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during World War II , the Rothschilds ' place in Frankfurt 's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the Rothschild name

6	The Rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors	As at the Zurich bank , the minimum investment for individuals will be high : about a million German marks ( $ 538,000 ) , three times what many other West German investment banks require
6	and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors	Warren Buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in 1982
8	Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps	One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital

2	Paul Lesutis blames futures markets for leading the way	The fundamentals do n't change in an hour
2	The fundamentals do n't change in an hour	they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing
2	Index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility	Although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets , John Bachmann , managing partner of Edward D. Jones , says too much liquidity is n't a good thing
8	It 's too disruptive	It is n't investing
8	But stock-index futures have plenty of support	Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks
5	Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks	They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures
5	that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s , a decade before the advent of futures	Futures merely cut down on trading costs
2	blaming futures is like blaming the messenger	Since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets , it ca n't add to volatility
8	either you adapt or die	If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to Australia or Tokyo
2	futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios	If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts

6	One reason futures are said to add volatility is that people can speculate in futures with little money down	Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7 %
2	Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7 %	For $ 10 million , you can move $ 100 million of stocks

2	The S & P 500 index futures `` transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit-making them a simple commodity to trade	It took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of IBM , for example
8	But owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks	Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices

5	In wooing British lawmakers , GM has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep Jaguar British-owned and independent	This week , the U.S. auto giant paid for 10 House of Commons members and two House of Lords members to fly to Detroit and tour its operations there

8	Some conservatives say Mr. Bush should n't make the trip	These critics object to Mr. Bush 's participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega among the guests
8	I believe it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like Daniel Ortega	Mr. Windsor , among other analysts connected to the conservative Heritage Foundation , fears the gathering of 18 leaders , mostly from Central American nations , will force Mr. Bush `` to explain and redeem himself '' in the wake of charges that the U.S. failed to do enough to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega
8	At the same time , liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of Mr. Bush 's joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in U.S. aid to the tiny country	The administration proposed only $ 57 million in so-called economic support funds for Costa Rica this year , down from the $ 90 million the U.S. provided last year
6	However , peace efforts by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias have n't always helped the country 's cause in Washington	Mr. Arias 's long-time refusal to support the U.S. 's campaign against leftist Nicaragua earned him the ire of the Reagan White House
8	Let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip	There wo n't be any formal resolutions or communiques , I do n't think.But we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many , many very important issues

8	The proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika , Mikhail Gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy	They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices , breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business
8	Instead , they map out a strategy in several phases from now until 1995	Most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered Soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest

6	Mr. Engelken moved south to Washington , but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951	When his wife , Betsy , came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966 , Mr. Engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment : `` You look prettier than Bobby Thomson 's home run

8	The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system	Highlights of the bills , as currently framed , are : -- A restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own , to 660 square meters in the nation 's six largest cities , but more in smaller cities and rural areas.The government will penalize offenders , but wo n't confiscate property . -- A tax of between 3 % and 6 % on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling . -- Taxes of between 15 % and 50 % a year on `` excessive '' profits from the resale of property , or the sale of idle land to the government.The government defines excessive profits as those above the average realized for other similar-sized properties in an area . -- Grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect

8	that about 10,000 property speculators are operating in South Korea	The chief culprits are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land `` not for their corporate use , but for resale at huge profit
5	that as much as 67 % of corporate-owned land is held by 403 companies -- and that as little as 1.5 % of that is used for business	that in the first half of 1989 , the nation 's 30 largest business groups bought real estate valued at $ 1.5 billion

8	Distribution centers are bombed , and advertisers are intimidated	Censorship is imposed by terrorism
2	If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world	The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive

1	There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money	In my opinion , this is not true
4	In my opinion , this is not true	Laundered drug money has served only to increase , unrealistically , the price of real estate , creating serious problems for low-income people who aspire to own their own homes

7	They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies	They wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis
8	and they wonder who will be advising him	Will he , if he wins , be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies , who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings , or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have funneled money into his campaign
6	In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty	A lot of people think I will give away the store , but I can assure you I will not , '' he says
2	but I can assure you I will not	I am aware we have real budgetary problems

2	New York State Comptroller Edward Regan predicts a $ 1.3 billion budget gap for the city 's next fiscal year , a gap that could grow if there is a recession	If elected , Mr. Dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under-serviced neighborhoods
2	He is going to face a mess	His supporters are not venal , but their solution to everything will be to spend more money , and he wo n't have any money
8	By and large , Mr. Dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore	Instead of focusing on the financial future , Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by Mayor Koch

2	No doubt , Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence	He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues ' children , opens doors for women , and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody
5	More important , he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst	Rather than scaring off white voters , as many predicted he would , Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head
2	But even in his front-runner campaign , he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as Manhattan borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor	Over the last few weeks , he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani
6	Over the last few weeks , he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani	A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron Percy Sutton was allowed to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media
5	A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron Percy Sutton was allowed to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media	He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke

6	Often , Mr. Dinkins 's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out	On the campaign stump , he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at Manhattan 's Columbus Circle.But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided , it was too late to try to draw other members to his position

2	One Board member , Bronx Borough President Ferdinand Ferrer , was said to be so impatient with Mr. Dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for Mr. Dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign	I had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind
4	that the Manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues	We did n't rubber-stamp everything that came to us
8	On some occasions when Mr. Dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign , he has run into a familiar kind of trouble	Some supporters were stunned this summer when Mr. Dinkins suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike
9	Some supporters were stunned this summer when Mr. Dinkins suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike	He withdrew the remark
9	He withdrew the remark	When he later sided with striking hospital workers , some allies cringed a little more , concerned that Mr. Dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees
6	Mr. Dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment	He favors a form of commercial rent control , which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city
5	He favors a form of commercial rent control , which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city	In the midst of a labor shortage , he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring New York City residents
1	In the midst of a labor shortage , he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring New York City residents	With an untrained local labor pool that policy could drive businesses from the city
1	And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of New York City	the Koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save 5,000 Chase Manhattan Bank jobs from moving across the Hudson
6	But Mr. Dinkins 's economic planks do n't seem to bother the business community	Steven Spinola , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , an industry organization , says Mr. Dinkins 's `` economic development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it , he can be reasonable
1	We know there are potholes for the city out there	If any of us think we 're going to sidetrack David 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us , we are making a sad mistake
5	If any of us think we 're going to sidetrack David 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us , we are making a sad mistake	You have to remember David is a pragmatist
6	But Mr. Dinkins 's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple cart	He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether , as mayor , he plans on reforming the political `` fiefdoms '' that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York 's school system
8	He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether , as mayor , he plans on reforming the political `` fiefdoms '' that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York 's school system	I will sit down and talk some of the problems out , but take on the political system ? Uh-uh , '' he says with a shake of the head
2	Despite many doubts about his candidacy , white New Yorkers are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to Mr. Giuliani	The former U.S. attorney , who prosecuted targets ranging from Mafia dons to Wall Street executives , has succeeded in raising questions about Mr. Dinkins 's ethical standards , but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy
5	As a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city , Mr. Giuliani has an inherent handicap	As a first-time candidate , he has been slow to learn the nuances of New York City politicking

0	A few years ago , Mrs. Hammack insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house , which had been converted into apartments	Only about 20 % of California home and business owners carried earthquake coverage
8	Ms. Johnson is awed by the earthquake 's destructive force	It really brings you down to a human level , '' she says
2	but you have to	If you do n't , you ca n't do your job
2	For Aetna and other insurers , the San Francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched	Most companies still are trying to sort through the wreckage caused by Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas last month
1	Adjusters who had been working on the East Coast say the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through December	It could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake-related claims
2	The secret to being a good adjuster is counting	You have to count everything
9	To do that , they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot , carpeting by the square yard , wallpaper by the roll , molding by the linear foot	Using a calculator and a unit-price guide for such jobs as painting , plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country , adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today 's market and what it would cost to rebuild it
6	Sometimes repairs are out of the question	When Aetna adjuster Bill Schaeffer visited a retired couple in Oakland last Thursday , he found them living in a mobile home parked in front of their yard . The house itself , located about 50 yards from the collapsed section of double-decker highway Interstate 880 , was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its basement
10	But such skills were alien to Toni Johnson	Four years ago , she was managing a film-processing shop and was totally bored

9	She signed up , starting as an `` inside '' adjuster , who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone	A year later , she moved to the commercial property claims division
6	Her new line of work has some perils	Recently , a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old Victorian house torched by an arsonist

6	During her second meeting with the Hammacks , Ms. Johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers	They would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor , but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside.Ms . Johnson tells them that , if the appliances ca n't be salvaged , their policy covers the replacement cost
1	They would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor , but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside	that , if the appliances ca n't be salvaged , their policy covers the replacement cost
5	Ms. Johnson tells them that , if the appliances ca n't be salvaged , their policy covers the replacement cost	Mr. Hammack is eager to know what Aetna will pay for the house , which has to come down
2	Mr. Hammack is eager to know what Aetna will pay for the house , which has to come down	When will I get that check for a million dollars ? '' he jokes
9	In this case , that 's about $ 250,000	It suddenly dawns on Mr. Hammack that rebuilding the house in Los Gatos may cost more than Aetna 's policy will pay
8	that rebuilding the house in Los Gatos may cost more than Aetna 's policy will pay	We can lose money on this
5	So , many Californians believe they can get by without it	Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption
8	Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption	I always knew that the 'Big One ' was coming , but not during my lifetime
1	I always knew that the 'Big One ' was coming , but not during my lifetime	Now she 's thinking of contacting her own insurance agent

5	The FCC moves were good news for AT & T , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation	Alfred Sikes , the new FCC chairman , championed deregulation of AT & T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency
8	The FCC took three specific actions regarding AT & T	By a 4-0 vote , it allowed AT & T to continue offering special discount packages to big customers
0	AT & T gave a 5 % to 10 % discount to the Memphis , Tenn. , company that oversees Holiday Inns , in response to a similar discount offered to Holiday Corp. by MCI Communications Corp	that because MCI 's offer had expired AT & T could n't continue to offer its discount plan
2	AT & T offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to Resort Condominium International , of Indianapolis , to meet another MCI bid	The FCC `` did n't say I could n't do it again
9	they expect to re-examine how AT & T is regulated since competition has increased	the agency to propose new rules next year
8	AT & T applauded the FCC 's actions	The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it , '' the New York telecommunications firm said in a statement
2	it was `` obviously disappointed '' with the FCC decision on Tariff 12	it will petition the FCC decision in federal court
2	it will petition the FCC decision in federal court	We believe that the court will find it unlawful
5	Separately , AT & T filed a countersuit against MCI accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising	The AT & T action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight
2	The AT & T action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight	Earlier this month , MCI sued AT & T in federal district court , claiming that AT & T 's ads are false
8	Interviews with three major fund groups confirm the trend	Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ 500 million , or about 13 % of their junk fund assets , in the past two months
8	negative publicity has exacerbated investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices	People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying : ` I ca n't take it anymore -- I 'm getting out
2	The withdrawals could spell trouble for the $ 200 billion junk market	If the heavy outflows continue , fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead
9	If the heavy outflows continue , fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead	Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds , already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems
2	Mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the outgoing money	that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts , and to a lesser extent , government-bond funds
8	The $ 1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $ 150 million in the past two months	About $ 60 million streamed out last week alone , double the level of the week following last month 's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze
5	The fund , with a cash cushion of more than 10 % , has `` met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing	Our fund has had { positive } net sales every month for the last three years -- until this month
2	Still , two-thirds of the outflow has been steered into other Vanguard portfolios	The fund now holds a cash position of about 15 %
8	Those withdrawals followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through August	The last two months have been the whole ball game
8	Junk-fund holders have barely broken even this year , as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices	Through Oct. 19 , high-yield funds had an average 0.85 % total return ( the price change plus dividends on fund shares ) , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc
1	Fidelity 's junk fund has fallen 2.08 % this year through Oct. 19	the Vanguard fund rose 1.84 %
2	People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again	Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues , such as RJR Nabisco , to raise cash to meet expected redemptions . Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers.And then , asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far
2	There was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst	The resignation came as a great surprise
2	The market was caught totally the wrong way	Everyone was extremely long on sterling
1	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8400 marks , up from 1.8353 marks late Wednesday , and at 142.10 yen , up from 141.52 yen late Wednesday	Sterling was quoted at $ 1.5765 , sharply down from $ 1.6145 late Wednesday
5	U.S. GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.5 % in the third quarter	The implicit price deflator , a measure of inflation , was down to a 2.9 % annual rate of increase in the quarter from a 4.6 % rate of gain in the second quarter
8	But the broader truth is more complicated -- and dismaying	The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the Senate intelligence committee and the CIA and National Security Council.Staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the U.S. could not do to oust the Panamanian thug.They simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant.Mr . Boren himself did n't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until Mr. Bush told him privately at the White House last week
5	They simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant	Mr. Boren himself did n't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until Mr. Bush told him privately at the White House last week
2	It 's ironic that David Boren should be in the center of this mire	A former Oklahoma governor , he 's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy
5	A former Oklahoma governor , he 's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy	He 's a rare Democratic hawk
5	He 's a rare Democratic hawk	He 's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg , the GOP senator from Michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s
5	He 's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg , the GOP senator from Michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s	Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine
2	Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine	They allowed this country to be credible
6	But in 1989 most senators have other ideas	Last July , his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama
8	Last July , his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama	Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get people hurt , a charming notion for a great power
5	Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get people hurt , a charming notion for a great power	Maine Republican William Cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban
9	So the administration dropped it	By October , when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal , even the administration was agreeing little should be done
8	but he does concede that Congress has made mistakes	In the aftermath of Vietnam , in the aftermath of Iran-Contra , I can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup , they have to bring their lawyers , '' he says
2	it means a bipartisan majority	The sustainability of U.S. foreign policy is essential Why was containment so successful ? Because it had bipartisan support
6	The sustainability of U.S. foreign policy is essential	Why was containment so successful ? Because it had bipartisan support
2	Mr. Boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions	that even Grenada or the Libyan raid would have taken place if `` consensus '' had been required
1	Vandenberg and Rayburn were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents	modern senators , Mr. Boren notwithstanding , are less modest
0	The result is that the Senate committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action	I would n't say it 's quite a veto
8	Mr. Boren even spies a silver lining	He figures the episode will help `` clarify any ambiguities '' between the committee and administration
8	More broadly , Mr. Boren hopes that Panama will shock Washington out of its fear of using military power	Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , '' he says
4	the problem goes beyond legal interpretation	Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` exchange of letters
2	that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock	The lawyers are now in charge of our national security
2	But if , as many now fear , Waertsilae Marine joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn out to be remembered most as a blemish on Finland 's international reputation	The shipyard 's 6.5 billion Finnish markka ( $ 1.54 billion ) backlog includes about 20 ships ordered by big international shippers , including three for Carnival Cruise Lines Inc
8	However , some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway 's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago	In that case , international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees
2	The decision by a majority of state-appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government policy	In August , the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard
5	Government officials were expected to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms	The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan
2	Mr. Suominen had grown increasingly worried about the state 's potential financial exposure as Waertsilae Marine 's losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated in August	that Mr. Suominen may have decided to cut Finland 's losses once and for all
2	The last thing markets like is uncertainty	you 'll see share prices go down
6	The pound immediately began to take a buffetting after the resignations were announced	In late New York trading , sterling stood at $ 1.5765 , down from $ 1.6145 late Wednesday
6	The British economy is hardly the picture of health these days	At 15 % , base interest rates are the highest in eight years
5	and the 7.6 % annual inflation rate is by far the highest in the European Community	Unions are pressing demands for wage increases of more than 10 % despite general belief that economic growth next year will be less than 2 %
6	Increasingly , the financial markets are reflecting the gloom	The Financial Times 100-share index has dropped about 12 % from its 1989 high of 2423.9 on Sept. 8
5	The Financial Times 100-share index has dropped about 12 % from its 1989 high of 2423.9 on Sept. 8	Yesterday , even before the resignations were announced , the index dove 32.5 points to close at 2129.4

2	The outlook for corporate earnings is fairly bleak	It 's quite likely we 're going to get repeats '' of the mid-October market shocks

6	Denizens of London 's financial district are cushioning themselves for heavy blows	A lot more of our customers are staying until our 10 p.m. closing time , '' says Christopher Brown , managing director of Corney & Barrow Restaurants Ltd. , which runs five tony wine bars in the district
9	There 's a strong sense among the martini set that there 's more { bad news } to come	People in the stock market were very much Thatcher 's children -- very young and wealthy optimists
8	The malaise has created a nostalgic longing for the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s	People come to us saying they 'd like to be back where they were a few years ago , in a more collegial atmosphere , with less tension , '' says Stephen Waterhouse , managing director of Hanover Partners Ltd. , a financial district head-hunting firm
8	But after trading losses in the mid-October market jolts here , many people will be lucky to have jobs at all	The industry , which currently employs about 25,000 people in London , has shed about 2,500 jobs over the past two years
2	Everybody and his sister have opened up M & A shops	It 's difficult to see that there 's going to be enough business to go around
8	It 's difficult to see that there 's going to be enough business to go around	About eight firms will get the lion 's share
5	About eight firms will get the lion 's share	At the others , there are going to be a lot of disappointments , after all those promises and all that big money that 's been paid to people
8	It all adds up to a cold winter here	People are just plain scared
2	One person who is past worrying about London 's blues is Christopher Hartley	Last summer , he chucked his 10-year career as a London stockbroker and headed for the mountains
2	I 'm glad to be out	The percentage of your day spent twiddling your thumbs got greater , and the work day kept getting longer
8	The warning by the U.S. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June	In those cases , the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes , including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment
8	According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar 's case , prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure	In a letter , prosecutors told Mr. Antar 's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings , they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized
8	In a letter , prosecutors told Mr. Antar 's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings , they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized	Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar 's attorneys that they believe Mr. Antar 's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities.Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid
8	Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission	In that suit , the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a `` massive financial fraud '' to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie , Edison , N.J. , over a three-year period
8	that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits	Mr. Antar made more than $ 60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987
8	that the government 's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly	According to department policy , prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made
8	That 's just what happened in the October 1987 crash	As the market tumbled , disorderly market conditions prevailed : The margins between buying bids and selling bids widened ; trading in many stocks was suspended ; orders took unduly long to be executed ; and many specialists stopped trading altogether

2	The situation was like that of a skier who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope	His skis spread farther and farther apart
9	His skis spread farther and farther apart -- just as buy-sell spreads widen during a financial panic -- and soon he is out of control	Unable to stop his accelerating descent , he crashes
2	It 's doubtful , though , whether circuit breakers do any real good	In the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up , as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone
2	Instead , an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market : the Federal Reserve	The availability of timely assistance -- of a backstop -- can help markets retain their resilience
6	The availability of timely assistance -- of a backstop -- can help markets retain their resilience	The Fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign-exchange markets
6	This does not mean that the Federal Reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market	In 1987 , it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window
5	In 1987 , it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window	It lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses
2	The stock market is certainly not too big for the Fed to handle	The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger
8	The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger	Daily trading volume in the New York foreign exchange market is $ 130 billion.The daily volume for Treasury Securities is about $ 110 billion
1	Daily trading volume in the New York foreign exchange market is $ 130 billion	The daily volume for Treasury Securities is about $ 110 billion
2	The combined value of daily equity trading on the New York Exchange , the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market ranges between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion	The $ 13 billion the Fed injected into the money markets after the 1987 crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day
8	The Fed 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious	It should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets -- not to prop up the Dow Jones or New York Stock Exchange averages at a particular level
5	not to prop up the Dow Jones or New York Stock Exchange averages at a particular level	The Fed should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks
2	The Fed should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks	It would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell IBM or General Motors shares
2	Instead , the Fed could buy the broad market composites in the futures market	The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices
2	Stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market	The Fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the symptom -- the liquidity of the banks
8	But since the member countries of the International Monetary Fund agreed to the `` Guidelines to Floating '' in 1974 , such difficulties have been avoided	I can not recall any disorder in currency markets since the 1974 guidelines were adopted
2	Caution should . . . be the rule of the day	It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general , to say nothing of banks , if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions

2	that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip 's `` floating-point unit '' , a set of circuits that do certain calculations	On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations
2	the flaws do n't affect them	Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development
8	the bugs wo n't delay their development of 486-based machines	We have n't modified our schedules in any way
9	Nonetheless , concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel 's stock to $ 32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading , on volume of 3,609,800 shares , and partly responsible for a drop in Compaq 's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday	Yesterday , Compaq plunged further
2	it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week	We should not be seeing any more
8	the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as computer-aided design and scientific calculations and then very seldom	These errata do not affect business programs
2	These errata do not affect business programs	The bugs will cause problems in `` specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications '' such as word-processing and spreadsheets
4	Intel is n't wholly to blame for the snafu	The real culprits are computer makers such as IBM that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products
8	The real culprits are computer makers such as IBM that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products	The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability
8	IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays	We do n't look at this as a major problem for us
2	it 's real strength lies in its software inheritance	The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began dominating the market ever since IBM picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer
2	Of the big computer makers , only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead	The 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry

5	The venture is part of a two-pronged effort to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years	The other element includes consolidating BethForge 's press-forge operations
9	it is significant because it marks the first time the nation 's No . 2 steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner	Wall Street analysts have criticized Bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones
2	We think it 's a step in the right direction for Bethlehem	It 's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked
9	Bethlehem is also working with the United Steelworkers union to consolidate BethForge 's two machine shops and four heat-treatment facilities of the press-forge operations	Once the consolidation is complete , Bethlehem plans to concentrate its forgings business on nuclear fabrication , hardened steel and large-diameter steel rolls for rolling mills and selected custom-die applications
8	If you 're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market , consider the case of Columbia Savings & Loan	The California thrift has just announced a $ 226 million third-quarter loss
8	Now , we regard this as a largely phony issue , but the `` long term '' is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the Beltway	It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value
2	It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value	They could no longer be classified as what Columbia regarded them , namely long-term investments
8	Congress 's ham-handed treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings reminds us of a story in the Journal earlier this year about the Baby Bell companies ' desire to have the court-ordered bans lifted on offering information services	The issue of seeking relief from Congress was raised to Delbert Staley , the chairman of Nynex.Mr . Staley replied : `` Legislation tends to be compromised.I believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court , through Justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies.I see Congress as a last resort

2	The shift wo n't affect operations	As part of its restructuring several years ago , Exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53-floor Rockefeller Center skyscraper to a Japanese company
6	But the pullout is an embarrassment to New York City officials , coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies	Mobil Corp. is in the process of vacating its headquarters here , and huge operations like J.C. Penney & Co. and Trans World Airlines have recently left
6	New York authorities reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it	We are dismayed , but there 's nothing we can do about it now , '' said Stanley Grayson , New York City deputy mayor for finance and economic development

8	The complex bill covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated	These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges , oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders , and exchange governance
5	One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker	The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill

8	The Senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading	The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of `` service fees , '' which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets . Other provisions have a more subtle , but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges.These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages . In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members , these measures could have other , far-reaching repercussions . One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct.Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances . It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation.In an already low-profitmargin business , commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public , depriving the private individual of access to the markets . Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them.This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages . Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade , many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers.This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers.A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity . Finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue.In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client.Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets

2	But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz	We see , smell and hear slums filled with `` the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language , rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street

2	Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic , and he modeled his work on Western classics	In one sense , this limits him

5	I do n't know how much got through	Nobody has any credible estimate
8	I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem	The efforts to get to the people who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important

5	These efforts wind up creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost	With these incentives , demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it
2	With these incentives , demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it	It seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it
2	Frankly , the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost	When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives
8	When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives , including , I might say , the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted , so that they create a market for themselves	They wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market

8	But trade , one of the economy 's main forces in the past few years , showed a sharp deterioration	Imports of goods and services soared , while exports were flat
2	For the past two years , the foreign trade sector has been a major contributor to economic growth	You ca n't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path
5	many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls	Many economists think the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar this year will further crimp progress in trade
5	Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the 2.5 % pace `` good , solid growth , '' although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter	Inflation is lower than I think people expected it to be , and I think that 's good news
6	But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report	Mr. Darby called it a `` disappointment
2	Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories	While a buildup of these stocks adds to GNP , it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs

9	As orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled , three years of steady growth ended with a 69 % drop in income in this year 's first half	The company hit on a new strategy : If the Defense Department is so intent on saving money , why not make money off that trend
5	UNC also is selling new parts , if needed , directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor	At as little as one-third of the government 's cost , the company is running a program to train Army helicopter pilots
5	In another approach , tiny Iverson Technology is trying to resume its growth by braving the new world of commercial products	he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets

Telos responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and `` bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities , '' says Lin Conger , Telos chairman and controlling shareholder

2	The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the European Community	Mr. Mitterrand proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the EC allowing a European central bank , and that the treaty be ratified by 1992

2	A reintegrated Europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies	There is likely to be a natural division of labor with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union , and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East

'' But it did n't sing.So they opted for IRA , naming it after Ira Cohen , a brilliant IRS actuary who helped them

Carl Curtis , sought some form of pensions for the uncovered	That year a four-man group headed by William Lieber in the Legislation and Regulations division of the Office of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service , was assigned the task of designing a plan
5	So they opted for IRA , naming it after Ira Cohen , a brilliant IRS actuary who helped them	Ira , himself , confirms this account
6	IRA rules have been changed over the years	One in 1981 raised to $ 2,000 a year from $ 1,500 the amount a person could put , tax-deductible , into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans
8	The measure will create a two-tier exchange rate	Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar.But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar
5	The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market	As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade , the discrepancy has become ever greater
8	the discrepancy has become ever greater	Western tourists in the Soviet Union who could exchange a dollar -- albeit illegally -- for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered 15 rubles or more
8	Even at such rates , black marketeers have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here	They use dollars to buy Western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark-up
6	and then sell them at a huge mark-up	The going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $ 2,000 in the West is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles
5	The going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $ 2,000 in the West is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles	Even a pack of 20 Western cigarettes can fetch 20 rubles or more
8	but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise	It 's much bigger than we expected , '' said one German banker
8	Unless other rules are changed , the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help : Soviets who travel abroad	Over the past three years , thousands of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad But under current rules , they are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip.At the new rate , that would give them about $ 30 to travel on

2	it 's time to take a fresh look at the nation 's central bank	After 75 years there may be a few things that are worth reexamining
6	The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup , for instance , may be out of date	In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond , Va. , a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank , but times have changed
8	In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond , Va. , a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank , but times have changed	Maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism
8	to restore an arrangement we once had -- or , at least , part of it	In the beginning , the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board.But in 1935 , when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression , it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board Rep. Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D. ) has introduced a bill in Congress , co-sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind . ) , that would put the treasury secretary back on the board
8	Carter Glass , a former treasury secretary who was then back in Congress , probably influenced the decision	that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and , somehow , he did n't think that was a good thing
8	Times have changed	Rep. Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D. ) has introduced a bill in Congress , co-sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind . ) , that would put the treasury secretary back on the board
2	Nicholas Brady , the incumbent treasury secretary , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does n't like it much	Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics , dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea
8	He was , in fact , taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury	After the October 1987 market crash , Mr. Brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it.One of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency , probably the Federal Reserve , should coordinate regulation of all financial markets
2	but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job	The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well
1	The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well	he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions
1	In recent weeks , moreover , Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates	The urging admittedly has been gentle
8	The urging admittedly has been gentle	In an interview with the Washington Post in early October , the secretary said the Fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is , while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth
8	At least some economists , of course , would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis	Earlier this month the St. Louis Fed held a conference to assess the system 's first 75 years.Allan Meltzer , a Carnegie-Mellon University economist , noted that the Fed 's record included the longest , most sustained , peacetime inflation in our history , dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989
5	but to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed	The central bank has been helping
2	Now , sterilized intervention may have some effect	When traders see the Fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully , for fear of what the central bank may do

1	In fact , however , Mr. Reagan 's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something	Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal
8	Those events continue to move at a rate , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake	that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty '' by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk
5	Earlier this week , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty '' by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk	Hungary is no longer a `` Socialist Peoples '' republic
8	It has been a well-paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office	The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million

5	that this is nothing new , that America has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced	There is evidence to support that view
8	There is evidence to support that view	Eighty-three years ago , William James wrote to H.G . Wells : `` The moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success . . . that , with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success , is our national disease But if it was the national disease in 1906 , it is today the national commonplace.If there is no law against it , do it.If the law leaves loopholes , use them.If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead.And if you are caught or if people complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one said I should n't `` and brazen it out.As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong . ( See , for instance , Jim Bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful . ) Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze 's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair.The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government `` violated norms of behavior '' in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station.We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about Iran-Contra , and that apparently is n't going to change.For that matter , those long ago identified as liars are still given respectful hearings in the press

5	The U.S. , in a far-reaching plan submitted to the Geneva meeting Tuesday , proposed curbing price support subsidies within 10 years and eliminating export subsidies within five years	the plan was flexible , and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade-distorting subsidies
8	But the EC reacted defiantly , arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the Common Agricultural Policy , the EC 's $ 28 billion-a-year price support program	The American proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation , '' the EC said in a statement
5	and is insisting on the `` elimination '' of export subsides , not just reduction	the U.S. plan `` calls into question '' the agreement reached by world negotiators last April in Geneva seeking `` substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection
5	U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Jules Katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the April accord	He said he was surprised by the EC 's reaction , calling it `` vehement , even frenetic

9	Russell Miller 's `` Bare-Faced Messiah : The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard '' is a biography of the founder of the Church of Scientology.Mr . Hubbard , who died in 1986 , bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church , which licensed them to New Era Publications , a Danish corporation	In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publishing `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' on the ground that Mr. Miller 's quotations from Mr. Hubbard infringed the copyrights
1	In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publishing `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' on the ground that Mr. Miller 's quotations from Mr. Hubbard infringed the copyrights	The publisher argued in response that the `` fair use '' statute permits quotation `` for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , . . . scholarship , or research
5	District Court Judge Pierre Leval denied the injunction on the ground that New Era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine lawyers call `` laches	As for the merits , Judge Leval said that Mr. Miller had written `` a serious book of responsible historical criticism
8	Verbatim quotation was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. Hubbard -- mendacity , bigotry , paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. Hubbard 's own words	The biographer/critic should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example
2	The biographer/critic should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example	In such circumstances , free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner
0	But Judge Leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbidding a biographer of J.D . Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger 's personal letters	He distinguished the two cases
8	He distinguished the two cases	In Salinger , Judge Leval noted , the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject
2	Still the Salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials	that a few of Mr. Miller 's quotations from Mr. Hubbard 's unpublished writings , because they were not necessary to prove historical points , failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright
9	The case went on appeal to the Second Circuit	In a decision in April of this year , Judge Roger Miner , joined by Judge Frank Altimari , agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval 's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright
8	but rejected Judge Leval 's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright	We conclude , '' the two judges wrote , `` that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction . '' Had the suit been filed in time , they said , `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' would have been suppressed
2	that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction	Had the suit been filed in time Bare-Faced Messiah '' would have been suppressed
2	This was too much for James Oakes , the court 's chief judge	In a powerful separate opinion , Judge Oakes further distinguished the Salinger case by pointing out that a living person , like Mr. Salinger , had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man , like Mr. Hubbard
3	that a living person , like Mr. Salinger , had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man , like Mr. Hubbard	that Salinger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us
5	I thought that Salinger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us	This case realizes that concern
1	Judges Oakes and Leval understand the requirements of historical scholarship	Judges Miner and Altimari do not appear to have a clue
3	As matters stand , the Salinger ruling , torn from context and broadly construed , is controlling	If an author quotes `` more than minimal amounts '' of unpublished copyrighted materials , as the Salinger decision had it , `` he deserves to be enjoined . '' The courts have not defined `` minimal amounts , '' but publishers , I understand , take it to mean about 50 words
5	The `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise	A second decision , handed down in August by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , is another blow against scholarship
5	and , as proof of malice , Mr. Masson contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. Malcolm were in fact fabricated	The quotes could not be found on the tapes
2	that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said , the reader assumes that these are the speaker 's precise words or at least his words purged of `` uh '' and `` you know '' and grammatical error	While judges have an obligation under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the press , `` the right to deliberately alter quotations is not , in my view , a concomitant of a free press
1	Ms. Malcolm , for example , wrote that Mr. Masson described himself as `` the greatest analyst who ever lived	No such statement appears on the tapes

1	Again , no such statement appears on the tapes	The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson 's description of himself as a `` private asset but a public liability '' to Anna Freud
1	The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson 's description of himself as a `` private asset but a public liability '' to Anna Freud and that in any case it was not defamatory	Judge Kozinski found the derivation entirely strained and writes that `` for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is . . . a devastating admission of professional dishonesty
3	These were only two of a series of fabrications that had , in Judge Kozinski 's words , the cumulative effect of making Mr. Masson `` appear more arrogant , less sensitive , shallower , more self-aggrandizing , and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements	As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm 's book , Mr. Masson emerges `` as a grandiose egotist . . . and , in the end , a self-destructive fool.But it is not Janet Malcolm who calls him such : his own words reveal this psychological profile

8	There is one sacred rule of journalism	The writer must not invent

8	Should the green light Judges Alarcon and Hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice , it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians -- and for citizens	To invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to lie in print . . . .

6	It has always been so	In the 1920s , a young schoolteacher , John T. Scopes , volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature.The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the `` smart set , '' whose spokesman was H.L . Mencken , and the religious fundamentalists , whom Mencken derided as benighted primitives.Few now recall the actual outcome : Scopes was convicted and fined $ 100 , and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under Tennessee law

5	And so it seems to be with the case of Elizabeth Morgan , the Washington , D.C. , plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter	Dr. Morgan has just emerged from the D.C. jail after more than two years ' confinement for contempt of court , a heroine to her many supporters

2	It is what lawyers call `` fact intensive	It presents no great issue of legal principle , no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt

5	It is difficult , if not impossible , for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy	Certainly I do not
8	So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many , not just in Washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world	that three themes have come together in the strange case of Dr. Morgan
5	many of Dr. Morgan 's supporters have taken Thurber 's memorable title `` The Male Animal '' quite literally	The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that Thurber accepted as an eternal part of the human condition
2	A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case	Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the `` best '' schools
5	Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the `` best '' schools	As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan , does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated , black , working-class woman , Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her
2	Finally , the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government	The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons
2	The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons	Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress
5	The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex , class , race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan 's particular situation	It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence

2	Richard Breeden had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone	It was , after all , only his second full day as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
2	But the lack of lines became painfully apparent	As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13 , Mr. Breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the SEC -- from his desk , where the New York Stock Exchange was on an open line , to his assistant 's office , where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was connected , to a third room , where a computer monitored market moves

5	In an interview and in congressional testimony , he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market	A veteran of another financial crisis , the savings-and-loan bailout , Mr. Breeden wants to have the SEC regulate securities issued by banks and S & Ls
5	More broadly , he wants to `` modernize '' regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping U.S. financial firms compete in the global market	He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs , an area the SEC does n't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in Congress
2	Also unlike Mr. Ruder , Mr. Breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda	As a former White House aide who worked closely with Congress , he is savvy in the ways of Washington
2	For instance , he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks	He may be waiting to see the results of several pending SEC studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules
2	Congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while	Members of the Senate Banking Committee know Mr. Breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill , and the relationship generally remains warm
2	These days , Mr. Breeden is winning praise in Washington and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday 's harrowing morning session	As a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence , Mr. Breeden avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government agencies

7	The University of California at San Francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business	In many other institutions , scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the NIH policy is settled

6	No doubt there is something to irk everyone in this AT & T-sponsored dramatization of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein 's book about Watergate	Personally , I 'm irked by its combination of ponderousness and timidity , which adds up to an utter lack of drama
5	The Ku Klux Klan was revived in the 1920s as a national organization aimed at Catholics and Jews as well as blacks	One reason for its downfall was the murder trial of D.C.

5	The filing , made yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here , follows an agreement by L.J . Hooker Corp. , Merksamer 's owner , to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price	GE Capital Corp. , a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co. , is providing Merksamer management with $ 15 million in financing
1	At that time , Sam Merksamer , president of the chain , angrily denied that his company was about to file	Mr. Merksamer is leading the buy-out
2	According to executives close to the situation , Merksamer filed for Chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain	an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of L.J . Hooker Corp. had frozen in place all of L.J . Hooker 's assets
8	The Merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement	By filing for Chapter 11 , the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale , not the hundreds of unsecured creditors

1	For all of this year 's explosive run-up in stock prices , Renaissance Investment Management Inc. 's computer sat on the sidelines	Now it 's on the fence
5	Renaissance , a Cincinnati-based money manager , began buying stocks again this week with half of the $ 1.8 billion that it oversees for clients , according to people familiar with the firm 's revised strategy	It was the first time since January that Renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning
1	but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday , timed to coincide with the maturity this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm	The other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in Treasury bills for the time being
5	they believed that Renaissance 's $ 900 million buy program was carried out by PaineWebber Inc	PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift
2	When it owns stocks , Renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues	to make buy or sell moves , the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades

9	to make buy or sell moves , the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades	The broker winning the business does n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price
6	That puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market	In Tuesday 's gyrating session , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 80 points early in the day , but finished with less than a four-point loss
1	At the time , the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at about 2200	The Dow average now stands more than 20 % higher , while Renaissance 's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6 % through the first three quarters of the year
2	The Dow average now stands more than 20 % higher , while Renaissance 's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6 % through the first three quarters of the year	The computer 's miscalculation has been painful for Renaissance
5	that if there was such a move , it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction	During that time , a buyer with the clout of a Renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand
2	Our { computer } model has a certain trigger point	When the computer says switch , Renaissance switches
5	The firm has made 17 previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history	Almost all have involved at least half and often the firm 's entire portfolio , as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category , following a money-management style called tactical asset allocation
5	It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans who had moved into the offices of MGM/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company	After MGM/UA terminated the $ 1.5 billion merger because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit , Qintex Entertainment -- which is 43 % -owned by Qintex Australia -- found itself facing problems of its own
5	On Oct. 19 , Qintex Entertainment was about to default on a $ 5.9 million payment owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program	Qintex Entertainment was depending on Qintex Australia to arrange financing
2	he believed Qintex Australia would n't be forthcoming	He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline , according to a source familiar with the sessions
2	But a majority of the board , which includes three members from the Australian company , overrode him	Mr. Evans resigned
5	and asked Mr. Evans to stay on	Mr. Evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it
5	Mr. Evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it	Mr. Evans could n't be reached yesterday for comment

1	Assets of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue 's Money Fund Report jumped to $ 351.2 billion in the week ended Tuesday	Assets soared $ 4.5 billion in the previous week
8	Meanwhile , the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point , the largest drop since midsummer	The average seven-day compound yield fell to 8.47 % , its lowest since late last year , from 8.55 % the week before , according to Donoghue 's
2	Lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates	Money funds invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities , commercial paper and certificates of deposit , all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring
1	The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , was just 7.77 %	The average yield on six-month CDs of $ 50,000 or less at major banks was 7.96 % in the week ended Tuesday , according to Banxquote Money Markets , a New York information service
8	One way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments	The average maturity of the taxable funds that Donoghue 's follows increased by two days in the latest week to 40 days , its longest since August
8	when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward	The average seven-day compound yield of the funds reached 9.62 % in late April
8	The highest-yielding funds are still above 9 %	The top-performing fund in the latest week was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar , with a seven-day compound yield of 9.45 %

8	Many small investors are facing a double whammy this year	They got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market
8	where a 25 % leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have 125 % of their money working for them	The strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio
2	That 's really where the leverage hurt	Share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values
1	which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all	Leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds
8	Consider the New America High Income Fund	With a leveraged position of about 45 % , the fund 's share price has plunged 28.5 % so far this year
5	With a leveraged position of about 45 % , the fund 's share price has plunged 28.5 % so far this year	That 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio , whose total return ( bond-price changes plus interest ) has amounted to a negative 6.08 %
1	Many investors are unaware their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market	If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold they might shy away
2	In a typical leverage strategy , a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money	If the market surges , holders can make that much more profit
2	If the market surges , holders can make that much more profit	the leverage effectively acts as an interest-free margin account for investors
6	Fund managers , for their part , defend their use of leverage	Carl Ericson , who runs the Colonial Intermediate High Income Fund , says the fund 's 25 % leverage has jacked up its interest income
2	the fund 's 25 % leverage has jacked up its interest income	As long as I am borrowing at 9.9 % and each { bond } yields over that , it enhances the yield
8	the fund 's 25 % leverage has jacked up its interest income	As long as I am borrowing at 9.9 % and each { bond } yields over that , it enhances the yield
8	Yet some funds have pulled in their horns	that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ 5 million in preferred stock and notes from investors
5	that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ 5 million in preferred stock and notes from investors	The fund made a similar move earlier this year
1	the fund 's recent performance `` illustrates what happens in a leveraged product '' when the market does n't cooperate	When the market turns around it will give a nice picture '' of how leverage can help performance
6	But a few funds have taken other defensive steps	Some have raised their cash positions to record levels
2	Some have raised their cash positions to record levels	High cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls
5	Prospect Street High Income Portfolio , for instance , now holds about 15 % in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year	the fund , which is 40 % leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds

2	the fund , which is 40 % leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds	I do n't want to be in a position to have to sell
6	Other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash	At the 50 % -leveraged Zenith Income Fund , portfolio manager John Bianchi recently dumped Mesa Petroleum , Wickes and Horsehead Industries , among others , to raise his cash position to a record 15 %
5	That 's a problem because cash is n't earning us very much money	This is the most difficult market that I 've been involved in
2	We 're looking at the leverage factor every day	At some point , if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost we 're going to have to make a move

2	After four years , though , the South Gardens design is 100 % uncollaborated Jennifer Bartlett	She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees , water , landscape fragments , rudimentary square houses , circles , triangles , rectangles -- and fit them into a grid , as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall
2	But for South Gardens , the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them	In a letter to the BPCA , kelly/varnell called this `` arbitrary and amateurish

5	As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design : `` I have designed a garden , not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip . '' Moreover , she proclaimed that `` landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years '' in the design of open space.And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method : Commissioning a friend to spend `` five or six thousand dollars . . . on books that I ultimately cut up . '' After that , the layout had been easy . `` I 've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail	Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client `` because I do n't think you can do watered-down versions of things
1	here and there are simple architectural forms , a whimsical jet of water , a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid , and chairs of every sort to drag around	At the core of it all is a love for plants

In one garden roomette she implanted a 43-foot square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit , a `` zinc sink , '' a `` huge fishbowl with carp '' and a `` birdcage with cockatoos	Next door she put a smaller plaid-floored glass house , where , she suggested , a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of winter
1	It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers , rosarians , orchardists and arborists	Ms. Bartlett blithely suggested calling upon `` semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance
2	Then , to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms , Ms. Bartlett had thrown up windowless walls ( brick , lattice , hedge ) eight to 10 feet tall , casting her interiors into day-long Stygian shade	It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in South Gardens without decking the walls in a Christmas-like array of Gro-Lites
5	Ms. Bartlett threw up yet another wall , this time concrete , this time 10 1/2 feet tall	She ran it the length of the South Gardens riverfront , blotting out the city 's great natural water features , the harbor and the river

8	Unhappily , our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his ` designs ' to the garden	It is this adapting of absurd ` knots ' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants
2	Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union 's large gold reserves would give it `` great power to establish credibility	During the latter part of the 19th century , Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100 % of its outstanding currency , but no one outside Russia used rubles

2	The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law , rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency	It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 , when the Bank of England was an independent private bank , the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England , the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined

Tisch , a billionaire in hotels and finance , was just learning the TV business.Five months later , Mr. Tisch took over as CBS 's chief executive , and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. Pilson scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper , sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators Then , in May 1988 , Mr. Tisch urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network.Mr . Pilson gave him one : He bid $ 243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville , France ; ABC and NBC would n't bid even $ 200 million

2	It 's also a fast fix for an ailing image	flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs , grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later
5	I 've been struggling against that for years	Even if baseball triggers losses at CBS I 'd rather see the games on our air than on NBC and ABC
2	That is n't surprising	Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot

8	The Winter Games outlook also is mixed	CBS expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating

2	That 's easy for him to say	CBS 's four-year NBA pact , now at $ 176 million for four years , could double in price by the time his talks with Mr. Pilson are completed later this month
1	And CBS takes in the least money in prime time	ABC and NBC charge 30 % to 35 % more for ads , according to a Variety survey

2	Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question	For most of the past nine years , he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position
1	Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion	Mr. Bush 's problem is n't so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it

1	By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters , the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments.Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House	On many issues -- flag-burning , for instance -- his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts
6	These days , when others raise the subject of abortion , the usually loquacious president can be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness	Ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance . `` My position is well-known and well-stated , '' he replied

6	In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980 , Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival , Ronald Reagan	In addition to supporting the landmark Roe vs.Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion , Mr. Bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising to promote
5	As Mr. Reagan 's running mate , though , Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position , endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion	He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan -- that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life

6	without being pushed into unwelcome moves	Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to
8	In 1986 , Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn 's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4 % stake	Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes , a move that , in effect , raised the cost of a $ 7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $ 3 billion

5	Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel companies	Given the weakness of the junk-bond market , can he finance a buy-out
1	Given the weakness of the junk-bond market , can he finance a buy-out	Mr. Icahn may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in Texaco Inc. in June -- a coup that gave him enough cash to make his USX move
5	it does n't end the takeover threat	I know it 's not over , '' a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged
8	In fact , it 's barely begun for Mr. Corry , who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job	He 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own
4	The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive	An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he could n't stand cutting up frogs , Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company `` that could do big things

6	Yet , the unassuming Mr. Corry helped chart USX 's transition from Big Steel to Big Oil	He served as Mr. Roderick 's front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of Marathon Oil for $ 5.9 billion
6	Nevertheless , Mr. Corry , once named chief executive , did n't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss	Soon after taking over last June , Mr. Corry rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers , a move that Mr. Roderick had n't made in spite of improved earnings
1	that Mr. Corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price	The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned
2	in restructuring USX	Mr. Icahn has long believed that the company , whose 1988 sales totaled $ 16.88 billion , is worth $ 70 a share if broken up
2	and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree	Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential
2	as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential	In the past five years , USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs.But the short-term outlook is so-so
2	It is n't surprising that Messrs.Roderick and Corry view steel so differently	While Mr. Roderick was reared in the shadows of Pittsburgh 's smoking mills , Mr. Corry grew up in Cincinnati , a city nicknamed `` Porkapolis '' and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron

6	Few people are aware that the federal government lends almost as much money as it borrows	From 1980 to 1988 , while federal budget deficits totaled $ 1.41 trillion , the government issued $ 394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $ 756 billion of new primary loan guarantees
5	From 1980 to 1988 , while federal budget deficits totaled $ 1.41 trillion , the government issued $ 394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $ 756 billion of new primary loan guarantees	These figures omit secondary guarantees , deposit insurance , and the activities of Government-Sponsored Enterprises ( a huge concern in its own right , as detailed on this page May 3
1	Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal , and were meant to break even financially	Since the 1950s , federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume , subsidy rates , and policy applications , spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular
2	and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular	As we will see , many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit
6	But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control	Student loan defaults remain high at about 12 % , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement
7	Student loan defaults remain high at about 12 % , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement	Farmers Home Administration ( FmHA ) loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs
8	Farmers Home Administration ( FmHA ) loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs	losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $ 20 billion
7	Student loan defaults remain high at about 12 % , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement.Farmers Home Administration ( FmHA ) loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs ; losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $ 20 billion	Defaults on Veterans Affairs loan guarantees have quadrupled in the past eight years
5	Last month , the General Accounting Office reported that defaults in Federal Housing Administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated , and that FHA 's equity fell to minus $ 2.9 billion	GAO 's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $ 300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs
2	If the programs continue their present path , the potential government losses are staggering	The federal government holds $ 222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantees
8	If the programs continue their present path , the potential government losses are staggering	The federal government holds $ 222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantees
5	The federal government holds $ 222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantees	Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA- and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $ 330 billion
2	Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs	To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide , credit policy must : 1.Use credit to improve the operation of capital markets , not to provide subsidies
8	There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program	If the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal
2	For example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector	Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds
2	For example , student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral	The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount
1	The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount	High default rates , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high
5	High default rates , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high	Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates
5	In contrast , a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rates	While the student was in school , interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance
6	Given the structure of most credit programs , it is surprising that default rates are not even higher	Guarantee rates are typically 100 % , giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully
1	Guarantee rates are typically 100 % , giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully	Reducing those rates moderately ( say , to 75 % ) would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers
2	Borrowers ' incentives are equally skewed	Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts , the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low
2	Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts , the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low.In addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off	Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection ( taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies ) and to deny new credit to defaulters
2	Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection ( taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies ) and to deny new credit to defaulters	These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy , but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections
1	Since the budget measures cash flow , a new $ 1 direct loan is treated as a $ 1 expenditure , even though at least part of the loan will be paid back	Loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the borrower defaults , so new guarantees do not raise the deficit , even though they create future liabilities for the government
2	Loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the borrower defaults , so new guarantees do not raise the deficit , even though they create future liabilities for the government	By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee , the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit
2	By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee , the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit	Predictably , guarantees outstanding have risen by $ 130 billion since 1985 , while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ 30 billion
2	This figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses , or determined by selling loans to private owners ( without federal guarantees )	Neither technique is perfect , but both are better than the current system , which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ 20 billion annually , according to the Congressional Budget Office

2	but both are better than the current system	A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to
6	Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit	Many agencies roll over their debt , paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans , or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans

5	More seriously , FmHA has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value	Until GAO 's recent audit , FHA books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years
2	The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices , including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits	Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises , provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions , and reduce fraud
1	Government lending was not intended to be a way to obfuscate spending figures , hide fraudulent activity , or provide large subsidies	The reforms described above would provide a more limited , but clearer , safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender

1	The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to keep the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and enable Southern blacks to go to the polls , unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices	Twenty-five years later , the Voting Rights Act has been transformed by the courts and the Justice Department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities -- Hispanics , Asians and native Americans -- holding elective office
5	In the 1980s , the Justice Department and lower federal courts that enforce the Voting Rights Act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of `` safe '' minority election districts	The program has even been called upon to create `` safe '' white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority
2	The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable	For the political process to work , all citizens , regardless of race , must feel represented
1	One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency	As is , blacks constitute 12 % of the population , but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders
2	But racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal	It is a quick fix for a complex problem
1	Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities -- New York and Birmingham , Ala	When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue
9	when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states	In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts
9	This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government completed a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members	Sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines

5	To win their seats on the council , these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all	Often they have found that the relevant issue is not race , but rather housing , crime prevention or education
2	In Birmingham , which is 57 % black , whites are the minority	Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act , a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts , including four safe white districts
8	Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act , a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts , including four safe white districts	The white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented , because in city-wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who catered to `` black interests '' could win
2	but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts	Richard Arrington , Birmingham 's black mayor , lamented the consequences

6	that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests	A small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman
8	But James Madison refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written , No . 10 of the Federalist Papers	Madison explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good
2	that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good	Large , heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government because a representative would be compelled to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none
8	Madison 's noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide us	As long as we believe that all Americans , of every race and ethnic background , have common interests and can live together cooperatively , our political map should reflect our belief
1	As long as we believe that all Americans , of every race and ethnic background , have common interests and can live together cooperatively , our political map should reflect our belief	Racial gerrymandering -- creating separate black and white districts -- says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people

2	Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process	In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected , the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions
5	In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected , the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions	It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements , such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office
8	As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions , the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section	The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies ( such as bonds ) are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction

8	The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders , too	They do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically
8	They do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically	Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur
2	That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will	In such an environment , a market maker can absorb huge losses
8	But the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale	they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly

5	We 're happy , we guess , to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets , five years after we started writing about it	Perhaps even the American apologists will now accede
2	Without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo	the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem
1	It 's not enough	If the Soviets want to be believed , they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious
6	If the Soviets want to be believed , they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious	Our own test of `` glasnost 's '' authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations -- the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk
2	The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there	The Pentagon 's recently issued `` Soviet Military Power repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment
1	Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet , the Soviet Union 's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat	We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze 's assurance last year that Krasnoyarsk did n't violate the ABM treaty
2	And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it	Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself
1	The U.S. government 's Sverdlovsk complaint , as with Krasnoyarsk , is no mere political posturing	Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate , and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government
1	The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or , alternatively , that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident	Until that happens , glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday

8	The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously	Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds
1	Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds	Northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million
1	In addition , Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years	Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on Seabrook operations and other contingencies
8	The company has filed an internal reorganization plan it valued at $ 2.2 billion that would require 5.5 % rate increases	That plan would leave existing preferred shareholders with at least a 41 % stake and give common shareholders as little as 13 %
2	that would require rate increases of only 4.8 % annually for seven years	The state of New Hampshire has favored that plan

2	State monopolies will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them	Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors , pesticides , fertilizers and feed

2	The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here	Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that Solidarity has barely started
5	We are dealing with real entrepreneurs	There are a lot of them
1	Polish peasants , spurning the collectivizers , were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists	Now , among Communist reformers , they are objects of envy

9	The pension 's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state	His allotment of materials also did
2	Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines	When supplies are short , it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain

5	But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991	Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult
6	and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance	The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required

1	and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad	An estimated $ 25.8 million is allocated to continue work in Oman
6	Closer to home , the negotiators were more generous	An estimated $ 38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G . Hefner , the House chairman
5	but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska , Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd ( D. , W.Va. ) even added report language listing $ 49.4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year
5	This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil	Mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations
8	In yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report , the company alluded to a $ 40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations	The report says that `` the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations
8	that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output	domestic exploration and production operations had a $ 16 million loss in the third quarter
5	Industrywide , oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year	Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year
6	Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified	One Mobil executive said that the $ 40 million charge related to the action indicates `` a substantial '' number of people will be involved

5	Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics	This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani
5	The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors , clients , bankers and others	This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division prohibiting Princeton/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases
2	that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process	prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are `` less intrusive '' alternatives , such as bonds , and in any case not to seek forfeitures `` disproportionate to the defendant 's crime
2	These changes come a tad late for Princeton/Newport , the first RICOed securities firm	It was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture
5	when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture	Princeton/Newport investors , including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment , made the rational decision to withdraw their money

2	So two cheers for the new rules	Justice has finally recognized its employees ' abuses , thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova , who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals
5	But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors	Judge Sentelle , of the appeals court in Washington , made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled , `` RICO : The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence
8	Judge Sentelle , of the appeals court in Washington , made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled , `` RICO : The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence	He said ours is supposed to be `` a government of laws not of men , '' and yet RICO defenders `` tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO
2	and yet RICO defenders `` tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO	No prosecutorial guidelines , observed or unobserved , limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages

8	that saw investors shifting assets from stocks to Treasury bonds	At its strongest , the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than a point , or more than $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount
2	the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable-goods orders and lackluster mid-October auto sales helped prop up the Treasury market	A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices
2	reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates	Now bond investors are looking toward next week 's report from national purchasing managers and the government 's October employment report as potentially prompting the Fed to lower rates

2	But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species	Are n't we , after all , the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution
8	His credentials are excellent for the task	Star lecturer at Harvard , author of numerous popular books on science , and scourge of the creationist lobby , Mr. Gould is perhaps the world 's most eminent evolutionary theorist
8	Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from Darwin	For him , natural history is anything but a gradual , predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness
1	For him , natural history is anything but a gradual , predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness	it is a careening , chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot
8	In `` Wonderful Life : The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History '' ( Norton , 326 pages , $ 19.95 ) , Mr. Gould makes his case for `` the awesome improbability of human evolution	The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale
2	Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the Burgess Shale , one Charles Doolittle Walcott	The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design , limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species
8	It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof.Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale	By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures , this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet
5	a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet	One was so fantastic in appearance , it was dubbed Hallucigenia

5	A good deal of the book is boring , particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text	These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like , `` Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma
8	Interest picks up , though , when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution	Not long after the appearance of life , evidently , there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth
2	Consequently , the winnowing process was like a lottery `` in which each group { held } a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues	So much for survival of the fittest
6	So much , too , for the notion that we humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle by evolving big brains	Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that did in the dinosaurs because they were small , not smart
8	If anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us , Mr. Gould sketches several	In one , birds are the dominant carnivores
7	In one , birds are the dominant carnivores	in another the seas abound with `` little penises

6	A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry	According to the state department of finance , a one-penny increase in the state 's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $ 3 billion
6	But observers expect broad support	If there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere , I think the attitude will be supportive , '' said Kirk West , president of the California Chamber of Commerce
2	But others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state 's earthquake relief tab	Since the late 1970s , California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as Proposition 13

2	Red tape is the bugaboo of small business	Ironically , the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active , results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal , state and local regulators

2	the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose	that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good , and even to their own businesses

2	When the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring , the nation 's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow	Ms. Bogart , an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein 's `` South Pacific , '' is decidedly downtown
8	She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season	It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht 's theoretical writings , called `` No Plays , No Poetry
5	Now , with the opening of Maxim Gorky 's bourgeois-bashing `` Summerfolk , '' Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table	Hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences
5	And `` Summerfolk is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers	Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances
5	Wisely Ms. Bogart has kept Gorky 's time and place intact	Despite the absence of samovars ( and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down ) , the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton , with boaters and fishing poles aplenty
2	But beyond this decorative nod to tradition , Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky 's naturalistic drama into something akin to , well , farce	The director 's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered
6	The director 's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered	Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them , but they often literally stand on their heads

1	SCI TV , which expects to release a plan to restructure $ 1.3 billion of debt in the next day or so , is n't just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt -- though it did do that	The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an LBO , a set of assets that were leveraged twice , enabling the blue-chip buy-out king Henry Kravis in 1987 to take more than $ 1 billion of cash out of the com- pany
9	SCI TV 's six stations once were part of Storer Communications	KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out

1	In an Oct. 10 editorial-page article , `` It 's the World Bank 's Turn to Adjust , '' Paul Craig Roberts lays most of the blame for what ails developing countries at the doorstep of the World Bank	The article is , unfortunately , replete with outrageous distortions
1	One of Mr. Roberts 's observations is that the Bank 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries	This is just not so
4	This is just not so	The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid
6	The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid	As of June 30 , 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1 % of the Bank 's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months
5	Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses	For the same fiscal year , by the way , the Bank 's net income was a robust $ 1.1 billion after provisions
1	Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development	Here , too , Mr. Roberts is way off the mark
2	Here , too , Mr. Roberts is way off the mark	The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years

6	There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs , traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups , are dwindling	More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers

8	Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , Litigation Sciences , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC , employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians	Twenty-one of its workers are Ph.D.s
5	Recently , Litigation Sciences helped Pennzoil Co. win a $ 10.5 billion jury verdict against Texaco Inc	It advised the National Football League in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League
5	Largely as a result , Litigation Sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years	Its 1988 revenue was $ 25 million
2	Meanwhile , competitors are being spawned almost daily ; some 300 new businesses -- many just one-person shops -- have sprung up	the industry 's total revenues approach $ 200 million
2	the industry 's total revenues approach $ 200 million	In any high-stakes case that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants
2	Despite their ubiquity , the consultants are n't entirely welcome	the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen

2	In the film classic `` Twelve Angry Men , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror 's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict	After hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity
2	After hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity	In real life , jurors may not always work that way , but some court observers question why they should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to
5	Litigation consulting is highly manipulative	The notion they try to sell is that juries do n't make decisions rationally
2	But the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally	I find it troubling
8	that consultants can be very effective	It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them
2	that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services	The affluent people and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals { in political cases } get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want
6	Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases	The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark
5	In that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg	The researchers discovered that Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants
2	The defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War	A more blue-collar panel became a second aim
8	Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case	Litigation consulting had arrived
10	The fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when International Business Machines Corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case	The problem for IBM trial lawyers Thomas Barr and David Boies was how to make such a highly technical case understandable
2	The problem for IBM trial lawyers Thomas Barr and David Boies was how to make such a highly technical case understandable	As the trial progressed , they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them
5	Thus , the `` shadow '' jury was born	Mr. Vinson , the professor , got the law bug and formed Litigation Sciences
5	Mr. Vinson , the professor , got the law bug and formed Litigation Sciences	IBM won the case
2	The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance	What you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it
2	when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it	A shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way
9	Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow	Just before the actual closing arguments , the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors , each of whom was being paid $ 150 a day
8	Just before the actual closing arguments , the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors , each of whom was being paid $ 150 a day	The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages
1	The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages	The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for Energy Transportation
8	It 's just like weather forecasting	It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer
2	Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work	Changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters
6	If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages , for example , depressed , underemployed people are far more likely to grant them	Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal
1	So would someone recently divorced or widowed	Since Litigation Sciences generally represents the defense , its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury
5	For personal-injury cases , Litigation Sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve	Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women
2	Litigation Sciences does n't make moral distinctions	If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help find them
2	If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help find them	We do n't control the facts.They are what they are
8	We do n't control the facts	They are what they are
2	But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ	In our system of advocacy , the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can
5	Once a jury is selected , the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation accordingly	Logic plays a minimal role here
4	Logic plays a minimal role here	More important are what LSI calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level
2	In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish	By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries
5	By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries	The ploy worked
2	The ploy worked	The defense won
8	In a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame	The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight
2	Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in Litigation Sciences ' operation	that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually
8	that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually	Computer-generated videos help

6	Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this	Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics

8	They may not have been able to articulate it all , but they did it	What you have here is intuition made manifest
5	Many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence	Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage
2	Litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome	that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions
5	Litigation Sciences concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions	A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services
6	Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick	The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co
0	For more than a decade , Mr. Etzioni , the sociologist , has been a leading critic of the masseurs	There 's no reason to believe that juries rule inappropriately
2	But the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better	What you then do is you make them think inappropriately
1	In most civil cases , judges allow each side three such challenges	For complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more
2	Mr. Etzioni also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors	Some courts release names and addresses , and researchers can drive by houses , look up credit ratings , and even question neighbors
6	Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact	Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning ( known as voir dire ) or giving out personal information about the jurors
2	Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning ( known as voir dire ) or giving out personal information about the jurors	The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective
5	One award is part of a Department of Defense contract to Loral Rolm Mil-Spec Computers and could be valued at more than $ 100 million over five years	The other involves the sale of about 35 of the company 's high-end workstations to the National Institutes of Health

8	which has been dubbed by some as `` motion-picture computing	This is a style of `` visual '' computing that provides three-dimensional , color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women 's fashion
6	In addition , the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices	A year ago , Silicon Graphics introduced a model priced at $ 15,000 -- almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features
8	Silicon Graphics also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future	It 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by 30 % to 40 % a year
2	Silicon Graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off	Revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 was $ 86.4 million , a 95 % increase over the year-ago period

5	They , or at least something less efficient than today 's thin-walled units , may soon be making a comeback	That something , whatever it is , could add as much as $ 100 to the $ 600 or so consumers now pay for lower-priced refrigerators
10	These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol , signed by 24 nations in 1987	In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs
2	In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs	World-wide production would be cut in half by 1998
5	The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0	Not to be outdone , George Bush wants CFCs banished altogether by the year 2000 , a goal endorsed at an 80-nation U.N. environmental meeting in Helsinki in the spring
2	That 's a lot of banishment , as it turns out	CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas , often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon , which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment
5	CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas , often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon , which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment	Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows , upholstery and insulation
5	Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows , upholstery and insulation	Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator , which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber
2	But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ 100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants , foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes , the Montreal Protocol 's legions of supporters say it is worth it	that CFCs are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays
8	I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems	In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently
8	But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in	We ca n't afford to wait
2	But does it have to be so soon	that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century
5	that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century	It 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S
2	and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture	The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure
6	and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture	The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure
0	The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure	What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year
0	Another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available , why not use them	Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the nonflammable , nontoxic CFCs
4	As it happens , Arthur D. Little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories	It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs
2	It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs	There is , after all , big money in environmentalism
2	Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing CFCs	Freon , introduced in 1930 , revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all
6	and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way	Du Pont , as it happens , has a potential substitute for CFCs
5	Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one , and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it	Japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets , of course
6	There are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise	Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it
5	Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it	University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy
2	University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy	They needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts
2	In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few	That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency

8	In 17 central states lawmakers adopted only three of 46 bills mandating health coverage or parental leave	The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which Gov . James Thompson vetoed , and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams
1	Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants	Similar proposals were defeated in at least 15 other states
8	But small business , which generally detests government-mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes	It 's just a matter of time before the tide turns
6	Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps to counter mandated leaves	In Pennsylvania , small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative
5	Triggering the re-examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees	The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under $ 25,000 and consulting and temporary services -- which often go to the smaller concerns

2	City officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last Tuesday 's earthquake	The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people , severed the Bay Bridge , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101 , the biggest artery to the south
8	mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50 % more passengers than normal	For the first time in memory , it was standing-room only in BART 's sleek , modern railcars
2	Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations	In the best of times , the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more
6	Not that getting into town was easy	Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway , and many commuters had to find rides to BART 's stations , because parking lots were full before dawn

8	It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had	It looks like a holiday
2	It looks like a holiday	a lot of people got scared and stayed home
1	At the San Mateo Bridge , which connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved	Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated
2	There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role	The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush

8	that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last	about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate
2	Well , mankind can rest easier for now	Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania-based computer , he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected
8	And when Mr. Kasparov strode into the playing hall , he called the outcome	As if he were Iron Mike , about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling , he declared : `` I 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years
8	a thorough study of dozens of its games including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S	Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed
2	Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed	The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top
1	The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T . 's strong points	Its chief builder , Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions
8	they needed kryptonite	This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov , proceeded
3	This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov , proceeded	No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones
9	But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly	Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , D.T . made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13
5	Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , D.T . made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13 ; then it put a knight offside on move 16	Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers
9	By move 21 , D.T . had fallen into a deep positional trap	It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T . 's knights
2	By move 21 , D.T . had fallen into a deep positional trap.It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T . 's knights	Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights , but in this case Mr. Kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and D.T . 's surviving bishop was reduced to passivity
6	Consistently , D.T . was over-optimistic about its chances	When most spectators thought its position hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down
2	He also launched a kingside storm , sacrificing a pawn to denude D.T . 's king	No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T
2	No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T	A piece down , the computer resigned
2	In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems	In such positions you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able to do that right now
2	After only 11 moves for each side , the computer 's position was shaky	Greedily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack
1	And when a defensive move was called for , D.T . passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats	that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move
6	Now , after only a dozen moves , spectators were looking for a mating combination	On a demonstration board , emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice
2	Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly	He won D.T . 's queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation , in this position , to give the computer much hope
8	In both games I got exactly what I wanted	What he had demonstrated is that there 's more to chess than sheer calculation
10	It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly	Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 %
2	Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 %	The CD seemed like a great deal
2	More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market	Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium
9	Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured	This is one thing I was never aware of
4	This is one thing I was never aware of	He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000
2	Dr. Blumenfeld is n't unique	Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk
8	Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things	The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in
1	he did n't fully understand what he was buying	that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs ( Treasury Income Growth Receipts ) , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch
5	The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York	Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale
5	If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market . . . is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference . . . is not insured	Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant
4	part of what he paid was a premium	I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD
2	It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation	There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks
8	There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks	We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made
0	Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years	Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986
5	Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total	that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs
2	You always have to watch out for yourself	No one else will watch out for you
1	Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers	If you want to be a player , you have to be in America , Europe and the Far East
5	If you want to be a player , you have to be in America , Europe and the Far East	You must have world-class brands , a long-term perspective and deep pockets
2	But the shift has also been fueled by necessity	While premium-brand spirits like Smirnoff vodka and Jack Daniel 's whiskey are riding high in the U.S. , domestic spirits consumption fell 15 % to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979

0	Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates , leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said Stephen R. Hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer	He declined to make a specific earnings estimate
5	Third-quarter net was $ 40 million , or $ 1.04 a share , from $ 54.4 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year ago	Sales rose 2.8 % to $ 864.1 million , from $ 840.4 million
2	The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do	he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ 5.70 a share , from his previous estimate of $ 6.10

5	For the nine months , net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $ 17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $ 170.6 million , or $ 4.54 a share , up 5.8 % from $ 161.3 million , or $ 4.32 a share , a year ago	Eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier
5	The conference was entitled `` Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection , '' a significant departure from East Bloc usage , which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior	Even more remarkably , it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution , notwithstanding Poland 's lack of functioning markets
5	According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey Institute , 27 areas containing a third of Poland 's population are regarded as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards	Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions
5	27 areas containing a third of Poland 's population are regarded as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards.Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions	Four-fifths of Poland 's soils have become highly acidified
5	27 areas containing a third of Poland 's population are regarded as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards.Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions.Four-fifths of Poland 's soils have become highly acidified ; 70 % of its southern forests are projected to die by century 's end	Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled
5	Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe	Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average
5	Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe.Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average	Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP
1	Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West	They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions
2	Indeed , skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference : `` The world must be coming to an end	The Russians are talking peace The Palestinians are talking elections And the Poles are engaged in commerce
10	The Russians are talking peace	The Palestinians are talking elections
7	The Russians are talking peace	The Palestinians are talking elections
8	But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year	Those implications include : -- Privatization
1	Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance	Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries
5	As conferees noted , scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms	That means simple , clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk
2	Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars	New types of financing must make funds available without draining Poland 's hard-currency reserves
2	East Bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets	While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information
5	The drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an 0.7 % slide by the Nasdaq composite index	It finished at 467.22 , down 3.45
10	Mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index of the OTC 's largest non-financial issues dropped 4.58 to 457.52	The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking issues lost 2.38 to 458.32
8	It 's a quiet retreat	It 's nothing dramatic , just a routine sell-off
6	It 's nothing dramatic , just a routine sell-off	Some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies

2	Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon	It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do
8	It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do	It 's that we do n't want to
5	And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests	These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them
5	But what do we mean , specifically , by `` creativity	No one can say
1	No one can say	In practice , it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression '' that encourages the youngsters ' `` self-esteem
2	The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children	It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive
2	Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands	Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy
8	The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated	Progressive education '' ( as it was once called ) is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction
5	It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy	I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher
1	I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher	They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses
2	But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment	and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching
1	and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching	They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition
1	But they need not be to do their jobs well	Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days
2	But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious	In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor
2	In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor	If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place
1	If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place	If he is competent and conscientious , he serves us well
2	Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis	Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem
8	Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem	they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more
1	they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more	It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes
5	But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials	If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it
2	If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do	There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message
2	Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand	We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking
2	In this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned	They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap
1	Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov . Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five	A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need
2	A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need	What Gov . Clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years
1	What Gov . Clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years	Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program
5	Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program	that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away
2	Parental involvement '' is a bad idea	Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children
1	Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children	Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school
8	Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school	They should see to it that their kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card
5	They should see to it that their kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card	If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another
8	Here , the experience of New York City is decisive	Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians
2	Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians	New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance
4	Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils	The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers
2	The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers	There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century educational performance has declined
2	There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century educational performance has declined	That is the way the system works
1	Students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows	No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago
2	The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd	The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential
0	to realize their full academic potential	No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential
2	It is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them , alas , out of print -- rather than newer ones	The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial
5	The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial	They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience
6	They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience	One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods
2	Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline	Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head
5	Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head	With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability
8	Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head.With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability	Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance

5	he believes IBM 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology	he expects IBM to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months
2	IBM 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing	Rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors , IBM is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs

5	As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits	As interest rates paid depositors were lowered , thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 5.1 billion , not including interest credited to accounts
8	some of the outflow to seasonal factors	August is a month when people are paying school tuition
5	August is a month when people are paying school tuition	That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry
5	The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year	Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink
1	For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion	For the prior year , deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ 8.8 billion
2	The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth	Since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor , underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics
1	evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates	The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period , but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated
4	This bias is in no way deliberate	The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data
0	This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor	In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s
2	In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s	Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector , this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year , on average
1	The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well	Independent estimates of output in those industries , including one by the Department of Labor for banking , suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5 % a year between 1948 and 1988
2	that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5 % a year between 1948 and 1988	Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year
8	The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes	that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product
6	Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services	In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed
1	In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP	For the private domestic business economy , the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point
2	Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts	The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective

6	Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico	Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state
2	the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri	they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel
5	Officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel	They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked
5	it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt	It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network
8	I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions	I can see both sides
1	I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses	There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them
5	more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million	By the end of this week , Drexel should have another three to four settlements
2	That total would be important for Drexel	The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry.A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday
1	The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry	A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday
5	New Jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused	The state is n't ruling out revoking Drexel 's brokerage license
5	Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license	It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters
8	This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market	Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here
5	Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties	Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so
8	This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business	We need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again
8	Time Warner emphasized in a news release that it should be evaluated based on its cash flow , which the company defined as earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization	On a pro-forma basis , assuming the merger was effective Jan 1 , 1988 , including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner , that cash flow figure would be $ 526 million for the latest quarter , more than double the comparable figure a year ago , or $ 242 million , according to Time Warner
2	Some analysts at least are buying that argument , and were n't alarmed by the losses	What really matters is the operating income of the divisions
5	For example , Warner made more than $ 100 million from filmed entertainment in three months	That 's a big number
5	In the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42 a share	Combined revenue for the latest quarter of Time Warner was $ 2.2 billion , compared with the year-ago Time revenue of $ 1.1 billion
5	On a pro forma basis , including all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compared with a $ 342 million loss a year earlier	On the same basis , revenue rose to $ 2.7 billion from $ 2.2 billion
5	For the third quarter , Warner 's $ 106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cents a share	Revenue rose to $ 1.5 billion from $ 1.1 billion
6	Time Warner 's operating earnings got a boost from Warner 's record box-office results	Batman '' alone has racked up more than $ 247 million in box-office receipts to date , making it Warner Bros. ' largest grossing film ever

2	Lloyd 's , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation	The 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters
2	At the same time , Lloyd 's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business	The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors
2	Lloyd 's is on the ropes	It needs more discipline
8	It needs more discipline	It needs to sort itself out
8	Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of `` names , '' the well-heeled investors ( some of them royal ) who , as members of about 360 syndicates , underwrite policies	Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year , more than triple the number of resignations in 1987
5	Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year , more than triple the number of resignations in 1987	Names are resigning at an even faster pace this year

7	The average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which results are available , was 6.5 % , according to Chatset Ltd. , an insurance consulting firm in London	In 1985 , it was 2.1 %
2	Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability	Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe

8	Lloyd 's is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance	Over the past decade , competitors have chipped away at the exchange 's share of the # 2.5 billion marine market in London , where half the world 's ships are insured
10	At the peak of its power and influence a century ago , Lloyd 's dominated the insurance world with a 50 % stake	It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe
5	Today , Lloyd 's share of the world market , excluding life insurance , is about 2 %	Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included
2	Today , Lloyd 's share of the world market , excluding life insurance , is about 2 % .

5	Bigger rivals , such as Aetna and Allianz , backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates	Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business
5	Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage	Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged
2	Thus Lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition	Lloyd 's has lost control of the situation
8	Lloyd 's has lost control of the situation	They are n't controlling their destiny like they used to
8	the exchange faces big challenges	This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead
2	By that , he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance	The exchange must find new products and new markets

1	reported profit will be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be	the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $ 600 million in aviation losses ( including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland ) and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo
2	the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently about # 11 billion	the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names
6	Meanwhile , the exchange has been trying to lower costs	It recently cut its work force by 9 % , or 213

1	Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers	Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada
2	But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented	The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand

5	In Japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one	The title of chief executive officer is n't used
2	While people within Daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that Mr . Dozen , 52 , would eventually become Daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many	It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive was appointed deputy president

5	All of Japan 's so-called Big Four securities firms have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets	While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the U.S

5	When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors	He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end
6	By his own account , Mr . Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds	how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc. , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues.But he could n't sell any

Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors

2	For a brief time , the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United 's pilot union	In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted
5	That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out	As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft
1	As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft	It 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement
5	The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United 's pilot and machinist unions	The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction
2	The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union	The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out
8	The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out	They paid $ 15 million for a 1 % stake and received an additional 9 % of the company at no additional cost
2	His credibility is also on the line in the investment community	Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines

8	In a startling turnabout , Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them	David Boren , the Intelligence Committee chairman , is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination
2	With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public service	If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega , the American people ought to know
5	If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega , the American people ought to know	What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry
1	What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry	Naturally , Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity
1	The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega	When they did , his commanders did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads
7	For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations	What part did U.S. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody , but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops
1	What part did U.S. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody , but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops	Mr. Noriega did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol
2	Mr. Noriega did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol	Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning : You have the right to conceal your coup intentions , because we may rat on you
5	CIA chief William Webster , hardly a Washington malcontent , got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup	The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point
8	but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point	The interpretation '' of the executive order and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including me
2	In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA	The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter
6	And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties	Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North
8	Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North	The Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , Senator William Cohen , joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra , deploring `` Men of Zeal
2	No doubt many people in the CIA , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it	What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail
8	What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail	Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play
2	The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action	President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America 's national security
2	President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America 's national security	There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars
2	but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars	The world being the nasty place it is , we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed
2	The world being the nasty place it is , we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed	In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility
2	The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral	As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi
8	The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral	As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi
5	As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi	It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal
8	It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal	Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him

5	At age 19 , she was a Paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade	It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas
8	but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible	I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than Josephine 's
5	Men were a constant complication	Baker had lots of them
6	But she did n't trust them and did n't reward trust	As she saw one key love affair , the problem was n't her infidelity , it was his jealousy
2	Her appetite for children also was large	She adopted 12 of assorted races
2	She made money , but spent more	Friends pitched in
1	Another lifelong complication was racism	Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris , where blacks had become exotic
6	where blacks had become exotic	African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks
2	African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks	To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world

9	One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end , '' Ms. Rose writes	Ms. Rose quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous
2	Still , even the title raises questions about the author 's vision of her subject	Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term
5	Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term	To find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with Cleopatra , requires an equal stretch
5	During World War II , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens	She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle 's cause , accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France

8	But Manville 's ownership is unusual	The Denver-based concern is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust
2	Their principal asset is Manville common stock	If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail
4	If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail	What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares
5	However , the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims	Its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989
1	And , beginning in 1992 , it will have a claim on as much as 20 % of Manville 's annual net income	Even so , the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch
2	Even so , the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch	As of June 30 , it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims , for an average of $ 40,424 each
1	As of June 30 , it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims , for an average of $ 40,424 each	The average should drop over time , since the most expensive claims are being settled first
2	And as of midyear , settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ 136 million -- more than half the trust 's total of $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities	At some point , we 're going to need an infusion of funds
2	Even before then , the trust may be eager to unload Manville stock	It does n't pay a dividend , and this trust needs income
2	Moreover , with 88 % of its assets tied up in Manville , the trust is badly in need of diversification	Obviously , a diversified portfolio would have less risk
8	Manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring	Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured
2	whether there is a better way to be structured	that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares
8	Thus the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville 's other shareholders	This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders
1	Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long-term	Its stock , at 9 5/8 , trades at about 8 1/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers
5	Its stock , at 9 5/8 , trades at about 8 1/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers	45 % of revenues are tied to construction

5	that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price	The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5 % a year , which would be payable to the fund after five years , according to Stephen E. Roulac , a real estate consultant working for the fund
8	hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio	Real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ 71.9 million from $ 143 million a year earlier
1	The realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors , among other possibilities	The Santa Fe Pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect , saying the deal was still under negotiation
8	but under a previously announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California , Arizona and the Chicago area	Among those are the 1,850 acres in the San Francisco Bay area , including 208 acres in the Mission Bay area
2	The California pension fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development	The fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash flow now topping $ 3 billion a year
5	but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago	JMB officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the Santa Fe Pacific Realty board , Mr. Roulac said , to insulate the fund from potential liability problems
9	After two mistrials , the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman , James T. Sherwin , have changed considerably	The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations
5	The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government 's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian	Mr. Jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing
2	But GAF 's bellwether role was short-lived	The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document
5	The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document	After 93 hours of deliberation , the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked , and another mistrial was declared on March 22
9	Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June	A month later , Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government
9	A month later , Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government	In August , Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts
2	Nevertheless , the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the GAF case	The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo
8	The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo	For Mr. Sherwin , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count
5	For Mr. Sherwin , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count	GAF faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count
0	that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman	Neither testified at the previous trials
6	For now , defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans	As we go in for the third time , Yogi Berra 's famous line is apt : ` It 's deja vu all over again
8	The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other	Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $ 2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan . The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims
1	It also bars future suits against Robins company officials , members of the Robins family and Robins 's former insurer , Aetna Life & Casualty Co	The latter provision is `` legally unprecedented
5	Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts	American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted

2	in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs	The posters were sold for $ 1,300 to $ 6,000 , although the government says they had a value of only $ 53 to $ 200 apiece

8	And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously	Unless the questions are answered , I will keep on going

6	Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open	Early in his political career , as a city councilman in San Antonio , he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced , denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a `` bat-roost meeting

1	At the time , Mr. Gonzalez said several senators told him that they `` could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn 's insistence on Wall	Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway , under the guise of the Lincoln investigation

1	The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive	Because the Soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars , marks and other Western currencies , companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction
6	International competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up , however	West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items

5	For many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating	This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take years before it 's over
5	In the third quarter , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so	Since the end of last year , junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds , including ultra-safe Treasury securities

5	Mr. McDuffie 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works	Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin 's direction , this `` Serenade '' really swings
1	Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin 's direction , this `` Serenade '' really swings	Mr. Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment , meanders until the propulsive `` Agitato , fervente
1	At Avery Fisher Hall here , Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare -- Bruch 's overwrought `` Violin Concerto in G Minor	His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed
5	His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed	The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big , lush sound that belied its size
6	Whatever he plays , Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife , Camille , a literary publicist	A normal person did not write the Beethoven ` Violin Concerto
5	A normal person did not write the Beethoven ` Violin Concerto	Even when I hear it played badly , I 'm still humbled by the piece
2	Even when I hear it played badly , I 'm still humbled by the piece	If I could ever feel I 've contributed to it in some way , then all the hard work has been worth it
2	A lot of observers think so , and , if they 're right , the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt	A sudden , forced cutback by consumers would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments ca n't readily take up the slack
6	The worriers cite some worrisome trends	During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion , inflation-adjusted gross national product , disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30 % , but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66 %
8	However , these figures do n't seem to worry Thomas A. Durkin , an economist at the Federal Reserve Board	In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco , Mr. Durkin comments that `` installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances , and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences
5	that `` installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances , and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences	We are now witnessing a slowdown which , if history is a guide , could persist for a while
1	But what about the debt burden	that `` there is some magic level '' at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income `` indicates economic problems
8	The chart below shows why ( see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 )	The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income , though up a bit , has n't climbed steeply , and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed
2	Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier	that some `` revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit '' being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing

8	And much home-equity credit is used conservatively	The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the value of the property
2	that consumers , conservative as ever , are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly	In July , consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987
5	but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family	There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group
8	There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group	We are a vanishing breed
6	The company sells image	Its current ad campaign does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like Christopher Reeve , star of the `` Superman '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons
2	The Maidenform name `` is part of American pop culture	Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I . . . in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The Maidenform woman.You never know where she 'll turn up
2	The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly { Maidenform } is a force to be reckoned with	Although working women are `` forced to wear the uniform of the day , to retain their femininity they are buying better quality , more upscale intimate apparel
9	Although Mr. Brawer 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising	Three days later , Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co. , a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc
1	that after spending 24 years at Maidenform , Mr. Lesk , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job	If you want the presidency of the company , this is n't the firm to work for
6	Top officers insist Maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership	You ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart , '' one delights
5	You ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart , '' one delights	It is fun competing as a private company , '' Mr. Brawer says
2	It is fun competing as a private company	You can think long range
6	Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way	Warnaco was taken private by Spectrum Group in 1986 for about $ 487 million
5	Buy-out offers for Maidenform are n't infrequent but they are n't taken very seriously	When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. Coleman
2	The company could command a good price in the market	Over the past three and a half years , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have been bought at about 60 % of sales
5	Mr. Brawer , along with Mrs. Coleman and her daughter , Elizabeth , an attorney who is vice chairman , are the family members involved in the operations of Maidenform , which employs about 5,000	Mr. Brawer 's wife , Catherine , and Robert Stroup , Elizabeth 's husband , round out the five-member board
6	Executives say Mrs. Coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations , especially product development	In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales
2	While the company has always been family-run , Mr. Brawer is n't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head Maidenform	Mrs. Coleman 's husband , Joseph , a physician , succeeded Mrs. Rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968

5	A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports	The $ 14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much
5	But before import growth slowed , China 's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves	The $ 14 billion level in June marked a drop from $ 19 billion at the end of April
9	The $ 14 billion level in June marked a drop from $ 19 billion at the end of April	China 's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $ 10.6 billion in June 1985 from $ 16.6 billion the previous September
8	For example , China 's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4	Revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $ 1.3 billion , down from $ 2.2 billion last year
9	In one , imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25 % and 5 % recorded during the first seven months , and the current-account deficit widens to $ 13.1 billion	In 1985 , China had a record deficit of $ 11.4 billion
5	But since June , foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to China	Even if borrowing resumes , commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before
6	With less capital coming in , China 's balance of payments would suffer	The Western government report 's first scenario assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment
7	The Western government report 's first scenario assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment	In the second , foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10 % and investment to drop 10 %
8	But in either case , the report says , China 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves , which are used to finance the imbalance	In the first scenario , the reserves would be exhausted next year , and in the second they would be wiped out in 1991
2	Ralph Brown was 31,000 feet over Minnesota when both jets on his Falcon 20 flamed out	At 18,000 feet he and his co-pilot `` were looking for an interstate or a cornfield '' to land
1	But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs , Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time	Had he been a little less gung-ho , `` I 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the nearest bar
8	But he flies for Federal Express Corp. , perhaps the closest thing in corporate America to the Green Berets	Federal 's employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock
5	Like Mr. Brown , they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal : delivering the goods on time	They are a tribute to Federal 's management which , since the company 's founding 16 years ago , has had its way with its work force -- an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry
2	That may soon change	This month , Federal 's 2,048 pilots , including some 961 acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February , will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent
2	This month , Federal 's 2,048 pilots , including some 961 acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February , will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent	The election , which would bring the first major union to Federal 's U.S. operations , has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown
1	A union , sooner or later , has to have an adversary , and it has to have a victory	In our formula , we do n't have any losers except the competition
2	What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots	Under federal transportation law , a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger 's job classifications into Federal's.Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers

5	He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and , as a perk , fly free in empty cockpit seats	He gives pep talks in periodic `` family briefings '' beamed internationally on `` FXTV , '' the company 's own television network
6	And , with many of his 70,000 workers , Mr. Smith 's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on	James Cleveland , a courier who earned a Bravo Zulu for figuring out how to get a major customer 's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m. , considers himself far more than a courier
2	James Cleveland , a courier who earned a Bravo Zulu for figuring out how to get a major customer 's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m. , considers himself far more than a courier	We do n't just hand the customer the package

2	We do n't just hand the customer the package	That 's just the beginning
4	That 's just the beginning	In essence , we run the show
2	This is America	Nobody has the right to tell me how much I can work
8	but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean	The company deliberately understaffs , stretching employees ' schedules to the limit
2	The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc. , the nation 's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members	UPS wo n't discuss its labor practices , but , according to Mr. Cleveland , a former UPS employee , and others , union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans
2	but , according to Mr. Cleveland , a former UPS employee , and others , union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans	Because UPS drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late
2	Labor problems are the last thing Mr. Smith needs right now	Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be , it also has brought problems
6	Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be , it also has brought problems	It more than doubled Federal 's long-term debt to $ 1.9 billion , thrust the company into unknown territory -- heavy cargo -- and suddenly expanded its landing rights to 21 countries from four
2	Federal , on its own , had n't been doing very well overseas	It had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into Asia , where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half-empty on certain routes

7	It had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into Asia , where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half-empty on certain routes.On routes to South America , the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were grounded	In Europe , business suffered as Federal bought several local companies , only to have the managers quit
8	Earnings have plummeted , too , in each of the past three quarters	In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 , profit fell 54 % to $ 30.4 million , or 58 cents a share , mostly because of the Tiger merger
8	Federal 's stock price , however , has held up well , driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks	Since trading as low as $ 42.25 a share in May , Federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ 57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
5	Since trading as low as $ 42.25 a share in May , Federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ 57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading	They closed Friday at $ 53.25 , down 50 cents on the day
2	There 's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase	Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies `` over the Hump '' from India to China during World War II
9	Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies `` over the Hump '' from India to China during World War II	In the early 1970s , Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger 's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations
8	it will pay off eventually	Federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28
1	Analysts expect Federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28 , when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger 's extra flights , back-up planes and landing rights	Until then , they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits
2	For now , the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal 's Tiger problems	Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination
6	Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination	When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes , he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority
2	That sort of approach , however , has n't worked since the addition of Tiger	Its 6,500 workers , who had battled Tiger 's management for years over givebacks , were union members until the day of the merger , when most of their unions were automatically decertified
1	Soon after the merger , moreover , Federal 's management asked Tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time , without cause or notice	When the pilots refused , the company retracted it
2	Mr. Smith angered Federal 's pilots , too	In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August , Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago : that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options
4	that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options	The Tiger merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure
8	his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat	A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith
5	Mr. Smith and other top Federal executives have met with Tiger workers in Los Angeles , Ohio , New York , Alaska , Asia and Europe	Recently , they have appeared every few weeks in talk-show type videos , countering pro-union arguments

1	our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice	It does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change

3	Already , the fight has been costly	The seniority-list controversy , along with the job-classification dispute , has been turned over to the mediator
6	The issue has also cost Federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots	They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says William Queenan , a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran
7	They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says William Queenan , a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran	Adds John Poag , a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board : `` They 've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots , and for us , nothing
2	Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote	A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union , according to a union study.But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed , it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded
6	The fight has turned ugly and , among pilots at least , has shattered the esprit de corps that Mr. Smith worked so hard to build	Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties
5	Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties	Some younger pilots say they have had to endure anti-union harangues by senior pilots while flying across the country
6	And for now , at least , the competition is n't the only enemy	he has received two anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague
8	he has received two anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague	The pilots are either for us or extremely against us

8	on charges of which a jury had acquitted him	In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him

5	He was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation	The Senate did n't vote on six lesser charges
9	Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes , then quickly left the chamber	In an impromptu news conference on the Capitol steps , he denounced the senators ' action
5	Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers ' teaching regarding impeachment	For the future he would run for governor of Florida

ET ) , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI

One more word and you are out on a park bench , mister
8	In fact , throughout `` Mancuso FBI , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches	Witnesses shout , scream , pontificate : `` . . . a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try to tear down every decent man who raises his voice

10	The Dallas Cowboys are looking at a long-yardage situation , struggling to pull ahead of the Atlanta Falcons	Up in his stadium box , their new and controversial owner , Jerral `` Jerry '' Jones , watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line
2	Mr. Jones takes heart	There in the center of the pack is quarterback Troy Aikman , the key to the Cowboys ' comeback strategy
5	So key , in fact , that Mr. Jones signed him in April for $ 11.4 million over the next six years	He 's a genuine Wheaties-box athlete
2	With three minutes left on the clock , Mr. Aikman takes the snap , steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an Atlanta defensive back	The crowd groans , Mr. Jones shakes his head , the Cowboys lose the game
9	the Cowboys lose the game	A few days after that Sept. 17 game , Mr. Aikman broke a finger
8	For Mr. Jones , losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the Dallas Cowboys	Once fat and happy , the Cowboys now are losing games , fans and money
6	Once fat and happy , the Cowboys now are losing games , fans and money	Last year , the team ended up $ 2 million in the red on $ 30 million in revenue
2	These days , he is n't alone	Nearly half the owners of the 28 National Football League teams are losing money
5	Last year , the top 12 players on each NFL team took home an average $ 536,000 , a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball	First-round draft picks have done even better

8	First-round draft picks have done even better	Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ 685,000 this year , up 44 % from 1987
8	It 's a vicious circle	One team pays so much and the other pays more
6	All this is causing convulsions in professional football	Owners , largely complacent in the past , are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue

2	For Mr. Jones , it was just the beginning	He quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half , shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and , in July , announced plans to sell Valley Ranch , the team 's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL
5	the team 's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL	Mr. Jones calls the ranch `` the Pentagon of Sportdom

5	It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms , elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer , more free-spending era	He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit , took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help
8	and called the front desk for help	I said , ` Somebody come get me
2	With a new day dawning on the sport , Mr. Jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury	It 's just not cost efficient
8	It 's just not cost efficient	The place costs nearly $ 2 million a year to maintain
2	And as for Tom Landry , well he had played out his winning years	After posting losing seasons in each of the last three years , the Cowboys needed a change
8	Football has long been Mr. Jones 's passion , both on and off the field	An Arkansas native , he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 University of Arkansas team that won a national championship
9	An Arkansas native , he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 University of Arkansas team that won a national championship	After college , he worked at his father 's insurance company in Little Rock , and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the San Diego Chargers
9	After college , he worked at his father 's insurance company in Little Rock	Years later , with cash from the sale of the insurance company , he founded Arkoma Production Corp. , an oil and gas exploration company based in Little Rock
8	So it was n't surprising that Mr. Jones returned to his Arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr. Landry	He tapped Jimmy Johnson , a teammate on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad and the head coach at the University of Miami
5	Whatever Mr. Johnson 's talents , in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans , he is no Tom Landry	Seven games ( and , after a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday , seven losses ) into the season , the `` new '' Cowboys are n't doing any better than the old
5	In fact , the last time they played this badly was in 1960 , their opening season	Average attendance at their games , about 49,000 last year , continues flat
6	Mr. Jones is attacking the problem on several fronts	He continues to reshuffle the team , trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks
7	He continues to reshuffle the team , trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks	To try to draw more fans , he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $ 25 to $ 19

6	The biggest is the NFL 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games	Last year , the Cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ 17.6 million
5	The team additionally earns between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights	Mr. Jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights
5	Mr. Jones is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days	He calls the contracts `` critical to winning in the NFL '' and has played his part in the bidding wars
8	and has played his part in the bidding wars	Besides signing Mr. Aikman to a sizable contract , Mr. Jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback Steve Walsh $ 4.1 million over the next four years
2	This wage inflation is bleeding the NFL dry	Soon , only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams
8	To tackle the problem , NFL owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries	but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability
5	but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability	Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance
6	The owners are trying to boost profit in other ways , too	Many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts
2	and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts	Most of the owners must pay up to 10 % of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old
2	We have the worst lease in the NFL	We 're in a metro area with millions of Bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated
2	We 're in a metro area with millions of Bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated	When the lease expires in 1999 It 's got to be changed

8	The changes have n't come easy	Like the game of professional football , the NFL organization itself is in turmoil
2	Like the game of professional football , the NFL organization itself is in turmoil	The new breed of team owner , Mr. Jones included , has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs , and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock

2	In July , 11 NFL owners , almost all of them new , blocked an effort to install Jim Finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner Pete Rozelle	Mr. Finks is perceived by some owners as a standard-bearer for the Old Guard
2	Earlier this month , another effort to choose a commissioner failed	The owners meet again tomorrow
8	and his work style seems to support that	He puts in busy six-day weeks ( excluding game days ) , and on one recent afternoon fielded questions , in the course of an hour , from a TV producer , his luxury-suite marketing manager , a disgruntled customer and a roomful of Arkansas reporters
5	He puts in busy six-day weeks	To keep his schedule on track , he flies two personal secretaries in from Little Rock to augment his staff in Dallas
8	When I made this investment , I made it on a lifetime basis	I 'm not here to make money by reselling the team later on
2	I 'm not here to make money by reselling the team later on	they ca n't be in the future
8	Besides , to a large extent , Mr. Jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team , even though it keeps losing	Owning the Cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in Arkansas just did n't provide
6	Owning the Cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in Arkansas just did n't provide	There is the new private jet , the platoon of assistants , invitations to the best parties , and television appearances on shows such as `` Prime Time Live

10	How interestingly clever of Robert Goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of `` Days of Rage '' in his television critique ( Leisure & Arts , Sept 11	He chastises Jo Franklin-Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism , judging her project as `` intellectually slipshod
1	One example he gives : `` She did n't ask '' ( why the Palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones	Really now , did she have to ask
5	Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment	of course the Israelis feel put upon
1	Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment	of course the Israelis feel put upon
2	But his complaint that `` Days of Rage '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant	It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are
2	Well , `` Days of Rage '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning	Every issue is multisided
2	Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget	That would give agencies `` less ability . . . to fudge over things
6	But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted	In a July 6 letter to the Senate Securities Subcommittee , First Boston Corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate
6	Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible	An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill
8	Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate	Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity

2	In fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara 's famous linkages of art , idealism and revolution seem modest	It is on behalf of these people , and out of my real respect for them , that I am responding to Mr. Asman 's opinions of their country
2	Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel , the army and the Cuban people	They are not interchangeable
2	They are not interchangeable , since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances	It is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people
2	We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom	Without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years

2	The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general	There are no facts { behind the assertions } that we sent any kind of signal
6	The comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think Japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets	A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another

6	That 's higher than some other estimates	Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah , Kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day
2	Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge	Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market
2	Under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC 's production ceiling than they would under the current system	If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at 105 % of capacity
6	In the end politics got in the way	Libya accepted Iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with Kuwait

9	The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the Embarcadero Freeway	Until it was closed Tuesday , it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District
2	The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that `` we were incredibly lucky	While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage

0	The Bakersfield Supermarket went out of business last May	The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs
4	Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan	The business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers
8	In his first year of operating the store he bought for $ 220,000 , Mr. Ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint	The first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside.The second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged

5	that almost 2 % of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople	Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers
1	Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem	Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture
5	Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem	Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture
8	Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture	While by no means the highest crime community in the country , New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development
8	A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface , a policy research organization	It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses
8	and analyzed 353 responses	The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job
5	The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job	Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed
5	Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed	Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving
5	More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises	In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year
5	In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year	Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average
8	Two decades ago , the Small Business Administration reported Yale Prof.Albert Reiss 's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records	He found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones
5	The New York study 's companies averaged 27 employees	their annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 , with an additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security
8	Whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury	After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives
6	After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives	One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises
8	the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls `` crime causing poverty	Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents.Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses
8	Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime	that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees
2	The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments	Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places
2	Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants	In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection
2	In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection	This creates several problems
8	One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses	The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents
1	The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents	Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves
5	A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms	Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive
2	A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms	Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive
2	Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas	For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits
5	For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits	Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density
2	I think this repeal was kind of a thoughtless action , as a matter of fact	They will have to revisit this issue
8	Stock funds , like the market as a whole , generally dropped more than 2 % in the week through last Thursday , according to figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc	That reflects the huge drop a week ago Friday , last Monday 's rebound and the dips and blips that followed
8	But several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market 's slide	Funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds
8	It 's like kicking the tires of a car	What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car going to perform
7	Gold-oriented funds , for instance posted an average decline of 1.15 %	Flexible portfolio funds declined at about half the rate of stock funds
1	Gold-oriented funds , for instance posted an average decline of 1.15 %	Flexible portfolio funds declined at about half the rate of stock funds
2	Global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25 % of their portfolios outside the U.S	This gives them the added benefits of international diversification
8	there 's also a price to pay	A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot
7	By comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19 % , while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17 %	Fixed-income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen just 4.55 % , on average

8	That 's the problem with trying to hedge too much	You do n't make any real money
5	The $ 4 million Monetta Fund , for instance , was the seventh top performing fund for the week , with a 2.65 % return	Its return so far this year has been a credible 21.71 %
2	The fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates 30 % over its cost	By the time the market plummeted 10 days ago , Monetta was 55 % in cash
9	By the time the market plummeted 10 days ago , Monetta was 55 % in cash	Last Monday , he started `` buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices
2	the fund was about half invested in government bonds on Oct. 13 , and about 10 % in cash	In a downward market , bonds act better
5	there 's a lot of unsettlement in this market	interest rates will continue to trend lower
6	giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak	From its high point on Thursday , Oct. 12 , to where it traded late in New York a week later , the dollar fell 3.6 % against the West German mark , 3.4 % against the British pound and 2.1 % against the Japanese yen
2	Three International Cash Portfolios funds were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week	Because the funds ' investments are denominated in foreign currencies , their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar
2	But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies , as it did for much of this year , the dollar value of these funds declines	All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date
2	The small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign	that what happened last week `` may not be enough of an adjustment
2	that what happened last week `` may not be enough of an adjustment	There 's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness
2	But investors do n't seem to think so	that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th
8	that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th	it had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into its stock funds last week

8	Look how much air is moving around	The ventilation here is great
2	You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air	After years of relative obscurity , he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture
5	He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant and his remodeling of Paul Stuart , the Madison Avenue clothing store	He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space

2	Now the question is : Is Poland ready for it	Mr. McDonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet , the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in Poland , the first such center in Eastern Europe
6	The project has already acquired a certain New York cachet	Bloomingdale 's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays
5	Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS	A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby 's in December

8	If Mr. McDonough has his way , the Poles will compensate for the trade center 's emissions of carbon dioxide , a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear	The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $ 150,000
2	The news has n't exactly moved others in Mr. McDonough 's profession to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds	All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme

1	Democrats hoped that Mr. Dinkins could become a highly visible national leader	Republicans figured that in Mr. Giuliani , the nation 's best-known prosecutor , they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory
1	Dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy	The alternative -- Giuliani -- is ghastly
2	I guess we 'll reluctantly go ahead and do it , vote for Dinkins	There 's nothing on the other side

9	and that he turned to comedian Jackie Mason for help with Jewish voters	Mr. Mason left the campaign after telling reporters Mr. Dinkins is `` a fancy 'shvartzer ' with a moustache
6	Mr. Dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble	He can match Jackie Mason with his own Robert `` Sonny '' Carson , an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974
0	The Dinkins campaign paid Mr. Carson close to $ 10,000 to get out the vote on primary-election day	Paper work on how it was spent is incomplete
9	Mr. Carson has been charged with being anti-Semitic	Asked about that the other day , he replied , `` Anti-Semitic
8	More troubling for Mr. Dinkins is his record in personal accounting	It began in 1973 , when he was being considered for deputy mayor , and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years

8	Nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere	The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty
2	In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters	The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts ( even the characters ' own ) are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters

Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world
2	Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures	Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians , snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions
2	Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this	If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process

5	The Bush administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be , is n't doing much for now	The only material support it is extending to the struggling U.S. industry is $ 30 million in awards from the Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency

2	It is n't just yuppie television	The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market
2	the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds	Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial

2	And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas	Planar President James Hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea , while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty-free

6	when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years	The current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones
5	Growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility	This kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds John Calverley , senior economist for American Express Bank , of the 1969-72 period

2	But not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals	Growth stocks may underperform cyclical stocks next year if the Federal Reserve begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy

2	that UAL 's board , having accepted a bid of $ 300 a share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal	By that logic , the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months
5	The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ 200 million , and to commit $ 200 million from their retirement funds	On Friday , they also persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them
2	Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank debt in any deal	That way someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work , because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs

2	But it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders	The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied
2	Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989	First Boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection
6	Unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month	American Airlines parent AMR and USAir Group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results
2	Some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots	The deal has so many moving parts
