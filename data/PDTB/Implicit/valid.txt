6	Meanwhile , overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded	In his Mansion House speech , Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect
8	But consumer expenditure data released Friday do n't suggest that the U.K. economy is slowing that quickly	The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago
8	Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further	Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness

2	The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation	Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently
2	Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill	Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981
2	Shippers are saying ` the party 's over	Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years
2	Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years	Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy

5	Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor	You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously
6	Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers	There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology

2	In East Germany , where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism , they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz	Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him
1	You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes	With Krenz , we just do n't know what to expect
8	With Krenz , we just do n't know what to expect	Mr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker
5	According to East Germany 's ADN news agency , Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies	Already last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media
6	Already last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media	On Thursday , a day after he took office , East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer
2	It was quite a shock	For the first time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television
2	And that 's a problem	Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators
5	I hope he grows with the job	The most important thing is that he have a chance
6	there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades	Unlike Mr. Honecker Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions
6	He was later shown on television , fielding questions	At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies
9	At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies	The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel
4	It 's more than just travel	People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society
6	This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring	Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen
5	Rather than trying to `` lecture us Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen	he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change
8	But there 's another side to Mr. Krenz	Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus
5	he 's a true reformer	Even if he is he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo
2	Against this background , the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing	The sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953
5	But if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance	that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him
6	that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him	The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations
8	For average East Germans , Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle	Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now
5	Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now	Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed
6	Meanwhile , East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor	Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production
10	Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production	East Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager , the government 's top ideologist , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no reason to change your own
5	But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms	New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions
2	The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research	Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting , fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end
8	their experiments also produced large amounts of heat	The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in
2	The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in	Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod
8	The results were fascinating	On the fourth `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat
9	On the fourth `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat	The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument
9	The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument	When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off
2	his experiment was `` very erratic	It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down
4	the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested	There is a reality to the excess energy
8	they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time	The bursts often occur after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on
2	The bursts often occur after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on	that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat
6	that they involve unusually meticulous measurements	Typically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt
1	Typically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt	One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells
8	One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells	A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it
9	Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water	he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium
1	he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium	There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water
10	Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable	Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays
1	researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it	In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time
2	In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time	They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment

2	Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression	While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use

1	The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter	Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter
2	The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable	A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy
1	Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board	Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits
8	and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions	Barring any petroleum-related news events , trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm

2	As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions	The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees
2	The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing	Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower
8	so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high	The discounting occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before
8	discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level	It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food

2	If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge	The industry is overbuilt
2	The industry is overbuilt	Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available
2	quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available	With the market so crowded If you 're doing well , you 're doing well at someone else 's expense
5	According to Mr. Rohs , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 , except for August	McDonald 's has also been running negative all year

5	the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales	that short-term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year
8	Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. `` are holding up quite nicely	Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s
4	But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers	Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail
1	Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail	Big franchise groups `` can ride out the storm a lot longer
2	The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees	that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers
5	But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end	courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing
2	In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions	If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise
8	Reggie Jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them	Mr. Jackson is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each
8	Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual	I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it
6	But these players were dead	Maybe three years ago , there were a lot of { Ty } Cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks
6	However , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way	Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs Bob Machon , owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park , Calif

2	ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right	You just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell
2	Dream on	There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing
5	So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges	Two things to keep in mind
5	Two things to keep in mind	Not all exchanges accept every type of order
2	With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market	It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now
5	For example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price	that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers
6	Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it	Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55
2	Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55	A limit order to sell could be entered at that price
1	A limit order to sell could be entered at that price	One risk
2	Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level	Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
5	Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses
8	While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference	Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above.In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below
8	The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do	An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday
1	Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order	Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price
2	Unlike stop orders stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price	If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled
9	However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it	As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price
8	The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades	It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better
2	he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options	I like to use them to feel out the market
8	I like to use them to feel out the market	If they do n't fill it immediately , then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price
8	This is another timing order	It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting
2	This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order	In a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security
6	This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time	On the close '' can be added to many types of orders
5	Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading	Day orders '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date
2	On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them	They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel
2	It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed	Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences
8	Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund	For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall
1	Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas	Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market
6	Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations	Beta is only part of the risk in a stock
2	Beta is only part of the risk in a stock	There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that
0	In particular , beta does n't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock	That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks
1	Our fear was people would look just at the beta { of a gold fund } and say here is an investment with very low risk	In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements
8	This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs	Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds
7	They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year	They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals
2	When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded	Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way
8	A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had `` flip-flopped '' on Manuel Noriega	He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time , hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup
8	Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise	It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners
1	The Sandinistas of Nicaragua , for example , also are part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus	he has not made that intellectual leap
2	he has not made that intellectual leap	We were wrong
2	THROUGHOUT THE 1980s , investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning	Capital has been democratized , and people want in
3	My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion	Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity , I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools , if only to assuage my father-in-law , who believes in such things
8	So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market	Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative
6	Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade	Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery
1	Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment	By 1987 , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it
2	By 1987 , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it	Concerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health
1	Concerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health	Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years
2	We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it	Bank it
8	but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future : personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , bulbs and shrubs ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all	All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential
5	Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy ( Figure 5 ) , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value	According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market
5	I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers	My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations
6	With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage	My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it
2	So go out there and eat that debt	You 're right there in the mainstream of American business , building value on the back of insupportable expenditures
8	WHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice	He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great
2	He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great	He tried management consulting , traded in turquoise for a while , and even managed professional wrestlers
1	He tried management consulting , traded in turquoise for a while , and even managed professional wrestlers	Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill -- financial planning
2	But in this case the needle has a very sharp point	Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent , the fact remains that , as one wag puts it , `` anybody who can fog a mirror '' can call himself a financial planner
2	but in effect they operate in the dark	There is no effective regulation of planners , no accepted standard for admission into their ranks no way to assess their performance , no way even to know how many of them there are
8	There is no effective regulation of planners , no accepted standard for admission into their ranks no way to assess their performance , no way even to know how many of them there are	All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning
2	So it should come as no shock that the profession , if that 's what it is , has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money	Alarmed , state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners
5	Alarmed , state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners	Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards , too
2	Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards , too	they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine
4	But reform has n't taken hold yet	The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days
6	An admittedly limited survey by NASAA found that between 1986 and 1988 `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million	The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother
5	So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners	Nobody can estimate the toll , but John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners , thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery
2	the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery	His group , like others , wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners
2	the best planner might be no planner at all	For most investors `` the benefits just are n't worth the risks
2	but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it	her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials , consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus -- but found that even some people who took these steps `` were still getting ripped off
1	The bad news , however , has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning	The Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business
6	and the pool of capital they influence is enormous	A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months
6	The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate	Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity
2	Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity	The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade
2	The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade	Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years
1	Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years	A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years
2	A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years	It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem
9	So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers	Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules
6	The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with	Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , says that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank
1	Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , says that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank	Mr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who heads one trade group , favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff
8	Mr.Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP , the major industry organization	When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners , Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded
8	The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification	NASAA , the organization of state securities regulators , is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states
8	NASAA , the organization of state securities regulators , is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states	It requires financial planners to register with states , pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest
2	The most common conflict involves compensation	that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend
2	that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend	The issue : Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions
2	In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. , an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested $ 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors	In its notice of action , the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , the attorney general alleged , the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos
2	the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos	Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian , payments investors were never told about
1	Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted	In practice if an investor had access to cash `` the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club
2	And First Meridian 's president , Roger V. Sala , portrayed himself as a `` financial expert '' when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma , work as a real-estate and insurance salesman , and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth	First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general
5	that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect	As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications , `` the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree
8	Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common	Two such actions could be particularly embarrassing to the industry
2	Two such actions could be particularly embarrassing to the industry	both name J. Chandler Peterson , an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP , as defendant
9	Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned	Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors
2	Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots , he opened up his briefcase and dumped $ 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors	he wanted to show the color of his money
1	and the sale never came off	According to the suit , Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment

5	They want it back	Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits
10	They want it back	Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits
2	he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs	The suit is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people
1	Rearding the suit over the bank bid , Mr. Peterson says it is filled with `` inflammatory language and half truths	He declines to go into specifics
8	the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a `` sign of the times '' in which people generally are more prone to sue	anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation
4	he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore	He now calls himself an `` investment banker
2	In many scams or alleged scams involving planners , it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way	Using it , would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner
2	Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner	Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County

5	Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot	The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals
9	In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room , prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses `` caused by employees due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month	Thus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses

2	At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in	In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others

6	Over the past decade or two the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations	Besides term life and whole life ( the old standbys ) , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on
2	Besides term life and whole life ( the old standbys ) , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on	What to do
8	First , generalize	Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive
5	If all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits	It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age
8	But `` term '' means just that	the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires
2	It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal	if you flunk you may not be able to buy it
5	if you flunk you may not be able to buy it	Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older
2	Amex said it would charge me $ 576 a year for $ 100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years	Sounds great -- or does it
5	Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation	Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money
2	Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount	I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile
2	I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile	That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me
8	Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else	There is no free lunch , there is only marketing
2	This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value	The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead
2	but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead	The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature
2	That is gilding the lily	The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into
2	That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package	Again , no free lunch
8	And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well	investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this
8	The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy	You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years
2	One newer wrinkle has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons	the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment
2	I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so I look into the broad category called universal life	it is far more flexible than straight whole life
6	Hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life	I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment
7	I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment	I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year
1	Also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year	These are not certain , either
2	At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed	I call her agent , David Dominici
1	Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection	If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection
8	So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection	these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive
8	these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive	Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays
5	Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays	others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants
2	Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen	there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot
8	I compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen	After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $ 792 , but Id get only $ 14 from the Equitable
8	The difference is magnified by time , too	At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate
4	Well , not yet	I 'm thinking about using the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first

2	But wait a second	Westridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average
9	Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing	Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer , such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , and match its performance
8	Institutional investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns	These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S & P 500 or other bellwethers , much less beat it
8	But today , indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one	Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average , they have developed `` enhanced '' indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points
1	Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade , but the index money has been just sort of sitting there	Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money
5	Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather than being restricted to the S & P 500 companies	They can ignore the S & P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country
2	that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the S & P 500	There is n't a boatload { of big investors } out there still waiting to get into indexing
8	A further problem is razor-thin profits	Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that
5	Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that	To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free
8	To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free	It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account
6	Strategies vary for Westridge Capital , which has $ 300 million under management	The firm sometimes buys S & P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies
2	And in some months , he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all	By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover
5	By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover	The more turnover , the better for our clients
5	Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns	it 's a good idea to jump between the S & P 500 stocks and futures
2	it 's a good idea to jump between the S & P 500 stocks and futures	You 're buying the S & P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it
2	that these instruments present added risks for investors	If the futures markets have a problem , then those products could have a problem
8	There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds	They include : LIMITED RISK FUNDS
8	LIMITED RISK FUNDS	These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains
6	These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains	Here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower
2	Here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower	The fund could invest $ 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed $ 95.That leaves $ 13 , which could be used to buy S & P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S & P index
9	Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks , indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks	the portfolio will be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk ( because of the large number of stocks
2	We see a lot of interest in those kind of things	People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies
8	This is an index fund with a bet	Instead of replicating the S & P 500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio
1	One simple approach is to exclude S & P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates	this can avoid weak sisters , but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds

5	Unless he closes the gap , Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month	Going into the 1990s , the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past
2	This change comes less from a shift in public opinion than in the boundaries of the debate	New Jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion , but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling , Webster vs.Missouri , has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue
1	Before July , pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion	Now , the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension , bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces

5	A matching Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal	Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55 % to 29 % over Republican Courter
8	Abortion alone ca n't explain this shift , but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate	By a 2-to-1 ratio , voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion , and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue
1	Looking back , he says he erred by stating his `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on `` policy '' as governor	It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate
2	He does n't know himself	Even abortion opponents , however angry with Mr. Florio , ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence
6	Even abortion opponents , however angry with Mr. Florio , ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence	He does n't want to lead the people , '' says Richard Traynor , president of New Jersey Right to Life
6	but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov . Kean	While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in Washington , Gov . Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office
5	but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government	Mr. Courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov . Kean 's own insurance commissioner
6	Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps , Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head	He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park.Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government , he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office

5	Asked the same question after his appearance , Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today	When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary , he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden
2	In the opinion of many , he has n't stopped running since	His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge
5	His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge	With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market , Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage

5	He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase state revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste	Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team
6	and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s	Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead
5	and instead quotes the Grateful Dead	The lyric chosen -- `` long strange night '' -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar
2	but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption	His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state , and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment , he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater , Trenton State College

2	But many economists were not nearly as jubilant	The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months
2	I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall	It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months
1	But retail energy prices declined 0.9 % in September	Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices , many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year
6	Still , some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind	It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem , '' argued Edward Yardeni , chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York
8	In both 1987 and 1988 , consumer prices rose 4.4 %	A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7 % annual rate in the first five months of this year , but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4 %
8	Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices	The bottom line is , it seems to me that the economic environment has become very , very competitve for a lot of businesses
1	The bottom line is , it seems to me that the economic environment has become very , very competitve for a lot of businesses	Back in 1987-88 , business was operating at fairly tight capacity , so businesses felt they could raise prices
1	Back in 1987-88 , business was operating at fairly tight capacity , so businesses felt they could raise prices	Now a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand
9	The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance	The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day
1	In the past several days , however , the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets	Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy
5	Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September	Transportation costs actually fell 0.5 % , and housing costs gained only 0.1 %
5	Transportation costs actually fell 0.5 % , and housing costs gained only 0.1 %	Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % , but that was after three months of declines

8	Car prices still showed declines at the consumer level	They dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers
5	Across the country , resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers	Some have built health spas , business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski
8	Such efforts are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $ 1.76 billion U.S. ski industry	Since the start of the decade , lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average , compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s
5	Since the start of the decade , lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average , compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s	Last season , lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years
5	Last season , lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years	By some estimates , nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s
2	But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers	Skiing , after all , has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport
6	In its new ad campaign the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people	One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes : senior citizens , minorities , families with children -- even a blind skier
5	Ski school is great , '' cries out a tot , bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope	`` You 'll never know 'til you try says a black skier
2	But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall	We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall
2	We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall	Most people think if you slip , you 'll wind up in a body cast
6	Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business	Since 40 % of skiers are parents , many slopes are building nurseries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids
6	and adding entertainment for kids	Vail , Colo. , now has a playland that looks like an old mining town
5	kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold	For $ 15 , they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment , with dinner , without mom and dad
1	A few years ago , parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children	Most parents who had to go through that never came back
2	To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors , several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies	In one phone call , ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations , buy lift tickets , rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons
6	because skiing is still expensive	a lift ticket can cost up to $ 35 a day and equipment prices are rising
8	And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions	that only 34 % believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports , as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor
2	Even if they could bring in that many new skiers , I do n't know if { the industry } could handle that kind of an increase	Most people will come on the weekend , the slopes will be overcrowded and then these { new skiers } wo n't come back
1	The theory is that the stadium , damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , will be repaired by then , and that people will be able to get there	Like just about everything else , that remains to be seen
2	Like just about everything else , that remains to be seen	Aftershocks could intervene
5	You might be interested to know that baseball , not survival , appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday , a half-hour before game time , when the quake struck	As soon as the tremor passed , many people spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show
1	I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City , Mich. , so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk about them	Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about one calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat

2	One of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds	That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover
5	that in the past , banks would normally have loaned 65 % of a total buy-out price	Another 20 % of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds
5	that Citicorp 's `` failure to deliver '' on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group `` is very distressing to potential users of a ` highly-confident ' letter from commercial banks	His client , Mr. Davis , used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL
2	that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million	We did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor
2	Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market , banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers	that `` a political and emotional bias '' has developed against junk bonds

1	And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks	In today 's markets , specialists ( on the New York Stock Exchange ) and `` upstairs '' market makers ( in the over-the-counter market ) are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process
2	In today 's markets , specialists ( on the New York Stock Exchange ) and `` upstairs '' market makers ( in the over-the-counter market ) are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process	When they halt trading , all market liquidity is gone
2	When that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility	Lack of important , needed information can cause fear
1	When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve be made available to all , not just to market makers	Because of a lack of information and access , many investors are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed
2	Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information	To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena ( and the information that would automatically accompany such access ) by investors -- particularly institutional investors
1	Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole	What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service
1	What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service	Liquidity is not a service
1	Liquidity is not a service	It is a market attribute
8	As a result the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction	The unwanted position is still an unwanted position
5	The unwanted position is still an unwanted position	only the identity of the seller has changed
2	In an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve ( buy and sell orders at each price ) entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders	Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis
2	The recession , that is	The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up
5	The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up	So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane
2	For the past seven years , investors have had the wind at their backs , in the form of a generally growing economy	Some may have forgotten what it 's like to invest during a recession
5	Some may have forgotten what it 's like to invest during a recession	Different tactics are called for , as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher
5	In a nutshell , pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in `` defensive '' industries	A heavy dose of cash is prescribed , along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds
8	because recessions often take investors by surprise	They always seem to come a bit later than you expect
1	They always seem to come a bit later than you expect	When they do hit , they hit fast
2	Interest rates almost always decline during recession	As surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds
5	As surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds	They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do
1	But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much	Long-term bonds swing more widely in price
8	But not just any bonds will do	Corporate bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession
2	Corporate bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession	As times get tougher , investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts
2	As times get tougher , investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts	This hurts the price of corporate bonds
5	That means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value ( plus , in some cases , a sweetener	When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that
2	When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that	they then save on interest costs
2	If corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all	It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing
2	It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing	Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside
2	Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government	During an economic slump , local tax revenues often go down , raising the risks associated with at least some municipals
8	What 's more , he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual	Once the downturn comes , it 's going to be very hard to reverse
2	and also shunning bonds	Because he sees a `` 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon
1	Greg Confair , president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown , Pa. , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash	He is n't sure a recession is coming
5	This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession	The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a `` soft landing requires the Fed to navigate `` an ever-narrowing corridor
1	A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all	It has to be engineered over and over again , month after month
5	It has to be engineered over and over again , month after month	that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles `` juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw
8	And , in a sense , that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks	It comes down to a question of whether to try to `` time '' the market
8	For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have been rewarding long-term investments	that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 %
2	investors should n't even worry too much about timing	Trying to time the economy is a mistake
5	Trying to time the economy is a mistake , '' says David Katz , chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York	that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years
1	that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years	Investors who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves
5	that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy	Frequent trading runs up high commission costs
2	Still , few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming	After all , in all five recessions since 1960 , stocks declined
8	After all , in all five recessions since 1960 , stocks declined	According to Ned Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis , Fla. , the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % , and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started
9	By the time a recession is `` official much of the damage to stocks has already been done	About six months before a recession ends , stocks typically begin to rise again
6	For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks , professionals have a number of suggestions	Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios
2	Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios	Low P-E '' stocks vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market
1	Low P-E '' stocks vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market	In good times they lag a bit
2	Prof Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies	Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession
1	For example stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow . ( Cash flow , basically earnings plus depreciation , is one common gauge of a company 's financial health	That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash
2	Food , tobacco , drugs and utilities are the classic examples	Recession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they 're sick
8	George Putnam III , editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston , offers one final tip for recession-wary investors	Keep some money available for opportunities , '' he says
2	Keep some money available for opportunities	If the recession does hit , there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest
6	Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle , many new issues of high-yield , high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back , delayed or dropped	On Wednesday , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to $ 71 million from $ 150 million
5	On Wednesday , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to $ 71 million from $ 150 million	Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's $ 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction
8	Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's $ 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction	Last week , the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock
2	the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package	If you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra
5	Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker	to have a 14 1/2 % coupon rate
8	Despite the problems with new issues , high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or resell , market	Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point
2	In the Treasury market , the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point , or $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount	that inflation is moderating while the economy slows
2	The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows	That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower
5	That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower	that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month
9	Yesterday , the Fed executed four-day matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system	The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week
4	they are not in a mood to ease aggressively	They are telling us that { 8 3/4 % } is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate
5	The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25/32 to yield 7.955 % , compared with 100 29/32 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday	The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9/32 to yield 7.937 % , compared with 99 26/32 to yield 8.007 %

5	that more than $ 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers	that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios
6	Away from the general obligation sector , activity was modest	Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3/8 point
1	The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $ 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority	A balance of $ 25.8 million remained in late order-taking , according to the lead manager
5	Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6/32 , up 9/32 , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10/32 , up 6/32	The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48
2	Collectively , the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground	The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday , with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place
2	However , in response to the British Air decision , United 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out	advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board `` at the earliest time possible
5	advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board `` at the earliest time possible	Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air 's participation
5	In another setback yesterday , United 's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws	In an effort to derail the buy-out , the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Transportation Department and Labor Department
8	But there was one bright spot yesterday	The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake
9	The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake	The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable
8	We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all	We 're not rushing into anything
2	We 're not rushing into anything	We do n't want to be party to a second rejection
9	Indeed , British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment	The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution
6	The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts	The { buy-out } consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing , '' a British Air spokesman said
5	British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest 's Airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier	it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers
10	UAL 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid	They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction

1	Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage	Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder

1	That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators	The House version of the bill does include the tax cut
2	Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill	To help lay the groundwork for that fight , President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue
1	and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it	I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor
5	The Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year	The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years

5	For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 %	That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years
8	The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth ( R. , Del . ) , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts	The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses
5	The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses	Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs , but would be subject to tax though no penalty

1	The author of the futuristic novel `` 1984 '' invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is , anything negative about the policies and practices of the state	Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet , but it has made a promising start
5	Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous , reassuring , and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better , safer or cheaper than they really are	When something undeniably nasty happens , a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear , much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers
1	For example , we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago	Wrong
2	Wrong	According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market , it never happened
1	According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market , it never happened	In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 , 1987 , was just a big blip
6	In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 , 1987 , was just a big blip	Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term , New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only `` a major technical correction
1	On Oct. 29 , 1929 -- a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word -- the DJ industrials fell 12.8 %	In the `` technical correction '' of two years ago , they lost a whopping 22.6 %
2	These people used to be called brokers , but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction , when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone	Either way , the word `` broker '' is clearly out of favor
1	Of the major New York-based securities firms , only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers	At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , they are `` financial consultants

6	It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves , overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle , do n't feel	Its almost product de jour , '' grouses one account executive at Dean Witter
5	The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips , instead stressing such terms as `` safe , '' `` insured '' and `` guaranteed '' -- even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product	The names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them , either
2	A case in point : `` government-plus '' bond funds	What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds
6	When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished , look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker	This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships
8	This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships	They are still being sold , but more and more often as `` direct investments '' -- with all the same risks they had under the old label
1	In such cases , the game has n't changed , only the name	In others a familiar old name still prevails , but the underlying game has changed
2	In recent years , though , a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges when an investor sells his shares	Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds
2	on the advent of program trading	Blue chips are now being referred to as poker chips
2	Finally , even the time-honored strategy called `` value investing '' no longer means what it once did	Before the takeover mania of the '80s , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks
1	Before the takeover mania of the '80s , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks , especially those with shrewd management , sound fundamentals and decent prospects	Now value investing often means `` looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble

2	rivals such as Warner , Paramount Pictures , Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office	After five years of management turmoil , with four different studio heads , Columbia sorely needs a stable , savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits
5	Their stock in trade as `` executive producers '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them	Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` The Color Purple
9	Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` The Color Purple	It falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing
1	With MGM/UA 's `` Rainman , '' for instance , Messrs.Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production , but their names still appear in big letters on the credits , and they are inevitably associated with its success	Sometimes , as with `` Batman , '' the pair really do make the film
5	And when you 're making a movie this big , you need all the help you can get	I wish they were around 24 hours a day
6	And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention	Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problems
5	Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure	We 've had a few bombs
5	But by and large this company has only been profitable	his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` is why we 'll be good at Columbia
5	his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` is why we 'll be good at Columbia	We practically ran our own studio
5	Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success , '' says Robert Bookman , an agent at Creative Artists Agency	Mark Johnson , the producer of `` Rainman , '' chimes in : `` He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority
2	He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority	It 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material
1	and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully	He gets better reviews as a creative whiz , an enthusiast , an idea man
2	He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did	Barbra Streisand made him famous
8	Barbra Streisand made him famous	He cut her hair
5	He cut her hair	He lived with her
9	He lived with her	He came to produce her records and her movies -- `` A Star Is Born '' and `` The Main Event
8	they make the perfect `` good cop , bad cop '' team	Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up
1	Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal	If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up
6	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way	Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer bristle when Messrs.Guber and Peters take credit for the film
2	Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherded `` Flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when Messrs.Guber and Peters take credit for the film	The script was unreadable
2	The script was unreadable	We reinvented it
5	We reinvented it	We are the producers of that movie
1	We are the producers of that movie	They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit '' as executive producers
5	they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop , including `` Rainman '' and `` Batman	Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner
5	Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner	I was upset with Roger , I fumpered and schmumpered
2	his relationship with Guber Peters was `` one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood	The two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive , and Peter is very compulsive
6	The two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive , and Peter is very compulsive	Jon Peters will come barreling into a room , say he 's got a great idea , and be gone.Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific
9	Jon Peters will come barreling into a room , say he 's got a great idea , and be gone	Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific
8	that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey	Within a few weeks , we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey
5	Within a few weeks , we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey	I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas
2	The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers	Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation , but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest
5	But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first	Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract
8	its about whether the ink is red or black	In the case of Peter and Jon , the ink has been very , very black
8	Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago	Recruited from New York University 's MBA program , he rose within two years to head of production , overseeing such films as `` The Way We Were , '' `` Taxi Driver , '' `` Tommy '' and `` Shampoo
9	Recruited from New York University 's MBA program , he rose within two years to head of production , overseeing such films as `` The Way We Were , '' `` Taxi Driver , '' `` Tommy '' and `` Shampoo	In 1976 , he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as `` The Deep , '' and `` Midnight Express
1	In 1980 , Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters	While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive
6	While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive	Among their clinkers were `` The Legend of Billie Jean , '' `` VisionQuest , '' `` Clue '' and `` Clan of the Cave Bear
5	And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates	The studio says it stuck with them `` even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner
8	that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse	From the beginning , { they } knew we had a goal and a dream
5	From the beginning , { they } knew we had a goal and a dream	On a number of occasions he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright
1	On a number of occasions he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright	They always listened , but they never acted
9	In 1987 , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment , a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman	In July a year later , Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs.Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM/UA
8	when Messrs.Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM/UA	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio
2	But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later	they got a look at the books and balked at the price
2	Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter	Last May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co
6	And earnings have been erratic	In the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earned $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cents a share , in last year 's quarter
5	In the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earned $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cents a share , in last year 's quarter	Guber Peters stock , which traded as low as $ 6 a share last year , closed yesterday at $ 16.625
8	The two sides now are accusing each other of lying	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise
1	But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court , Mr. Ross , Warner Bros.Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made	Warner , in its court filings , calls it `` a piece of fiction created for this litigation
10	and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now	Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM/UA , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives
5	and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now	Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM/UA , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives
1	that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia	At the very least an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony
5	During settlement talks , for example , Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner , according to executives involved in the talks	In any settlement , Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years , notably sequels to `` Batman
6	there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts	The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract
1	The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief , they note , Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract , then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia	In his affidavit filed yesterday , Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument
2	In his affidavit filed yesterday , Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument	If Sony succeeds here , no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on
2	First , there 's the name : `` asset-backed securities	Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing
6	And there 's more	The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions
7	The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions	Most earn high ratings from credit agencies
7	The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions.Most earn high ratings from credit agencies	Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues
2	Well , think twice	The concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors.But the simplicity may be misleading
2	the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk	that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate
2	A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters	We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn
5	Such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products	Since the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities
5	They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans	They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares
5	They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares	Last year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds
5	Last year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders	Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations
2	This is the heyday of debt	Before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems nothing will be left unhocked
2	and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market	The entry fee is affordable
8	The entry fee is affordable	Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ 1,000
5	The trust then issues securities that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors	Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings
8	the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions	Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds
8	Consider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables	The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues
2	The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues	On a $ 10,000 investment , that 's a difference of only $ 50 a year
2	But Mr . Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans	that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts
8	Another concern is liquidity	The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues
5	That 's particularly true for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans	You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market
1	In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings	There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities
1	Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities	It is n't
1	That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received	That also is n't easy
8	Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company	The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities
2	But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper	When you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties
2	some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets	At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times
9	At the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , Treasurys	That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter
2	At the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , Treasurys	That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter
6	But it could be much worse	Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues
2	Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues	For one thing , credit-card loans are unsecured
2	Nope , we still say to stick with Treasurys	Ratings are subject to change
2	Those portfolios are remarkably diversified	By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate
1	For example , 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months	Last year , only 8 % were expecting a recession
1	An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months	Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth
5	Apparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much	A slim majority ( 51 % ) think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989
8	Their verdict on real estate is almost the same	Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months
2	By contrast , only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold	Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control
8	many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance	Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession
1	Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession	For the most part , the changes were `` slight
2	A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents	Most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year
5	Most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year	Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year
1	Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year	only 57 % had sold any
8	But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark	About 33 % considered another crash `` likely , '' while about 63 % said one is `` unlikely
8	And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual	About 60 % of them said they would `` ordinarily '' have at least 25 % of their money in stocks.But as of August , only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size
8	it lowered its rating on about $ 75 million of this Chatsworth , Calif. , concern 's convertible subordinated debentures , due 2012 , to Caa from B2	the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives
2	it lowered its rating on about $ 400 million of this bank holding company 's senior debt to B2 from Ba3	Moody 's said it expects Valley National , of Phoenix , Ariz. , to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio , and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets , and from high loan-loss provisions
8	That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage	Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies
5	Any secret can be pirated if it is transmitted over the air	Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder
9	if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder	They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait
2	They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait	You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time
5	You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time	It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught
2	It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught	The only way to catch an electronic thief is to set him up with erroneous information
6	By contrast , European firms will spend $ 150 million this year on electronic security	Already many foreign firms , especially banks , have their own cryptographers
2	Still , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy	the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies

5	And no one was shouting	No one around me was saying anything

8	Then I remembered the quake of '71 , which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room	When the swaying of the building woke me up , I reasoned that a ) I was in Southern California ; b ) the bed was moving ; c ) it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited
2	and realized what had happened	What should I do
1	But the lot might split into crevasses , so I had better stand on my car , which probably was wider than the average crevasse	Fortunately , the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood

5	In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others	The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes

1	He throws something	He does n't just walk off the mound and weep
2	Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career	His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe , the inferior `` Playback '' ( 1958 ) , at times read almost like a parody of his previous work
9	His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe , the inferior `` Playback '' ( 1958 ) , at times read almost like a parody of his previous work	When he died in 1959 , Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book , `` The Poodle Springs Story , '' which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque
2	But the lovebirds have a conflict	He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye , and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him
8	Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life , Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds	The supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes
5	The supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes	The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down
6	But there are grounds for complaint	At one point , the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro

2	Mr. Shioya has turned the tables	Today , he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine , the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business
5	Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries	While there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp.

5	Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point	This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone
2	The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter	access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter
2	This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals	new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about $ 13.5 million for the quarter ; toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion

5	Generally in the quarter , overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability	The industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices

2	But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply , to $ 12 million from $ 95 million	Higher oil prices were n't enough to offset a roughly $ 20 million charge related to a 10 % reduction in Amoco 's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses

8	The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg	It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid , at all costs , being accused of meddling in the region
8	The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership , which leaves Central America open to Soviet adventurism	The { influence of the } U.S. is not being felt in Central America ; Washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy , and are divorced from reality
5	The { influence of the } U.S. is not being felt in Central America	Washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy
9	The disarray of the Bush administration 's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of American States to condemn categorically Gen. Noriega	Faced with this embarrassment , U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations , which gathered last week in Peru , would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator
8	But other than a few slaps on the wrist , Gen. Noriega went unpunished by that body , too	he was not even singled out in the closing statement
8	Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the Costa Rican press	Even Carlos Manuel Castillo made public his opposition to the presence of Nicaragua `` in a democratic festivity
2	Nevertheless , the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July	According to officials in Washington , the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias , it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega 's promises of democratic elections were tested next February
8	Prior to this episode , Sen.

9	Visiting Nicaragua , he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas	In Honduras he promised to help unblock some $ 70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington
2	Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani	Mr. Cristiani 's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd 's likes and dislikes
2	It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S. , virtually neglected by the Bush administration , ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December , long before the elections	Fittingly , the Tela Accords were nicknamed by Hondurans `` the Dodd plan
6	The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America	On Oct. 3 , following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim `` Nicaragua 's great peace efforts
8	There , Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan	The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America
1	He also called on Nicaragua 's neighbors to accept a `` military equilibrium '' guaranteed by both superpowers	The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow 's words , East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels
2	Since Mr. Shevardnadze 's proposals followed discussions with Mr. Baker , speculations arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in Central America	This scheme would fit the Arias Plan , which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by Washington to freely elected governments
8	The sad condition of U.S. policy in Central America is best depicted by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica	In 1984 , the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country , flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda
9	In 1984 , the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country , flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda	Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica , funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America ( VOA
2	It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America	Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default
5	President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action	that 64 % of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama , the U.S. will come to its defense

5	MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79 % stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $ 140 million	TVX owns five stations , including WTXF , a Fox affiliate , in Philadelphia
2	Fox was n't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming	To make the venture work , they would need Fox affiliates
1	To make the venture work , they would need Fox affiliates	We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations
1	The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries ' broadcasting unit	A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks
2	I think it 's to Fox 's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture	the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount-MCA shows would n't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by Paramount-MCA
1	The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical	It is n't . . . . Why would I consider giving up Fox , a proven commodity , '' for an unknown venture
5	The holding company will be called BanPonce Corp	The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico
9	Banco Popular just kept waiting	They got a transaction that 's good for both companies
2	The two banks appear to be a good fit	BanPonce caters to a more affluent customer , while Banco Popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets
5	The merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in Puerto Rico	They 're often right across the street from one another
2	the merger will result in a `` larger and stronger locally based bank	We 'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks

9	We had just finished phase two '' of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock	After completing installation of the jackets on `` one frame '' of the freeway last year , the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design
8	the project had been stymied somewhat by `` the difficulty of designing '' the jackets	The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel , then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed

6	The Cypress structure opened in June 1957 , and as such , like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area , does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support	The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake

5	Five of the partners are opening a boutique in Richmond to concentrate on corporate defense litigation , particularly in product liability cases	The sixth partner , John H. OBrion , Jr. , is joining Cowan & Owen , a smaller firm outside Richmond
8	However , operating profit fell 35 % to $ 16.4 million	The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines , lower earnings from the forest-products group , and what is proving to be a nagging major problem , continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship daily newspaper
8	Analysts said the company 's troubles mirror those of the industry	Retail advertising largely is n't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected
6	At the same time , newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising , especially in its financial component	Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9 % , a reflection , in part , of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine
2	next year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper-industry advertising	Next year , earnings will hold steady , but we just do n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising
2	linage is down	It will be hard to do handstands until real linage starts heading back up
8	that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990	the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in Edison , N.J. , in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs
2	they were impressed by the performance of the company 's newspaper group	group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to $ 34.9 million from $ 34.5 million on flat revenue
5	that `` profits held up in a tough revenue environment	That 's a good sign when profits are stable during a time revenue is in the trough
2	Stock and bond investors were cheered by last month 's encouragingly low inflation rate	This news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts
2	This news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts	Treasury-bond prices immediately rallied , setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell
8	Indeed , over-the-counter stocks , led by technology issues , outleaped the industrial average	The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 7.52 , or 1.6 % , to 470.80 , its highest one-day jump in points this year
5	Many takeover-related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy-out of American Medical International Inc	Among the biggest winners were brokerage-house stocks , responding to heavy trading volume
1	consumer prices rose only 0.2 % last month	Economists expected twice as large an increase
6	That news , plus recent signs of economic sluggishness , greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further	I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy , and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt , '' said Garnett L. Keith Jr. , vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America , one of the nation 's largest institutional investors
1	I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy , and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt	Fed officials probably wo n't drive down rates immediately
2	Fed officials probably wo n't drive down rates immediately	Despite the inflation news , several Fed officials still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed
2	Investors also are anxious about today 's `` witching hour	This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session
6	Stock prices surged in heavy trading	Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 198.1 million shares from 166.9 million Wednesday
8	The dollar was mixed	In New York late yesterday , it was at 141.70 yen , up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday.But it fell to 1.8470 marks from 1.8485
8	that , at least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting '' has been on the rise over the past half century	In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 %
1	In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives	Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 %
8	As we know , voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress	In every presidential election over the past half century , except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy , the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress
1	In every presidential election over the past half century , except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy , the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress	Prior to 1932 , the pattern was nearly the opposite
8	If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic	If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies
2	but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies	Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making
2	In races for the White House , a voter 's incentive , at the margin , is to lean Republican	Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state , such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
2	such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes
8	Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives	Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
8	Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office	Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent
2	Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent	To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates
8	Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South	To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office
8	Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House	Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts
2	that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do	To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns
8	This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House	The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959
8	Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level	State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse
5	The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $ 156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor , Education , Health and Human Services	Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate , which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women
5	Reversing an eight-year federal policy , the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest , but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother 's life is in danger	Mr. Bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House , but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill
8	The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State , Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990	An estimated $ 1.32 billion is provided for next year 's census , and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens
5	Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies , and an 18 % increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added $ 26 million in filing fees	In an unprecedented step , the measure anticipates another $ 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases
5	and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency	Lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville , Spain , but agreed elsewhere to $ 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger
5	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings attached $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative	His Republican counterpart , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H. ) , has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp
2	but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed	The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year
1	The bill also provides $ 620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and $ 80 million for peace-keeping activities	Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989
8	Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors , fighting the urge to spend more , we 're reminded of those late-night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says , `` Stop me before I kill again	The Members know they 're doing wrong , but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions
8	I come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter	It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy
1	as I was walking back to get in my car , I heard many , many people . . . opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in	As I was driving home , I did not feel very good about myself
2	that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again	A good place to start the rehabilitation is a `` legislative line-item veto '' bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats
9	Under the proposal , a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of `` rescissions '' to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes	Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 % majority
1	The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 Budget `` Reform '' Act	Before 1974 , a President could `` impound , '' or refuse to spend , funds appropriated by Congress
1	Before 1974 , a President could `` impound , '' or refuse to spend , funds appropriated by Congress	Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power , but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away
1	Today a President can still send up spending rescissions , but they 're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind	This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens
6	and naturally rescissions are almost never approved	In 1987 , President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill , but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress
1	In 1987 , President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill , but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress	Senator Coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts
2	Senator Coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts	The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies , but the police ( in the form of a President ) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy , as they do now
5	President Bush has endorsed the idea , and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past	but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions , they 'll sign up
2	That is a minimum figure , and I underscore minimum	It 's impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time
6	For the most part , major corporations ' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake	One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley to report in , Seagate Technology , said it expects to be back at full strength Monday
6	The city 's recovery from the earthquake was uneven	Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 % of their usual capacity , but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled , leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 % vacancy rate
5	Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 % of their usual capacity , but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled , leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 % vacancy rate	City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings , but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled

6	The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake 's epicenter , 80 miles south of San Francisco	Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly $ 600 million
5	Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly $ 600 million	Santa Clara County has a running total so far of $ 504 million , excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos
5	That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished , peeled business facades south of Market Street , and houses in the city 's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations	Many streets and sidewalks buckled , and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured
1	FEMA is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo	It is likely to get as much as $ 800 million initially in additional funds
8	there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements	The Bush administration has at its disposal $ 273 million in funds remaining from the $ 1.1 billion Congress released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo
5	We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate , short-term requirements	that the Office of Management and Budget , the Transportation Department and other agencies are `` developing longer-term legislation '' that should be ready soon
2	Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges	California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state
6	Some things ca n't be repaired	The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $ 10 million to $ 15 million in damage , including shattered porcelains and stone figures
5	The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $ 10 million to $ 15 million in damage , including shattered porcelains and stone figures	Its neighbor , the De Young Museum , totaled $ 3 million to $ 5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture
5	The ground along the Embarcaderothe street that skirts the city 's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake , wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers	At San Francisco International Airport , shock waves wrecked the control tower , knocking down computers and shattering glass

8	A major chunk of the $ 2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency	All of the city 's $ 5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours '' on overtime salaries
6	Claims range from a scratched fender to a major processing plant	We 're delivering a check for $ 750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday
6	After that , the federal share diminishes	For interstate highways , the federal share normally would drop to 90 % of the cost of repairs , and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost
2	Transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning Monday and growing worse over the next several weeks	Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco daily
5	Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco daily	it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow
1	Moreover , state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours	Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos
2	Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos	If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while

1	Apparently so	There are no easy choices in Cambodia , but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia
8	the State Department is talking again about accepting an `` interim '' coalition government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh	The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen regime , the two non-communist resistance groups led by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk , and the Khmer Rouge
1	The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by allowing the Khmer Rouge a small share of power	that any Khmer Rouge participation would have to be `` minimal
6	that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else	Recall that Nicaragua 's Sandinistas came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates
0	Recall that Nicaragua 's Sandinistas came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates	Within two years , the moderates were exiled or in prison
7	Within two years , the moderates were exiled or in prison , Nicaragua had gone communist , and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors	In Laos , when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination
7	In Laos , when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination	Even Mao Tse-tung 's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller , non-communist parties
2	that the current regime is already communist , as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi , as are the Khmer Rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups	It 's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government , but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear
2	that the non-communists would disappear	That would leave Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge
2	The Khmer Rouge , however , carry an unsurpassed record for Cambodian tyranny	These utopians caused the deaths of well over one million Cambodians
8	These utopians caused the deaths of well over one million Cambodians	The Cambodian horror was so bad that the Vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief
5	But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed	Some of our sources in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader , Pol Pot , has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border
2	Nor should the U.S. worry much about offending China	It 's time the State Department recognized that China does not play by gentlemen 's rules
4	Nor should the U.S. worry much about offending China	It 's time the State Department recognized that China does not play by gentlemen 's rules
2	For the U.S. to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on Indochina 's bleak scene could only disturb America 's allies elsewhere	It would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the Philippines or Peru to conclude the following : Fight viciously enough and the U.S. , under the banner of pragmatism , might eventually help negotiate your way to victory
2	Fight viciously enough and the U.S. , under the banner of pragmatism , might eventually help negotiate your way to victory	U.S. diplomacy has done it before , and it will likely do it again
3	Why the timidity	At the very least , the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia 's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents.When that day comes , it would be particularly awful to know that the United States sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor

5	They 're forgetting we 're all Texans	The Lone Star is on the rise again
8	As the ad 's tone implies , the Texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these days , and Lone Star is n't alone in trying to take advantage of that	From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks , the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders
2	While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times	That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders

2	And deposits at NCNB Texas National Bank , a unit of NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , have increased $ 2 billion since last year after heavy advertising stressing commitment to Texas	Obviously , pride sells in Texas
6	The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks -- stressing the company 's ` Texasness , ' pointing out the competition 's lack thereof , or trying to be more Texan than Texans	Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like `` Connecticut and Long Island , '' sniffs a commercial for Chevrolet , a division of General Motors Corp

8	The most-strident anti-outsider sentiment among bankers comes from the Independent Bankers Association of Texas , although it 's hard to tell from previews of the $ 5 million `` The I 's of Texas '' TV campaign	Commercials will highlight heart-rending scenes of Texas and chest-swelling , ain't-it-great-to-be-a-Texan music

5	Little money has been returned to upgrade Pemex 's aging facilities	While the government drains Pemex from above , the union has drained it from below

7	Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , UAL 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake	UAL management was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake
5	that British Air will take a more active , high-profile role in pursuing any new bid	He said he believes UAL management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction
8	British Air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group , led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf , and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming	As far as we 're concerned , we 're waiting for the dust to settle
5	a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks	the original proposal is dead , and all aspects of a revised version are up for change , in light of the changes in UAL 's market price , the amount of debt banks are willing to fund , and the price British Air would be willing to pay
1	but declined to specify a figure	Asked whether a $ 230-a-share figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low , he said , `` It 's certainly not too low
8	the original offer was `` a pretty full price	with paying $ 750 million
1	If the { new } deal had us putting up less money but still having 15 % , that would be a point in our favor	In any new proposal , British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20 % -plus in the original proposal
2	In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid , the UAL board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction , even without any legal obligation to do so	Roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders , who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient
2	UAL 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the United pilot union for the buy-out proposal	The 220 pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union
9	The 220 pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union	The airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the 1985 strike , a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit
3	utilization management does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs	Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends
2	The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow	The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus
5	The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus	As a general rule , prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care
1	As a general rule , prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care	that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines
8	There 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization , '' he said.But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed	It 's like squeezing a balloon
2	that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high	You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment
5	You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment	that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements

2	the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles	By pooling their resources , the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed
5	Both Renault and DAF will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks	Under a separate arrangement , British Aerospace PLC 's Rover Group PLC subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the U.K. , and Renault 's truck-building subsidiary Renault Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in France
8	First , its position in the government is anomalous	It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments -- the control of the money supply
8	Second , the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular	As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used to say , they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting
2	So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians	The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness , like high interest rates or slow economic growth , while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed 's independence
8	This leads to proposals for `` reform '' of the Fed	These proposals include changing the term of the chairman , shortening the terms of the members , eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process , putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board , having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress ( the General Accounting Office ) , putting the Fed 's expenditures in the budget , and requiring prompt publication of the Fed 's minutes
2	they rest on an incorrect view	They would not solve the problem
4	They would not solve the problem	they would make it worse
8	The price level in the U.S. is now about 4 1/4 times as high as it was 30 years ago	On average , something that cost $ 100 30 years ago now costs $ 425
8	The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy	At least , it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period
2	Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it	Despite all the formal provisions for its independence , the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it
2	Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors , one of the leading proposals today , is an example	The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money
2	The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money	He has a built-in , constant longing for lower interest rates
2	True , a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed	By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew , in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury , and probably also the Congress , should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot
2	By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew	The Fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government
8	The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical	The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government
2	The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government	The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president
8	Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic	What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy
1	What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy , which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level	To leave this decision to an `` independent '' agency is not only undemocratic
5	The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System	Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal ( D. , N.C . )
2	It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted , however	Congress would be required to make a hard decision , and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact
2	But that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives	The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives
1	The per-share loss was $ 5.32	In the year earlier period , the New York parent of Republic National Bank had net income of $ 38.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share
5	Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week	Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature
2	Indeed , abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests	The pro-choice movement has shown -- finally -- that it can mobilize But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri , where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time
8	But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an `` informed consent '' provision	Under this legislation , a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks
8	In Michigan , where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week , Gov . Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists	Susan Rogin , a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state , takes comfort from the fact that the state 's House abortion opponents `` have n't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years
1	but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall	she and her allies are `` cautiously optimistic '' they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote

8	Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by Houston Republicans on behalf of HEI Corp. of Texas to retroactively `` move '' a Missouri hospital from one county to the next to justify higher Medicare reimbursements	The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $ 1.4 million in claims made by the Health Care Finance Administration against HEI , which owned the hospital in Sullivan , Mo. , during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment
2	but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990	The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox , entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use , but as a master of pork-barrel politics , he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border
2	The British conglomerate , planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a # 13.35 billion ( $ 21.03 billion ) takeover bid by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith , intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures	If anything , the gyrations in world stock markets since last Friday 's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring

1	Beefeater alone is worth as much as # 300 million	Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for # 174.5 million
2	But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry	Now , it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations
3	For rival liquor companies , the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands	It 's not very often something like this comes up

8	Whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry	Earlier this year , the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry
1	British brewers currently own thousands of pubs , which in turn sell only the breweries ' beer and soft drinks	Under new rules , many of the country 's pubs would become `` free houses , '' selling beers of their choice
5	Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests , in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses	The company has about 13 % of the British beer market

8	where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years	IBM 's traditional mainframe rivals , including Unisys Corp. , Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp. , have struggled recently
8	Digital is promising a new approach	Digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves , but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations , personal computers , printers and other devices
6	The challengers will have a big price advantage	Digital is expected to tag its new line from about $ 1.24 million to $ 4.4 million and up , depending on configuration.That 's about half the price of comparably equipped IBM mainframes
2	The heightened competition will hit IBM at a difficult time	The computer giant 's current mainframe line is starting to show its age

1	In the past , customers had to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX	Now they do n't have to
2	Now they do n't have to	That 's going to cost IBM revenue
8	Digital can expect this pent-up demand for the new VAX to fuel strong sales next year	the 9000 could boost sales by more than $ 1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in July
8	to begin shipping in volume until next year	The first model available will be the 210 , which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger , or vector processor
1	Four more models are expected to begin shipping in late June	Most analysts do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter , which begins next July 1
2	Digital 's new line has been a long time coming	The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product , and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end

1	Michael Maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs	As thanks , the egg industry tried to break him
6	And the egg producers have done a pretty good job	They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress
5	They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress	Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban Mr. Maynard 's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella
2	Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban Mr. Maynard 's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella	His company , Misa Manufacturing Inc. , was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated
5	His company , Misa Manufacturing Inc. , was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated	Monthly sales of his Egg King machine have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75
8	Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry	Many larger egg producers are also egg processors , who crack , inspect , and sanitize billions of eggs , turning them into powdered , liquified or frozen egg products
2	Chickens carry this bacteria	Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs , and it can also be found on unclean shells
6	Mr. Maynard claims this is a manageable problem	The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and , as an added precaution , to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria
8	The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and , as an added precaution , to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria	With nearly 4,000 machines in use , there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed
3	Opponents do n't buy such arguments	Human nature being what it is , people do n't always follow instructions
6	Leading the assault against the Egg King has been United Egg Producers	The Decatur , Ga. , trade group has issued a `` briefing book '' that claims the machine is `` a health hazard '' and that Mr. Maynard is trying `` to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers
5	and that Mr. Maynard is trying `` to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers	The UEP declines to comment , but the group 's attorney , Alfred Frawley , says the group 's actions are motivated solely by `` health concerns
8	An early battleground was the U.S. Department of Agriculture	Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the USDA 's Food Safety Inspection Service
1	Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the USDA 's Food Safety Inspection Service	Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard , another branch of the USDA , the Agricultural Marketing Service , was in charge of eggs
2	Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard , another branch of the USDA , the Agricultural Marketing Service , was in charge of eggs	After receiving complaints from egg producers , this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval , thus limiting the machine 's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that are n't regulated by the USDA
5	So the producers went to Capitol Hill , where a congressman from Georgia introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines	Mr. Maynard enlisted his local congressman
1	Mr. Maynard 's forces finally defeated the measure , though it took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives to do it	Even then , opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an `` unscrupulous '' method for breaking eggs
2	An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard 's company filed in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg Producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes	The judge dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard 's company to pay over $ 100,000 in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers

2	However , Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace	Baker Boys '' is both bluesy and funny
5	Much of the picture 's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus 's slyly seductive lens work	After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder , the late German director , and more recently with Martin Scorsese ( `` After Hours , '' `` The Color of Money , '' `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' ) , Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style

5	Della Femina had billings of just $ 660 million last year and ranked as the U.S. 's 24th-largest ad agency	The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $ 2.6 billion -- most of that in Europe -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide
2	The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $ 2.6 billion -- most of that in Europe -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide	To make it to top-10 status , it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising , D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Omnicom 's DDB Needham
9	The merged agency 's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may prove equally difficult	When WCRS created Della Femina McNamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988 , it said it did so in order to attract larger clients , especially packaged-goods companies
5	But major packaged-goods players of the world -- such as Procter & Gamble , Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever -- have steadfastly eluded the agency	Three of our favorite names

0	One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention	The deportation of more than 315,000 men , women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years
6	As if this were n't enough , the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act	On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole 's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24 , 1990 , as the `` National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923
2	but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve	It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey

2	Turkey is n't really part of Europe	Why , they wonder , should it belong to the EC
5	Why , they wonder , should it belong to the EC	Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people

2	Turkey is not a Christian nation	its people simply wo n't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition
1	its people simply wo n't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition	It 's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore
5	No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument	Turkey in any event is long past it
6	Turkey in any event is long past it	The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations

5	Kurds have inundated eastern Turkey	Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria
2	The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently	Surely , the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten

8	Rep. Chalmers Wylie , an Ohio Republican , rallied to the cause	I think the gentlelady is making an important statement
2	the gentlelady is making an important statement	The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong is most unfortunate
1	some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with HUD	that given Congress 's attitude toward HUD , the place probably is beyond reform
1	For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities	In the process HUD has wasted untold billions , created slums and invited corruption
6	Much of HUD 's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class	That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration
5	and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units	The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods
8	Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones	there have been a record 96 killings there this year , most of them drug-related

5	A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle	A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer
2	Decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs	Until then , the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted
1	It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there	No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged
1	No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged	Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals , we disagree
4	Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals , we disagree	It 's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine HUD has become and channel the resources into the drug war
6	but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed	The rubble after the Armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed , quite literally , a city whose larger structures had been built with sand
6	The larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of San Francisco is surely with the state of the U.S. economy	Did the stock-market tremors of Friday , Oct. 13 , presage larger fragility , far greater upheavals
6	The eerie complacency of the Reagan-Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements	A licensed government intellectual , Francis Fukuyama , recently announced in The National Interest that history is , so to speak , at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization
9	Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate peaked in 1965 at 17.2 %	That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6 % in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1 % in 1986 and 8 % in 1987
8	This is indeed what the market decided	By 1982 the ratio was 43.5 % , meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at 43 cents
2	that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's capital stock , an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way	His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits
8	But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet , and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way	The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988
6	But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history for society to continue shielding its eyes	Mainstream economists and commentators , craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing , swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs , claimed the end result would be a leaner , meaner corporate America , with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall
4	But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found	The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of '80s capitalism
4	Left-stream economists I associate with were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues	All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities
6	and pointing out the underlying realities	Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher , and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow
6	The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up	In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2 % or 3 % , a Harvard study published in April of this year found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34 %
2	Corporations need liquidity , in the form of borrowed funds	Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits , they look to the government
1	which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts	The consequence can be inflation , brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash
6	Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort : an assault on wages	Mr. Fukuyama said in his essay that `` the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West
2	Mr. Fukuyama might want to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism	From its peak in 1972 of $ 198.41 , the average American weekly wage had fallen to $ 169.28 in 1987 -- both figures being expressed in 1977 dollars
8	These are long-term Richter readings on American capitalism	The whole structure is extremely shaky
1	The whole structure is extremely shaky	Governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic
6	But sophistication has its limits	The S & L bailout could cost $ 300 billion , computing interest on the government 's loans

5	A Lufthansa spokeswoman in Tokyo said the head of Lufthansa 's cargo operations had been in Toyko last week for talks with JAL	In Paris , Air France declined to comment
1	Nothing is defined or signed at this point	Whatever accord the three carriers reach he is skeptical it would create a separate airline
2	If the three companies pool their air-freight businesses , their clout would be considerable	According to figures from the International Air Transport Association , they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year
1	According to figures from the International Air Transport Association , they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year	Federal Express and Flying Tiger , as separate companies , carried a combined 2.6 million tons

1	For such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes , devotion to a single brand was quite low , with fewer than 30 % saying they usually buy the same brand	Only for cigarettes , mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than 60 % of users say they typically stick with the same brand
6	People tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors , such as cigarettes and ketchup	her husband is adamant about eating only Hunt 's ketchup

1	He simply ca n't stomach the taste of Heinz	The only other thing I 'm really loyal to is my Virginia Slims cigarettes
2	The only other thing I 'm really loyal to is my Virginia Slims cigarettes	Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me , and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale
8	Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes , perfume and beer	People often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys
8	Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries	Only 23 % of trash-bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand , and just 29 % of battery buyers stick to one brand

2	In the past , you just wore Fruit of the Loom and did n't care	The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women
2	there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty	What loyalty there is to gas brands is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations
8	Brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the Journal survey	Nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey
1	Nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey	only 9 % of those age 18 to 29 have such strong allegiance
2	Higher-income people also tend to be more brand loyal these days	that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price
1	and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price	An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality

2	The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game : How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave as they move into middle age	They grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far

8	When there 's a clutter of brands , consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves , 'All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy	Too often , advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer
2	And perhaps with good reason	Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser
8	Consider , for example , what happened to Maxwell House coffee	The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business
2	Now , Philip Morris { Kraft General Foods ' parent company } is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House	Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it

2	Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month	The earthquake 's toll , including possible deep structural damage , goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane
5	Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage	Most insurers already have mobilized their `` catastrophe '' teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California
8	Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement `` rider '' on a homeowner 's policy in California , because of the area 's vulnerability to earthquakes	about 25 % of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance
1	about 25 % of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance	about 23 % of its personal property policyholders -- about 28 % in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage
1	Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage	Highways generally do n't have insurance coverage
9	For example , insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy	Such increased demand for reinsurance , along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters , are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise
2	this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace	His firm , along with some others , issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday
8	Still , a few individual companies , most likely smaller ones , could be devastated	there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this
2	there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this	some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo
8	The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906	that the 1906 San Francisco destruction , on an inflation-adjusted basis , included insured losses of $ 5.8 billion
1	that the 1906 San Francisco destruction , on an inflation-adjusted basis , included insured losses of $ 5.8 billion	this week 's disaster will generate insured losses of $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion , following about $ 4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo

2	We 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet '' with him	Ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon

1	Ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later	I 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody

2	Developing an executive-model range would mark a major departure for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker	A typical British executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car
5	A typical British executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car	It generally fetches no more than # 25,000 ( $ 39,400
1	We have designs for such { executive } cars , but have never been able to develop them	GM 's help would `` make it possible { for Jaguar } to build a wider range of cars
8	An executive model would significantly boost Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars	You are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year
1	A pact with GM may emerge in as little as two weeks , according to sources close to the talks	The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders
2	The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders	We have to make it attractive enough that { holders } would accept it
8	That may be difficult when you have somebody else breathing down your neck	Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later , said
8	until U.K. government restrictions expire	The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of Jaguar shares without permission until Dec. 31 , 1990
8	But with its 10.4 % stake , Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely	It 's a very valuable weapon in their armory , '' which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar
1	Otherwise , Jaguar may have to tolerate the two U.S. auto giants each owning a 15 % stake for more than a year	It would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective

5	The refinancing of $ 481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by $ 22 million , or five cents a share , but in the long run will save more than $ 250 million in interest costs	The company previously said that the recent acquisition of Mobile Communications Corp. of America would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3 %
5	For the third quarter , revenue increased 1.9 % to $ 2.55 billion from $ 2.51 billion	Operating expenses increased 2.6 % to $ 2.04 billion , including one-time pretax charges of $ 40 million for labor contract signing bonuses

1	Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading , one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record	Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report , they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed Monday to restore the markets ' equilibrium

8	For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker with a man cut of the same cloth : Egon Krenz , the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege	East Germany , it is clear , is no Poland , where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union
6	Still , any change in East Germany has enormous implications , for both East and West	It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow , Washington and Western Europe
8	Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday	Mr.Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media

0	In Washington , the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change	The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz , provided he is willing to institute reforms

1	it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change	Clearly , the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz
2	Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland , he was eight years old when World War II ended	Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division

5	Notably , one of Mr. Krenz 's few official visits overseas came a few months ago , when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing	He later defended the Chinese government 's response during a separate visit to West Germany

6	In recent days , Mr. Krenz has sought to project a kinder image	According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin , it was Mr. Krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig
8	He does n't want to have the image of the gun man	He 's not a reformer -- he wants to have the image of a reformer
8	He 's not a reformer	he wants to have the image of a reformer
2	As part of his image polishing , Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party 's authority	Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker , Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media , free up travel restrictions , and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups
2	West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful	He does n't signify what people want , so the unrest will go on

2	From the perspective of East Germany 's old guard , reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being	East Germany is a creature of the Cold War
8	Unlike the other nations of the bloc , East Germany is a creature of the Cold War	Erasing the differences still dividing Europe , and the vast international reordering that implies , wo n't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary.But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map
2	Which is what the Old Guard fears	they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable state
1	Up to now , that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country 's international legitimacy , followed by Mr. Honecker 's campaign to build the East bloc 's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise	Neither man achieved perfection
8	The East German media soon began presenting Mr. Gorbachev 's speeches only as sketchy summaries , and giving space to his opponents	By late 1988 , they were banning Soviet publications
10	The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road	Mr. Honecker spoke of `` generally valid objective laws of socialism '' and left no room for debate
