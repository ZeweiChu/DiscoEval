8	The solution , at least for some investors , may be a hedging technique that 's well known to players in the stock-options market	Called a `` married put , '' the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock
8	It 's like `` fire insurance	Because a put option gives its owner the right , but not the obligation , to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date , the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price
2	This is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire	but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured
9	In addition to hedging new stock purchases , the married-put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns	In either case , the investor faces three possible outcomes
2	If the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date , the put will probably expire worthless	The investor will be out the cost of the put and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit
2	If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date , the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put , less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put	The worst-case scenario would be if the put expires worthless
8	If the price of the stock declines , the put will increase in value	Once the stock price is less than the exercise price , or `` strike price , '' of the put , the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar
2	For example , Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents , which would be received before the February option expires and , thus , reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount	In this case , the investor 's risk would n't exceed 3.6 % of the total investment
2	But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues	Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted

6	The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street	The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report 's release , before recovering to close 18.65 points lower at 2638.73
8	This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline	It raises questions about more deep-seated problems , the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them

9	On Oct. 14 of that year , the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline	The slide continued until the record 508-point market drop on Oct. 19
6	The bleak trade report was played down by the Bush administration	Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the worsening trade figures `` disappointing after two very good months
2	The figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $ 110 billion annual rate	That 's still an improvement over last year , but it leads one to conclude that basically we 've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit
2	In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness	Since March , exports have been virtually flat

8	Mike Metschan , a salesman in Wang 's Austin , Texas , office , has a breezier method	We tell them $ 3 billion companies do n't go out of business
5	We tell them $ 3 billion companies do n't go out of business	We tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties
1	We tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties	Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines , but very few have had losses comparable to Wang 's or are carrying such a large debt load
2	that after a sharp sales slump in July and August , sales stabilized in September	Although Wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 and the full fiscal year , Mr. Miller says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter
2	anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line	If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run
2	The customer will react to strength	Ignore the present condition
4	Ignore the present condition	Show it 's business as usual
2	That is n't easy	Wang 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable , wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come
8	but they 've come a long way	They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened
2	The first priority for Wang 's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers	Wang 's installed base is one of its greatest assets , and many of those customers remain extremely loyal
8	New customers are even tougher	You ca n't sell a VS to a new customer
2	The financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing Wang 's image systems	Consultants say that Wang 's technology is among the best available in the image market
6	But salespeople often found that news of Wang 's problems superseded their sales efforts	William Tait , a former sales manager in Indianapolis , says that his office had all but sold a $ 1.5 million image system to pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly & Co
1	that his office had all but sold a $ 1.5 million image system to pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly & Co	When they were making the decision , all hell broke loose with the finances
2	When they were making the decision , all hell broke loose with the finances	the Lilly executives told him they could n't take the risk with Wang
2	he does n't blame Lilly	Buyers have to rely on a supplier `` continually upgrading and replacing the product
2	Buyers have to rely on a supplier `` continually upgrading and replacing the product	When a company realizes that , it 's hard to go with Wang
2	It can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement	You have pride in your job
2	You think you can go out and turn things around	It 's a tough thing when you ca n't
2	It 's a tough thing when you ca n't	The reason does n't relate to your selling skills
8	Discouragement feeds on itself	The problem is , if people get down in the dumps , they stop selling
1	The bad news is , you 'll be rejected more	The good news is , it 's not your fault
8	But Mr. Miller , Wang 's new president , recently warned his salespeople about negativism	Our customers watch us for the hidden message , '' he said
2	Our customers watch us for the hidden message	Look a customer right in the eye and say , ` I 'm glad to be at Wang

5	Revenue in the telecommunications products and services unit rose 27 % to $ 728.8 million , but operating profit was unchanged at $ 26.3 million , partly because of start-up expenses	Electrical products ' sales fell to $ 496.7 million from $ 504.5 million with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in Europe and South America

2	When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week , so did UAL 's stock	Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at $ 250 a share , the two executives would still get about $ 25 million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction
2	Mr. Wolf owns 75,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $ 83.3125 each	In the $ 300-a-share buyout , that totaled about $ 76.7 million

2	Beantown scribes , who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as Michael `` Pee Wee '' Dukakis , or New England Patriots Coach Raymond `` Rev.Ray '' Berry , yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of Globe columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week	By late last night , Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy , bending to the will of his troops , scrapped the new drawings
6	Trouble was , nobody thought they looked right	Globe columnist Mike Barnicle -- in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks -- averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad , it looked `` like a face you 'd find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime
5	Globe columnist Mike Barnicle averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad , it looked `` like a face you 'd find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime	Mr. Barnicle reminded readers that he still has n't forgiven Globe management for questioning a $ 20 expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story
5	I thought { the drawing } a cross between someone you 'd spot whipping open his trench coat . . . or a guy who boasted he 'd been Charles Manson 's roommate for the last 19 years , '' he said	Mr. Barnicle was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues Michael Madden ( `` appears to be a pervert '' ) , Will McDonough ( `` looks as if he drove for Abe Lincoln '' ) or Bella English , whose `` little girl now screams hysterically every time she sees a newspaper

1	Deeply ingrained in both the book review `` Kissing Nature Good-bye '' by Stephen MacDonald ( Leisure & Arts , Sept. 27 ) and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity	Is such a view justified
8	About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended	Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America , northern Europe and Asia
5	Furthermore , no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming	It is probably continuing
5	You 're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever	On the comptroller side , you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a $ 6 billion budget
5	The rebel officer 's slow and painful death was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega	Leaping into rages , sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust , Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup , according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City
7	He is now changing the place he sleeps every night , sometimes more than once a night	His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time mistress , Vicky Amado , and her mother , Norma
8	And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters	More enemies to be dealt with
8	it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades	America 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship
5	America 's war on the dictator over the past two years is the legacy of that relationship	Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates
2	for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period	The woman had nearly died
2	But U.S. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away	Mr. Noriega 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests
5	But U.S. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away.Mr . Noriega 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests	From that point on , the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian 's misadventures
2	The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful	The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of Iran , as well-born as Nicaragua 's Anastasio Somoza , as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti 's Baby Doc Duvalier.Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them
2	The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along	He has mastered the art of survival
6	In keeping with America 's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega , recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival	Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama 's dire economic situation but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement
6	Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne	One Colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name
2	He is cornered	The Americans have left him without a way out
6	His chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses	Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos , who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation
8	The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959 , when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima , according to former U.S. intelligence officials	The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega 's half-brother , a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado.Luis Carlos , knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer , relayed Tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and , more important , among his officers and instructors
2	The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega 's half-brother , a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado	Luis Carlos , knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer , relayed Tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and , more important , among his officers and instructors
2	Luis Carlos relayed Tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and , more important , among his officers and instructors	A spy was born
2	It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega , who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina -- pineapple face	Born the illegitimate son of his father 's maid , he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City
2	In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed , French-made uniform , Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life	He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism , where officers were the elite with special privileges
9	Mr. Noriega 's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967	His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison , Major Omar Torrijos , gave him an intriguing assignment : Mr. Noriega would organize the province 's first intelligence service
8	His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison , Major Omar Torrijos , gave him an intriguing assignment	Mr. Noriega would organize the province 's first intelligence service
2	United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama 's national income	Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader
8	Mr. Noriega 's initial retainer was only $ 50 to $ 100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX	It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly
2	He did it very well	He started building the files that helped him gain power
2	A National Guard job assumed by Capt . Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy	By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information
2	By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information	He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistresses
9	So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles , which was ruled by United Fruit Co	The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control
8	He was superb	Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people
6	During his years in Chiriqui , however , Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious	Rodrigo Miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David , where he had his offices.Mr . Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office

2	Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office	People started wondering if something was wrong with him
6	But through this period , so far as the U.S. military was concerned , Mr. Noriega was a model recruit	He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967 , according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret
9	He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967 , according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret	He flew to Fort Bragg , N.C. , in September of that year for a course in psychological operations , returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called `` military intelligence for officers
10	Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely	He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama 's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier
9	He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama 's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier	He became Gen. Torrijos 's inseparable shadow , and the holder of all Panama 's secrets
5	He became Gen. Torrijos 's inseparable shadow , and the holder of all Panama 's secrets	Mr. Noriega , by now a lieutenant colonel , expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis , the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking
1	Mr. Noriega , by now a lieutenant colonel , expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis , the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking	When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega 's moonlighting , intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans
5	Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States	Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans
6	Even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns	During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers
5	During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers	One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination
2	that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S	Everybody was afraid of him
8	Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976 , when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army 's 470th Military Intelligence Group	The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos 's own phone , according to American intelligence officials
2	For the first time , the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense	In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy characters
2	In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy characters	The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you
10	Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others	Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration
10	The U.S. soon found new cause for concern : gun-running	Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza
2	At the time , though , in 1979 , the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy	Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon
9	Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon	Dade County and federal authorities , learning that he intended to fly through Miami , made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil
8	The Pentagon foiled the plan	According to military officers at the time , word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting
9	According to military officers at the time , word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting	On Monday , U.S. officials received a routine , unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama
8	Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback	Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen , the friend of Mr. Noriega , and the other four was dismissed on a technicality
10	Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback	Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen , the friend of Mr. Noriega , and the other four was dismissed on a technicality
5	Panamanian dictator Torrijos , he was told , had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington	Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega 's friend , Mr. Wittgreen , would be handling the shah 's security
2	Mr. Noriega 's friend , Mr. Wittgreen , would be handling the shah 's security	It would n't be a good idea to indict him -- much less Mr. Noriega
8	After prodding from Mr. Sanford , U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed	Unfortunately , '' Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter , `` those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control
2	if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now	If he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him
1	Soon , the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses	The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega 's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll
2	Although working for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively	During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas
5	During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas	He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges
8	But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would n't act against him because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua	the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama
2	Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama.Mr . Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.And on at least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua	Although , his help for the Contra cause was limited , it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration
8	Although , his help for the Contra cause was limited , it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration	Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin
6	An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials	Curtin Windsor , then the ambassador to Costa Rica , recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the Aswara Peninsula
2	being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the Aswara Peninsula	Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs , the U.S. ambassador to Panama , of the invitation
2	Briggs screamed	he was being set up for a `` honey trap

2	But the editorial , by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization , notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries	Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior '' around the world , the editorial says , through the enactment of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education
8	The NCI report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns	A higher proportion of black men smoke than white men

6	Key to the issue is that the bikes , in skillful hands , can go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror	An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance
6	For harried public-land managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates	The state of California , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles

6	But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users	I have a mountain bike , yet as a hiker I 've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them , '' says Gene Coan , an official at Sierra 's headquarters in San Francisco
2	fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers	many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy
6	To fight back , activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails	Mr. Langton 's group , Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association , mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing
5	Mr. Langton 's group , Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association , mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing	Biking groups in Montana , Idaho , Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions

9	The Soviets cut a deal with Iran : a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy	The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry
6	Moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces	Before his assassination in 1988 , President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn
5	Before his assassination in 1988 , President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn	Rep. Bill McCollum ( R. , Fla. ) reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards , ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms
8	In this they are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public	This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better , moderate leaders
2	At the last minute , however , Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar , perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists , with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces	The deal fell through , and Kandahar remains a major regime base
5	The resistance lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves	Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime
8	Instead , they were pressured by Pakistan 's ISI , the channel for their support , into attacking Jalalabad	They took more than 25 % casualties ; journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors

5	For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack	Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons
4	No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan people to give up their struggle	A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain
2	A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain	Creation of a new , realistic U.S. policy is long overdue
2	It is n't surprising that President Bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI	Though he nominally supports both programs , Mr. Bush has n't been a passionate champion of either cause , as Mr. Reagan was
1	What 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list	A combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives , a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility
8	But it 's like kicking your father in the pants	You hate to do it because he 's your father
1	You hate to do it because he 's your father	conservatives ' unhappiness with Mr. Bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out
6	Of course , neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI	Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February
2	and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best	Instead of focusing on the Contras , Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua 's Sandinista government
2	But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI	The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding
8	More ominous to SDI supporters , the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars	The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses
8	some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs	The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing
10	One longtime champion of these programs in Congress , Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia , is distracted by questions about his ethics , conservatives note	Other conservative champions , like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop , a longtime SDI advocate , do n't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan
8	neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support	For there to be wind in the sails of any program , the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails
6	All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm	What I 'd like to see , if he is up to it , is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI , '' the congressman says
8	His recent speech caused an uproar when its title leaked out	Mr. Allen 's commissioners voted to call his unread speech `` thoughtless , disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory
6	Mr. Allen 's commissioners voted to call his unread speech `` thoughtless , disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory	Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was `` another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman
7	Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was `` another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman	Rep. Don Edwards , the California Democrat , warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be `` outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction
7	Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was `` another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman . '' Rep. Don Edwards , the California Democrat , warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be `` outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction	Thomas Stoddard , head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund , called the prospect of the speech `` frankly shocking
8	Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts , a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals	He said that other participants in the conference `` do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual , '' but that `` I mean to persuade you to the opposite view
5	because it seems to `` assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity , of humaneness	Rights on such a basis , whether for blacks or homosexuals , are `` mere indulgences
8	the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals , not as members of certain select groups	His speech criticized the `` idiocy of notions of protected groups in society '' as opposed to individual equality
2	His speech criticized the `` idiocy of notions of protected groups in society '' as opposed to individual equality or , as he put it , in `` a common destiny as Americans	Instead of lobbying for special treatment that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk `` invidious retrenchment with government complicity
2	This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed	What 's really going on here
6	Mr. Allen has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights	He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation
9	He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation	Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again , which somehow elevated the vague concept of `` Indian rights '' above the rights of individual Indians
1	Indeed , the gap is so large that Mr. Allen 's critics refuse to engage the debate	Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument
5	Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument	Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement
2	Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement	We hope the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr. Allen in making the case for equality of civil rights
7	George L. LaMore , president and chief executive officer , will become chairman and chief executive upon Mr. Cunin 's retirement	John C. Dannemiller , executive vice president and chief operating officer , will become president and chief operating officer

1	The Soviet president and his prime minister , Nikolai Ryzhkov , spent the longest time , about 15 minutes , at the IBM stand , where they got souvenir computer-chip key rings	At the GM stall , they barely looked at a gleaming Cadillac , preferring to talk about cooperation possibilities
8	but the West 's embargo on military deals and uncertainty about the nation 's stability kept many foreign exhibitors away	Officials said 91 companies from 14 countries , including the U.S. , had displays , down from about 260 firms from more than 20 countries at the last show
5	Japanese air-conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd. was fined two million yen ( $ 14,000 ) for exporting to the Soviet Union a chemical solution that could be used in missile-guidance systems	A Daikin executive in charge of exports when the high-purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold to the Soviets in 1986 received a suspended 10-month jail sentence
8	A Soviet legislative panel rejected as not radical enough a government proposal on decentralizing economic control	the committee decided the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by Moscow to the country 's 15 republics `` does n't reflect the radical changes in the Soviet federation

2	Ending tax-free shopping in the European Community after 1992 could threaten more than 3,000 jobs	Instead of banning such shopping , the confederation proposed amending controls to be sure the privilege is n't abused
1	Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $ 63.1 million for the third quarter , more than double the year-before $ 24 million	Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $ 54.1 million , or 77 cents a share , in 1988 's third quarter
8	I 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand '' for Polaroid products	If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue , there is n't a lot here to base optimism on
5	If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue , there is n't a lot here to base optimism on	Polaroid officials told him yesterday that U.S. sales of the company 's new conventional film product , introduced in the second quarter , have been `` disappointing '' after a promising start
1	that the company has n't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise , discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already	the film , One Film , is currently carried at about 15,000 retail outlets , including drugstores and supermarkets

8	that `` circuit breakers '' put in place to damp volatility after the 1987 crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged Friday	The circuit breakers caused a 30-minute shutdown in trading in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling
5	With the futures-trading halt , you could only sell stocks '' to cut exposure to the market	It was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off

9	The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user.The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running	If it finds one of those passwords , Mr. Alexander said , the worm will do such things as change users ' passwords to a series of random numbers , preventing them from signing on to the network

6	Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts	Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v.Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers
1	it has never been statutorily defined	In 1983 , the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v.SEC decision
6	Gradually , however , lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point	Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman

9	After placing orders to sell , Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel , an investment banker at Kidder , Peabody & Co. , who was advising on the deal , to confirm these rumors	Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was
1	The illegal `` tip '' of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market	Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced : Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain
1	It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness	Arguably , both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky
8	Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors	After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method
2	After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method	When only civil liability is involved , this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization
8	Still , case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc ( and usually sleazy ) examples	When a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct , it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule
1	In the past , not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company , but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts	Today , after Mr. Freeman 's plea , there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient
8	The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime	In 1987 , the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v.U.S . to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues.Yet , late last year , Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of `` the intangible right of honest services . '' At a stroke , this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches ( and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee
2	Yet , late last year , Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of `` the intangible right of honest services	At a stroke , this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches
8	Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem : Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions , which the courts must thereafter interpret , than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility	We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway

8	Once again , your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions	In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. Greve informs your readers , `` . . . the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge '' ( `` Congress 's Environmental Buccaneers , '' Sept. 18 ) . This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong
2	the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do	it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge
2	but it is simply wrong	The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge
4	The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge	It requires that `` discharges of pollutants '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301
2	It requires that `` discharges of pollutants '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301	Whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects `` zero risk '' or `` zero discharge
0	Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress 's meaningless statement of `` the national goal '' in section 101 , which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985 , no less	This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972 , and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute
8	Thus , you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests , even facetiously , that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water	your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters , from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors

2	The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before	It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics
2	Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices	When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers
6	But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back	It now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales force

2	The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange	While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations
2	While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations	Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders
2	that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand	liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration
2	The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions	The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them
8	The study , by the CFTC 's division of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade	Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis does n't seem to have much economic impact
6	Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations	The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more
5	The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more	The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses
8	So far , one test of restricting dual trading has worked well	The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987.Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers.Traders who stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves . A Merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit

8	At the moment , however , the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive , David L. Paul	In an international buying spree that began barely two years ago , Mr. Paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works , including the Preti , at a total cost of $ 28 million . By midnight Oct. 6 , all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off , under orders from Florida 's comptroller , whose office regulates the state 's S & Ls.CenTrust did n't meet the deadline . The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S & L 's new office tower , designed by I.M . Pei.The rub is that the $ 28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist.Mr . Paul had no right to buy art for the S & L in the first place -- it is n't on the comptroller 's `` permissible '' list -- without seeking a special dispensation , which he did not do.Besides that , some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach

2	Although Mr. Paul has pared a $ 1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ 900 million since April , the high-yield debt market has plummeted	Divesting itself of what is left , as is required of all thrift institutions by July 1994 under the new federal S & L bailout law , may well prove difficult

6	and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting	Mr. Payson , an art dealer and collector , sold Vincent van Gogh 's `` Irises '' at a Sotheby 's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond
2	He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby 's auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York	There , on one of his first shopping trips , Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices
8	He paid $ 2.2 million , for instance , for a still life by Jan Jansz . den Uyl that was expected to fetch perhaps $ 700,000	The price paid was a record for the artist
5	Some 64 % of items offered at the Guterman auction were sold , at an average price of $ 343,333	The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids
1	And he tells me , ` If you want to see your paintings , you 'll have to come to my house in Florida	Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating
8	Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating	It 's just not true , '' he says

8	In March 1989 , just 15 months into his campaign , Mr. Paul was named by Art & Antiques magazine as one of the top 100 individual collectors in the U.S	An unknown quantity to most of the art world , Paul is no stranger to lavish spending , '' the magazine said
6	that he does n't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat	He recently bid $ 30,000 at a Paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world 's great chefs , but the final party cost closer to $ 100,000

5	In other words : Get rid of all the pictures	The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director
1	that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby 's	that he was `` merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment '' required for their safekeeping , until CenTrust 's new building was ready for them
5	For instance , he got a $ 3 million loan from the S & L , negotiated at a below-market rate	He owns 43 % of CenTrust 's shares
8	The $ 12 million lavished on the Rubens , for example , was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among scholars about its provenance	scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens

8	that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event	It sounds like with the Rubens he got absolutely taken to the cleaners
8	that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat	It 's not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $ 12 million , but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen
3	Still , predicting is tricky	I 'm forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices
2	Jonathan H. Kress , the son of the painting 's former owner , Mrs . Rush Kress , dismisses the price talk as `` sour grapes	Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out

8	Robert Crandall , with the Brookings Institute , agrees	Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it 's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills
3	Not to mention the incursion of imports	Japanese and European steelmakers are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992
6	Moreover , the U.S. can expect more competition from low-cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries	A Taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a Nucor-like plant

Carr of Kenyon & Kenyon , showed that `` he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project '' in an effort to avoid infringement	Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid 's patent positions , '' and Kodak followed his advice in every instance
2	the fact that seven patents were infringed `` suggests that infringement was willful	It 's difficult to be that consistently wrong
2	because it would result in a larger award	it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by Kodak if Kodak had n't entered the market
6	Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor to testify on that issue	Kodak hired Robert Buzzell and Polaroid brought in Robert J. Dolan

5	Options traders who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling	They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss

8	on-site massage is certainly infiltrating corporate America	In some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office , fearful that upper-level executives wo n't approve
2	The blood flows to your head , you feel lightheaded and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck	When you leave the room after your massage , people say you look like you 're glowing
6	Not everyone , however , is at ease with office massage	Three years ago , the Internal Revenue Service 's office in San Jose , Calif. , opened its doors to on-site massage.And even though employees paid the bill , taxpayers grumbled
2	Last month , the complaints intensified and the massages ended	Now we 're looking for a room with thicker walls
2	Massage also has an image problem to contend with	Some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves `` bodyworkers '' and describing their office visits as `` reinvigoration breaks
2	Phil Harms , a software engineer , was an eager customer	You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day

5	Many loans are being renegotiated , especially those tied to the hotel sector , which has been hit hard by a post-June 4 tourism slump	Many bankers view property-sector loans as particularly risky

8	Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it 's expensive	In my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry

9	Traders nervously watching their Quotron electronic-data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummet 99 points in seconds	A minute later it soared 128 points
8	It was crazy	It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane
2	But those who said `` This ca n't be happening '' were right	The Quotrons were wrong
8	Quotron Systems Inc. , a Citicorp unit , blamed the 30-minute foul-up on `` a timing problem in our software '' caused by the enormous early volume	The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct but the average was wrong
6	Meanwhile , there was an awful lot of confusion	At about 10:40 a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm , a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked , `` What 's going on ? Is the market up or down
6	And there were other blunders	When the market opened at 9:30 a.m. EST , a reporter for the Reuters newswire miscalculated the industrial average 's drop as a 4 % decline when it really was down 0.7 %

2	Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago	Since the crash , many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S & P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them
8	More than 400 traders jammed the S & P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell	Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am
9	But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher	The market hovered near Friday 's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour , moving several index points higher or lower in seconds , then broke higher and did n't look back
2	Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart	You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune
8	Several of Wall Street 's largest securities firms , including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc. , were also large buyers	Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week

1	I was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight	Now , I feel maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria
6	Analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors	Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management , citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later , says , `` We 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986
8	Junk bonds are a highly stratified market	There 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good
6	Analysts at Standard & Poor 's say junk bond offerings by `` tightly stretched '' issuers seem to be growing	Almost $ 8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from SCI TV , Gillette Holdings ( not related to Gillette Co. ) , Interco , Seaman Furniture , Allied Stores , Federated Department Stores , National Gypsum , M.D.C. Holdings , Micropolis , Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications

1	Mr. Trump withdrew his bid before the AMR board ever formally considered it	AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses , from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees , a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass , or both
5	AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs	Yesterday , Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress , saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives
6	Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump might come back with a lower bid	Ray Neidl of Dillon Read & Co. said Mr. Trump `` is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle

2	Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders	The group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around

2	they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes	If they were to insist on a low bid of , say $ 200 a share , the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose
2	Also , because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots ' bid , the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders	That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder
8	The bill would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget	to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization
9	But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold	That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold
2	It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved	The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S & Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes
8	Absent other working capital the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets	We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward
5	That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian	The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility

8	PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash	In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night
8	The new PaineWebber commercial features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish	Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle . . . .

6	With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach	At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon

6	In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach	He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed
2	So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup	If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen
6	On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts	Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17
5	Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17	The A-men batting Nos . 6 through 9 , a.k.a . the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision
5	The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs ( 29 of 39 ) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all	That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters
8	but they observe them in relative calm	Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see
6	A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams	I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday.I love 'em both.The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go
5	I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday	I love 'em both
2	I love 'em both	The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games
1	although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else	Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox ( hey , it 's possible ) , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans
6	Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for	In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery
8	there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery	He was flawless afield ( ditto in game two ) , moved a runner along in the A 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally
0	Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph	Not his autograph
8	An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation	He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run
8	He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run	When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously
1	They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs	They went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero homers and ribbies
2	It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come	I believe in the law of averages
2	I believe in the law of averages	I 'd rather see a so-so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold
8	But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side	When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said

1	the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation	It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it
5	The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest	If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days

6	After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose	The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours

7	If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour	if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours
2	It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic	A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself.But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices
8	What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds	The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index.Options markets stopped trading in many securities.The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open .

2	It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively	Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them
1	It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers	To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none
2	Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions	It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open
2	It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open	Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline

2	Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line	The question is how long it 's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution
8	The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim	The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992

8	Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic `` stop-loss '' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels	Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including computer-guided program traders
8	Now , at 3:07 , one of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the S & P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials	Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted in Chicago

2	And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading	It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront
5	As the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss Friday , the S & P pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit	2,000 S & P contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of $ 330 million in stock

2	that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout	their customers would like it very much
1	America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be	that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets , they might not miss one at all
6	Indeed , a random check Friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations	Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time

2	The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , John Hoyt Stookey , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased Quantum 's reliance on plastics	The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years
2	But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum 's profit is plummeting	Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter
8	To a degree , Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life	Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices eroding
8	And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them	We were all wonderful heroes last year Now we 're at the bottom of the heap
1	We were all wonderful heroes last year	Now we 're at the bottom of the heap
2	At Quantum the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics	the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986
6	In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive	Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents
8	By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year	China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them
8	to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up	People were even hoarding bags

3	I say 1992	that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity
8	A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy	The company is trying to carry out a three-year , $ 1.3 billion plant-expansion program started this year
1	Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases	Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation
8	On top of everything else , Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris , Ill	After an explosion idled the plant in June , the company progressed in September to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it.Then a second explosion occurred.Two workers died and six remain in the hospital
2	Then a second explosion occurred	Two workers died and six remain in the hospital
2	This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes	Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards
2	A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum 's financial future	When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward.But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting
2	Not everything looks grim for Quantum	The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity

5	which is n't included in the quota program	Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel
8	It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments	The U.S. termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension
1	Mexico virtually doubled its quota to 0.95 % of the U.S. steel market from 0.48 % under the previous quotas	South Korea is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 %
7	Mexico virtually doubled its quota to 0.95 % of the U.S. steel market from 0.48 % under the previous quotas	South Korea is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 %
5	South Korea is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 %	That increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included
6	The EC and Japan -- the U.S. 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent	The EC steel industry has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 %
5	The EC steel industry has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 %	Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5 % of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9 %
5	Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program	The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela
8	The U.S. had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks	That was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting Japan 's allowance
5	Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30	Revenue totaled $ 5 million
1	Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30.Revenue totaled $ 5 million	that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million
2	The lower results reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , Elcotel 's primary business	Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas
8	Foremost among those is the company 's entrance into the public facsimile business	Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country
5	Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines , made by Minolta in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country	Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data
8	Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls	Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone not just phones produced by Elcotel
2	The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets	They do n't want to get caught again
9	that shipments to Phoenix started late last month	the company will study results from this market before expanding to others
2	Superconcentrates are n't entirely new for P & G	The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack
8	after watching the success of Attack	When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P & G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 %
1	When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P & G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 %	With the help of Lemon Cheer , P & G 's share is now estimated to be 12 %
2	With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more	many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine
1	it will take up less shelf space	When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better
2	But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case	If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates
0	Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S	To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P & G , which has about 23 % of the market
6	Some believe P & G 's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese	This is something P & G would do with or without Kao , '' says Mr. Zurkuhlen
2	With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening , many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills	They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S
2	Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view	Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher
8	Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade	He said such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan
0	that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action	that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest
6	American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills	Many called it simply a contrast in styles
1	But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic	Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand
1	I think my line has been very consistent	I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement
1	I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement	I do n't feel very ferocious
8	I do n't feel very ferocious	I do n't feel either hard or soft
4	I do n't feel either hard or soft	I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade
5	Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill	She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified
8	But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition	She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets
8	At her news conference for Japanese reporters , one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief	My impression was that you would be a scary old lady , '' he said
5	The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years	Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise
2	I am against managed trade	I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market
1	The company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results	In the latest nine months net income was $ 4.7 million , or $ 1.31 a share , on revenue of $ 44.3 million
5	Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability	The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak
8	Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene	It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound
1	It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound	A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents
2	Beginning in mid-1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand	Companies added capacity furiously
1	Companies added capacity furiously	Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower
8	Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker	Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year
2	Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize	The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period
8	many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter	During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits
2	Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year	Prices have stayed well above most companies ' expectations
2	Prices have stayed well above most companies ' expectations	Demand has been much stronger than anticipated
2	Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter	We could see higher oil prices this year
6	While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse	In the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988
8	The main reason remains weather	Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use
8	that Olivetti exported $ 25 million in `` embargoed , state-of-the-art , flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry	Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984
10	A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom , but declined to confirm any details	Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules
5	A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom , but declined to confirm any details	Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules
8	the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community	It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting
6	The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies	Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods.But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc
2	However , these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization	There 's no evidence that the Soviet program to ( illegally ) acquire Western technology has diminished
2	The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK $ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % .In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , the shares closed Wednesday at HK $ 4.80 each	At this price , the shares would have to rise above HK $ 6.05 for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants
5	In a suit filed in federal court Thursday , the S & L alleged that a `` disproportionate number '' of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value	Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million
1	But HOFI 's first offer would have given Ideal 's other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company	Ideal 's directors rejected that offer , although they said they endorsed the merger proposal
8	the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments	that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels
2	The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels	It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988
2	But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year	Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level
6	Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level	On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged
2	In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans	it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings

8	Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop	It was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million 90-pound boxes , compared with 146.6 million boxes last season
2	However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55	Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time
2	Brazilian juice is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities	Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in plentiful supply
2	The price cut appeared to be aimed even more at Europe , where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen	It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe
5	New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear	Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak

8	This market still wants to go higher , '' said Nauman Barakat , a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc	He predicted that the November contract will reach $ 21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange
1	There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets	Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes
2	There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell	Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria

5	But { otherwise } it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by management	any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi
1	The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back	That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1

8	Ms. Cunningham , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall	She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` Babylonian Bronx , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue

7	Her friend Susan , whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents ' bedroom , as though she were a temporary visitor	Her friend Diana 's father was a professional thief ; they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all
6	Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting	When Rosie died , her uncles moved in

6	Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think Friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating	This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations , rather than to any fundamentals , '' said John Young , chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. , whose shares dropped $ 3.125 to $ 48.125

5	There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy	The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem
8	Indeed , one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday 's events was Robert Crandall , chairman of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump	Asked whether Friday 's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate , Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said : `` No comment

2	In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill	tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom

8	Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways	Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it ; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad
1	Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it	Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad
2	The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan , the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren	In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court
1	In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court	Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions
8	But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech	Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , '' he said
5	Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future	He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt
8	but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights	We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month
6	a point that has n't escaped legal scholars	Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents
8	Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents	The dissenters in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . `` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , '' he says
1	The dissenters in the Warren Court appeared to be writing for the short-term	Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future
8	Justice Blackmun also seems feisty about his new role	Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues
8	But his level of frustration showed in a recent , impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago	He concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late Martin Luther King 's famous `` I Have a Dream '' speech from the 1963 March on Washington
8	it also differs in an important way from recent history	The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created
5	Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C	A Canadian bank bought another thrift , in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank
5	Under these deals , the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets	These `` clean-bank '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later

7	Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives	cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million
8	Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers	In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation
6	Besides , Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky	Giveaways just give people the wrong image , '' said Mr. Heinemann
2	Giveaways just give people the wrong image	That perception takes the focus off the magazine
8	Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers	What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said Mr. Heinemann
8	What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it	We are trying to create quality and involvement
6	Still , Time 's move is being received well , once again	It 's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more , '' said Michael Drexler , national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency

2	Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm	CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale
8	Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin	You ca n't live on that
2	So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel	Tonight , to kick off the effort , CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts
5	The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty	To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program
5	To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program	It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers
2	But that wo n't be easy	Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change
8	The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive	Already , CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel
2	CNN wants to change its viewers ' habits	Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research
1	Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research	That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks
5	That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks	The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels
2	Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service	It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks
5	It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks	It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look
8	Now , the push is on for more-distinctive shows	Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity

2	The evening news is also slated as CNN 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism	In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC
2	She 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly , in-depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories	the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS
6	that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces	They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour
5	The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less-experienced work force	CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks
2	CNN is my wire service	they 're on top of everything
2	In any case , cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN 's format	They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage

5	analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline	Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall

5	In March , regulators labeled CenTrust a `` troubled institution , '' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses	In the same month , the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track

8	CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds	The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market
2	Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market	The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate

7	One annual co-production , the three-hour-long `` Eurovision Song Contest has been described as the world 's most boring TV show	Another , `` Jeux Sans Frontieres is a hit in France
1	Another , `` Jeux Sans Frontieres is a hit in France	A U.S.-made imitation under the title `` Almost Anything Goes '' flopped fast
2	For the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason	The cream of the British crop , the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as `` Masterpiece Theater , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time
1	The cream of the British crop , the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as `` Masterpiece Theater , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time	Most British programming is more of an acquired taste
6	The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns	A French knock-off of `` Dallas , '' called `` Chateauvallon '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in France
7	A French knock-off of `` Dallas , '' called `` Chateauvallon '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in France , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident	Schwarzwaldklinik , '' ( Black Forest Clinic ) , a kind of German `` St.Elsewhere '' set in a health spa , is popular in Germany , and has spread into France
8	Italy 's most popular series is a drama called `` La Piovra , '' or `` The Octopus , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia	It was front-page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series

8	The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with American programs second	Given a choice , everybody will watch a home-produced show
1	Thus , Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal	We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see
2	Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising	Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication
6	Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly	Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time
2	Sky Channel , a British-based venture of Australian-American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch , offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience	The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures
6	The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures	In a Madrid hotel room recently , a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , only to be urged by the British announcer to `` stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo
2	After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance	The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end
5	The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting	In recent months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture
5	Already , British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system	Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC , a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit
2	But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid	GEC plans first to study Ferranti 's financial accounts
2	Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators	Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry
8	it is n't interested in Ferranti	We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official said Sunday
2	The missile venture is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting	For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries
2	The venture 's importance for Thomson is great	the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans

1	that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate	Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level
8	The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas	volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s
2	the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly	The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration
2	Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports	That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico
5	Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system	The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day
5	At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract	The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T.

2	It 's hard to know what to expect at this point	The industry defies characterization
8	Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer	In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share . This month , however , Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 had n't met expectations

8	In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays	Until recently , Adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last month Apple , Adobe 's biggest customer , and Microsoft rebelled
2	The short-term outlook for Adobe 's business , however , appears strong	The company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers sold by Apple
2	Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems spells trouble for software firms generally	It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales
8	The gap between winners and laggards will grow	In personal computers , Apple , Compaq and IBM are expected to tighten their hold on their business.At the same time , second-tier firms will continue to lose ground

8	IOWA IS MAKING a comeback.So are Indiana , Ohio and Michigan	The population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s
1	Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people	Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin
8	The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race	Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980
8	At the same time , several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround	Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population
1	This does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone , however	That share has remained at about 24 % since 1970
8	What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives , such as children	In 1988 , 10 % of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses , down from 15 % in 1970
8	Like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives	Only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970
8	At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman indicates	Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families
5	Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families	Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group
8	Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich	Average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000
2	The goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups , the upper-middle class	Although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one-third of discretionary income
5	Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it	Twenty percent do n't even feel they are financially well off
6	Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either	About 40 % do n't feel they 're more able than others

8	This small Dallas suburb 's got trouble	Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool
2	The council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years	Obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on
8	Obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on	Pool is hot in New York and Chicago where `` upscale , suit-and-tie places '' are adding tables
2	Pool is hot in New York and Chicago where `` upscale , suit-and-tie places '' are adding tables	With today 's tougher drunk driving laws people do n't want to just sit around and drink
5	where rooms average $ 200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ 3.50 a pop	At the lounge , manager Elizabeth Dyer wo n't admit patrons in jeans , T-shirts or tennis shoes
6	But a majority of the Addison council did n't buy those arguments	Introducing pool , argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker , would be `` dangerous
2	Introducing pool would be `` dangerous	It would open a can of worms
2	Addison is no stranger to cans of worms , either	After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's coffers for trips and retreats
1	The revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested	Now comes the pool flap
5	I think there 's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous	I thought this was all taken care of in ` The Music Man
4	For instance : `` Haole '' ( white ) is not the ultimate insult	Mainland haole '' is
8	For instance : `` Haole '' ( white ) is not the ultimate insult ; `` Mainland haole '' is.Richard Chamberlain dresses as a `` Mainland haole , '' tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves.And the local expression for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah . '' And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty , if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left , not right , ear	Sorry , the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color
8	Of all the ethnic tensions in America , which is the most troublesome right now	A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City
2	Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason , the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights ( 9:30-10 p.m. EDT )	Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup
8	Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice	Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically
5	Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically	He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically
5	He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically	He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa
4	Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language	As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular
8	Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular	He said Jews were `` sick with complexes
3	that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur	People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
8	Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect	Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict
2	Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict	That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences
2	Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer	The question is , if group conflicts still exist ( as undeniably they do ) , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam
1	Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy	It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer
8	It 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants	At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie
2	At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie	It could n't be more obvious that `` Chicken Soup '' is being made from an old recipe
1	Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all	So far , the bubbles have been few and far between
8	So far , the bubbles have been few and far between	Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms to preach about social issues
8	Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms to preach about social issues	To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them
1	For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona
8	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona	The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end ( and occasionally in the middle ) , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself
2	I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz	That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer
2	But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America	At your age , Jackie , you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame
5	The underlying economy remains sound	There is nothing wrong with the economy
8	There is nothing wrong with the economy	all the indices are up
8	Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit	Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases
2	that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill	We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains
6	Opponents of the cut are playing hardball	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut
1	The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress	Because the legislation has n't been completed , President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
1	Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill	The House appears reluctant to join the senators
8	The House appears reluctant to join the senators	A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions
6	The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions	These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures
1	To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare	To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken
2	We 're looking like idiots	Things had just gone too far
5	that the move required sacrifice by every senator	It worked because there were no exceptions
5	In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long-distance telephone calls	It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting
7	Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties	A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised
2	The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell	Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill
8	The deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years	The revenue-raising provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would : -- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs , effective Aug. 2 , 1989 . -- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received , effective the day after the tax bill is enacted . -- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective June 6 , 1989 , that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers.The measure repeals a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns less than 30 % of the employer 's stock . -- Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as zero-coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest payments . -- Raise $ 851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes . -- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies , effective August 1990 . -- Impose a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals , such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam , beginning at $ 1.10 a pound starting next year . -- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding . -- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly , effective next year . -- Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash . -- Increase to $ 6 a person from $ 3 the international air-passenger departure tax , and impose a $ 3-a-person tax on international departures by commercial ships

8	I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion	The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity

6	Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true	He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials

Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ? Such as , what happened when Congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost	No , Mr. Lantos 's complaints simply wo n't wash
4	No , to my mind , the Journal did not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust	it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense
2	The system is the problem , not an individual member	Individuals can always have their hands slapped
1	Individuals can always have their hands slapped	It 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble
8	But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency ( and , yes , maybe criminality ) within HUD could possibly generate	The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` Tail Gunner Joe '' McCarthy did his work
5	The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself	This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
5	Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter	He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
8	He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution	Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
2	Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution	Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify
2	one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution	The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime
8	Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime	Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination
2	We could n't get dealers to answer their phones	It was { like } the Friday before Black Monday '' two years ago
8	Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29	Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading
1	Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors	Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades
5	It was the last hour of trading on a Friday	There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots
8	There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots	It was n't intentional , we were all busy
2	It was just like two years ago	Everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time
5	On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to	When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast
8	When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast	Two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices
8	some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares	Everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid
2	the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987	Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit.I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now
1	Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit	I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now
1	that Piper Jaffray actually made money on Friday	It helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago
5	The pace of trading was orderly	Nasdaq 's Small Order Execution System `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr. Hardiman
2	In the past , the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation	Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent
6	But they are worried	We were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter
1	some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears	It wo n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail investors
1	retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt	Institutional investors were calmer
2	We had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic	If they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf
8	Nasdaq 's biggest stocks were hammered	The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33
5	The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33	The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2 % , or 9.31 , to 462.98
1	McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 1/2 , to 40	LIN Broadcasting , dropped 5 1/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1/2
1	McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 1/2 , to 40.LIN Broadcasting , dropped 5 1/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1/2	The turnover in both issues was roughly normal
2	On a day when negative takeover-related news did n't sit well with investors , Commercial Intertech , a maker of engineered metal parts , said Haas & Partners advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported $ 27.50-a-share bid to buy the company	Commercial Intertech plummeted 6 to 26
6	The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday	On the OTC market , First Executive , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 1/4
7	Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1/8 to 33 7/8	Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1/8 to 19 1/2
7	Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1/8 to 33 7/8 ; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1/8 to 19 1/2	the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1/4 to 10 1/4
7	Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1/8 to 33 7/8 ; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1/8 to 19 1/2 ; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1/4 to 10 1/4	MCI Communications slipped 2 1/4 to 43 1/2

2	These rate indications are n't directly comparable	lending practices vary widely by location
8	To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today	They could still panic and bail out of the market
5	Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart	He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further
8	Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday 's rout shaved $ 40 million from the value of the $ 752 million Janus Fund he oversees	I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through Then he jumped into the market : `` I spent $ 30 million in the last half-hour
6	Other money managers also opened their wallets	I was buying at the close ( Friday ) and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn
2	I was buying at the close ( Friday ) and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value	There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash
5	big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock	Most often , they do just that
8	The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad	Those that pulled out ( of stocks ) regretted it
2	Stocks , as measured by the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends	Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades
2	Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days	It can happen before you can turn around
5	It can happen before you can turn around	he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading
8	he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading	The only thing you do n't have `` is the ` portfolio insurance ' phenomenon overlaid on the rest
1	Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S & P futures contracts	In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected
6	Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday	Neil Weisman said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands
8	stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , trapping more investors	it will be a rigor mortis rally
8	All that now has changed	We 're ahead for the year because of Friday
8	We 're ahead for the year because of Friday	We 're not making a killing , but we had a good day
1	it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin	Bolar has denied that it switched the brand-name product for its own in such testing
2	Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV	the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders
5	A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue	He termed ASKO 's legal actions as `` unproductive '' to international cooperation among European retailers
2	There are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with Japan , that have to be the subject of major initiatives	I 'd like to see that initiative
8	I 'd like to see that initiative , and I have n't	There is n't a big shot , an agenda
2	The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill	We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices
8	For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy	The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting
1	The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower	the Fed has been resisting
2	The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting	One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board
8	And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines	Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through
8	In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash	Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold.The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve.And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous
7	Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold	The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy
2	But a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year	Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement
8	the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble	Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession That did not happen
1	Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession	That did not happen
4	That did not happen	They learned they could survive it without much problem
2	In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around	There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut
6	there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds	At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it
9	Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it	Asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : `` The adminstration will have to speak for itself
2	The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion	Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here
6	But some players were quick to seize the moment	Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains
8	Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains	Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said
2	And I think institutions are going to come in and buy	I 'm going to hold on
2	I 'm going to hold on	If I sell now , I 'll take a big loss
6	Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in 1987	Oh , I bet it 'll be up 50 points on Monday , '' said Lucy Crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington , Ky
5	Oh , I bet it 'll be up 50 points on Monday , '' said Lucy Crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington , Ky	Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , `` but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more
2	In fact , some of the association 's members welcomed the drop in prices	We hope to take advantage of it
8	We hope to take advantage of it , '' said John Snyder , a member of a Los Angeles investors ' club	He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants
8	the market drop is one of `` a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending	There 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders
2	she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it	I have this feeling that it 's built on sand
2	I have this feeling that it 's built on sand that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it	She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash
6	Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand	We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot , '' said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg
2	We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot	We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime , come on back
1	We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime , come on back	Now it 's happening again
1	Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared	This time he 's ready to buy in `` when the panic wears off
2	We ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often	When the little guy gets frightened , the big guys hurt badly
8	When the little guy gets frightened , the big guys hurt badly	Merrill Lynch ca n't survive without the little guy
5	Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday , but mostly through mutual funds	Discount brokerage customers `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago
5	Discount brokerage customers `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago	Schwab customers `` have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks
2	Schwab customers `` have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks	Individual investors are still angry about program trading
6	But it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried	Alan Helfman , general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston , said he and his mother have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry
6	And , finally , there were the gloaters	I got out in 1987.Everything , '' said Pascal Antori , an Akron , Ohio , plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments ' LaSalle Street office
8	I got out in 1987.Everything	I just stopped by to see how much I would have lost

6	Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market	One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and two others have introduced even smaller `` palmtops
8	Compaq 's notebooks , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines	Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market
5	Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000	All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases
2	and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly	One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name
8	One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name	This is n't quite a notebook -- I call it a phonebook
2	That ca n't be said of the $ 2,400 notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corp. , a unit of Tandy	Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to `` read '' block printing
2	Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to `` read '' block printing	At 4 1/2 pounds , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth
6	Palmtops are n't far behind	Atari Corp. 's Portfolio weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs
1	At stake is what Mike Swavely , Compaq 's president of North America operations , calls `` the Holy Grail of the computer industry '' -- the search for `` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere	The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be
8	The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be	I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is
1	I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is	Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter
2	Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter	It 's huge
8	Consider the growth of portables , which now comprise 12 % of all personal computer sales	Laptops have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year
8	Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises	Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory
2	Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises	Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory
1	A Poquet spokesman , for example , criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two	Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue that they 're too small
2	a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups	Poquet , trying to avoid the `` gadget '' label , responded with the tag line , `` The Poquet PC -- a Very Big Computer
2	Despite the sniping , few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises	Toward that end the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq
6	Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith 's market share	Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an `` unconventional '' two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1/2-inch disk
1	Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an `` unconventional '' two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1/2-inch disk	John P. Frank , president of Zenith Data Systems , simply shrugs off such criticism
8	that 3 1/2-inch floppies were also `` unconventional '' when they first replaced five-inch disks	We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard
6	Analysts do n't see it that way	I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , '' says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc
5	Analysts do n't see it that way . `` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , '' says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc	Adds Bill Lempesis , senior industry analyst for DataQuest , a high-technology market research firm : `` We basically think that these are very hot products
8	We basically think that these are very hot products	The problem Compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them
5	Toshiba 's line of portables , for example , features the T-1000 and the T-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size	A third model , marketed in Japan , may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players
5	And among the issues hitting new highs were Detroit Edison Co. and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp	Other major issues hitting highs included American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , Westinghouse Electric Corp. , Exxon Corp. and Cigna Corp. , the big insurer
6	Of course , many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows	These included International Business Machines Corp. , which during Friday 's session traded below $ 100 a share for the first time since June 1984
5	These included International Business Machines Corp. , which during Friday 's session traded below $ 100 a share for the first time since June 1984	IBM closed at $ 102 , down $ 5.625
9	These included International Business Machines Corp. , which during Friday 's session traded below $ 100 a share for the first time since June 1984	IBM closed at $ 102 , down $ 5.625
8	Meanwhile , two initial public offerings braved the cascading market in their maiden day of national over-the-counter trading Friday	Shares of Rally 's Inc. , an operator of fast-food restaurants , closed at $ 17 each , up from its $ 15 offering price and shares of Employee Benefit Plans Inc. , a health-care consultant , closed at $ 14.125 , up from its $ 12 offering price
5	The No . 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the British luxury-car maker , the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions	General Motors Corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares

9	Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value	If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities
6	But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls	Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said
2	he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers	Schwab had increased margin requirements
2	Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion	We learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility
2	I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs	Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements

2	and having it run one hour is the best way to it	This will raise the energy level of the show
10	Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week	Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino , Calif. , company will report revenue of $ 430 million to $ 460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share
8	That will spur Tandem 's growth	I 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20 % next year
8	But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue 's machines	The answer is n't price reductions , but new systems
5	Nevertheless , Tandem faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to IBM 's mainframes	Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion , insisting that Tandem 's new machines are n't replacements for IBM 's mainframes
2	Do n't jump yet	The stock market 's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy
8	In one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for weeks	It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar
2	It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar	The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed , the entire economy
2	This may sound strangely optimistic	After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy
8	After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy	When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed
2	That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable	The 1987 crash was `` a false alarm however you view it
8	The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation	Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy
8	Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy	The market today has a life of its own
2	Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week	Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance
5	Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance	The financial-services industry was battered by the 1987 crash
2	What 's more , although the stock market is far less overvalued today than two years ago , the U.S. economy is weaker	Growth is slower
6	What 's more , although the stock market is far less overvalued today than two years ago , the U.S. economy is weaker	Growth is slower
7	Growth is slower	Profits are softer
7	Growth is slower.Profits are softer	Debt burdens are heavier
8	But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate	The Fed is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets
1	The Fed is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets	Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies
8	Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals	The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar
1	A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S	That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S
8	Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting	In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % .The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which ended two weeks ago
1	In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 %	that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989
