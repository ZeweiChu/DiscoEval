10	He launched into Saint-Saens 's `` The Swan '' from `` Carnival of the Animals , '' a favorite encore piece for cellists , with lovely , glossy tone and no bite	he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens 's Sonata for Clarinet , a whimsical , puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality
6	Then , as if to show that he could play fast as well , he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens 's Sonata for Clarinet , a whimsical , puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality	so it went through the first half : an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none that would disturb or challenge a listener

6	At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility	The researchers pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop
10	They attached a second gene , for herbicide resistance , to the pollen-inhibiting gene	Both genes are inserted into a few greenhouse plants

6	A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion	the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings , in two important ways
6	It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past	it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities

3	he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future	Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market
2	If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future	economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest
11	These fears were clearly apparent	last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding
1	These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding	the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika
6	Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled	does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika
6	Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika	the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform
1	that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika	is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill
6	But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill	has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise
7	An alternative and more convincing explanation , confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program , is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market	while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state , strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market
1	For example strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market	the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state

7	The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers	Private dressmaking is allowed in 10 Soviet republics but banned by five ; shoemaking is allowed in seven but illegal in nine
10	The controls on cooperatives appeared relatively liberal	first introduced
1	The controls on cooperatives appeared relatively liberal when first introduced	that changed following a resolution from the Supreme Soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy , and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state
3	and permitting activity in others	the cooperatives are under contract to the state
6	All independent media activity is now illegal , which perhaps is not surprising	so is the manufacture of perfume , cosmetics , household chemicals and sand candles
3	these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless	Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market
1	that he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought	Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls
2	We do not share this approach	it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country
6	Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons , and the market for fear of the social ( political ) consequences , Mr. Gorbachev seeks a `` third way '' that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter	Mr. Gorbachev 's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism , whose architects spoke specifically of a `` third way '' : of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism
1	The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an `` organic '' society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified , and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation	a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause , rather than resolve , conflict
11	The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident	Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress
6	he rejected a socialist planned economy	embraced the free market
5	In doing so , he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market	he proposed a `` law-governed economy , '' in which there would be a `` clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management
1	To ensure the loyalty of the business sector , Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests , probably by restricting competition	Mr. Gorbachev must ensure that within this `` alliance '' the business sector remains subordinate to the party
5	that a cooperative be closed	its prices be reduced
1	The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev 's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism	Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor , capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo

2	And sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers	general retail centers such as ComputerLand have little presence in Japan

6	For a woman whose period is late , using RU-486 means no waiting , no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics , and no feet up in stirrups for surgery	It means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant
2	RU-486 is being administered in France only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor	a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines ; an initial visit for medical screening and to take the pill , a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin , administered either via injection or vaginal suppository , and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted
6	Thus , a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines ; an initial visit for medical screening ( anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated ) and to take the pill , a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin , administered either via injection or vaginal suppository , and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted	because timing is so critical with RU-486 , she will learn , via a pelvic examination and ultrasound , not only that she is pregnant , but just how pregnant she is
2	Furthermore she will learn , via a pelvic examination and ultrasound , not only that she is pregnant , but just how pregnant she is	timing is so critical with RU-486

6	That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion ( annualized ) rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989	These revised figures may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar
1	Too early to tell	a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture

0	Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant	researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells
10	An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant	the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged
2	Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth	for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired
2	A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom one copy is damaged early in life , is especially prone to cancer	he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop
10	The Dedham , Mass. , couple knew that any child of theirs had a 50 % chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma , an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births	Bonnie became pregnant in 1987

11	after his mother had suffered the same fate	she was a baby
2	that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene	and faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer
1	All this may not be obvious to the public , which is concerned about advances in treatment	I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon
10	Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986	last spring , researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which , if impaired , turns healthy colon cells cancerous
3	which turns healthy colon cells cancerous	impaired
3	that they are especially prone to cancer	people inherit defective versions of these genes
11	The tumor developed	the second , normal copy also was damaged
0	when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects	there was no way to prove Dr. Knudson 's `` two-hit '' theory
1	Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes	under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes
1	He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer	he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared
10	But he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared	a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer
1	It was an audacious claim	in Baltimore , Dr. Vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School , believed Dr. Knudson was right , and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers
10	and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers	Dr. Vogelstein turned his attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer
2	colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes	it often seems to develop in stages
9	It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages	a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring
3	benign polyps would develop	both copies of a certain gene were knocked out
3	the polyps would progress to malignancy	both copies of a second gene were then deleted
10	benign polyps would develop	If both copies of a second gene were deleted
1	It was the confirming evidence we all needed that { gene } losses were critical to the development of a common tumor	Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy
3	that flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy	damaged
10	Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over	they found it last winter
1	The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53	Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth
1	But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth	the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth
10	Despite that they found the two were identical	the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine 's p53 gene

3	that the gene may predispose women to the cancer	inherited in a damaged form
6	In a report out last week , John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene	There are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin cancers
6	people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer	that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too

11	From 1980 to 1988 the government issued $ 394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $ 756 billion of new primary loan guarantees	federal budget deficits totaled $ 1.41 trillion

3	collecting the debt defeats the original goal	the program is meant to provide a subsidy
2	If the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal	subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time
3	government should issue credit	it intends to use every legal method to collect
1	Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time	credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets
7	In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets	legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector.Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds
1	In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets	this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans
9	There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program.If the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal	student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral.The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount.High default rates , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high.Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates
11	and government coverage of all interest costs	the student is in school
11	paying it back	the student graduates
1	The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount	a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rates
11	interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance	the student was in school
6	Reducing those rates moderately ( say , to 75 % ) would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers	it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers , and go a long way toward reducing defaults

7	But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers , and go a long way toward reducing defaults	the Small Business Administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its Preferred Lenders ' Program
2	the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low	the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts
6	Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts , the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low	it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off
3	In addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan	existing debts are not paid off
0	In addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan	existing debts are not paid off
2	a new $ 1 direct loan is treated as a $ 1 expenditure	the budget measures cash flow

10	Loan guarantees do n't appear at all	the borrower defaults
2	Loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the borrower defaults	new guarantees do not raise the deficit

11	As for the humor that Gorky 's text provides it looks and sounds forced	repainted in such broad strokes ( particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble )
11	Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words	she wants , as she so often does want , to express herself through Gorky 's helpless play

6	But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured	People who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed
3	that those premiums are n't insured	the institutions that issued the CDs failed
1	that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed	those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid
