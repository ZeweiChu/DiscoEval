10	California Gov . George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse , blaming the disaster on substandard construction	touring the area

1	there are many obstacles , including cost	as for safety double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale
1	Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday	most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks , and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable , or `` liquefy , '' in a major quake
1	they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal `` ties '' that run horizontally through the column	the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement
1	Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes , with spiraling steel rods inside	in the case of the Nimitz Freeway , the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below
6	Basically , we had a severe earthquake of significant duration	it was just something the structure could n't withstand
1	Ironically , Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state , this time wrapping freeway columns in `` steel blankets '' to reinforce them	only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority , and the Nimitz Freeway , supported by double rows , was left out

6	The investor will be out the cost of the put , which is called the `` premium	this loss will reduce the stock-market profit
3	the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put , less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put	the stock stays at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date

1	Ultimately , whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options.That cost rises in times of high market volatility	it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit
2	That 's	it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call
1	Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline	if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option , the stock is almost certain to be called away.And in that case , the investor misses out on any major upside gain

1	that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $ 110 billion annual rate	That 's an improvement over last year
0	That 's still an improvement over last year	it leads one to conclude that basically we 've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit

10	that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed	further trade improvement can occur
2	That 's	the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export
1	People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits	the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem
6	but the imbalances are still there	they are still a problem
6	That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export	the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness

1	There are many reasons for the market 's jumpiness : new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options ; computer-driven strategies like program trading ; and crowd psychology	traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves
8	the current volatility in U.S. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s , decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced	that before Friday 's tailspin , daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached `` historically low levels

6	It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought	Yet it is axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts
1	that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers	well established in British law
1	That 's the conventional theory anyway	In practice the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur
9	In practice , however , the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur	a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade
7	In particular , a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade	although insider trading has long been criminal , it has never been statutorily defined

6	whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain `` some personal gain	whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact
1	In 1983 , the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v.SEC decision , which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain `` some personal gain '' and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact	Gradually lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point

10	Essentially , Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out	he was told by another prominent trader , Bernard `` Bunny '' Lasker , that the deal was in trouble
10	Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel , an investment banker at Kidder , Peabody & Co. to confirm these rumors	placing orders to sell
8	Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain ? Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this	was the information material
1	Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced	all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue
1	It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness.Arguably , both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky	even if they behaved recklessly , reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading

2	that a particular actor 's conduct was culpable	and extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct
2	When a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct , it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule	a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule
7	Thus , a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule	in focusing on Mr. Freeman 's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal 's collapse , one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin : What if the rumor had been false
6	In the past , not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company	companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts

1	In 1987 , the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v.U.S . to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues	late last year , Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of `` the intangible right of honest services

11	quoted first in the Village Voice	he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign
10	and then in Newsweek	he and the campaign parted company
2	that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks	they support black candidates uncritically
2	that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination	they , too , support black candidates uncritically
6	He said Jews were `` sick with complexes	he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache
3	would the water be quite so hot	Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers
2	It probably would	few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language
6	because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language	some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism
7	In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism	the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur.People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
6	The latter typically is the humor of the underdog	it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves
1	In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons	wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief
2	Why constructive	despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict
3	Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity	honest differences were allowed to simmer
3	group conflicts still exist	what other means do we have for letting off steam
8	if group conflicts still exist	if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe
3	Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe	and what other means do we have for letting off steam
2	Do n't say the TV sitcom	that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy
1	that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show	these are not the differences that make headlines
6	that the plot has entered the public domain	it has remained there
1	Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over	whether it will simmer at all
7	To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them	Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
2	For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie	he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman
1	not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman	because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
2	For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie	but he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
1	The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end ( and occasionally in the middle ) , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself	too often , these routines lack spark
2	But too often , these routines lack spark	this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade-ethnic differences
10	That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up	it can simmer
1	I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz	I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America
6	The economy remains well-balanced	the outlook is for continued moderate growth
1	Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases	that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut
6	that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut	the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision
1	No one can predict exactly what will happen on the House side	I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year
3	that will help a great deal	that 's the signal that comes from the White House
8	he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut	there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year
2	President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law	the legislation has n't been completed
0	it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate	I am encouraged by the Senate action
1	He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut	Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill

2	but was cut out	it lost money
6	To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare	To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas were stricken
2	It worked	there were no exceptions
6	To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken	The Senate dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced
6	The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill.These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures.Also missing from the Senate bill is the House 's repeal of a law , called Section 89 , that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives . One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts.Mr . Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon . To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare.To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced	the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long-distance telephone calls
6	It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting	It drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees

2	This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify	in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth
