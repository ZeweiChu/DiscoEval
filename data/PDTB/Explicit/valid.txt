2	The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio	the bulk of the money is in a single issue
1	Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return , 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % , as calculated by Seidman Financial Services , which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman	one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility
6	Take the expected return	add one standard deviation to it

10	and must be renewed	it expires
6	the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires	It may stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal
3	you may not be able to buy it	you flunk
3	your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older	you 're healthy and can renew
2	your premium will go up sharply	you 're that much older
2	But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires.It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it.Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older	term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks
1	One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders	Upon examination I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense

11	This is worth remembering	insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value
1	The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry	salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead
5	but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms	preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment
2	That 's	you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package
11	to die	under its protection
6	This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection	in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well
2	That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package	view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment
8	You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing	your cash value and dividends grow over the years
6	the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans	none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment

8	I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year	I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy
3	and I can even skip payments	my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy
1	One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees ( usually 4 % to 4.5 % )	the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment , often 8.5 % or more

6	Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ?

1	But it 's good to have a partner , and obviously the chemistry works	people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters
6	But it 's good to have a partner	obviously the chemistry works
10	In 1980 , Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters , by then a successful producer in his own right	the death of Mr. Bogart
1	their record was n't always so impressive	Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others
6	Among their clinkers were `` The Legend of Billie Jean , '' `` VisionQuest , '' `` Clue '' and `` Clan of the Cave Bear	the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates
1	that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse	that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony
10	but that Warner never felt threatened	they linked up with Sony
1	They always listened	they never acted
2	In July a year later , Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract	Messrs.Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM/UA

10	But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later	Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured
10	Last May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor	Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co

6	Last May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract
1	The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom	it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month : the chance , at last , to run a major studio , about $ 50 million in deferred compensation , up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow , 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value , and annual salaries of $ 2.7 million for each

6	Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ 42 million last year	earnings have been erratic
1	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise	in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court , Mr. Ross , Warner Bros.Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made
6	For one thing , according to Mr. Daly , the producers requested a release in advance	the old contract was about to expire , and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now
6	Moreover , the old contract was about to expire	the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now
2	Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights	it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM/UA , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives
6	Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights	it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM/UA , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives
7	At the very least , Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony	During settlement talks Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner , according to executives involved in the talks
10	in accepting the Sony offer	taking it up with Warner
6	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner	they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts
10	The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract	took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia
10	then took him back	he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia
3	no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on	Sony succeeds here
6	First , there 's the name : `` asset-backed securities . '' Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing	there 's more
8	The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions.Most earn high ratings from credit agencies.Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues	the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors
0	The concept may be simple	the simplicity may be misleading
6	that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them	those are hard to evaluate
6	that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate	the securities were introduced only about 4 1/2 years ago ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession
6	They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans.They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares.Last year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders.Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations	the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables , sometimes known as `` plastic bonds
10	nothing will be left unhocked	the sun sets on the '80s
1	Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions	wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market
6	Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions	But wealthy individuals have been jumping in
6	But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in	lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market
11	The process typically begins	an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust
3	The process typically begins	an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust
10	when an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust	The trust issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors
2	Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit	and have received high credit ratings
11	the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers	providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions
1	Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds	skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks
6	who buy bonds in large quantities	whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street
1	That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street	for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless
3	you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby	even an extra 25 basis points ( 0.25 percentage point ) becomes an important consideration on a career basis
1	If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra 25 basis points ( 0.25 percentage point ) becomes an important consideration on a career basis	if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance
3	you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again	But that is n't of overwhelming importance
6	But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless	the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level
1	Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable	interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level
1	That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states , such as New York or California	Mr . Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans
10	to sell their holdings quickly	the securities mature
2	You could see massive gyrations here	it 's such a thinly traded market
6	The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues	an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings
7	Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem	Investors may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities
9	that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , Citibank N.A. , Citicorp or any affiliate thereof	if there 's a problem , do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue
3	In other words do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue	there 's a problem
6	The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , Citibank N.A. , Citicorp or any affiliate thereof	The prospectus notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency
6	Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem	That is n't easy
6	The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities	does it cover the entire portfolio
10	in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues	which is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim
1	Still , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim	skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper
3	why you should bother buying this stuff	you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper
11	why you should bother buying this stuff	you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper
3	you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties	you buy an asset-backed issue
11	you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties	you buy an asset-backed issue
3	that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports	a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations
6	If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations	that could affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports
1	Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions	despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets
1	That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter	it could be much worse
6	For one thing , credit-card loans are unsecured	that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession
6	A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues	therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds
2	A day of reckoning is coming where the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues	the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds

7	The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago	12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months.Last year , only 8 % were expecting a recession
1	Apparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much.A slim majority ( 51 % ) think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 . Their verdict on real estate is almost the same.Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months	only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold.Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control

11	Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities	voting in office
6	If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits	their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies
4	Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535	it comes to national policy making
1	such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state
6	Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state	such a president is likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
2	Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state , such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	The individual voter 's standing will be enhanced through lower taxes
6	Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society	the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe
7	Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office	first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat
2	they were more vulnerable to defeat	these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role in national policy making
6	First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South	the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House
6	Since local benefit-seeking matters more	national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress
3	this is precisely the pattern one would expect	Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts
3	Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking	the key assumption is valid
6	that such votes reflect national policy making	that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking
6	Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking	This is what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House
6	First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns . Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House	as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices
6	where local benefit-seeking duties matter more	national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices
6	Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices	An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 ( when control of that body changed party hands ) reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff
3	Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate	the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe
11	Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate	the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe
6	Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe	ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level
6	State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse	that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate
9	First that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do . Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking . Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level	at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation

6	And in a footnote to the fall of House Speaker James Wright this year , the conference voted to rescind $ 11.8 million in unspent EDA funds for a Fort Worth , Texas , stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader	Fiscal pressures forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies

6	Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 % of their usual capacity , but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled , leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 % vacancy rate.City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings , but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled.Among the city 's banks , Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open.The closed branches , in San Francisco , Hayward , Santa Clara and Santa Cruz , sustained structural damage.Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line.Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America 's Concord office , and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles , the bank said . Wells Fargo & Co. said its Emergency Operations Committee -- which met all night Tuesday -- moved its global-funds transfer system to El Monte , Calif. , 500 miles to the south.Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed , while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order . The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake 's epicenter , 80 miles south of San Francisco.Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly $ 600 million.Santa Clara County has a running total so far of $ 504 million , excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos . Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday ; a section of I-880 , a twotiered highway , collapsed in Oakland , causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake . San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total $ 2 billion.That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished , peeled business facades south of Market Street , and houses in the city 's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations.Many streets and sidewalks buckled , and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured . The federal funds would go to a range of programs , including the Federal Emergency Management Agency , highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration , according to Rep. Vic Fazio ( D. , Calif. ) . FEMA , which coordinates federal disaster relief , is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo , which hit the Carolinas last month.It is likely to get as much as $ 800 million initially in additional funds , and eventually could get more than $ 1 billion , according to Mr. Fazio , a member of the House Appropriations Committee . White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements.The Bush administration has at its disposal $ 273 million in funds remaining from the $ 1.1 billion Congress released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo . `` We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate , short-term requirements , '' Mr. Fitzwater said.He added that the Office of Management and Budget , the Transportation Department and other agencies are `` developing longer-term legislation '' that should be ready soon . Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges.California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state . Some things ca n't be repaired.The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $ 10 million to $ 15 million in damage , including shattered porcelains and stone figures.Its neighbor , the De Young Museum , totaled $ 3 million to $ 5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture . The city 's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls , and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor . The ground along the Embarcaderothe street that skirts the city 's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake , wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers.At San Francisco International Airport , shock waves wrecked the control tower , knocking down computers and shattering glass.Offices of the city 's Rent Board were destroyed . Mayor Agnos 's $ 2 billion estimate does n't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city , some of which remained closed.A major chunk of the $ 2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency , said a spokesman for Mr. Agnos . `` All of the city 's $ 5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours '' on overtime salaries , he said . Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices . At Fireman 's Fund Corp. , a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake , and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area . `` Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this -- to a major processing plant , '' a spokesman said . `` We 're delivering a check for $ 750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday . '' Fireman 's is part of a $ 38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge , which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income . California lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a $ 100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster , as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads . In addition , under the highway-relief program , the federal government provides 100 % of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort.After that , the federal share diminishes.For interstate highways , the federal share normally would drop to 90 % of the cost of repairs , and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost.But lawmakers want to extend the period for 100 % federal funding for several months . Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo -- South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands , according to an aide to Rep. Fazio	the FEMA announced a toll-free telephone number ( 800-462-9029 ) to expedite service to victims of the earthquake

Few telephone lines snapped.That 's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points.The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake	phone service was sporadic ; many computer terminals remained dark , and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power
