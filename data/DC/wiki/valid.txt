It was largely unaffected by short immersion in water , when immersion was prolonged however the chlorate dissolved out , leaving a practically non-explosive residue .	However , if exposed to moist and dry air alternately , the chlorate crystallised out on the surfaces rendering the explosive very sensitive .	In testing however it was found to be extremely sensitive to combined friction and percussion , and could be readily ignited by a glancing blow with wood .
0	But Knuth goes on to explain that it is better working with the generalized problem directly , because the generalized algorithm is simpler and faster :	A simple change to his Algorithm X allows secondary columns to be handled directly .	Although the algorithm was originally designed for videos , virtually all implementations use SIOX primarily for still image segmentation .	Due to its NP-completeness , any problem in NP can be reduced to exact cover problems , which then can be solved with techniques such as Dancing Links .	However , for some well known problems , the reduction is particularly direct .	For instance , the problem of tiling a board with pentominoes , and solving Sudoku can both be viewed as exact cover problems .

To reassure herself , she reaches a hand toward the floor for the dog and is rewarded by a reassuring lick on her hand .	She lies awake listening to the dripping sound .	Each time she feels frightened , she reaches for the dog on the floor and feels a lick on her hand .	Since the change is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait ( for example , from greed to benevolence ) , the geometric term `` arc '' is often used to describe the sweeping change .

One critical point made regarding our individual set point is to understand it may simply be a genetic tendency and not a completely determined criterion for happiness , and it can still be influenced .	In a study on moderate to excessive drug intake on rats , Ahmed and Koob ( 1998 ) , sought to demonstrate that the use of mind-altering drugs such as cocaine could change an individual 's hedonic set point .	Their findings suggest that drug usage and addiction lead to neurochemical adaptations whereby a person needs more of that substance to feel the same levels of pleasure .	Today , most talk of speech codes is within institutional contexts and refer to colleges and refers to official lists and rules established by authorities , where speech codes are occasionally used by colleges and universities to suppress speech that others find offensive .	Genetic roots of the hedonic set point are also disputed .

Their police powers stem from a law that was written in 1866 by ASPCA founder Henry Bergh .	They are certified New York State peace officers and have statewide jurisdiction , though they only work in the confines of New York City 's 5 boroughs ( Manhattan , Queens , Bronx , Brooklyn , and Staten Island ) .	The agents of the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement have the same equipment NYPD police officers do , plus some items that are specialized for animal-related work .

0	A green wave occurs when a series of traffic lights ( usually three or more ) are coordinated to allow continuous traffic flow over several intersections in one main direction .	An actuated traffic signal relies on some mechanism for detecting vehicles as they approach the intersection .	This allows higher traffic loads , and reduces noise and energy use ( because less acceleration and braking is needed ) .	In practical use , only a group of cars ( known as a `` platoon '' , the size of which is defined by the signal times ) can use the `` green wave '' before the time band is interrupted to give way to other traffic flows .	The coordination of the signals is sometimes done dynamically , according to sensor data of currently existing traffic flows - otherwise it is done statically , by the use of timers .	Under certain circumstances , `` green waves '' can be interwoven with each other , but this increases their complexity and reduces usability , so in conventional set-ups only the roads and directions with the heaviest loads get this preferential treatment .

The first section is , as mentioned , very mysterious , as Scriabin employs many tritones and seventh intervals which do not fall into the key of C minor .	The first 8 bars feature modulations to D minor and F minor .	The ninth bar , marked `` con anima '' , introduces an E major melody using more conventional harmonies , but the piece only delves yet again deeper into the depths of the mystery four bars later .	Harold C. Schonberg , in `` The Great Pianists '' , writes : `` It also is hard to escape the notion that Chopin was very familiar with Hummel 's now-forgotten Op .	At the seventeenth bar , the piece calms to quiet block chords of F minor , C minor-7 , and B major-9 ( without the bass B ) , finally resolving to an arpeggiated final C-minor chord , reminiscent of the ninth prelude immediately preceding this one .

The 1868 Act specified that it was to be constructed at a broad gauge of , but that requirement was repealed in the 1869 Act , thus allowing construction at the standard gauge of .	The railway was leased to the Michigan Central Railroad ( MCR ) for 99 years ; in 1929 it was subleased to the New York Central Railroad ( NYC ) .	Its successors Penn Central ( formed 1968 ) and Conrail ( formed 1976 ) later exercised control before being sold to CN/CP in 1985 .	The line was originally conceived by Kenyon Cox ( brother of Jacob Dolson Cox , Governor of Ohio ) , Daniel Drew , Sidney Dillon and John F. Tracy to connect with the Wabash Railroad and establish a railway network extending from Lake Erie to the Mississippi River .

There is currently a focus on fretting research in the aerospace industry .	The dovetail blade-root connection and the spline coupling of gas turbine aero engines experience fretting .	Another example in which fretting corrosion may occur are the pitch bearings of modern wind turbines , which operate under oscillation motion to control the power and loads of the turbine .	Through changes in temperature , or solvent evaporation or degasification , the concentration of salts may exceed the saturation , leading to a precipitation of solids ( usually crystals ) .

In modern practice , total body irradiation is typically fractionated , with smaller doses delivered in several sessions , rather than delivering the entire dose at once .	The tropic movement is growth movement but nastic movement may or may not be growth movement .	The rate or frequency of these responses increases as intensity of the stimulus increases .	An example of such a response is the opening and closing of flowers ( photonastic response ) , movement of euglena , chlamydomonas towards the source of light .

Growing to about tall , it makes a mass of pink , purple and white fragrant four petalled ( cruciform ) flowers .	However , the 1920 Iraqi revolt resulted in the scrapping of the original mandate plan in favor of British administered semi-independent kingdom , under the Hashemite allies of Britain , via the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty .	For best results in growing Virginia stock , sow on the surface in patches or rows and thin the young plants to 6 inches apart .	It prefers full to partial sun and well drained soils .

0	Tritoma is a genus of beetles in the family Erotylidae , the pleasing fungus beetles .	Ivo Hodek has also described the species as univoltine ( having one brood per year ) ; in early autumn they migrate from sun-exposed forest habitat “ to well-insolated slopes of rocky hills or also to buildings. ” Seeking winter shelter in rocky crevices or , opportunistically , in human dwellings , the beetles will cluster in aggregations of up to several hundred individuals .	There are over 100 species .	Some species consume euagaric mushrooms , staying concealed amidst the gills as they feed .	Some feed on mushrooms growing from dead trees , as well as mycorrhizae on living roots .	One of the most common pleasing fungus beetles in Europe , `` T. bipustulata '' , is a black beetle with red spots which engages in autohaemorrhaging as a defensive behavior .

The battalion made a reconnaissance on 18 July of the Lo-Lo trail , and the Indian scouts accompanying it were ambushed and met with considerable loss .	These models predict the effect of perturbations caused by the Earth ’ s shape , drag , radiation , and gravitation effects from other bodies such as the sun and moon .	Simplified General Perturbations ( SGP ) models apply to near earth objects with an orbital period of less than 225 minutes .	Simplified Deep Space Perturbations ( SDP ) models apply to objects with an orbital period greater than 225 minutes , which corresponds to an altitude of 5,877.5 km , assuming a circular orbit .	The SGP4 and SDP4 models were published along with sample code in FORTRAN IV in 1988 with refinements over the original model to handle the larger number of objects in orbit since .

Calorimetry design is an active area of research in particle physics .	An electromagnetic calorimeter is one specifically designed to measure the energy of particles that interact primarily via the electromagnetic interaction , while a hadronic calorimeter is one designed to measure particles that interact via the strong nuclear force .	In theoretical astrophysics , the Nordtvedt effect refers to the relative motion between the Earth and the Moon which would be observed if the gravitational self-energy of a body contributed differently to its gravitational mass than to its inertial mass .	The response of a calorimeter can be described in terms of the e/h ratio .	This is the measure of how well a calorimeter responds to leptons or photons versus hadrons .

The game was first unveiled at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo , during which Konami distributed 3-D glasses to attendees so that they could see the 3-D effect .	This somewhat backfired , as journalists in attendance at the show reported that the 3-D feature was a `` gimmick '' and did not improve the game 's visuals .

0	The reaction mechanism for this reaction is as follows : a base abstracts the acidic malonate proton generating a carbanion or enolate which reacts with the electron deficient fullerene double bond in a nucleophilic addition .	This in turn generates a carbanion which displaces bromine in a nucleophilic aliphatic substitution in an intramolecular ring cyclopropane ring closure .	The Bingel reaction is a popular method in fullerene chemistry .	Recent literature from the Shanahan lab supports the rare aza-Prins/pinacol pathway only associated with significantly increased alkene nucleophilicity and iminium electrophilicity .	The reaction is also known to take place with the ester groups replaced by alkyne groups in dialkynylmethanofullerenes .	An alternative to the Bingel reaction is a fullerene diazomethane reaction .

Swaps are also known as `` contracts for differences '' and as `` fixed-for-floating '' contracts , terms that summarize the essence of these financial arrangements .	HKFE provides efficient and diversified markets for trading futures and options contracts by its more than 160 participant organisations , including many that are affiliated to international financial institutions .	In a swap contract , you trade with your counterpart ( a company/institution/individual ) and take risk on their capacity to pay you any amount that may be due at settlement .	Thus , investors should carefully enter into a swap agreement with other party considering all these parameters .	The first energy derivatives covered petroleum products and emerged after the 1970s energy crisis and the fundamental restructuring of the world petroleum market that followed .

For Protestants , spiritual disciplines are generally regarded to include any combination of the following , in moderation : celebration , chastity , confession , fasting , fellowship , frugality , giving , guidance , hospitality , humility , intimacy , meditation , prayer , reflection , self-control , servanthood , service , silence , simplicity , singing , slowing , solitude , study , submission , surrender , teaching , and worship .	The similarities between twins ( such as intelligence or beauty ) may invoke similar reactions from the environment .	Quakers have little to no creed or doctrine , and so their practices constitute a large portion of their group identity .	A well-known writer on Christian spiritual disciplines , Richard Foster , has emphasized that Christian meditation focuses not of the emptying of the mind or self , but rather on the filling up of the mind or self with God .	Spiritual practice in Islam is practiced within salat ( ritual prayer ) during which Muslims subdue all thoughts and concentrate solely on Allah , also through other forms of worship activities like fasting , and Hajj .

0	An antistatic agent is a compound used for treatment of materials or their surfaces in order to reduce or eliminate buildup of static electricity .	Static charge may be generated by the triboelectric effect or by a non-contact process using a high voltage power source .	Static charge may be introduced on a surface as part of an in-mold label printing process .	In this way , about 900 tons are produced annually .	The molecules of an antistatic agent often have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas , similar to those of a surfactant ; the hydrophobic side interacts with the surface of the material , while the hydrophilic side interacts with the air moisture and binds the water molecules .	Internal antistatic agents are designed to be mixed directly into the material , external antistatic agents are applied to the surface .

0	Purging selection occurs where the phenotypes of deleterious recessive alleles are exposed through inbreeding , and thus can be selected against .	This can lead to such detrimental mutations being removed from the population , and has been demonstrated to occur rapidly where the recessive alleles have a lethal effect .	The efficiency of purging will depend on the relationship between the magnitude of the deleterious effect that is unmasked in the homozygotes and the importance of genetic drift , so that purging is weaker for non-lethal than for recessive lethal alleles .	It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture , along with four other nominations at the 72nd Academy Awards .	The fixation of a single allele for a specific gene can also reduce fitness where heterozygote advantage was previously present ( i.e. , where heterozygous individuals have higher fitness than homozygotes of either allele ) , although this phenomenon seems to make a usually small contribution to inbreeding depression .	Although naturally occurring , purging can be important for population survival , deliberately attempting to purge deleterious mutations from a population is not generally recommended as a technique to improve the fitness of captive bred animals .

A barge was destroyed , as was a large portion of the San Pedro wharf .	Pinacol was discovered by Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig in 1859 .	The first step in the reaction mechanism is one-electron reduction of the carbonyl group by a reducing agent such as magnesium to a ketyl radical anion species .	Two ketyl groups react in a coupling reaction yielding a vicinal diol with both hydroxyl groups deprotonated .	Addition of water or another proton donor gives the diol .

However , such a contract would likely be deemed illusory if the buyer reserved the right to buy from other parties .	Australia , Ireland as well as most Canadian provinces have converted from deeds registries to Torrens titles .	Contracts must have terms that are sufficiently defined for a court to be able to determine where a breach has occurred .	It would be difficult to determine whether the buyer in a requirements contract is falsely claiming that his needs are lower than they actually are as a ploy to achieve a renegotiation or rescission of the contract .	Conversely , if market conditions make the contract price a windfall for the buyer , that buyer may decide to buy more than it actually needs in order to go into competition against the seller .

0	Carbol fuchsin , carbol-fuchsin , or carbolfuchsin , is a mixture of phenol and basic fuchsin , used in bacterial staining procedures .	It is commonly used in the staining of mycobacteria as it has an affinity for the mycolic acids found in their cell membranes .	It is a component of Ziehl–Neelsen stain , a differential stain .	Carbol fuchsin is used as the primary stain dye to detect acid-fast bacteria because it is more soluble in the cells wall lipids than in the acid alcohol .	In general these systems are not very durable for coating , especially antimony tin oxide is used for durable systems , often in its nano form , it is then formulated to a final coating .	Carbol-fuchsin is also used as a topical antiseptic .

Another example of a species which may be seriously impacted by ocean acidification is Pteropods , which are shelled pelagic molluscs which play an important role in the food-web of various ecosystems .	But if the material begins to harden by a smaller proportion than the decrease in cross-sectional area , as indicated by the first tangent point in the top diagram , strain concentrates at the location of highest stress or lowest hardness .	The greater the local strain , the greater the local decrease in cross-sectional area , which in turn causes even more concentration of strain , leading to an instability that causes the formation of a neck .	This instability is called `` geometric '' or `` extrinsic '' because it involves the material 's macroscopic decrease in cross-sectional area .	As deformation proceeds the geometric instability causes strain to continue concentrating in the neck until the material either ruptures or the necked material hardens enough , as indicated by the second tangent point in the top diagram , to cause other regions of the material to deform instead .

It was largely unaffected by short immersion in water , when immersion was prolonged however the chlorate dissolved out , leaving a practically non-explosive residue .	The byproducts of the remediation can be valuable materials themselves , such as enzymes ( like laccase ) , edible or medicinal mushrooms , making the remediation process even profitable .	Fungi , thanks to their non-specific enzymes , are able to break down many kinds of substances .

As in Europe , sons very often followed their father into the workshop , but boys showing talent from any background might be recruited ; at least one notable painter was born a slave .	The subconscious mind then responds by fulfilling that desire .	This mental action causes the conscious and subconscious minds to work together toward the common goal of remembering the dream .	The discipline of waking up to record a dream in a diary sometimes leads to a false awakening where the dreamer records the previous dream while still in a dream .	Some dream diarists report writing down the same dream one or two times in a dream before actually waking up , and recording it in a physical dream diary .

0	The Eternity Range is a range of mountains long , rising to , and trending north-south approximately in the middle of the Antarctic Peninsula , in the Palmer Land region of Antarctica .	The Eternity Range is divided into three main mountain blocks , the major summits in each from north to south being Mount Faith , Mount Hope , and Mount Charity .	These four names were applied by Lincoln Ellsworth who discovered the range from the air during his flights of November 21 and November 23 , 1935 .	In November 1936 , the range was surveyed by John Riddoch Rymill of the British Graham Land Expedition who gave the name `` Mount Wakefield '' to the central mountain in the range .	Bach ice shelf also supports the north side of the Monteverdi Peninsula .	A careful study of the original reports , maps and photographs , and comparison with materials from subsequent expeditions such as the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition , 1947 , and the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey , 1960 , has led to the conclusion that the range described comprises at least the core of Ellsworth 's Eternity Range and appropriately commemorates his discovery .

This complication by Rymill , and uncertainty as to the precise location or extent of Ellsworth 's discovery , hindered for a time a resolution of its nomenclature ( i.e. , following the U.S. Antarctic Service expedition in 1939–41 , the name Eternity Range or Eternity Mountains was incorrectly applied to the present Welch Mountains farther south ) .

A variety of Ringworld hominid species , led by the Machine woman Valavirgillin ( from `` The Ringworld Engineers '' ) , join together to kill a large nest of vampires ( the shadow nest ) which has been feeding on all of them .	These circuits are not hacked chips , but created from a series of master templates , enabling them to be mass-produced .	The Ghouls find one of the Hindmost 's spying devices in the factory and transport it all the way to the rim , to ask for help against the protectors who rule the rim .	Meanwhile , Louis Wu decides to die of old age instead of asking the Hindmost for rejuvenation , as self-punishment for his helping the Hindmost to restabilize the Ringworld at the end of `` The Ringworld Engineers '' , killing ( as he thinks ) a trillion hominids to save the rest .	After ten years of wandering around the Ringworld and aging , the Hindmost convinces him that he killed far fewer people than expected .

0	In philosophical logic , the masked-man fallacy ( also known as the intensional fallacy and the epistemic fallacy ) is committed when one makes an illicit use of Leibniz 's law in an argument .	Leibniz 's law states that , if one object has a certain property , while another object does not have the same property , the two objects can not be identical .	The fallacy is `` epistemic '' because it posits an immediate identity between a subject 's knowledge of an object with the object itself .	The name of the fallacy comes from the example :	Although other models and constructed metaphors of the Internet found in scholarly research and theoretical frameworks may be more accurate sources on the `` effects '' of the Internet , mass media messages in popular culture are more likely to influence how people think about and interact with the Internet .	Thus the argument is a fallacious one .

In 1998 , criminal proceedings were launched against Verbeke by the public prosecution of Frankfurt , Germany , for distributing to German addresses the antisemitic pamphlet `` Goldhagen and Spielberg Lies '' , which attacked Daniel Goldhagen and Steven Spielberg .	In 2000 , Verbeke was ordered to abstain from distributing a brochure co-authored with professor of literature Robert Faurisson that attempted to challenge the authenticity of the `` Diary of Anne Frank '' .

0	Until the early 6th century , there was a single holder of the title , the `` Ērān-spāhbed '' , who according to the list of precedence provided by the 9th-century Muslim historian Ya'qubi occupied the fifth position in the court hierarchy .	The Byzantine and Syriac sources record a number of senior officers who might be holders of the rank in the early 6th century .	Thus during the Anastasian War of 502–506 , a certain Boes ( `` Bōē '' ) , who negotiated with the Byzantine `` magister officiorum '' Celer and died in 505 , is named in the Syriac sources as an astabid ( also spelled `` astabed '' , `` astabad '' , `` astabadh '' ) .	The 12Bell OH-58 Kiowa , a scout helicopter , is mounted with a rapid-firing machine gun , but the air force lacks a true attack helicopter .	Some modern scholars have interpreted `` astabed '' as a new office corresponding to the Byzantine `` magister officiorum '' , supposedly instituted by Kavadh I shortly before 503 for the purpose of weakening the authority of the `` wuzurg framadar '' .	But it is likely that this Syriac word is simply a corrupted form of `` spāhbed '' ( which is normally recorded as `` aspabid '' in Syriac ) , or possibly `` asp ( a ) bed '' ( `` chief of the cavalry '' ) , since the Greek sources give the name of the second man as `` Aspebedes '' ( Latin : ' ) , `` Aspevedes '' , or `` Aspetios '' ( Latin : ' ) .

0	The clay till which also goes by the now rather old-fashioned but still useful name of boulder clay , is usually very sticky when wet and hard when thoroughly dry .	On quiet hot summer days the water takes on a beautiful turquoise colour which is very photogenic .	Usually , such land was left as woodland but here , enterprising landowners seem to have taken it on when nobody else wanted it and attempted to make it produce income by excavating lakes for the raising of fish .	This was a sensible , commercial idea except in that the open , still and shallow water will have harboured the vectors of malaria .	The population therefore remained small and probably sickly , until more effective , 19th century drainage permitted use of some of the land for pasture and modern agricultural methods permitted the heavier land to be used for ploughing .	In parallel with these , medical advances overcame the malaria .

Æthelric was consecrated by Stigand , unlike most of the English bishops of the time period , because at that point , Stigand held a valid pallium , or symbol of an archbishop 's authority and ability to consecrate bishops .	Æthelric was deposed by the Council of Windsor on 24 May 1070 and imprisoned at Marlborough , being replaced by Stigand ( not the same as the archbishop ) , who later moved the seat of the diocese to Chichester .	He traveled to Shiraz and stayed there for at least nine months in order to secure his son 's succession there , despite the fact that the Samanids were threatening his own possessions .	If Æthelric was related to the Godwin 's , King William I of England may have feared that the bishop would use his diocese to launch a rebellion .	Other reasons put forward include the fact that Æthelric had been consecrated by Stigand , but the other bishop that Stigand had consecrated , Siward the Bishop of Rochester was not deposed .

0	We learn from Polybius that Phylarchus was a contemporary of Aratus , and gave an account of the same events as the latter did in his history .	Aratus died 213 BC , and his work ended at 220 BC ; we may therefore place Phylarchus at about 215 BC .	The credit of Phylarchus as an historian is vehemently attacked by Polybius , who charges him with falsifying history through his partiality to Cleomenes III , king of Sparta , and his hatred against Aratus and the Achaeans .	The accusation is probably not unfounded , but it might be retorted with equal justice upon Polybius , who has fallen into the opposite error of exaggerating the merits of Aratus and his party , and depreciating Cleomenes , whom he has certainly both misrepresented and misunderstood .	He also describes the Battle of Crecy in 1356 , The Peasant 's War , and the siege of Calais , again with great detail .	The vivid and graphic style of Phylarchus , of which we shall say a few words below , was well suited to Plutarch 's purpose .

The accusation of Polybius is repeated by Plutarch , but it comes with rather a bad grace from the latter writer , since there can be little doubt that his lives of Agis and Cleomenes are taken almost entirely from Phylarchus , to whom he is likewise indebted for the latter part of his life of Pyrrhus .	The vivid and graphic style of Phylarchus , of which we shall say a few words below , was well suited to Plutarch 's purpose .
