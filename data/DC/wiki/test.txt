0	In molecular biology the protein domain Whirly is a transcription factor commonly found in plants .	This means they aid the transcription of genes from DNA into a complementary copy of mRNA .	It is present as a domain of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase ( GlnRS ) in almost all eukaryotes .	The function of Whirly proteins is to regulate the expression of genes that aid defence .	They are transcription factors which bind to single stranded DNA in order to regulate gene expression .	When a pathogen enters , salicylic acid is released as a signalling molecule which affects Whirly , allowing the expression of defence genes to occur .

He ’ d done this because he had been ordered not to tell the truth in his military report – that the deportees were being appallingly treated – and so had written something that he thought was so ludicrous – how could the deportees be given ‘ light refreshments ?	NBC announced the renewal of `` Aquarius '' for a second season on June 25 , 2015 .	But , before Mr Nicolson admitted what he ’ d done , some historians had taken his written report at face value and used it to try and ‘ prove ’ that the surviving deportees who now spoke of how badly they had been treated were lying .	If Nigel Nicolson hadn ’ t told the truth years later than that inaccurate report would still be in the written archives and the suffering of the deportees still disputed .	So my advice is to be as careful of the accuracy of written archives as you are careful of the accuracy of people . ''

Bands of this type now treat the Witches Reel as a dance to involve the whole room all at once , danced as one line of gentlemen and one line of ladies , rather than as a dance to be performed in sets of any particular size .

1	To estimate the voting index of any player one needs to estimate the number of the possible winning coalitions in which his vote is decisive .	Assume for simplicity that the number of voters is odd , `` N '' = 2 '' j '' + 1 , and the body votes according to the standard majority rule .	Following Penrose one concludes that a given voter will be able to effectively influence the outcome of the voting only if the votes split half and half : if `` j '' players say 'Yes ' and the remaining `` j '' players vote 'No ' , the last vote is decisive .	Assuming that all members of the body vote independently ( the votes are uncorrelated )	and that the probability of each vote 'Yes ' is equal to `` p '' = 1/2 one can estimate likelihood of such an event using the Bernoulli trial .	The probability to obtain `` j '' votes 'Yes ' out of 2 '' j '' votes reads

1	In response to Baker 's letter , IPF executive director David Halperin wrote in an email to `` Haaretz '' : `` In short , Ambassador Baker seems to have misunderstood the nature of our concerns , which stem from the added impediments the Levy Report poses for achieving a diplomatic solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – not the technical and legal reasoning used to arrive at its conclusions , which is irrelevant to our concern '' , adding IPF 's fear `` that the Levy Report will not strengthen Israel 's position in this conflict , [ and ] at this moment , it is more critical than ever that Israel strengthen its claim in the international community that it is committed to a two-state vision , which is , in turn , central to Israel 's future as a Jewish and democratic state '' .	The Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) issued a statement in which it `` has praised and endorsed the report '' and supports Likut MK `` Tzipi Hotovely in her quest to have the Report ’ s conclusions adopted by the Knesset , '' adding `` the Levy Report is an important and timely document .	Not because it tells us something that was not known before – the legality of Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria , as in any other part of the territory earmarked for Jewish settlement by the 1920 San Remo Conference , is a known but ignored fact .	Indeed , the ZOA has frequently pointed out that the San Remo decision has never been superseded by any subsequent , internationally-binding agreement .	Rather , it is important that a respected legal commission under the chairmanship of one of the Supreme Court ’ s retired justices has both reaffirmed this truth as well as making recommendations for avoiding in the future the complications and arbitrary procedures whereby Jewish life and construction in Judea and Samaria have become unnecessarily fraught .	This situation has helped contribute to the utterly false notion that Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria are both illegal and an obstacle to peace ... We are also pleased that the false , indeed malicious , claim that Jewish settlement and construction beyond the 1949 armistice lines violates the Fourth Geneva Convention has been specifically repudiated .

Assume for simplicity that the number of voters is odd , `` N '' = 2 '' j '' + 1 , and the body votes according to the standard majority rule .	Following Penrose one concludes that a given voter will be able to effectively influence the outcome of the voting only if the votes split half and half : if `` j '' players say 'Yes ' and the remaining `` j '' players vote 'No ' , the last vote is decisive .

1	The Wavelet Tree is a succinct data structure to store strings in compressed space .	It generalizes the formula_1 and formula_2 operations defined on bitvectors to arbitrary alphabets .	Originally introduced to represent compressed suffix arrays , it has found application in several contexts .	The tree is defined by recursively partitioning the alphabet into pairs of subsets ; the leaves correspond to individual symbols of the alphabet , and at each node a bitvector stores whether a symbol of the string belongs to one subset or the other .	The name derives from an analogy with the wavelet transform for signals , which recursively decomposes a signal into low-frequency and high-frequency components .	Let formula_3 be a finite alphabet with formula_4 .

Polar headgroups of these lipids bind to the hydrophilic part of the membrane protein ( s ) at the inner and outer surfaces of lipid bilayer membrane .	The hydrophobic surface of the membrane proteins is bound to the apposed lipid fatty acid chains of the membrane bilayer .	Unusual for ribosomal peptides , cyanobactins can include D-amino acids ; these can occur adjacent to azole or azoline residues .	Outside the layer of shell/annular lipids , lipids are not tied down to protein molecules .	However , they may be slightly restricted in their segmental motion freedom due to mild peer pressure of protein molecules , if present in high concentration , which arises from extended influence of protein-lipid interaction .

Central to this revised standard was a mandate for an information stream , at the transmitter , and broadcast to TV sets ( receivers ) , which was independent of whether the signal was monochrome ( already in existence since 1941 ) or color ( adopted in 1953 ) .	This significant mandate was satisfied by an encoding device which came to be known as a Colorplexer .	Colorplexer ( a portmanteau of `` color '' and `` multiplexer '' ) was the RCA trade name for its complex electronic device which encoded discrete red , green and blue 3-color images , as from a color camera , into a composite monochrome-compatible color information stream .	In RCA 's recommendation for monochrome-compatible color TV , generally called `` NTSC color '' , each color TV source ( as , from a CCU ) incorporated its own colorplexer , thereby providing the remaining equipment , all of which were presumed to have originated as a monochrome equipment system , with a signal which could be managed ( generated , switched , transmitted , received , etcetera ) as if the signal was not color at all , but was an ordinary composite monochrome signal .	This was a strategic decision on RCA 's part , and this `` one Colorplexer per color source '' concept became part of RCA 's color TV equipment marketing recommendations .

0	It models language predominantly by way of theoretical syntactic/semantic theory ( e.g .	CCG , HPSG , LFG , TAG , the Prague School ) .	Deep linguistic processing approaches differ from `` shallower '' methods in that they yield more expressive and structural representations which directly capture long-distance dependencies and underlying predicate-argument structures .	The predicate `` eats '' c-selects both its subject argument `` Fred '' and its object argument `` beans '' , but as far as subcategorization is concerned , `` eats '' subcategorizes for its object argument `` beans '' only .	However , research in the early 2000s had made considerable advancement in efficiency of deep processing .

1	Many of the same predators sometimes compete over territory and food with this species .	Despite their highly similar diet and habitat preferences , it has been found that red-shouldered hawks can nest within of a barred owl without interspecies conflict .	In Florida , red-shouldered hawks sometimes collaborate and peaceably coexist with American crows ( usually an enemy to all other birds because of their egg-hunting habits ) so they cooperatively mob mutual predators , mainly great horned owls and red-tailed hawks .	Prior to 1900 , the red-shouldered hawk was one of the most common North American raptors .

1	Aquilegia longissima , the long-spur columbine , is a rare perennial herb that is native to northern Mexico , Trans-Pecos Texas and southern Arizona .	In the original species description by Asa Gray in 1883 , `` Aquilegia longissima '' is distinguished from the shorter-spurred golden columbine `` Aquilegia chrysantha '' based on the extremely long spur over 10 cm long , narrow spatulate petals , and very slender spurs that usually hang straight down .	The plants typically flower in the fall after monsoon rains and are found in oak-pine-juniper woodlands in shaded canyons near intermittent streams or on talus slopes .	William Trelease hypothesized in 1883 that the most likely pollinator of `` A. longissima '' would be the giant sphinx moth , `` Cocytius antaeus '' .	The giant sphinx moth is a rare stray in west Texas and has been collected in Big Bend National Park near long-spur columbine populations ; however , the common pollinators are likely large hawkmoths in the genera `` Manduca '' and `` Agrius '' with tongue lengths from 9–14 cm long .	Hybridization is common in the genus `` Aquilegia '' and populations with intermediate spur lengths from 7–9 cm are found near some long-spur columbine populations .

1	The effector mechanisms of food reinforcement depend on dopaminergic activity in the brain .	Conceptually , weight loss programs might target control of hedonic hunger .	Specific research to determine what diet techniques would be most beneficial for those with an increased hedonic hunger would help people modify their immediate availability of food or its palatability .	For example , whole grain popcorn may be a better choice than potato chips due to a lower calorie load and an increased sense of satiety .

At least five different concentrations of a toxicant are tested , plus controls , with at least two exposure chambers for each treatment .

0	Use of TT systems was popularised by the publication of `` Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems '' ( PTTES ) in 2001 and the related introductory book `` Embedded C '' in 2002 .	The PTTES book also introduced the concepts of time-triggered hybrid schedulers ( an architecture for time-triggered systems that require task pre-emption ) and shared-clock schedulers ( an architecture for distributed time-triggered systems involving multiple , synchronised , nodes ) .	Since publication of PTTES , extensive research work on TT systems has been carried out .	Most breeders keep their techniques secret in order to avoid having them copied by other farms .	Time-triggered systems can be viewed as a subset of a more general event-triggered ( ET ) system architecture ( see event-driven programming ) .

1	The title of the album suggests the possibility of drawing inspiration and strength from an ordinary object like a tangerine .	The song `` Narengi '' ( Persian for tangerine ) makes a reference to the album name and morphs its way from a traditional Sufi song rooted in the Magham music of Torbat-e Jam ( Namjoo 's birthplace ) crying `` O God , Help me , Sheikh Ahmad-e Jami , Help me , '' to Namjoo 's own words praising a tagerine .	The song `` Reza Khan '' talks about Reza Shah , the founder of the Pahlavi Dynasty .	Namjoo 's lyric refers to Reza Khan as an `` opium addict , with a bad temper who killed his enemies and brought modernity to Iran . ''	This angered the Iranian pro-monarchists who flooded Namjoo 's Facebook page with obscenities against Namjoo .	The song , however , is more about how a dictator imposed a notion of modernity on a society that was unprepared to absorb it .

1	Importantly , the WRKY genes contain a conserved intron in the WRKY domain , which occurs at the location encoding for the PR of the PRSYY amino acid sequence , thus explaining the conservation of this motif .	The WRKY domain forms a unique wedge-shaped structure that enters perpendicularly in the major groove of the DNA strand .	WRKY protein domains interact with the ( T/A ) TGAC ( T/A ) cis-element , also called the W-box .	Recent evidence suggests that the GAC core of the W-box is the primary target of the WRKY domain and flanking sequences help dictate DNA interaction with very specific WRKY proteins .	The RKYGQK residues of the core motif and additional arginine and lysine residues of the WRKY domain are responsible for interaction with the phosphate backbone of seven consecutive DNA base pairs , including the GAC core .	Changing the tryptophan , tyrosine , or either lysine of the WRKYGQK motif to alanine completely abolishes DNA-binding , indicating these amino acids are essential for recognizing the W-box element .

0	Though the cryptographic methods based on geometry have practically no real life applications , they are of use as pedagogic tools for the elucidation of other more complex cryptographic protocols .	Some of the geometric cryptographic methods are based on the impossibility of trisecting an angle using ruler and compass .	Given an arbitrary angle , there is a straightforward ruler and compass construction for finding the triple of the given angle .	In October 2015 , the US Senate took the bill back up following legislation concerning sanctuary cities .	Hence the function which assigns the triple of an angle to a given angle can be thought of as a one-way function , the only constructions allowed being ruler and compass constructions .	A geometric identification protocol has been suggested based on the one-way function indicated above .

1	Hong Taiji sponsored the translations of many Chinese language histories and classics in his newly declared Qing dynasty .	The majority of literary works in Manchu during the Qing dynasty consisted of officially sanctioned translations of Chinese Confucian classics and political works , and later translations of Chinese novels and texts on medicine , history , religion .	There were few Manchu archetypal literary works .	The German sinologist Eric Hauer argued that the Manchu translations of Chinese classics and fiction were done by experts familiar with their original meaning and with how best to express it in Manchu .	Because Manchu is easy to learn , these translations enable the student to use the Manchu versions of the classics to verify the meaning of the Chinese text , for instance , the Manchu translation of the Peiwen yunfu or the language of difficult Chinese novels , such as Jin Ping Mei .	Most original material produced in Manchu were histories and documentary texts relating to military and foreign affairs on the northern frontiers which were handled by the Lifan Yuan , such as campaigns against the Dzungars .

1	He was formerly its associate director , and currently serves as the Global Oscillations Network Group program manager .	In 2011 , Hill 's research , which had used helioseismography to monitor streams below the surface of the sun , attracted considerable media attention .	Although such streams tend to be the `` spawning ground '' for sunspots , and they had been expected to begin forming in 2008 , the study found that these new streams had yet to form .	The study in question therefore suggested that the sunspot cycle was going to take longer than expected to reach its next peak , or , according to Hill , might not happen at all .	Although Hill and his colleagues refused to discuss the possible effects this weaker solar cycle would have on climate , this was reported on by some media , including the Global Warming Policy Foundation , as evidence that a `` mini ice age '' was imminent .	Hill responded to these reports by telling Reuters that `` We have not predicted a Little Ice Age , '' but rather that `` We have predicted something going on with the Sun . ''

0	However , an important caveat is that invasion analysis may not always be sufficient for identifying stable coexistence .	The potential for SEM-AVS to act as a screening tool in evaluating sediment toxicity due to metals has led several regulatory bodies to use it in the establishment of regulatory assessments of sediment quality .	Conversely , high order interactions in communities with many species can lead to complex dynamics following an initially successful invasion , potentially preventing the invader from persisting stably in the long term .	For example , an invader that can only persist when a particular resident species is present at high density could alter community structure following invasion such that that resident species ' density declines or that it goes locally extinct , thereby preventing the invader from successfully establishing in the long term .	The 2008 Neutral theory by Stephen Hubbell attempts to model biodiversity through a migration-speciation-extinction balance , rather through selection .	It assumes that all members within a guild are inherently the same , and that changes in population density are a result of random births and deaths .

1	Ottoman Sign Language , also known as Seraglio Sign Language or Harem Sign Language , was a deaf sign language of the Ottoman court in Istanbul .	Nothing is known of it directly , but it is reported that it could communicate ideas of any complexity , and that it was passed on to the young through fables , histories , and scripture .	In 16th and 17th centuries , deaf pages , doormen , executioners , and companions of the sultan were valued for their ability to communicate silently , for their inability to overhear sensitive information at secret negotiations , and for the difficulty outsiders had in communicating with them or bribing them .	At court , silence was at a premium , and several sultans preferred that sign language be used in their presence ; they were able to jest with them in a way that would be inappropriately familiar in Turkish .	Osman II ( r. 1618–1622 ) was perhaps the first sultan to learn to sign , and ordered many of the hearing of his court to follow his lead .	At their height , there may have been over a hundred deaf courtiers at any one time ; it was considered undignified for the sultan to address his subjects orally , and also unseemly for those before him either to speak aloud , disturbing him , or to whisper secretly .

In sub-type CCI+ , current into `` Y '' produces current into `` Z '' ; in a CCI- , current into `` Y '' results in an equivalent current flowing `` out '' of `` Z '' .	In a more versatile later design , no current flows through terminal `` Y '' .	The ideal CCII can be seen as an ideal transistor , with perfected characteristics .	No current flows into the gate or base which is represented by `` Y '' .	There is no base-emitter or gate-source voltage drop , so the emitter or source voltage ( at `` X '' ) follows the voltage at `` Y '' .

1	Jewish manuscripts of Greek translations of the Old Testament ( Septuagint , Proto-Masoretic , kaige , the translations of Aquila of Sinope , Symmachus the Ebionite , Theodotion and the Hexapla ) differ from Christian manuscripts in not using Kύριος or the `` nomina sacra '' and ( with a horizontal line above the contracted words ) to represent the Tetragrammaton .	Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1007 is in fact difficult to identify as either Christian or Jewish , as on the barely legible recto side ( in Gen 2:18 ) it contains the nomen sacrum ( characteristic of Christian manuscripts ) and the Tetragrammaton represented as a double yodh יי ( characteristic of Jewish manuscripts ) .	According to Edmon Gallagher , a faculty member of Heritage Christian University , `` extant Greek manuscripts from Qumran and elsewhere that are unambiguously Jewish ( because of the date ) also include several ways of representing the Divine Name , none of which was with κύριος , the term used everywhere in our Christian manuscripts '' .	He concludes that there is no certainty about whether it was a Jew or a Christian who transcribed the Cairo Genizah manuscripts of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible by Aquila ( not the LXX ) , in which the Tetragrammaton is generally given in paleo-Hebrew letters but in one instance , where there was insufficient space at the end of a line , by , the `` nomen sacrum '' rendering of the genitive case of Κύριος .	Jewish manuscripts , such as those found in Qumran , did not render it into Greek , but instead reproduced it within the Greek text in several different ways .	Some gave it in either Hebrew , Aramaic or paleo-Hebrew letters .

1	These detectors exist in a form in which the decision-feedback path can be realized by simple table look-up operations , whereby the contents of these tables can be updated as a function of the operating conditions .	Analytical and experimental studies have shown that a judicious tradeoff between performance and state complexity leads to practical schemes with considerable performance gains .	Thus , reduced-state approaches are promising for increasing linear density .	Depending on the surface roughness and particle size , particulate media might exhibit nonstationary data-dependent transition or medium noise rather than colored stationary medium noise .	Improvements o\in the quality of the readback head as well as the incorporation of low-noise preamplifiers may render the data-dependent medium noise a significant component of the total noise affecting performance .	Because medium noise is correlated and data-dependent , information about noise and data patterns in past samples can provide information about noise in other samples .

1	Some doctors have described their use of Wikipedia as a `` guilty secret '' .	A 2015 study compared the popularity of Wikipedia 's articles on ten of the most common neurological disorders over a 90-day period from April 2014 to July 2014 ; it found that there was no relationship between the incidence or prevalence of a neurological disorder and the number of page views it received .

1	Though the cryptographic methods based on geometry have practically no real life applications , they are of use as pedagogic tools for the elucidation of other more complex cryptographic protocols .	Some of the geometric cryptographic methods are based on the impossibility of trisecting an angle using ruler and compass .	Given an arbitrary angle , there is a straightforward ruler and compass construction for finding the triple of the given angle .	But there is no ruler and compass construction for finding the angle which is exact one-third of a given angle .	Hence the function which assigns the triple of an angle to a given angle can be thought of as a one-way function , the only constructions allowed being ruler and compass constructions .	A geometric identification protocol has been suggested based on the one-way function indicated above .

Its source code management and Application performance management products aim at software developers , project managers and devops engineers .	The entire runtime interaction with ftrace is performed through readable and writable virtual files contained in a specifically mounted debugfs file system ; as a result , ftrace requires no specialized userspace utilities to operate .	However , there are additional userspace utilities that provide more advanced features for data recording , analysis and visualization ; examples of such utilities are `` trace-cmd '' and `` KernelShark '' .	Internally , ftrace relies on the gcc 's profiling mechanism to prepend machine instructions to the compiled versions of all source-level kernel functions , which redirect the execution of functions to the ftrace 's trampolines and tracer plugins that perform the actual tracing .	These `` entry point '' instructions created by gcc are altered by ftrace when the kernel is booted , and varied later at runtime by ftrace between NOPs and actual jumps to the tracing trampolines , depending on the tracing types and options configured at runtime .

Although the Ninth Circuit had routinely rejected the necessity defense as it applied to protestors , there had been no overall ruling that the defense was `` per se '' inapplicable .	The court noted that necessity is a utilitarian defense , meaning that it applies where the harm caused by the defendant 's actions outweighs the societal cost of inaction .

1	Like all Grignard dimers , Hauser bases derived from 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine ( TMP ) and HMDS are bridged by halides in the solid state .	In contrast to Grignard reagents , dimeric amido bridged Hauser bases exist , too .	All have one in common : they are bridged by less bulky amido ligands such as EtN− , PhP=N− and iPrN− .	The displacement to halide bridges may be a result of the bulky groups on the amide ligand .	Although there is a great deal of information on the utility of these reagents , very little is known regarding the nature of Hauser bases in solution .	One reason for that lack of information is that Hauser bases show a complex behaviour in solution .

1	Laurence Rees wrote , in response to Booker , that historians should treat every source they use sceptically , and that applies to written sources as much as eye-witness accounts. < br > '' Nigel Nicolson , a British officer with 3 Battalion , Welsh Guards , who took part in the infamous forced repatriations from Austria in the summer of 1945 , said to me that he had deliberately falsified the historical record at the time , writing that the Yugoslavian deportees had been offered ‘ light refreshments ’ by their Tito Communist guards .	He ’ d done this because he had been ordered not to tell the truth in his military report – that the deportees were being appallingly treated – and so had written something that he thought was so ludicrous – how could the deportees be given ‘ light refreshments ?	– that future historians would know he was being ironic .	But , before Mr Nicolson admitted what he ’ d done , some historians had taken his written report at face value and used it to try and ‘ prove ’ that the surviving deportees who now spoke of how badly they had been treated were lying .	If Nigel Nicolson hadn ’ t told the truth years later than that inaccurate report would still be in the written archives and the suffering of the deportees still disputed .	So my advice is to be as careful of the accuracy of written archives as you are careful of the accuracy of people . ''
