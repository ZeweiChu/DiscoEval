Nisan ( or Nissan ; , `` Nisan '' `` Nîsān '' ) on the Assyrian calendar is the first month , and on the Hebrew calendar is the first month of the ecclesiastical year and the seventh month ( eighth , in leap year ) of the civil year .	The name of the month is of Assyrian-Babylonian origin ; in the Torah it is called the month of the `` Aviv . ''
As the name was not a very common one , he is probably the `` Magister Hubertus , pictor '' recorded as having been paid in 1409 for panels in the church of Onze Lieve Vrouwe , Tongeren .	He is probably also the Master Hubert who had painted a panel bequeathed in 1413 by Jan de Visch van der Capelle to his daughter , a Benedictine nun near Grevelingen ; however he does not appear in guild records , and his heirs did not include any children , so it has been suggested that he may have been in minor orders , perhaps attached to what was then the abbey , now the cathedral , of St Bavo at Ghent , where his `` Ghent Altarpiece '' still remains , settling in Ghent by c. 1420 .
It is celebrated on the 22nd day of the Hebrew month of Tishrei in the Land of Israel , and on the 22nd and 23rd outside the Land , usually coinciding with late September or early October .	It directly follows the Jewish festival of Sukkot which is celebrated for `` seven '' days , and thus Shemini Atzeret is literally the `` eighth '' day .

Basil II ( ; 957/958 – 15 December 1025 ) , nicknamed the Bulgar Slayer ( ) , was a Byzantine Emperor from the Macedonian dynasty whose effective reign , the longest of any Byzantine monarch , was from 10 January 976 to 15 December 1025 .	The son of Romanos II and Theophano , a woman of commoner origin , he had been associated with the throne since 960 as a junior colleague to a succession of senior emperors–his father ( 960 to 963 ) , his step-father Nikephoros II Phokas ( 963 to 969 ) , and John I Tzimiskes ( 969 to 976 ) .
In the 2006 remake and its 2009 sequel , he is played by Steve Martin .	Clouseau 's likeness also appears in the Pink Panther animated cartoon shorts and segments .
Because the payoff is for accurately picking the date rather than performing the action of the assassin , it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability for the assassination .

In telecommunications , antenna blind cone ( sometimes called a cone of silence or antenna blind spot ) is the volume of space , usually approximately conical with its vertex at the antenna , that can not be scanned by an antenna because of limitations of the antenna radiation pattern and mount .	An Air Route Surveillance Radar ( ARSR ) is an example of an antenna blind cone .
Moreover , an antenna does not have an intrinsic `` antenna temperature '' associated with it ; rather the temperature depends on its gain pattern and the thermal environment that it is placed in .	Antenna noise temperature has contributions from several sources :
Instead of being filled with all 0s , as in logical shift , when shifting to the right , the leftmost bit ( usually the sign bit in signed integer representations ) is replicated to fill in all the vacant positions ( this is a kind of sign extension ) .	Some authors prefer the terms `` sticky right-shift '' and `` zero-fill right-shift '' for arithmetic and logical shifts respectively .
All three protocols usually use some form of sliding window protocol to tell the transmitter to determine which ( if any ) packets need to be retransmitted .	These protocols reside in the Data Link or Transport Layers of the OSI model .
In telecommunications , an atmospheric duct is a horizontal layer in the lower atmosphere in which the vertical refractive index gradients are such that radio signals ( and light rays ) are guided or ducted , tend to follow the curvature of the Earth , and experience less attenuation in the ducts than they would if the ducts were not present .	The duct acts as an atmospheric dielectric waveguide and limits the spread of the wavefront to only the horizontal dimension .
ARJ was one of two mainstream archivers for DOS and Windows during the early and mid-1990s , with PKZIP being its competition .	Parts of ARJ were covered by .
This phenomenon is called acoustic attenuation and is measured in decibels ( dBs ) .	In electrical engineering and telecommunications , attenuation affects the propagation of waves and signals in electrical circuits , in optical fibers , and in air .
In business , companies with significant telecommunications costs or a telecommunications focus normally either conduct audits internally or hire a consultant .	No matter the method , typical audits encompass one or more of the following :
An audit trail ( also called audit log ) is a security-relevant chronological record , set of records , and/or destination and source of records that provide documentary evidence of the sequence of activities that have affected at any time a specific operation , procedure , or event .	Audit records typically result from activities such as financial transactions , scientific research and health care data transactions , or communications by individual people , systems , accounts , or other entities .

In telecommunication , automatic sounding is the testing of selected channels for quality by providing a very brief identifying transmission that may be used by other stations to evaluate connectivity , and availability , and to identify known working channels for immediate or later use for communications or calling .	They are often used to maintain connectivity in digital communications high frequency radio networks .
In reliability theory and reliability engineering , the term availability has the following meanings :	For example , a unit that is capable of being used 100 hours per week ( 168 hours ) would have an availability of 100/168 .
In telecommunications , a back-to-back connection can be formed by connecting a transmitter directly to a receiver without a transmission line in between .	This is used for equipment measurements and testing purposes .
The backward-channel bandwidth is usually less than that of the primary channel , that is , the forward ( user information ) channel .	For example , ADSL 's upstream channel , considered a backward channel for some types of analysis , typically has a bandwidth less than one-fourth of the downstream channel .
The chief advantage of the balanced line format is good rejection of external noise when fed to a differential amplifier .	Common forms of balanced line are twin-lead , used for radio frequency signals and twisted pair , used for lower frequencies .

In telecommunication , the term bandwidth compression has the following meanings :	Bandwidth compression implies a reduction in normal bandwidth of an information-carrying signal without reducing the information content of the signal .
This allows the jammer to jam multiple radars at once , and reduces or eliminates the need for adjustments to respond to any single radar .	Early radar systems typically operated on a single frequency , and could only change that frequency by changing internal electronics .
a spectral magnitude that is nonzero only for frequencies in the vicinity of the origin ( termed `` f '' = 0 ) and negligible elsewhere .	In telecommunications and signal processing , baseband signals are transmitted without modulation , that is , without any shift in the range of frequencies of the signal .
The name `` Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem '' ( and the acronym `` BCH '' ) arises from the initials of the inventors ' surnames ( mistakenly , in the case of Ray-Chaudhuri ) .	One of the key features of BCH codes is that during code design , there is a precise control over the number of symbol errors correctable by the code .
Since beams typically do not have sharp edges , the diameter can be defined in many different ways .	Five definitions of the beam width are in common use : D4σ , 10/90 or 20/80 knife-edge , 1/e , FWHM , and D86 .
The term is relevant only in the `` far field '' , away from any focus of the beam .	Practically speaking , however , the far field can commence physically close to the radiating aperture , depending on aperture diameter and the operating wavelength .
This is done by changing the magnitude and phase of two or more loudspeakers installed in a column where the combined sound is added and cancelled at the required position .	Commercially , this type of loudspeaker arrangement is known as a line array .
The beamwidth can be computed for arbitrary antenna arrays .	Defining the array manifold as the complex response of the formula_1 element antenna array as formula_2 , where formula_2 is a matrix with formula_1 rows , the beam pattern is first computed as :
People may develop biases toward or against an individual , an ethnic group , a sexual or gender identity , a nation , a religion , a social class , a political party , theoretical paradigms and ideologies within academic domains , or a species .	Biased means one-sided , lacking a neutral viewpoint , or not having an open mind .
The bit error ratio ( also BER ) is the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transferred bits during a studied time interval .	Bit error ratio is a unitless performance measure , often expressed as a percentage .
One way to maintain timing between transmitting and receiving devices is to employ an asynchronous protocol such as start-stop .	Alternatively , bit slip can be prevented by using a self-clocking signal ( such as a signal modulated using OQPSK ) or using a line coding such as Manchester encoding .
Stuffed bits should not be confused with overhead bits .	Bit stuffing is used for various purposes , such as for bringing bit streams that do not necessarily have the same or rationally related bit rates up to a common rate , or to fill buffers or frames .
While branches can be nearly horizontal , vertical , or diagonal , the majority of trees have upwardly diagonal branches .	The term `` twig '' often refers to a terminus , while `` bough '' refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk .
When light encounters a boundary between two media with different refractive indices , some of it is usually reflected as shown in the figure above .	The fraction that is reflected is described by the Fresnel equations , and is dependent upon the incoming light 's polarization and angle of incidence .
Bridging loss is the loss , at a given frequency , that results when an impedance is connected across a transmission line .

It is not necessarily proportional to luminance .	This is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models .
In the 1980s , the term `` data burst '' was used for a technique used by some United Kingdom and South African TV programmes to transmit large amounts of primarily textual information .	They would display multiple pages of text in rapid succession , usually at the end of the programme ; viewers would videotape it and then read it later by playing it back using the pause button after each page .
In telecommunications , a call collision ( commonly known as glare ) is one of two things :	If you have ever tried to make a call out on a PBX , and been accidentally connected to an incoming call , you have experienced glare .
Instead of going to voicemail or simply sitting on hold until the line is free , this feature places you in a queue whereby the moment the line clears , the call will be put through .	Systems that provide this feature monitor the busy user until the user blocking signal ends , and then proceed to complete the requested access .
`` Note 1 : '' A call-second is equivalent to 1 call with a duration of 1 second .	`` Note 2 : '' One user making two 75-second calls is equivalent to two users each making one 75-second call .
There are two types of call tracing .	Permanent call tracing permits tracing of all calls .
In its simplest implementation , capacitive coupling is achieved by placing a capacitor between two nodes .	Where analysis of many points in a circuit is carried out , the capacitance at each point and between points can be described in a matrix form .
The capture effect is defined as the complete suppression of the weaker signal at the receiver limiter ( if it has one ) where the weaker signal is not amplified , but attenuated .	When both signals are nearly equal in strength , or are fading independently , the receiver may switch from one to the other and exhibit picket fencing .
CSMA/CA is a protocol that operates in the Data Link Layer ( Layer 2 ) of the OSI model .	Collision avoidance is used to improve the performance of the CSMA method by attempting to divide the channel somewhat equally among all transmitting nodes within the collision domain .
It uses carrier-sensing to defer transmissions until no other stations are transmitting .	This is used in combination with collision detection in which a transmitting station detects collisions by sensing transmissions from other stations while it is transmitting a frame .
A cable television system is an example of frequency-division multiplexing .	Many television programs are carried simultaneously on the same coaxial cable by sending each at a different frequency .

By definition , radiation produced by the transition between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium ( in the absence of external influences such as the Earth 's magnetic field ) has a frequency , , of exactly 9,192,631,770 Hz .
CSUs can be categorized by the class of service they support ( DS1 , DS3 , DDS , etc . )	and by the capabilities within that class .
The characteristic impedance or surge impedance ( usually written Z ) of a uniform transmission line is the ratio of the amplitudes of voltage and current of a single wave propagating along the line ; that is , a wave travelling in one direction in the absence of reflections in the other direction .	Alternatively and equivalently it can be defined as the input impedance of a transmission line when its length is infinite .
The circuit guarantees the full bandwidth of the channel and remains connected for the duration of the communication session .	The circuit functions as if the nodes were physically connected as with an electrical circuit .
At any instant of time , the electric field vector of the wave describes a helix along the direction of propagation .	A circularly polarized wave can be in one of two possible states , `` right circular polarization '' in which the electric field vector rotates in a right-hand sense with respect to the direction of propagation , and `` left circular polarization '' in which the vector rotates in a left-hand sense .
A `` port '' in this context is a point where an external waveguide or transmission line ( such as a microstrip line or a coaxial cable ) , connects to the device .	For a three-port circulator , a signal applied to port 1 only comes out of port 2 ; a signal applied to port 2 only comes out of port 3 ; a signal applied to port 3 only comes out of port 1 , so to up to a phase-factor , the scattering matrix for an ideal three-port circulator is

Wave interference is strong when the paths taken by all of the interfering waves differ by less than the coherence length .	A wave with a longer coherence length is closer to a perfect sinusoidal wave .
For an electromagnetic wave , the coherence time is the time over which a propagating wave ( especially a laser or maser beam ) may be considered coherent .	In other words , it is the time interval within which its phase is , on average , predictable .
The purpose of stacking multiple dipoles in a vertical collinear array is to increase the power radiated in horizontal directions and reduce the power radiated into the sky or down toward the earth , where it is wasted .	They radiate vertically polarized radio waves .

Extremism is often considered as antonym to compromise , which , depending on context , may be associated with concepts of balance and tolerance .	In the negative connotation , compromise may be referred to as capitulation , referring to a `` surrender '' of objectives , principles , or material , in the process of negotiating an agreement .

The term is broad in scope and may have widely different meanings depending on the specific context even under the same general umbrella of computing .	It is at times used as a proxy term for data quality , while data validation is a pre-requisite for data integrity .
These are governed by a link protocol enabling digital data to be transferred from a data source to a data sink .	There are at least three types of basic data-link configurations that can be conceived of and used :
The device converts bipolar digital signals coming ultimately from a digital circuit and directly from a Channel service unit ( CSU ) , into a format ( e.g .	RS- 530 ) compatible with the piece of data terminal equipment ( DTE ) ( e.g .
The `` maximum user signaling rate '' , synonymous to gross bitrate or data signaling rate , is the maximum rate , in bits per second , at which binary information can be transferred in a given direction between users over the telecommunications system facilities dedicated to a particular information transfer transaction , under conditions of continuous transmission and no overhead information .	For a single channel , the signaling rate is given by , where `` SCSR '' is the single-channel signaling rate in bits per second , `` T '' is the minimum time interval in seconds for which each level must be maintained , and n is the number of significant conditions of modulation of the channel .
In communications messages , a date-time group ( DTG ) is a set of characters , usually in a prescribed format , used to express the year , the month , the day of the month , the hour of the day , the minute of the hour , and the time zone , if different from Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) .	The order in which these elements are presented may vary .
By 1952 the company no longer had its own stand at the Paris Motor Show , but one of their cars appeared as a star attraction on the large Panhard stand , reflecting the level of cooperation between the two businesses .	The company was defunct by 1961 , as Deutsch and Bonnet 's differing design philosophies hamstrung further cooperation .
In the measurement of loudness , for example , an A-weighting filter is commonly used to emphasize frequencies around 3–6 kHz where the human ear is most sensitive , while attenuating very high and very low frequencies to which the ear is insensitive .	The aim is to ensure that measured loudness corresponds well with subjectively perceived loudness .
dBm ( sometimes dB or decibel-milliwatts ) is unit of level used to indicate that a power ratio is expressed in decibels ( dB ) with reference to one milliwatt ( mW ) .	It is used in radio , microwave and fiber-optical communication networks as a convenient measure of absolute power because of its capability to express both very large and very small values in a short form compared to dBW , which is referenced to one watt ( 1,000 mW ) .
Thus , 0 dBrn = -90 dBm .	Use of 144 line , 144-receiver , or C-message weighting , or flat weighting , can be indicated in parentheses .
A data circuit-terminating equipment ( DCE ) is a device that sits between the data terminal equipment ( DTE ) and a data transmission circuit .	It is also called data communication ( s ) equipment and data carrier equipment .
The degree of isochronous distortion , in data transmission , is the ratio of the absolute value of the maximum measured difference between the actual and the theoretical intervals separating any two significant instants of modulation ( or demodulation ) , to the unit interval .	These instants are not necessarily consecutive .
In delta modulation , the transmitted data are reduced to a 1-bit data stream .	Its main features are :
formula_1	The demand factor is often implicitly averaged over time when the time period of demand is understood by the context .
DOs are used because applicable systems standards are not in existence .	Examples of reasons for designating a performance characteristic as a DO rather than as a standard are ( a ) it may be bordering on an advancement in the state of the art , ( b ) the requirement may not have been fully confirmed by measurement or experience with operating circuits , and ( c ) it may not have been demonstrated that the requirement can be met considering other constraints , such as cost and size .
In the most common variant of pulse dialing , decadic dialing , each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses .	The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9 , as one to nine pulses , respectively , and the digit 0 as ten pulses .
When a dielectric is placed in an electric field , electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization .	Because of dielectric polarization , positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction .
In physics , the term dielectric strength has the following meanings :	The theoretical dielectric strength of a material is an intrinsic property of the bulk material and is independent of the configuration of the material or the electrodes with which the field is applied .
It is not necessary to know the polarity of the sent signal since the information is not represented by the absolute voltage levels but in their changes : in other words it does not matter which of the two voltage levels is received , but only whether it is the same or different from the previous one ; this makes synchronization easier .	Differential Manchester encoding has the following advantages over some other line codes :
The directions of these beams depend on the spacing of the grating and the wavelength of the light so that the grating acts as the dispersive element .	Because of this , gratings are commonly used in monochromators and spectrometers .
This is in contrast to the other major type of electronic filter , the analog filter , which is an electronic circuit operating on continuous-time analog signals .	A digital filter system usually consists of an analog-to-digital converter ( ADC ) to sample the input signal , followed by a microprocessor and some peripheral components such as memory to store data and filter coefficients etc .
When decoding the digital milliwatt , a PCM decoder produces a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of 1000 Hz with one milliwatt in power .	The digital milliwatt signal is encoded by eight 8-bit words corresponding to one pulse-code modulated cycle of the signal .
For a typical phone call , the audio sound is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate , or 8000 samples per second , using 8-bit pulse-code modulation for each of the samples .	This results in a data rate of 64 kbit/s .
In telecommunications marketing , the term DSL is widely understood to mean asymmetric digital subscriber line ( ADSL ) , the most commonly installed DSL technology , for Internet access .	DSL service can be delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line since DSL uses higher frequency bands for data .
In the North American and Japanese T-carrier digital hierarchies , each digroup supports 12 PCM voice channels or their equivalent in other services .	The DS1 line rate ( 2 digroups plus overhead bits ) is 1.544 Mbit/s , supporting 24 voice channels or their equivalent in other services .
Direct distance dialing ( DDD ) is a telecommunication service feature in which a caller may , without operator assistance , call any other user outside the local calling area .	Direct dialing by subscribers typically requires extra digits to be dialed as prefixes than for dialing within the local area or within an area code .
In telecommunications , direct-sequence spread spectrum ( DSSS ) is a spread spectrum modulation technique used to reduce overall signal interference .	The spreading of this signal makes the resulting wideband channel more noisy , allowing for greater resistance to unintentional and intentional interference .
Practically , this means that the waveform at the input will be different from the waveform at the output of the link .	Note that the amount of allowable degradation is dependent on the quality of the receiver .
Distortion is the alteration of the original shape ( or other characteristic ) of something .	In communications and electronics it means the alteration of the waveform of an information-bearing signal , such as an audio signal representing sound or a video signal representing images , in an electronic device or communication channel .
Unlike parallel systems , in which the processors are tightly coupled and constitute a single database system , a distributed database system consists of loosely coupled sites that share no physical components .	System administrators can distribute collections of data ( e.g .
To appreciate the innovative value of the DQDB MAC algorithm , it must be seen against the background of LAN protocols at that time , which were based on broadcast ( such as ethernet IEEE 802.3 ) or a ring ( like token ring IEEE 802.5 and FDDI ) .	The DQDB may be thought of as two token rings , one carrying data in each direction around the ring .
Distributed switching is an architecture in which multiple processor-controlled switching units are distributed .	There is often a hierarchy of switching elements , with a centralized host switch and with remote switches located close to concentrations of users .
The U.S .	Naval Observatory master clock is one of the two standard time and frequency references for the U.S. Government in accordance with Federal Standard 1002-A .
DSB-SC transmission is a special case of double-sideband reduced carrier transmission .	It is used for radio data systems .
A drop may form when liquid accumulates at the lower end of a tube or other surface boundary , producing a hanging drop called a pendant drop .	Drops may also be formed by the condensation of a vapor or by atomization of a larger mass of liquid .
`` , time slot or frequency band , previously occupied by the diverted signal .	The diverted signal may be demodulated or reinserted into another transmission system in the same or another time slot or frequency band .
Increasingly complex circuits required more signal and power supply leads ( as observed in Rent 's rule ) ; eventually microprocessors and similar complex devices required more leads than could be put on a DIP package , leading to development of higher-density packages .	Furthermore , square and rectangular packages made it easier to route printed-circuit traces beneath the packages .
Duplexers can be based on frequency ( often a waveguide filter ) , polarization ( such as an orthomode transducer ) , or timing ( as is typical in radar ) .	In radar , a transmit/receive ( TR ) switch alternately connects the transmitter and receiver to a shared antenna .
A period is the time it takes for a signal to complete an on-and-off cycle .	As a formula , a duty cycle ( % ) may be expressed as :
It is often used in the context of signals , like sound and light .	It is measured either as a ratio or as a base-10 ( decibel ) or base-2 ( doublings , bits or stops ) logarithmic value of the difference between the smallest and largest signal values .
In Greek mythology , Echo ( ; , `` Ēkhō '' , `` echo '' , from ἦχος ( `` ēchos '' ) , `` sound '' ) was an Oread who resided on Mount Cithaeron .	Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and often visited them on Earth .
In low-frequency applications involving loaded or nonloaded vertical antennas , the effective height is the moment of the current distribution in the vertical section , divided by the input current .	For an antenna with a symmetrical current distribution , the center of radiation is the center of the distribution .
The diameter of the near-field radiation pattern is defined here as the full width at half maximum and the radiation angle at half maximum radiant intensity .	Effective mode volume is proportional to the breadth of the relative distribution of power amongst the modes in a multimode fiber .
The practical conditions of measurement should be specified , especially the duration of the measurement .	Telegraph communications may have different temporal efficiency factors for the two directions of transmission .
In telecommunications and electrical engineering , electrical length ( or phase length )	refers to the length of an electrical conductor in terms of the phase shift introduced by transmission over that conductor at some frequency .
An electric field ( sometimes abbreviated as E-field ) is a vector field surrounding an electric charge that exerts force on other charges , attracting or repelling them .	Mathematically the electric field is a vector field that associates to each point in space the force , called the Coulomb force , that would be experienced per unit of charge by an infinitesimal test charge at that point .
Each is a means of conveying lineage .	Patronymics are still in use , including mandatory use , in many countries worldwide , although their use has largely been replaced by or transformed into patronymic surnames .
A cinematographer or director of photography ( sometimes shortened to DP or DOP ) is the chief over the camera and light crews working on a film , television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image .	The study and practice of this field is referred to as cinematography .
During his early period , he also published under a variety of pseudonyms .	His first novel , `` What Entropy Means to Me '' ( 1972 ) , was nominated for the Nebula Award .
A powerful and influential centre of commerce in medieval Germany , Braunschweig was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th until the 17th century .	It was the capital city of three successive states : the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel ( 1269–1432 , 1754–1807 , and 1813–1814 ) , the Duchy of Brunswick ( 1814–1918 ) , and the Free State of Brunswick ( 1918–1946 ) .
While some drugs are illegal to possess , many governments regulate the manufacture , distribution , marketing , sale and use of certain drugs , for instance through a prescription system .	For example , amphetamines may be legal to possess if a doctor has prescribed them ; otherwise , possession or sale of the drug is typically a criminal offence .
This represents a multi-billion-US $ market for companies such as Oxford Instruments and Siemens .	The magnets typically use low-temperature superconductors ( LTS ) because high-temperature superconductors are not yet cheap enough to cost-effectively deliver the high , stable , and large-volume fields required , notwithstanding the need to cool LTS instruments to liquid helium temperatures .
He was a suitor for the Queen 's hand for many years .	Dudley 's youth was overshadowed by the downfall of his family in 1553 after his father , the Duke of Northumberland , had failed to prevent the accession of Mary I. Robert Dudley was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and took part in the Battle of St. Quentin under Mary 's husband and co-ruler , Philip , which led to his full rehabilitation .
The treaty concluded the Thirteen Years ' War which had begun in February 1454 with the revolt of the Prussian Confederation , led by the cities of Danzig ( Gdańsk ) , Elbing ( Elbląg ) , Kulm ( Chełmno ) and Thorn , and the Prussian gentry against the rule of the Teutonic Knights in the Monastic State .	Both sides agreed to seek confirmation from Pope Paul II and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III , but the Polish side stressed ( and the Teutonic side agreed ) that this confirmation would not be needed for validation of the treaty .
Studies of past changes in the environment and biodiversity often reflect on the current situation , specifically the impact of climate on mass extinctions and biotic recovery .	The scientific study field of paleoclimate began to form in the early 19th century , when discoveries about glaciations and natural changes in Earth 's past climate helped to understand the greenhouse effect.The first observations which had a real scientific basis were probably those by John Hardcastle in New Zealand , in the 1880s .

They detected this effect only indirectly because the magnetic flux is conserved by a superconductor : when the interior field decreases , the exterior field increases .	The experiment demonstrated for the first time that superconductors were more than just perfect conductors and provided a uniquely defining property of the superconductor state .
In the humanities in modern academia , the latter style of scholarship is an outgrowth of critical theory and is often called simply `` theory '' .	As a consequence , the word `` theory '' has become an umbrella term for a variety of scholarly approaches to reading texts .
Though the two activities are closely related , literary critics are not always , and have not always been , theorists .	Whether or not literary criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from literary theory , or conversely from book reviewing , is a matter of some controversy .

Together with the Tumen River to its east , and a small portion of Paektu Mountain , the Yalu forms the border between North Korea and China and is notable as a site involved in military conflicts such as the First Sino-Japanese War , the Russo-Japanese War , World War II , and the Korean War .
The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back at least 75 years .	Hybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling , while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity .
A monopropellant rocket ( or `` monoprop rocket '' ) is a rocket that uses a single chemical as its propellant .	For monopropellant rockets that depend on a chemical reaction , the power for the propulsive reaction and resultant thrust is provided by the chemical itself .
Heating is usually achieved by sending electricity through a resistor consisting of a hot incandescent filament , with the expanded gas expelled through a conventional nozzle .	Resistojets have been flown in space since 1965 on board military Vela satellites .
This imparts additional energy to the propellant , so that one can extract more work out of each kilogram of propellant , at the expense of increased power consumption and ( usually ) higher cost .	Also , the thrust levels available from typically used arcjet engines are very low compared with chemical engines .
Hall-effect thrusters ( based on the discovery by Edwin Hall ) are sometimes referred to as Hall thrusters or Hall-current thrusters .	Hall thrusters are often regarded as a moderate specific impulse ( 1,600s ) space propulsion technology .
An ion thruster or ion drive is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion .	It creates thrust by accelerating positive ions with electricity .
It is sometimes referred to as Lorentz Force Accelerator ( LFA ) or ( mostly in Japan ) MPD arcjet .	Generally , a gaseous material is ionized and fed into an acceleration chamber , where the magnetic and electrical fields are created using a power source .
Most PPTs use a solid material ( normally PTFE , more commonly known as Teflon ) for propellant , although very few use liquid or gaseous propellants .	The first stage in PPT operation involves an arc of electricity passing through the fuel , causing ablation and sublimation of the fuel .
A nuclear thermal rocket is a proposed spacecraft propulsion technology .	In a nuclear thermal rocket a working fluid , usually liquid hydrogen , is heated to a high temperature in a nuclear reactor , and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust .
Technically the powerplant is nuclear , not the propulsion system , but the terminology is standard .	A number of heat-to-electricity schemes have been proposed : Rankine cycle , Brayton cycle , Stirling cycle , thermoelectric ( including graphene-based thermal power conversion ) , pyroelectric , thermophotovoltaic , thermionic and magnetohydrodynamic type thermoelectric materials .
Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path .	After leaving the path , the payload continues to move due to momentum .
A magnetic sail could also thrust directly against planetary and solar magnetospheres .	The magnetic sail was proposed by Dana Andrews and Robert Zubrin working in collaboration in 1988 .
A gas nuclear reactor ( or gas fueled reactor or vapor core reactor ) is a proposed kind of nuclear reactor in which the nuclear fuel would be in a gaseous state rather than liquid or solid .	In this type of reactor , the only temperature-limiting materials would be the reactor walls .
In place of traditional chemical propellant , such as that in a chemical rocket , the rocket would be fueled by salts of plutonium or 20 percent enriched uranium .	The solution would be contained in a bundle of pipes coated in boron carbide ( for its properties of neutron absorption ) .
The beam is typically either a microwave or a laser beam and it is either pulsed or continuous .	A continuous beam lends itself to thermal rockets , photonic thrusters and light sails , whereas a pulsed beam lends itself to ablative thrusters and pulse detonation engines .
Photonic rockets are technologically feasible , but rather impractical with current technology based on an onboard nuclear power source .	However , the recent development of Photonic Laser Thruster ( PLT ) , the Beamed Laser Propulsion ( BLP ) with photon recycling , promises to overcome these issues by separating the nuclear power source and the spacecraft and by increasing the thrust to nuclear power ratio ( specific thrust ) by orders of magnitude .
The design relies on the development of fusion power technology beyond current capabilities , and the construction of rockets much larger and more complex than any current spacecraft .	A smaller and lighter fusion reactor might be possible in the future when more sophisticated methods have been devised to control magnetic confinement and prevent plasma instabilities .
The Bussard ramjet is a theoretical method of spacecraft propulsion proposed in 1960 by the physicist Robert W. Bussard , popularized by Poul Anderson 's novel `` Tau Zero '' , Larry Niven in his `` Known Space '' series of books , Vernor Vinge in his `` Zones of Thought '' series , and referred to by Carl Sagan in the television series and book `` '' .	Bussard proposed a ramjet variant of a fusion rocket capable of reasonable interstellar travel , using enormous electromagnetic fields ( ranging from kilometers to many thousands of kilometers in diameter ) as a ram scoop to collect and compress hydrogen from the interstellar medium .
There are several designs that attempt to accomplish this goal .	The advantage to this class of rocket is that a large fraction of the rest mass of a matter/antimatter mixture may be converted to energy , allowing antimatter rockets to have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket .
Although the metric proposed by Alcubierre is consistent with the Einstein field equations , it may not be physically meaningful , in which case a drive will not be possible .	Even if it is physically meaningful , its possibility would not necessarily mean that a drive can be constructed .
It led to the division of Western Christianity into different confessions ( Catholic , Lutheran , Reformed , Anglican , Anabaptist , Unitarian , etc . ) .	By the time of its arrival , Western Christianity was only compromised in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown , where Utraquist Hussitism was officially acknowledged by both the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor ; in addition , various movements ( including Lollards in England and Waldensians in Italy and France ) were still being actively suppressed .
It was enacted as Tennessee Code Annotated Title 49 ( Education ) Section 1922 , having been signed into law by Tennessee governor Austin Peay .	The law also prevented the teaching of the evolution of man from what it referred to as lower orders of animals in place of the Biblical account .
The volumes were edited by Rev .	Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson .
Intuitively we expect that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function , the fidelity of the result depends on the density ( or sample rate ) of the original samples .	The sampling theorem introduces the concept of a sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are bandlimited to a given bandwidth , such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process .
Unlike the Ante-Nicene Fathers which was produced by using earlier translations of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library ( ANCL ) , the `` Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers '' was printed simultaneously in Europe and in America , by T. & T. Clark , by Christian Literature Company and other American editors .	T. & T. Clark was surely convinced by the commercial success of the cheaper American version/revision of the ANCL , although of lesser quality on some minor points .
Pope Leo XI ( 2 June 1535 – 27 April 1605 ) , born Alessandro Ottaviano de ' Medici , was Pope from 1 to 27 April 1605 .	His pontificate is one of the briefest in history having lasted under a month .
The second son of Lorenzo the Magnificent , ruler of the Florentine Republic , he was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489 .	Following the death of Pope Julius II , Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College .
Beta particles with an energy of 0.5 MeV have a range of about one metre in air ; the distance is dependent on the particle energy .	Beta particles are a type of ionizing radiation and for radiation protection purposes are regarded as being less ionising than alpha particles , but more ionising than gamma rays .
He was home-schooled until he was 13 , when he attended the College in Schulpforta in 1803 , and studied there , graduating in 1809 .	He then enrolled at the University of Leipzig , where he studied astronomy under the mathematician and astronomer Karl Mollweide .

A broader sense of the term crocodile , Crocodylidae that includes `` Tomistoma '' , is not used in this article .	The term crocodile here applies to only the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae .
The work premiered on 9 February 1893 at La Scala , Milan .	Verdi wrote `` Falstaff '' , which was the last of his 28 operas , as he was approaching the age of 80 .
Today the work holds a central place in the operatic canon , receiving performances every year around the world ; at New York 's Metropolitan Opera alone , `` Aida '' has been sung more than 1,100 times since 1886 .	Ghislanzoni 's scheme follows a scenario often attributed to the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette , but Verdi biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz argues that the source is actually Temistocle Solera .
Dolenz began his show-business career in 1956 when he starred in a children 's TV show called `` Circus Boy '' under the name Mickey Braddock .	He played Corky , an orphaned water boy for the elephants in a one-ring circus at the start of the 20th century .
When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction , the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on that system .	The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is also called thrust .
In shape , the Savoy knot is comparable to a figure eight .	When used outside heraldry ( as a real knot ) , it is known as a figure-eight knot .
The conjecture is that no matter what value of `` n '' , the sequence will always reach 1 .	The conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz , who introduced the idea in 1937 , two years after receiving his doctorate .
He was born around the beginning of the 3rd century in North Africa , perhaps at Carthage , where he received a classical education .	Soon after converting to Christianity , he became a bishop in 249 .
In the summer when the mature plant may have a height of , it bears sweetly scented pink or white flowers that attract many fly species , especially hoverflies of the genus `` Eristalis '' .	It is consumed as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera ( butterfly and moth ) species , including the grey pug .
The opera was originally titled `` Violetta '' , after the main character .	It was first performed on 6 March 1853 at the La Fenice opera house in Venice .
These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora .	For Verdi , the three years were filled with operatic activity because work on this opera did not proceed while the composer wrote and premiered `` Rigoletto '' in Venice in March 1851 and also while his personal affairs limited his activities .
Ernani is an operatic `` dramma lirico '' in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave , based on the play `` Hernani '' by Victor Hugo .	Verdi was commissioned by the Teatro La Fenice in Venice to write an opera , but finding the right subject took some time , and the composer worked with the inexperienced Piave in shaping first one and then another drama by Hugo into an acceptable libretto .
In addition , it has been noted by David Kimball that the Fontainebleau scene and auto da fé `` were the most substantial of several incidents borrowed from a contemporary play on Philip II by Eugène Cormon '' .	The opera is most often performed in Italian translation , usually under the title Don Carlo .
On a sub-orbital spaceflight , a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface , without having gone into an orbit .	For orbital spaceflights , spacecraft enter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies .
With escape velocity in a direction pointing away from the ground of a massive body , the object will move away from the body , slowing forever and approaching , but never reaching , zero speed .	Once escape velocity is achieved , no further impulse need be applied for it to continue in its escape .
Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance , unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years .	`` Carmen '' has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon ; the `` Habanera '' from act 1 and the `` Toreador Song '' from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias .
The master singers had developed a craftsmanlike approach to music-making , with an intricate system of rules for composing and performing songs .	The work draws much of its atmosphere from its depiction of the Nuremberg of the era and the traditions of the master-singer guild .
The work was premiered on 30 September 1791 at Schikaneder 's theatre , the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna , just two months before the composer 's premature death .	In this opera , the Queen of the Night persuades Prince Tamino to rescue her daughter Pamina from captivity under the high priest Sarastro ; instead , he learns the high ideals of Sarastro 's community and seeks to join it .
The libretto was based on Pierre Beaumarchais 's French comedy `` Le Barbier de Séville '' ( 1775 ) .	The première of Rossini 's opera ( under the title `` Almaviva , o sia L'inutile precauzione '' ) took place on 20 February 1816 at the Teatro Argentina , Rome , with designs by Angelo Toselli .
In 1946 , fifty years after the opera 's premiere , Toscanini conducted a commemorative performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra .	A recording of the performance was later released by RCA Victor on vinyl record , tape and compact disc .
While it was often held that Mascagni , like Leoncavallo , was a `` one-opera man '' who could never repeat his first success , `` L'amico Fritz '' and `` Iris '' have remained in the repertoire in Europe ( especially Italy ) since their premieres .	Mascagni said that at one point , `` Iris '' was performed in Italy more often than `` Cavalleria '' ( cf .
Giuseppe Saverio Raffaele Mercadante ( baptised 17 September 179517 December 1870 ) was an Italian composer , particularly of operas .	While Mercadante may not have retained the international celebrity of Gaetano Donizetti or Gioachino Rossini beyond his own lifetime , he composed as prolific a number of works as either ; and his development of operatic structures , melodic styles and orchestration contributed significantly to the foundations upon which Giuseppe Verdi built his dramatic technique .
A `` Final Chapter '' movie , three OVAs , and a music special were also produced , with a live-action movie made by Toei in 1986 .	A live-action TV special aired in May 2007 on TV Asahi , with a finale aired in July 2008 .
Donizetti was born in Bergamo in Lombardy .	Although he did not come from a musical background , at an early age he was taken under the wing of composer Simon Mayr who had enrolled him by means of a full scholarship in a school which he had set up .
Bell Helicopter manufactured the OH-58 for the United States Army based on its Model 206A JetRanger helicopter .	The OH-58 was in continuous U.S. Army service from 1969 to 2017 , when it was replaced in this role by the Boeing AH-64 Apache .
Today he remains largely known for `` Pagliacci '' , one of the most popular works in the repertory , appearing as number 20 on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide in the 2013/14 season .	His other well-known works include the song `` Mattinata '' , popularized by Enrico Caruso , as well as the symphonic poem `` La nuit de mai '' .
Today he is particularly known for his operas `` L'arlesiana '' and `` Adriana Lecouvreur '' .	Born in Palmi near Reggio di Calabria , Cilea gave early indication of an aptitude for music when at the age of four he heard a performance of Vincenzo Bellini 's `` Norma '' and was greatly affected by it .
The Army designated the prototype as the `` YUH-60A '' and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976 , after a fly-off competition with the Boeing Vertol YUH-61 .	Named after the Native American war leader Black Hawk , the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979 , to replace the Bell UH-1 Iroquois as the Army 's tactical transport helicopter .
Cimarosa was principally based in Naples , but spent some of his career in various other parts of Italy , composing for the opera houses of Rome , Venice , Florence and elsewhere .	He was engaged by the empress of Russia Catherine the Great as her court composer and conductor between 1787 and 1791 .
His first 25 or so operas were written when Gioachino Rossini dominated the Italian operatic stage .	But Pacini 's operas were `` rather superficial '' , a fact which , later , he candidly admitted in his `` Memoirs '' .
Paisiello was born in Taranto in the Apulia region and educated by the Jesuits there .	He became known for his beautiful singing voice and in 1754 was sent to the Conservatorio di S. Onofrio at Naples , where he studied under Francesco Durante , and eventually became assistant master .
Light with a shorter wavelength than violet but longer than X-rays and gamma rays is called ultraviolet .	In the color wheel historically used by painters , it is located between blue and purple .
Purple is a color intermediate between blue and red .	It is similar to violet , but unlike violet , which is a spectral color with its own wavelength on the visible spectrum of light , purple is a secondary color made by combining red and blue .
The paradox is variously applied to a prisoner 's hanging , or a surprise school test .	It is a particular case of Newcomb 's paradox .
Feldspars crystallize from magma as veins in both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock .	Rock formed almost entirely of calcic plagioclase feldspar ( see below ) is known as anorthosite .

Recorded history began on 12 October 1492 , when Christopher Columbus landed on the island of Guanahani , which he renamed San Salvador Island on his first voyage to the New World .	The earliest permanent European settlement was in 1648 on Eleuthera .
It is a simple check to see if the produced material is rational ( that the material 's creator was thinking rationally , applying sanity ) .	The point of a sanity test is to rule out certain classes of obviously false results , not to catch every possible error .
Frequently described as a planet-like moon , Titan is 50 % larger than Earth 's moon and 80 % more massive .	It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter 's moon Ganymede , and is larger than the smallest planet , Mercury , but only 40 % as massive .
The history of instrumentation can be divide into several phases .	Elements of industrial instrumentation have long histories .
The marriage was declared unconsummated and , as a result , she was not crowned queen consort .	Following the annulment , she was given a generous settlement by the King , and thereafter referred to as `` the King 's Beloved Sister '' .
Catherine Parr ( sometimes alternatively spelled Katherine , Katheryn or Katharine , signed 'Kateryn the Quene KP ' ) ( ) was Queen of England and Ireland ( 1543–47 ) as the last of the six wives of King Henry VIII , and the final queen consort of the House of Tudor .	She married him on 12 July 1543 , and outlived him by one year .
Some of his ideas and aesthetics influenced Italian fascism and the style of Benito Mussolini and , thereby , Adolf Hitler ; he has been described as `` the father of Fascism '' .	D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works , which interplayed closely with French Symbolism and British Aestheticism .
Margaret of Anjou ( ; 23 March 1430 – 25 August 1482 ) was the Queen of England by marriage to King Henry VI from 1445 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471 .	Born in the Duchy of Lorraine into the House of Valois-Anjou , Margaret was the second eldest daughter of René , King of Naples , and Isabella , Duchess of Lorraine .
The term can legitimately refer to any form of psychotherapy when delivered in a group format , including cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy , but it is usually applied to psychodynamic group therapy where the group context and group process is explicitly utilised as a mechanism of change by developing , exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group .	The broader concept of `` group therapy '' can be taken to include any helping process that takes place in a group , including support groups , skills training groups ( such as anger management , mindfulness , relaxation training or social skills training ) , and psychoeducation groups .

The finite simple groups have been completely classified .	Every such group belongs to one of 18 countably infinite families , or is one of 26 sporadic groups that do not follow such a systematic pattern .
is an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord .	The tall structure is usually a fixed object , such as a building , bridge or crane ; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object , such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter , that has the ability to hover above the ground .
The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into the opposing team 's goal .	The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match .
In 1983 it was officially named after Atlas of Greek mythology , because it `` holds the rings on its shoulders '' like the Titan Atlas held the sky up above the Earth .	It is also designated ' .
Later , he became commonly identified with the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa and was said to be `` King of Mauretania '' .	Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy , mathematics , and astronomy .
An atlas is a collection of maps ; it is typically a bundle of maps of Earth or a region of Earth .	Atlases have traditionally been bound into book form , but today many atlases are in multimedia formats .
The atlas is the topmost vertebra and with the axis forms the joint connecting the skull and spine .	The atlas and axis are specialized to allow a greater range of motion than normal vertebrae .
The Atlas Mountains ( ; , `` idurar n waṭlas '' ) are a mountain range in the Maghreb .	It stretches around through Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia .
The alternative term , `` telamones '' , also is derived from a later mythological hero , Telamon , one of the Argonauts , who was the father of Ajax .	The caryatid is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece , a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar .
An atlas consists of individual `` charts '' that , roughly speaking , describe individual regions of the manifold .	If the manifold is the surface of the Earth , then an atlas has its more common meaning .

Vera Ellen Wang was born and raised in New York City , and is of Chinese descent .	Her parents were born in China , and came to the United States in the mid-1940s .
The publicized suicide serves as a trigger , in the absence of protective factors , for the next suicide by a susceptible or suggestible person .	This is referred to as suicide contagion .
Materials vary widely ; while wooden boards are generally used in high-level games ; vinyl , plastic , and cardboard are common for regular and common play .	Decorative glass and marble boards are available but rarely accepted for games rated by national or international chess federations .
This is in contrast to the troposphere , near the Earth 's surface , where temperature decreases with altitude .	The border between the troposphere and stratosphere , the tropopause , marks where this temperature inversion begins .
As the captain of the starship USS `` Enterprise '' , Kirk leads his crew as they explore `` new worlds , to boldly go where no man has gone before '' .	Often , the characters of Spock and Leonard McCoy act as his logical and emotional sounding boards , respectively .
This characteristic is used to define its limits : it begins at the top of the stratosphere ( sometimes called the stratopause ) , and ends at the mesopause , which is the coldest part of Earth 's atmosphere with temperatures below .	The exact upper and lower boundaries of the mesosphere vary with latitude and with season ( higher in winter and at the tropics , lower in summer and at the poles ) , but the lower boundary is usually located at heights from above the Earth 's surface and the upper boundary ( mesopause ) is usually around .
At these high altitudes , the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass ( see turbosphere ) .	Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation .
The deified Aten is the focus of the monotheistic religion of Atenism established by Amenhotep IV , who later took the name Akhenaten ( died ca .	1335 BCE ) in worship and recognition of Aten .
The mesopause is the temperature minimum at the boundary between the mesosphere and the thermosphere atmospheric regions .	Due to the lack of solar heating and very strong radiative cooling from carbon dioxide , the mesosphere is the coldest region on Earth with temperatures as low as -100 °C ( -148 °F or 173 K ) .
The Apollo asteroids are a group of near-Earth asteroids named after 1862 Apollo , discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in the 1930s .	They are Earth-crossing asteroids that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of the Earth ( > 1 AU ) but perihelion distances less than the Earth 's aphelion distance ( q < 1.017 AU ) .
An algal bloom or algae bloom is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of algae in freshwater or marine water systems , and is recognized by the discoloration in the water from their pigments .	Cyanobacteria were mistaken for algae in the past , so cyanobacterial blooms are sometimes also called algal blooms .
In optics , an aperture is a hole or an opening through which light travels .	More specifically , the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the cone angle of a bundle of rays that come to a focus in the image plane .
The measurement of altitude is called altimetry , which is related to the term bathymetry , the measurement of depth under water .	Altitude can be determined based on the measurement of atmospheric pressure .
The Ames Research Center ( ARC ) , also known as NASA Ames , is a major NASA research center at Moffett Federal Airfield in California 's Silicon Valley .	It was founded in 1939 as the second National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) laboratory .
An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock , rock fractures or unconsolidated materials ( gravel , sand , or silt ) .	Groundwater can be extracted using a water well .
The standard atmosphere ( symbol : atm ) is a unit of pressure defined as , equivalent to 760mmHg ( torr ) , 29.9212inchesHg , or 14.696psi .	The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth .
If a player 's king is threatened with capture , it is said to be `` in check '' , and the player must remove the threat of on the next move .	If this can not be done , the king is said to be in checkmate , resulting in a loss for that player .
There may be coral islands or cays on the rim .	The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water .
form of the Arabic noun `` السَّمْت '' `` as-samt '' , meaning `` the direction '' ) is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system .	The vector from an observer ( origin ) to a point of interest is projected perpendicularly onto a reference plane ; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth .
Many measurements of air pressure are used within surface weather analysis to help find surface troughs , high pressure systems and frontal boundaries .	Barometers and pressure altimeters ( the most basic and common type of altimeter ) are essentially the same instrument , but used for different purposes .
Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms , such as bacteria , fungi .	The process of biodegradation can be divided into three stages : biodeterioration , biofragmentation , and assimilation .
Biomass can refer to `` species biomass '' , which is the mass of one or more species , or to `` community biomass '' , which is the mass of all species in the community .	It can include microorganisms , plants or animals .
Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby , the character made his debut in `` The Fantastic Four '' # 5 ( July 1962 ) .	The Monarch of the fictional nation Latveria , Doom is usually depicted as the archenemy of Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four , though he has come into conflict with other superheroes as well , including Spider-Man , Iron Man , Black Panther , and the Avengers .
The quote comes from the European release of the game , featuring poor English translations of the original Japanese version .	The meme developed from this in the early 2000s , as the result of a GIF animation depicting the opening text , which was initially popularized on the Something Awful message forums .
As detailed below , the real temperature of a surface can in some cases be calculated by dividing the brightness temperature by the emissivity of the surface .	Since the emissivity is a value between 0 and 1 , the real temperature will be greater than or equal to the brightness temperature .
The outcome of the comparison can result in no significant error being noted on the device under test , a significant error being noted but no adjustment made , or an adjustment made to correct the error to an acceptable level .	Strictly speaking , the term calibration means just the act of comparison , and does not include any subsequent adjustment .
It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere , as well as long-term processes of carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks .	The carbon cycle was discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier , and popularized by Humphry Davy .
Because the queen is the strongest piece , a pawn is promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases .	In the game `` shatranj '' , the ancestor of chess that included only male figures , the closest thing to the queen was the `` vizier '' , a weak piece only able to move or capture one step diagonally and not at all in any other direction .
Cirrus ( cloud classification symbol : Ci ) is a genus of atmospheric cloud generally characterized by thin , wispy strands , giving the type its name from the Latin word `` cirrus '' , meaning a ringlet or curling lock of hair .	This cloud can form at any altitude between and above sea level .
Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes , variations in solar radiation received by Earth , plate tectonics , and volcanic eruptions .	Certain human activities have been identified as primary causes of ongoing climate change , often referred to as global warming .
Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the important drivers of climate , including atmosphere , oceans , land surface and ice .	They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the climate system to projections of future climate .
Cloud albedo is a measure of the albedo of a cloud .	Higher values indicate that a cloud reflects a larger amount of solar radiation and transmits a smaller amount of radiation .
They are seen in the Earth 's homosphere ( which includes the troposphere , stratosphere , and mesosphere ) .	Nephology is the science of clouds , which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology .
Seen from below , clouds emit infrared radiation back to the surface , and so exert a warming effect ; seen from above , clouds reflect sunlight and emit infrared radiation to space , and so exert a cooling effect .	Cloud representations vary among global climate models , and small changes in cloud cover have a large impact on the climate .
The following equation calculates this change in the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere	The net cloud radiative effect can be decomposed into its longwave and shortwave components .
A coccolithophore ( or coccolithophorid , from the adjective ) is a unicellular , eukaryotic phytoplankton ( alga ) .	They belong either to the kingdom Protista , according to Robert Whittaker 's Five kingdom classification , or clade Hacrobia , according to the newer biological classification system .
When the transition happens from the gaseous phase into the solid phase directly , the change is called deposition .	Condensation is initiated by the formation of atomic/molecular clusters of that species within its gaseous volume—like rain drop or snow flake formation within clouds—or at the contact between such gaseous phase and a liquid or solid surface .
Contrails ( ; short for `` condensation trails '' ) are line-shaped clouds produced by aircraft engine exhaust or changes in air pressure , typically at aircraft cruise altitudes several miles above the Earth 's surface .	Contrails are composed primarily of water , in the form of ice crystals .
Convection includes sub-mechanisms of advection ( directional bulk-flow transfer of heat ) , and diffusion ( non-directional transfer of energy or mass particles along a concentration gradient ) .	Convection can not take place in most solids because neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion of matter can take place .
Thus , there is a wide overlap with the hydrosphere .	The cryosphere is an integral part of the global climate system with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes , clouds , precipitation , hydrology , atmospheric and oceanic circulation .
These clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather , such as tornadoes .	Cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell .
Their name derives from the Latin `` cumulo- '' , meaning `` heap '' or `` pile '' .	Cumulus clouds are low-level clouds , generally less than 2,000 m ( 6,600 ft ) in altitude unless they are the more vertical cumulus congestus form .
The names Haptophyceae or Prymnesiophyceae are sometimes used instead .	This ending implies classification at the class rank rather than as a division .
The preamble refers to the `` inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security '' .	Operative Paragraph One `` Affirms that the fulfillment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles :
The series premiered on March 10 , 1997 , on The WB and concluded on May 20 , 2003 , on UPN .	The series narrative follows Buffy Summers ( played by Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , the latest in a line of young women known as `` Vampire Slayers '' , or simply `` Slayers '' .
It enjoyed a degree of success in arcades and was subsequently ported to the Mega Drive by Toaplan on May 31 , 1991 , in Japan , and by Sega during the following year in Europe , followed by a Japan-only release by Naxat Soft on September 18 , 1992 , for the PC Engine 's CD-ROM² .	The European version of the Mega Drive port was the source for `` All your base are belong to us '' , an Internet meme which plays off the poorly translated English in the game 's introduction .
The carrying capacity of a biological species in an environment is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely , given the food , habitat , water , and other necessities available in the environment .	In population biology , carrying capacity is defined as the environment 's maximal load , which is different from the concept of population equilibrium .
It covers the northwestern part of geographical Macedonia , whose modern borders came to be defined by the mid-19th century .	It usually refers to the part of the region of Macedonia attributed to the Kingdom of Serbia by the Treaty of Bucharest ( 1913 ) .
In 1954 they had produced the world 's first hydropneumatic self-levelling suspension system then , in 1955 , the revolutionary DS , the first mass production car with modern disc brakes < ref name= '' vintagecars.about.com/internet archive '' > < /ref > and , in 1967 , they introduced in several of their models swiveling headlights that allowed for greater visibility on winding roads ; these automobiles have received various international and national level awards , including three European Car of the Year .	With a successful history in motorsport , it is the only automobile manufacturer to have won three different official championships from the International Automobile Federation : the World Rally Raid Championship five times , the World Rally Championship eight times and the World Touring Car Championship .
The term `` Antarctic '' , referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle , was coined by Marinus of Tyre in the 2nd century AD .	The rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that `` Terra Australis Incognita '' ( `` Unknown Southern Land '' ) , if it existed , was a continent in its own right .
This history can not be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created , discussed , wrote about , and in other ways were concerned with ideas .	Intellectual history as practiced by historians is parallel to the history of philosophy as done by philosophers , and is more akin to the history of ideas .
Ancient history as a term refers to the aggregate of past events from the beginning of writing and recorded human history and extending as far as the post-classical history .	The phrase may be used either to refer to the period of time or the academic discipline .
Every inhabited continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history .	In the 19th and 20th century , it was generally Southeast and South Asia , as well as Eastern and Central Europe that suffered the most deaths from famine .
The plot was discovered by Elizabeth 's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and used to entrap Mary for the purpose of removing her as a claimant to the English throne .	The chief conspirators were Anthony Babington and John Ballard .
Dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields , such as mathematics , physics , chemistry , engineering , and economics .	Examples of quantities to which dimensions are regularly assigned are length , time , and speed , which are measured in dimensional units , such as metre , second and metre per second .
As a result , it was banned for many years in Forman 's home country .	After Forman left Czechoslovakia for the United States , two of his films , `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest '' ( 1975 ) and `` Amadeus '' ( 1984 ) , acquired particular renown , and both gained him an Academy Award for Best Director .

The island is a popular tourist destination because of its moderate climate and coastline .	Historically , most of Barbuda 's 1,638 residents have lived in the town of Codrington .
The term `` coconut '' ( or the archaic `` cocoanut '' ) can refer to the whole coconut palm , the seed , or the fruit , which botanically is a drupe , not a nut .	The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word `` coco '' meaning `` head '' or `` skull '' after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features .
They are commonly but inaccurately referred to as dioxins for simplicity , because every PCDD molecule contains a dibenzo-1,4-dioxin skeletal structure , with 1,4-dioxin as the central ring .	Members of the PCDD family bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife because of their lipophilic properties , and may cause developmental disturbances and cancer .

It is a well-known rock formation in the park , named for its distinct shape .	One side is a sheer face while the other three sides are smooth and round , making it appear like a dome cut in half .
Equivalently ( by definition ) , the theorem states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed .	The theorem is also stated as follows : every non-zero , single-variable , degree `` n '' polynomial with complex coefficients has , counted with multiplicity , exactly `` n '' complex roots .
He also wrote plays , travel books , memoirs and philosophical essays such as `` The Saviors of God : Spiritual Exercises '' .	His fame spread in the English-speaking world due to cinematic adaptations of `` Zorba the Greek '' ( 1964 ) and `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' ( 1988 ) .
It is also a name sometimes given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water ( carbonated water ) , because such solutions contain small amounts of HCO .	In physiology , carbonic acid is described as `` volatile acid '' or `` respiratory acid '' , because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs .
In mathematics , an integer sequence is a sequence ( i.e. , an ordered list ) of integers .	An integer sequence may be specified `` explicitly '' by giving a formula for its `` n '' th term , or `` implicitly '' by giving a relationship between its terms .
In particular , -adic numbers are considered to be close when their difference is divisible by a high power of : the higher the power , the closer they are .	This property enables -adic numbers to encode congruence information in a way that turns out to have powerful applications in number theory – including , for example , in the famous proof of Fermat 's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles .
Somaliland ( ; ' , ' ) , officially the Republic of Somaliland ( , `` Jumhūrīyat Ṣūmālīlānd '' ) , is a self-declared state , internationally considered to be an autonomous region of Somalia .	The government of the de facto state of Somaliland regards itself as the successor state to the former British Somaliland protectorate , which , in the form of the briefly independent State of Somaliland , united as scheduled on 1 July 1960 with the Trust Territory of Somaliland ( the former Italian Somaliland ) to form the Somali Republic .
The diagonal argument was not Cantor 's first proof of the uncountability of the real numbers , which appeared in 1874 .	However , it demonstrates a powerful and general technique that has since been used in a wide range of proofs , including the first of Gödel 's incompleteness theorems and Turing 's answer to the `` Entscheidungsproblem '' .
British Somaliland , officially the British Somaliland Protectorate ( ) , was a British protectorate in present-day Somaliland .	For much of its existence , the territory was bordered by Italian Somalia , French Somali Coast and Ethiopia .
The hyperreals , or nonstandard reals , *R , are an extension of the real numbers R that contains numbers greater than anything of the form	Such numbers are infinite , and their reciprocals are infinitesimals .
In mathematics , the surreal number system is a totally ordered proper class containing the real numbers as well as infinite and infinitesimal numbers , respectively larger or smaller in absolute value than any positive real number .	The surreals share many properties with the reals , including the usual arithmetic operations ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division ) ; as such , they form an ordered field .
It is possible to apply the Cayley-Dickson construction to the sedenions infinitely on , but the algebras created have the same properties as sedenions and are of little interest .	The term `` sedenion '' is also used for other 16-dimensional algebraic structures , such as a tensor product of two copies of the biquaternions , or the algebra of 4 by 4 matrices over the reals , or that studied by .
They are noncommutative and nonassociative , but satisfy a weaker form of associativity ; namely , they are alternative .	Octonions are not as well known as the quaternions and complex numbers , which are much more widely studied and used .
The concept of a hypercomplex number covered them all , and called for a discipline to explain and classify them .	The cataloguing project began in 1872 when Benjamin Peirce first published his `` Linear Associative Algebra '' , and was carried forward by his son Charles Sanders Peirce .
In mathematics , the quaternions are a number system that extends the complex numbers .	They were first described by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1843 and applied to mechanics in three-dimensional space .
This is a partial case of divisibility in rings .	An element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a zero divisor .
An earlier formulation of Zorn 's lemma is Hausdorff 's maximum principle which states that every totally ordered subset of a given partially ordered set is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset of that partially ordered set .	Zorn 's lemma can be stated as :
There are , however , other functions that have been given that name .	One is defined in terms of the circle map .
Mohammed Daoud Khan or Daud Khan ( July 18 , 1909 – April 28 , 1978 ) was the 5th Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1953 to 1963 and later the President of Afghanistan .	Born into the royal family , he overthrew the Musahiban monarchy of his first cousin Mohammed Zahir Shah and declared himself as the first President of his republic in 1973 before his assassination in 1978 as a result of the Saur Revolution led by the communist People 's Democratic Party of Afghanistan ( PDPA ) .
Aside from the core language , most of the primitive functions are for geometry , accessing AutoCAD 's internal DWG database , or manipulation of graphical entities in AutoCAD .	The properties of these graphical entities are revealed to AutoLISP as association lists in which values are paired with AutoCAD `` group codes '' that indicate properties such as definitional points , radii , colors , layers , linetypes , etc .
The South Platte River is one of the two principal tributaries of the Platte River .	Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska , it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West .
A machine ( or mechanical device ) is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action .	Machines can be driven by animals and people , by natural forces such as wind and water , and by chemical , thermal , or electrical power , and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement .
The Canadian portion of the Plains is known as the Prairies .	It covers much of Alberta and southern Saskatchewan , and a narrow band of southern Manitoba .
His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed at the Comédie-Française more often than those of any other playwright today .	His influence is such that the French language itself is often referred to as the `` language of Molière '' .
The network of these tubular branching hyphae , called a mycelium , is considered a single organism .	The hyphae are generally transparent , so the mycelium appears like very fine , fluffy white threads over the surface .
Mycelium is the vegetative part of a fungus or fungus-like bacterial colony , consisting of a mass of branching , thread-like hyphae .	The mass of hyphae is sometimes called shiro , especially within the fairy ring fungi .
In biology , a spore is a unit of sexual or asexual reproduction that may be adapted for dispersal and for survival , often for extended periods of time , in unfavourable conditions .	Spores form part of the life cycles of many plants , algae , fungi and protozoa .
A seat belt ( also known as a seatbelt or safety belt ) is a vehicle safety device designed to secure the occupant of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result during a collision or a sudden stop .	A seat belt functions to reduce the likelihood of death or serious injury in a traffic collision by reducing the force of secondary impacts with interior strike hazards , by keeping occupants positioned correctly for maximum effectiveness of the airbag ( if equipped ) and by preventing occupants being ejected from the vehicle in a crash or if the vehicle rolls over .
There he met his wife , Martha Singer .	From Vienna , Singer and his wife went to Barcelona , Spain , where Singer was appointed Assistant Professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona .
In most fungi , hyphae are the main mode of vegetative growth , and are collectively called a mycelium .	A hypha consists of one or more cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall .
A jurist ( from medieval Latin ) is someone who researches and studies jurisprudence ( theory of law ) .	Such a person can work as an academic , legal writer or law lecturer .
Mutualism can be contrasted with interspecific competition , in which each species experiences `` reduced '' fitness , and exploitation , or parasitism , in which one species benefits at the `` expense '' of the other .	Symbiosis involves two species living in close proximity and may be mutualistic , parasitic , or commensal , so symbiotic relationships are not always mutualistic .

Depending on how the string is plucked , the vibrations can be in a vertical direction , horizontal direction , or at any angle perpendicular to the string .	In contrast , in longitudinal waves , such as sound waves in a liquid or gas , the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation , so these waves do not exhibit polarization .
Such fiber is used in special applications where preserving polarization is essential .	In an ordinary ( non-polarization-maintaining ) fiber , two polarization modes ( say vertical and horizontal polarization ) have the same nominal phase velocity due to the fiber 's circular symmetry .
Apparent power is the average product of current and voltage .	Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source , or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source , the apparent power may be greater than the real power .

The near-field pattern is most commonly defined over a plane placed in front of the source , or over a cylindrical or spherical surface enclosing it .	The far-field pattern of an antenna may be determined experimentally at an antenna range , or alternatively , the near-field pattern may be found using a near-field scanner , and the radiation pattern deduced from it by computation .
A single transmitter can be used to give a line of position ( LOP ) of the craft .	The ( true ) bearing to the station from the craft , TB or QUJ , is composed of the true heading , TH , plus the relative bearing , RB , of the station .
Radiometry is a set of techniques for measuring electromagnetic radiation , including visible light .	Radiometric techniques in optics characterize the distribution of the radiation 's power in space , as opposed to photometric techniques , which characterize the light 's interaction with the human eye .
For a receiver , the attack-time delay is defined as the time interval from the instant a step radio-frequency ( RF ) signal , at a level equal to the receiver 's threshold of sensitivity , is applied to the receiver input , to the instant when the receiver 's output amplitude reaches 90 % of its steady-state value .

Customers may have a remote-forwarding telephone number in a central switching office without having any other local telephone service in that office .
Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction .	Some types of repeaters broadcast an identical signal , but alter its method of transmission , for example , on another frequency or baud rate .
Frequencies at which the response amplitude is a relative maximum are known as resonant frequencies or resonance frequencies of the system .	Near resonant frequencies , small periodic forces have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations , due to the storage of vibrational energy .
That service can be anything from a memory fetch , to a disk IO , to a complex database query , or loading a full web page .	Ignoring transmission time for a moment , the response time is the sum of the service time and wait time .
For a system that responds linearly to its input , there is a unique responsivity .	For nonlinear systems , the responsivity is the local slope .
It is usually expressed as a ratio in decibels ( dB ) ;	Return loss is related to both standing wave ratio ( SWR ) and reflection coefficient ( Γ ) .
It may be used with or without a telephone switchboard .	The term originated in magneto telephone signaling in which cranking the magneto generator , either integrated into the telephone set or housed in a connected ringer box , would not only `` ring '' its bell but also cause a drop to fall `` down '' at the telephone exchange switchboard , marked with the number of the line to which the magneto telephone instrument was connected .
A ringer equivalency number of 1 represents the loading effect of a single traditional telephone ringing circuit , such as that within the Western Electric model 500 telephone .	The REN of modern telephone equipment may be significantly lower than 1 .
In the context of computer networks , the signal is generally a data packet , and the RTT is also known as the ping time .	An internet user can determine the RTT by using the ping command .

However , rubidium fountains are currently being developed that are even more stable than caesium fountain clocks .	All commercial rubidium frequency standards operate by disciplining a crystal oscillator to the rubidium hyperfine transition of .
RRTS does not enable mobile communications .	In the United States , the Federal Communications Commission issues initial Rural Radiotelephone Service licenses on a site-by-site basis .
A schematic usually omits all details that are not relevant to the information the schematic is intended to convey , and may add unrealistic elements that aid comprehension .	For example , a subway map intended for passengers may represent a subway station with a dot ; the dot does not resemble the actual station at all but gives the viewer information without unnecessary visual clutter .
Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult .	Examples of the latter might include removing or changing vertical or horizontal sync pulses in television signals ; televisions will not be able to display a picture from such a signal .
In telecommunications , a secondary frequency standard is a frequency standard that does not have inherent accuracy , and therefore must be calibrated against a primary frequency standard .	Secondary standards include crystal oscillators and rubidium standards .
Beneficiaries ( technically referents ) of security may be persons and social groups , objects and institutions , ecosystems , and any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change by its environment .	Security mostly refers to protection from hostile forces , but it has a wide range of other senses : for example , as the absence of harm ( e.g .
A key component to loss prevention is assessing the potential threats to the successful achievement of the goal .	This must include the potential opportunities that further the object ( why take the risk unless there 's an upside ? )
Every self-synchronizing code is a prefix code , but not all prefix codes are self-synchronizing .	Other terms for self-synchronizing code are synchronized code or , ambiguously , comma-free code .
Shields vary greatly in size , ranging from large panels that protect the user 's whole body to small models ( such as the buckler ) that were intended for hand-to-hand-combat use .	Shields also vary a great deal in thickness ; whereas some shields were made of relatively deep , absorbent , wooden planking to protect soldiers from the impact of spears and crossbow bolts , others were thinner and lighter and designed mainly for deflecting blade strikes .
These are often configured as 'serial-in , parallel-out ' ( SIPO ) or as 'parallel-in , serial-out ' ( PISO ) .	There are also types that have both serial and parallel input and types with serial and parallel output .
Shot noise or Poisson noise is a type of electronic noise which can be modeled by a Poisson process .	In electronics shot noise originates from the discrete nature of electric charge .
In radio communications , a sideband is a band of frequencies higher than or lower than the carrier frequency , containing power as a result of the modulation process .	The sidebands carry the information ( modulation ) transmitted by the signal .
Signaling systems may be classified based on several principal characteristics .	In the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) , in-band signaling is the exchange of call control information within the same physical channel , or within the same frequency band , that the telephone call itself is using .
A ratio higher than 1:1 ( greater than 0 dB ) indicates more signal than noise .	While SNR is commonly quoted for electrical signals , it can be applied to any form of signal , for example isotope levels in an ice core , biochemical signaling between cells , or financial trading signals .
Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems , routers , switches , servers , workstations , printers , and more .	SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring .
SX signaling may be one-way , for intra-central-office use , or the simplex legs may be connected to form full duplex signaling circuits that function like composite ( CX ) signaling circuits with E & M lead control .

how the wave is distributed in space .	Waves can have the same mode but have different frequencies .
A skip zone is an annular region between the farthest points at which the ground wave can be received and the nearest point at which the refracted sky waves can be received .	Within this region , no signal can be received because , due to the conditions of the local ionosphere , the relevant sky waves are not reflected but penetrate the ionosphere .
Many modern clocks are synchronized , either through the Internet or by radio time signals , to a worldwide time standard called Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) based on a network of master atomic clocks in many countries .	For scientific purposes , precision clocks can be synchronized to within a few nanoseconds by dedicated satellite channels .
It is commonly expressed in `` Jones '' units ( formula_4 ) in honor of Robert Clark Jones who originally defined it .	Given that noise-equivalent power can be expressed as a function of the responsivity formula_5 ( in units of formula_6 or formula_7 ) and the noise spectral density formula_8 ( in units of formula_9 or formula_10 ) as formula_11 , it 's common to see the specific detectivity expressed as formula_12 .
This phenomenon has been investigated by scientists since the time of Newton , but speckles have come into prominence since the invention of the laser and have now found a variety of applications .	The term speckle pattern is also commonly used in the experimental mechanics community to describe the pattern of physical speckles on a surface which is useful for measuring displacement fields via digital image correlation .
The FWHM method may be difficult to apply when the spectrum has a complex shape .	Another method of specifying spectral width is a special case of root-mean-square deviation where the independent variable is wavelength , λ , and `` f '' ( λ ) is a suitable radiometric quantity .

In telecommunications , squelch is a circuit function that acts to suppress the audio ( or video ) output of a receiver in the absence of a sufficiently strong desired input signal .	Squelch is widely used in two-way radios and radio scanners to suppress the sound of channel noise when the radio is not receiving a transmission .
The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes , and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes .	Standing waves were first noticed by Michael Faraday in 1831 .
For example , the VSWR value 1.2:1 denotes an AC voltage due to standing waves along the transmission line reaching a peak value 1.2 times that of the minimum AC voltage along that line .	The SWR can as well be defined as the ratio of the maximum amplitude to minimum amplitude of the transmission line 's currents , electric field strength , or the magnetic field strength .
A star coupler is a device that takes in an input signal and splits it into several output signals .	In fiber optics , and especially in telecommunications , a star coupler is a passive optical device , used in network applications .

The stopband of a low-pass filter is the frequencies from the stopband corner frequency ( which is slightly higher than the passband 3 dB cut-off frequency ) up to the infinite frequency .	The stopband of a high-pass filter consists of the frequencies from 0 hertz to a stopband corner frequency ( slightly lower than the passband cut-off frequency ) .
It is conservative , in that if it were used to measure the individual losses of several long fibers , and the long fibers were concatenated , the total loss obtained ( excluding splice losses ) would be expected to be lower than the sum of the individual fiber losses .	Some modern optical power meters have the capability to set to zero the reference level measured at the output of the reference fiber , so that the transmission loss of the fiber under test may be read out directly .
Control of the system is returned to the supervisory program frequently enough to ensure that demands on the system are met .	Historically , this term was essentially associated with IBM 's line of mainframe operating systems starting with OS/360 .
Suppressed-carrier transmission is a special case in which the carrier level is reduced below that required for demodulation by a normal receiver .	Reduction of the carrier level permits higher power levels in the sidebands than would be possible with conventional AM transmission .
In physics , a surface wave is a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media .	A common example is gravity waves along the surface of liquids , such as ocean waves .
Following disruptive forces such as flood , fire , disease , war , or climate change some species of flora , fauna , and local life forms are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding biophysical conditions .	In engineering , survivability is the quantified ability of a system , subsystem , equipment , process , or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man-made disturbance ; for example a nuclear electromagnetic pulse from the detonation of a nuclear weapon .
