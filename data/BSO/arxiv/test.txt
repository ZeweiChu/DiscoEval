After a certain storage time we coherently convert the spin waves into the light in deterministic anti-Stokes scattering .	The whole process can be regarded as a delayed four-wave mixing which produces pairs of correlated , delayed random images .
Given an absence of recent star-formation , accreting binaries are the only candidates for the M84 X-ray sources .	The majority of M84 sources ( with luminosities exceeding 10^38 ergs/s ) exhibit hardness ratios expected from multi-temperature black-body disk emission .
The use of retro-reflection in light-pulse atom interferometry under microgravity conditions naturally leads to a double-diffraction scheme .	The two pairs of counterpropagating beams induce simultaneously transitions with opposite momentum transfer that , when acting on atoms initially at rest , give rise to symmetric interferometer configurations where the total momentum transfer is automatically doubled and where a number of noise sources and systematic effects cancel out .
Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems .	Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic , non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations .
Using three magnified Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) detected behind CLASH clusters , we perform a first pilot study to see whether standardizable candles can be used to calibrate cluster mass maps created from strong lensing observations .	Such calibrations will be crucial when next generation HST cluster surveys ( e.g.FRONTIER ) provide magnification maps that will , in turn , form the basis for the exploration of the high redshift Universe .
Chandra observations of nearby galaxies have revealed a number of X-ray sources characterized by high luminosities ( $ L_X & gt ; \sim10^ { 36 } $ erg s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) and $ k T $ in the range $ 100 - 350 $ eV .	These `` quasisoft X-ray sources '' ( QSSs ) are harder than luminous supersoft X-ray sources ( SSSs ) , whose characteristic temperatures are tens of eV , but , with little or no emission above 2 keV , they are significantly softer than most canonical X-ray sources .
SPEED2 consists on 40 +/- Marx modules connected in parallel ( 4.1 mF equivalent Marx generator capacity , 300 kV , 4 MA in short circuit , 187 kJ , 400 ns rise time , dI/dt~1013 A/s ) .	Currently the SPEED2 is operating at the Comision Chilena de Energia Nuclear , CCHEN , Chile , being the most powerful and energetic device for dense transient plasma in the Southern Hemisphere .
However it falls short of the high-luminosity population .	We combine this with models for major merger-induced AGN fueling , which lead to rarer but more luminous events , and predict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated AGN host galaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift .
Such an approach however begs the question of how in reality a disc could ever be assembled with beta_ { cool } & lt ; beta_ { crit } .	Here we adopt the more realistic approach of gradually reducing beta_ { cool } , as might correspond to changes in thermal regime due to secular changes in the disc density profile .
In this paper , we propose to discriminate similar handwritten Chinese characters by using weakly supervised learning .	Our approach learns a discriminative SVM for each similar pair which simultaneously localizes the discriminative region of similar character and makes the classification .
We begin by constructing the Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Yvon-Kirkwood ( BBGYK ) integral equations relating different orders of dislocation correlation functions in a grand canonical ensemble .	Approximate pair correlation functions are obtained for single-slip systems with two types of dislocations and , subsequently , for general multiple-slip systems of both charges .
A common workaround for this problem is to instead optimize a emph { surrogate loss } function , such as for instance cross-entropy or hinge loss .	In order for this remedy to be effective , it is important to ensure that minimization of the surrogate loss results in minimization of the task loss , a condition that we call emph { consistency with the task loss } .
Specifically , we consider optical character recognition ( OCR ) systems that can be bootstrapped by identifying a subset of correctly translated document words with very high precision .	This `` clean set '' is subsequently used as document-specific training data .
We present stellar parameters , stellar ages , and detailed elemental abundances for Na , Mg , Al , Si , Ca , Sc , Ti , Cr , Ni , Zn , Sr , Y , Zr , Ba , La , and Eu for 16 KFR08 stream members based on analysis of high resolution spectra .	Based on the abundance ratios of 14 elements , we use the chemical tagging method to identify the stars which have the same chemical composition , and thus , might have a common birthplace , such as a cluster .
In the gauge theory dyonic region the spectral expansions are divergent , and indeed are not Borel-summable , so they are more properly described by resurgent trans-series in which perturbative and non-perturbative effects are deeply entwined .	In the gauge theory electric region the spectral expansions are convergent , but nevertheless there are non-perturbative effects due to poles in the expansion coefficients , and which we associate with worldline instantons .
Effective gauge theories for the moduli fields are constructed on the four-dimensional world volume of vortices .	A systematic method to obtain the most general form of the effective Lagrangian consistent with symmetry is proposed .
The rapid squirt of a proteinaceous slime jet endows the ancient velvet worms ( Onychophora ) with a unique mechanism for defense from predators and for capturing prey by entangling them in a disordered web that immobilizes their target .	However , to date neither qualitative nor quantitative descriptions have been provided for this unique adaptation .
This implies non-trivial identities for non-planar diagrams as well as interesting relations between the N = 4 and N = 8 theories .	We show that the on-shell diagrams of N = 8 supergravity obey equivalence relations analogous to those of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills , and we develop a systematic algorithm for reading off Grassmannian integral formulae directly from the on-shell diagrams .
This allows us to introduce a quantity , the fractional occupation , which gives insightful information on the crossover from a Lifshits to a Bose glass .	Finally , we compare temperature and interaction effects , highlighting similarities and intrinsic differences .
The definition of the classical transition state theory ( TST ) as a t= 0+ limit of the flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that simultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical process .	However , the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum mechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime impossible .
Cloud computing is a newly emerging distributed system which is evolved from Grid computing .	Task scheduling is the core research of cloud computing which studies how to allocate the tasks among the physical nodes , so that the tasks can get a balanced allocation or each task 's execution cost decreases to the minimum , or the overall system performance is optimal .
To understand the reason , a rewriting of the functional form of the +U corrections is presented that leads to a more physical and transparent understanding of the effect of these correction terms .	The approach highlights the importance of Hund 's coupling ( intra-orbital exchange ) in providing anisotropy across the occupation and energy eigenvalues of the Mn d states .
In addition a 'Comment ' has been put to the Internet February 7 , 2002 , [ Comm-Evid02 ] ( { \it version 1 } ) critisizing our publication [ KK-Evid01 ] .	( Meanwhile six of the nine claims in the 'Comment ' have been withdrawn [ Comm-Evid02 ] ( { \it version 3 } ) . )
The predicted primordial 7Li abundance is four times that measured in the atmospheres of Galactic halo stars .	This discrepancy could be caused by modification of surface lithium abundances during the stars ' lifetimes or by physics beyond the Standard Model that affects early nucleosynthesis .
We use theory and simulations to investigate the existence of amorphous glassy states in ultrasoft colloids .	We combine the hyper-netted chain approximation with mode-coupling theory to study the dynamic phase diagram of soft repulsive spheres interacting with a Hertzian potential , focusing on low temperatures and large densities .
Using models that include long-range variations in the contact potential across the plate surfaces , a number of experimental observations can be reproduced and explained .	For these models , numerical calculations show that if a voltage is applied between the plates which minimizes the force , a residual electrostatic force persists , and that the minimizing potential varies with distance .
This paper studies the \emph { $ \varepsilon $ -approximate range emptiness } problem , where the task is to represent a set $ S $ of $ n $ points from $ \ { 0 , \ldots , U-1\ } $ and answer emptiness queries of the form `` $ [ a ; b ] \cap S \neq \emptyset $ ? ''	with a probability of \emph { false positives } allowed .
The system was observed 24 times during the GPS thus covering many orbital phases including the pre-periastron flare .	The source is clearly detected in all Integral instruments in most pointings .
Here we present a new method that was carefully geared to allow loading under stress control either at $ T=0 $ or at any other temperature , using Monte-Carlo techniques .	The method is applied to a model perfect crystalline solid , to a crystalline solid contaminated with topological defects , and to a generic glass .
This object is a compact , bipolar nebula that is currently undergoing the transition from asymptotic giant branch star to planetary nebula .	Our images confirm the presence of at least three highly collimated outflows emanating from the central regions of GL 618 .
Here , we use far-ultraviolet emission spectra from HD209458 in the wavelength range ( 1180-1710 ) A to bring new insight to the composition and energetic processes in play in the gas nebula around the transiting planetary companion .	In that frame , we consider up-to-date atmospheric models of the giant exoplanet where we implement non-thermal line broadening to simulate the impact on the transit absorption of superthermal atoms ( HI , OI , and CII ) populating the upper layers of the nebula .
We show how to compute the solution for a dessin that is a tree .	This amounts to finding a Fuchsian differential equation satisfied by the local inverses of a Shabat polynomial .
The spectra obtained using two level atoms give identical results with the mode spectrum .	One benefit of the method is that only one time averages are needed .
Therefore , there is an urgent need for developing solid methods for accurately measuring moods from large-scale social media data .	In this paper , we propose PANAS-t , which measures sentiments from short text updates in Twitter based on a well-established psychometric scale , PANAS ( Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ) .
Here , $ E_\rho $ is the vector bundle of rank $ \dim V $ associated to $ E $ via $ \rho $ .	If we take , for example , the standard representation of $ \GL ( r ) $ on $ \C^r $ we have to classify triples $ ( E , L , \phi ) $ consisting of $ E $ as before and a non-zero homomorphism $ \phi\colon E\lra L $ which includes the so-called Bradlow pairs .
Renormalons demonstrate also presence of nonperturbative contributions .	We proceed then to multirenormalon chains and argue that they are in fact not suppressed compared to a single chain .
The former were described in our previous papers in detail , and here we present the latter .	The Grotch equation was originally developed for pure Coulomb systems and allowed to express the relativistic recoil correction in order $ ( Z\alpha ) ^4m^2/M $ in terms of the relativistic non-recoil contribution $ ( Z\alpha ) ^4m $ .
The PLUME project tackles the issue of assembling double-sided ladders .	The SERWIETE project deals with a more innovative concept and consists in making single-sided unsupported ladders embedded in an extra thin plastic enveloppe .
A cold reservoir of Fermions plays a dual role as a source of atoms to be loaded into the lattice via a Raman process and as a heat bath for sympathetic cooling of lattice atoms .	Atoms are initially transferred into an excited motional state in each lattice site , and then decay to the motional ground state , creating particle-hole pairs in the reservoir .
Subjects like the layout of the magnetic circuit , the excitation coils , and the cooling circuits will be discussed .	A short introduction to materials for the yoke and coil construction and a brief summary about cost estimates for magnets will complete this topic .
A Fast Fourier analysis has been performed in the spatial domain , all along the slit length used , for all the spectra and for the total duration of the observations .	We have detected a significant periodic spatial variations with Fourier transform power peaks around 9-10 arcsec and at 4 arcsec .
We observed the DoAr 24E system with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph ( IRS ) , with high-resolution , near-infrared spectroscopy of CO vibrational transitions , and with mid-infrared imaging .	The source of high extinction toward infrared companions has been an item of continuing interest .
Bouncing models have been proposed by many authors as a completion , or even as an alternative to inflation for the description of the very early and dense Universe .	However , most bouncing models contain a contracting phase from a very large and rarefied state , where dark energy might have had an important role as it has today in accelerating our large Universe .
In a limiting case of large Nc , when QCD amplitudes contain only pole singularities , the strong coupling constant alpha_s ( Q ) is shown to be also meromorfic function of external momenta .	Some simple models and examples are given when nonperturbative beta function and alpha_s ( Q ) can be written explicitly .
The muonium measurement requires a novel monoenergetic , low-velocity , horizontal muonium beam directed at an atom interferometer .	The precision three-grating interferometer can be produced in silicon nitride or ultrananocrystalline diamond using state-of-the-art nanofabrication .
We consider the case where a quasar is observed in an intergalactic medium ( IGM ) whose ionisation structure evolves slowly relative to the light crossing time of the HII region , as well as the case where the evolution is rapid .	The latter case is expected towards the end of the reionisation era where the highest redshift luminous quasars will be observed .
Consequently perturbative and non-perturbative issues of the theory can be studied .	For the correspondence based on free CFT 's we discuss the nature of bulk 1/N interactions through an S-matrix which is argued to be equal to 1 ( Coleman-Mandula theorem ) .
A later , longer observation found the source in a high-intensity state and covered the uneclipsed through mid-eclipse phases .	In the high-intensity state , the non-eclipse spectrum has an absorbed continuum component due to scattering by material near the pulsar and 80 per cent of the fluorescent iron emission comes from less than 19 lt-sec away from the pulsar .
In this paper we give general combinatorial arguments showing that if a sorting network with a given depth exists then there exists one with a special form .	We then construct propositional formulas whose satisfiability is necessary for the existence of such a network .
To perform the analysis of quantum processes , we directly derive diagrams of states from physical implementations of quantum circuits associated to the processes .	Complete diagrams are then rearranged into simplified diagrams , to visualize the overall effects of computations .
A qualitative model describing the `` anomalous '' features of the conductivity of polymer nanocomposites , in particular , switching to the conducting state in relatively thick ( tens of microns or more ) of flexible PVC films is considered .	In previously published experimental results , change of conductivity by 10 or more orders of magnitude occurred both in the absence of external influences ( spontaneously ) , and under the influence of an applied electric field , as well as other initiating factors ( such as uniaxial pressure ) .
We show that the tunneling effect exists in a wide class of spacetimes admitting weakly isolated horizons .	The general thermodynamic nature of WIH is then confirmed .
The apparent horizon of a primordial black hole formed through hydrodynamical processes is also considerably smaller than the cosmological apparent horizon for $ 0 & lt ; k\le 1 $ .	We derive an expression for the maximum size which an overdense region can have without being a separate closed universe rather than part of our own .
We study the complexity of functions computable by deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations in terms of the symmetries and the number of linear regions that they have .	Deep networks are able to sequentially map portions of each layer 's input-space to the same output .
The bisection width of interconnection networks has always been important in parallel computing , since it bounds the amount of information that can be moved from one side of a network to another , i.e. , the bisection bandwidth .	Finding its exact value has proven to be challenging for some network families .
In particular , we show that it is possible to amplify a slow propagating pulse without population inversion .	We also analyze the regime of anomalous light propagation showing that it is possible to observe superluminal energy propagation .
If it is assumed that both the optical and X-ray afterglows arise from the same outflow then , in the framework of the standard forward shock model , the chromaticity of the X-ray light-curve breaks indicates that they do not arise solely from a mechanism related to the outflow dynamics ( e.g.energy injection ) or the angular distribution of the blast-wave kinetic energy ( structured outflows or jets ) .	The lack of a spectral evolution accompanying the X-ray light-curve breaks shows that these breaks do not arise from the passage of a spectral break ( e.g.the cooling frequency ) either .
We also pay particular attention to the gluon distribution in the photon , $ g^ { \gamma } ( x , Q^2 ) $ , which has been poorly constrained in earlier analyses which only include structure function data .	We use large $ p_T $ jet production in $ \gamma \gamma $ collisions from TRISTAN to constrain $ g^\gamma $ .
We introduce a generalized scaling law , M_tot = 10^K A^a B^b , to look for the minimum scatter in reconstructing the total mass of hydrodynamically simulated X-ray galaxy clusters , given gas mass M_gas , luminosity L and temperature T. We find a locus in the plane of the logarithmic slopes $ a $ and $ b $ of the scaling relations where the scatter in mass is minimized .	This locus corresponds to b_M = -3/2 a_M +3/2 and b_L = -2 a_L +3/2 for A=M_gas and L , respectively , and B=T .
Without loss of generality we may assume that $ d_1 \le ... \le d_n $ .	A separable ( Hartree ) $ n $ -partite state $ | \phi & gt ; $ can be described by $ | \phi & gt ; = \otimes_ { k=1 } ^n | \phi^ { ( k ) } & gt ; $ with $ | \phi^ { ( k ) } & gt ; \in \HH_k $ .
We apply the three-flavor ( Polyakov- ) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to generate baryons as quark-diquark bound states using many-body techniques at finite temperature .	All the baryonic states belonging to the octet and decuplet flavor representations are generated in the isospin-symmetric case .
The presence of mass outflows is studied as a function of mass loss rate , wind temperature and binary orbital parameters .	A 2-dimensional hydrodynamical model is used to study the stability of mass transfer in wind accreting symbiotic binary systems .
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the radiation process of the charged particle passing through an external periodic field in a dispersive medium .	In the optical range of spectrum we will consider two cases : first , the source has not eigenfrequency , and second , the source has eigenfrequency .
The gamma-ray emission produced by interactions of cosmic-rays ( CRs ) and interstellar gas in those molecular clouds is useful to study the CR densities and distributions of molecular gas close to the solar system .	The obtained gamma-ray emissivities from 250 MeV to 10 GeV for the three regions are about ( 6 -- 10 ) $ \times $ 10 $ ^ { -27 } $ photons s $ ^ { -1 } $ sr $ ^ { -1 } $ H-atom $ ^ { -1 } $ , indicating a variation of the CR density by $ \sim $ 20 % even if we consider the systematic uncertainties .
We relate local , strong local and global survival with suitable inequalities involving the first-moment matrix M of the process .	In particular we prove that , while the local behavior is characterized by M , the global behavior can not be completely described in terms of properties involving M alone .
It is conjectured that there are exactly 6 exceptional manifolds .	We find hyperbolic 3-manifolds , some from the SnapPea 's census of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds , associated to 5 other families .
Spectroscopic and photometric behaviour of the class of recurrent novae with giant secondaries ( T Coronae Borealis , RS Ophiuchi , V3890 Sagittarii and V745 Scorpii ) at quiescence are presented in this study .	The hot component in these systems is variable , with the variability manifesting as variability in the ultraviolet luminosity , the ultraviolet and optical emission line fluxes and in the UBV/visual magnitudes .
The groups of University of Kanazawa and Pisa have produced by Lattice simulations many results supporting the idea that QCD vacuum is a dual superconductor .	Instantons are related to Chiral symmetry breaking , as explained e.g.in the instanton liquid model of E. V. SHURYAK .
The proposed algorithm works autonomously in real time .	The number of used appliances and the corresponding appliance models are learned in operation and are progressively updated .
The mass of the primary component was found to be 1.204 ( 0.004 ) Msun , while it was obtained as 0.450 ( 0.006 ) Msun for the secondary component .	The radius of the primary component was computed as 1.424 ( 0.001 ) Rsun , while it was computed as 0.904 ( 0.001 ) Rsun for the secondary component .
The reason is the lack of damping boundaries .	This paper compares two analytic techniques to derive the patten dynamics from hydrodynamics , which are usually equivalent but lead to different results when applied to multiple homogeneous soft modes .
In particular we are able to show that in the heavy-baryon limit all electromagnetic contributions vanish .	By calculating the leading correction to the known result , we give a final expression which is accurate to better than 1 % .
On the one hand , as a counter example to NIST SP800-22 test suite , it is easy to construct functions that are considered as GOOD pseudorandom generators by NIST SP800-22 test suite though the output of these functions are easily distinguishable from the uniform distribution .	Thus these functions are not pseudorandom generators by definition .
These flares were sometimes intense , rapid , and late relative to the nominal prompt phase .	The most intense of these flares was observed by XRT with a flux & gt ; 500 the afterglow .
While graphical models for continuous data ( Gaussian graphical models ) and discrete data ( Ising models ) have been extensively studied , there is little work on graphical models linking both continuous and discrete variables ( mixed data ) , which are common in many scientific applications .	We propose a novel graphical model for mixed data , which is simple enough to be suitable for high-dimensional data , yet flexible enough to represent all possible graph structures .
The stress tensor is calculated to derive the equation of state .	Solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation , we show the relationship between the mass and the radius of a dense star .
Flow and transport are studied in transparent model fractures with rough complementary self-affine walls with a relative shear displacement $ \vec { u } $ .	The aperture field is shown to display long range correlations perpendicular to $ \vec { u } $ : for flow in that direction , the width and geometry of the front of a dyed shear-thinning polymer solution displacing a transparent one have been studied as a function of the fluid rheology and flow rate .
One linear combination of these goldstinos is massless and eaten by the gravitino , while the orthogonal combinations acquire a tree level mass and become the physical states named goldstini ( G ' ) .	Compared to the gravitino , such goldstini could couple more strongly to the visible fields and lead to some exotic phenomenology .
Unlike past approaches defined in terms of form factors for atoms or clusters , we develop a functional determinant method that allows us to treat realistic band structures .	This method builds upon earlier theoretical work in mesoscopic physics and accounts for both excitonic effects as well as the orthogonality catastrophe arising from interaction between the core hole and the valence band electrons .
We illustrate the application of our estimates in two diophantine contexts : to counting transcendental lattice points on algebraic subvarieties of semi-abelian varieties , following Hrushovski and Pillay ; and to counting the number of intersections between isogeny classes of elliptic curves and algebraic varieties , following Freitag and Scanlon .	In both cases we obtain bounds which are singly-exponential ( improving the known doubly-exponential bounds ) and which exhibit the natural asymptotic growth with respect to the degrees of the equations involved .
Remarkably similar properties were previously reported for the cluster compounds of Mo4 .	These compounds show an extremely high density of low energy excitations in their electronic properties .
Modern text retrieval systems often provide a similarity search utility , that allows the user to find efficiently a fixed number k of documents in the data set that are most similar to a given query ( here a query is either a simple sequence of keywords or the identifier of a full document found in previous searches that is considered of interest ) .	We consider the case of a textual database made of semi-structured documents .
In millimeterWave wireless networks the rapidly varying wireless channels demand fast and dynamic resource allocation mechanisms .	This challenge is hereby addressed by a distributed approach that optimally solves the fundamental resource allocation problem of joint client association and relaying .
At commensurate filling n a charge gap opens and then magnetization plateaux correspond to fully gapped situations .	However , plateaux also arise in the magnetization curves at fixed n between the commensurate values and then the plateau-value of of m depends continuously on n and can thus also become irrational .
In particular , ( a ) the appearance of negative energy or negative probability density in single particle theory -- corresponding to the fact of existence of antiparticle , ( b ) spin- statistics connection , ( c ) CPT theorem , ( d ) the Feynman propagator are linked together via this symmetry .	Furthermore , we try to derive the main results of special relativity , especially , ( e ) the mass-energy relation , ( f ) the Lorentz transformation by this one `` relativistic '' postulate and some `` nonrelativistic '' knowledge .
The additional terms introduced into the Hamiltonian involve products of spin components related to three adjacent sites .	A Jordan-Wigner transformation leads to a simple bilinear Fermi form for the resulting Hamiltonian and hence the spin model admits a rigorous analysis .
The central flare ribbons were located at the site of an emerging bipole in the center of the active region .	The negative polarity of this bipole fragmented in two main pieces , one rotating around the positive polarity by ~ 110 deg within 32 hours .
A Jaffe & amp ; Perola ( JP ) model fitted to the integrated spectrum of the source gives an asymptotic low-frequency index of $ \alpha_ { inj } =0.53_ { -0.02 } ^ { +0.01 } $ , while JP models fitted to the observed spectral index trend along the lobes allow us to estimate radiative ages of $ \sim29 $ Myr and $ \sim37 $ Myr for the west and east lobes respectively .	Our age estimates are a factor of two lower than the 75-Myr upper limit derived from X-ray data ( O'Sullivan et al.2011 ) .
The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer ( BCS ) formalism is extended by including the single-particle continuum in order to analyse the evolution of pairing in an isotopic chain from stability up to the drip line .	We propose a continuum discretized generalized BCS based on single-particle pseudostates ( PS ) .
We demonstrate that the system can acquire and switch between behaviors learned through interaction based on social feedback from the human partner .	The role of reinforcement based on a short term memory of the interaction is experimentally investigated .
Our main results are as following .	( a ) Bounds from rates are used to constrain parameters , such as coupling constants and masses .
With the common form of the electron Cooper pair , we also show that there is a coexistence of the electron Cooper pair and antiferromagnetic short-range correlation , and hence the antiferromagnetic short-range fluctuation can persist into the superconducting state .	Our results are qualitatively consistent with experiments .
In this work we are concerned with the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian in regions of Rn which are invariant under the natural action of a compact subgroup G of O ( n ) .	We give a partial positive answer ( in the Neumann case ) to a conjecture of V. Arnold [ 1 ] on the transversality of the transformation given by the Dirichlet integral to the stratification in the space of quadratic forms according to the multiplicities of the eigenvalues .
This paper presents a survey and a comparative evaluation of recent techniques for moving cast shadow detection .	We identify shadow removal as a critical step for improving object detection and tracking .
We study the Drazin inverses of the sum and product of two elements in a ring .	For Drazin invertible elements $ a $ and $ b $ such that $ a^2b=aba $ and $ b^2a=bab $ , it is shown that $ ab $ is Drazin invertible and that $ a+b $ is Drazin invertible if and only if $ 1+a^Db $ is Drazin invertible .
In particular , this paper addresses the use of NLP in the requirements analysis and systems design processes .	We have developed a prototype toolset that can assist the systems analyst or software engineer to select and verify terms relevant to a project .
Charge transfer states in organic semiconductors play crucial roles in processes such as singlet fission and exciton dissociation at donor/acceptor interfaces .	Recently , a time-resolved spectroscopy study of dinaphtho [ 2,3-b:2'3'-f ] thieno [ 3,2-b ] -thiophene ( DNTT ) thin films provided evidence for the formation of mixed Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons after the photoexcitation .
Here we review basic symmetry properties of the relativistic quantum theories for free electrons in ( 2+1 ) - and ( 1+1 ) -dimensional spacetime .	Additional flavour degrees of freedom are necessary to properly define symmetry operations in ( 2+1 ) dimensions and are generally present in physical realisations of such systems , e.g. , in single sheets of graphite .
We show that both randomized and deterministic procedures are successful if additional information about the families of functions to be approximated is provided .	In the absence of such additional information one may observe exponential growth of the number of terms needed to approximate the function and/or extreme sensitivity of the outcome of the approximation to parameters .
The I-J color is a good predictor of absolute magnitude for late-M and L dwarfs .	M_J becomes monotonically fainter with I-J color and with spectral type through late-L dwarfs , then brightens for early-T dwarfs .
Many brain diseases are associated with altered topological patterns of brain connectivity .	Therefore , a key inquiry of connectivity analysis is to identify network-level differentially expressed connections that have low false positive rates , sufficient statistical power , and high reproducibility .
A \emph { self-complementary } graph is a graph isomorphic to its complement .	An isomorphism between $ G $ and its complement , viewed as a permutation of $ V ( G ) $ , is then called an \emph { antimorphism } .
It is shown that many of the features observed in these experiments can be reproduced by this generalized model that explicitly includes non-Boussinesq and mean flow effects .	The spontaneous formation of hexagons , rolls , and a rotating spiral pattern is studied , as well as the transitions and competition among them .
The aim of this paper is to illustrate that the same coupling can be exploited to derive an exact representation for second-order parameter sensitivity .	Furthermore with this representation one can construct an unbiased estimator which is easy to implement .
The main drivers of solar variability are thought to be magnetic features at the solar surface .	The climate reponse can be , on a global scale , largely accounted for by simple energetic considerations , but understanding the regional climate effects is more difficult .
Effective Hamilton matrix elements are then evaluated with the above CLHSs ; diagonalization finally yields the desired correlation corrections for the cationic hole states .	We compare and analyze the results of the FLHA with the results of a full MRCI ( SD ) ( multi-reference configuration interaction with single and double excitations ) calculation for two prototype model systems , ( H2 ) n ladders and H- ( Be ) n-H chains .
The electronic states and magnetic properties of hexagonal , triangular and circular GQRs with different sizes and zigzag edge terminations are studied .	The results show that , although the AB oscillations in the all types of nanoring are affected by the interaction , the spin splitting in the AB oscillations strongly depends on the geometry and the size of graphene nanorings .
We argue that the kinetic energy of the material ejected during a stellar collision may be sufficient to remove the gas and dust entirely from a cluster , or to remove the gas as a wind , in addition to partially destroying the dust .	By calculating the rate of stellar collisions using an N-body model for the cluster , we find remarkable agreement between the average time between collisions and the inferred dust lifetime in this cluster , suggesting a possible close relation between the two phenomena .
Next we initiate a systematic search for more Fano visitors .	We generalize the methods of arXiv:1503.00125 to prove that smooth curves of genus at most 4 are all Fano visitors and general curves of genus at most 9 are Fano visitors .
We interpret the large variety of redshift distributions of galaxies found by far-infrared and ( sub- ) millimeter deep surveys depending on their depth and wavelength using the B\'ethermin et al .	( 2012 ) phenomenological model of galaxy evolution .

Such a symmetry has interesting consequences including the absence of charge and spin currents along open edges , and the absence of the sign problem in the determinant quantum Monte-Carlo simulations .	Consequentially , the interplay between band topology and strong correlations can be studied at high numeric precisions .
Recent Internet interconnection disputes have sparked an in- creased interest in developing methods for gathering and collecting data about utilization at interconnection points .	One mechanism , developed by DeepField Networks , allows Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to gather and aggregate utilization information using network flow statistics , standardized in the Internet Engineering Task Force as IPFIX .
Particular interest was given to the losses found in tapes in the superconducting rotor caused by the magnetic flux ripples originating from the conventional stator during nominal operation .	To compute the losses , a 2D Finite Element Method was applied to solve the H-formulation of Maxwell 's equations considering the nonlinear properties of both the superconducting material and its surrounding Ni matrix .

In fact , Teo , Sethuraman and Tan \cite { TST01 } , show that there is a polynomial time algorithm to obtain , for a given strategy ( the set of all lists ) $ Q $ and a woman $ w $ , the best partner attainable by changing her list .
We calculate the scalar , axial , and pseudoscalar charges of the quark in the Schwinger-Dyson formalism of Landau gauge QCD .	It is found that the dressed quark scalar density of the valence quark is significantly enhanced against the bare quark contribution , and the result explains qualitatively the phenomenologically known value of the pion-nucleon sigma term and also that given by lattice QCD .
Here , we report the measurement of state-resolved inelastic scattering cross sections for collisions between two open-shell molecules that are both prepared in a single quantum state .	Stark-decelerated OH radicals were scattered with hexapole-focused NO radicals in a crossed beam configuration .
We consider a process to create quasi long-range quantum discord between the non-interacting end spins of a quantum spin chain , with the end spins weakly coupled to the bulk of the chain .	The process is not only capable of creating long-range quantum correlation but the latter remains frozen , when certain weak end-couplings are adiabatically varied below certain thresholds .
Over 1.5 million targets have been searched for pulsations with amplitudes greater than 0.5 millimagnitude .	We identify over 350 stars which pulsate with periods less than 30 min .
In addition , we find a surprisingly strong increase of field enhancement with increasing opening angle of the nanotips .	For gold and tungsten nanotips in the experimentally relevant parameter range ( radius of curvature $ \geq 5\ , $ nm at $ 800\ , $ nm laser wavelength ) , we obtain field enhancement factors of up to $ { \sim } 35 $ for Au and $ { \sim } 12 $ for W for large opening angles .
Modifying this concepts by using partially Gr\ '' obner bases , local dimension , and the `` Zero Sum Relation '' we present in this paper an implementation in SINGULAR to compute the numerical irreducible decomposition .

Ca II H & amp ; K does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color , but lower-velocity SNe tend to be intrinsically bluer .	Combining the spectroscopic measurements does not improve intrinsic color inference .
A single astrophysical signal is found , with P = ( 1.780938 \pm 0.000093 ) d and a mean semi-amplitude of ( 6.9 \pm 0.3 ) mmag .	There is no evidence for persistent coherent signals with semi-amplitudes in excess of ca .
At the same time , they may have nonzero parameters \omega_ { ( \bar\alpha -3 ) } \ , ( \bar\alpha =4 , ... , D ) of the equations of state in the extra dimensions .

As a complementary analysis , one should investigate whether MOND can also reproduce the dynamics of early - type galaxies ( ETGs ) without dark matter .	As a first step , we here show that MOND can indeed fit the observed central velocity dispersion $ \sigma_0 $ of a large sample of ETGs assuming a simple MOND interpolating functions and constant anisotropy .
We employ a parabolic mirror for the conversion of a transverse beam mode to a focused dipole wave and show the required spatial and temporal shaping of the mode incident onto the mirror .	The results include a proof of principle correction of the parabolic mirror 's aberrations .
Specification of the strongest possible Bell inequalities for arbitrarily complicated physical scenarios -- any number of observers choosing between any number of observables with any number of possible outcomes -- is currently an open problem .	Here I provide a new set of tools , which I refer to as `` multideviations '' , for finding and analyzing these inequalities for the fully general case .

In this work by alternately using the technique of integration within normal , antinormal , and Weyl ordering of operators we not only derive some new operator ordering identities , but also deduce some useful integration formulas regarding to Laguerre and Hermite polynomials .	This opens a new route of deriving mathematical integration formulas by virtue of the quantum mechanical operator ordering technique .

The accuracy of the absolute astrometry offered by the VLBA allows very precise determinations of the trigonometric parallax and proper motion of T Tau South .	The proper motion derived from our VLBA observations agrees with that measured with the VLA over a similar period to better than 2 mas yr $ ^ { -1 } $ , and is fully consistent with the infrared proper motion of T Tau Sb , the pre-main sequence M star with which the radio source has traditionally been associated .
We generalize the van Kampen ansatz by introducing a new prescription leading to non-Gaussian fluctuations around the absorbing state .	The two expansion predictions are explicitly compared for the infinite range voter model with speciation as a paradigmatic model with an absorbing state .

Z-Z_d mixing introduces a new source of low energy parity violation well explored by possible future atomic parity violation and planned polarized electron scattering experiments .	Rare K ( B ) meson decays into pi ( K ) l^+ l^- ( l = e , mu ) and pi ( K ) nu anti-nu are found to already place tight constraints on the size of Z-Z_d mixing .
Thus far , much effort has been devoted to analysis of the buckling of nanotubes under various loading conditions : compression , bending , torsion , and their certain combinations .	Such extensive studies have been motivated by ( i ) the structural resilience of nanotubes against buckling and ( ii ) the substantial influence of buckling on their physical properties .
We found it impossible to construct an internally consistent set of values until we realized that two robust -- and in places competing -- conceptions of computer security were influencing our thinking .	We needed to pry these apart and make a primary commitment to one .
A \emph { $ k $ -independent set } is a set of vertices whose induced subgraph has maximum degree at most $ k $ .	The \emph { regular $ k $ -independence number } of $ G $ , denoted by $ \alpha_ { k-reg } ( G ) $ , is defined as the maximum cardinality of a $ k $ -independent set of $ G $ in which all vertices have equal degree in $ G $ .
Next we will turn to the one-baryon sector of chiral perturbation theory and will address the issue of a consistent power counting scheme .	As examples of the heavy-baryon framework we will comment on the extraction of the axial radius from pion electroproduction and will discuss the generalized polarizabilities of the proton .
In the intermediate-frequency regime , the SWNT conductivity is very low , and the spontaneous decay rate is practically unaffected by the SWNT .	In the low-frequency regime , the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate contains resonances at the antennas resonance frequencies for surface-wave propagation in the SWNT .
Mechanical deformations of the lattice offer a powerful route for tuning the electronic structure of the transition-metal dichalcogenides , as changes to bond lengths lead directly to corrections in the electronic Hamiltonian while curvature of the crystal lattice mixes the orbital structure of the electronic Bloch bands .	We first present an effective low energy Hamiltonian describing the electronic properties near the K point in the Brillouin zone , then present the corrections to this Hamiltonian due to arbitrary mechanical deformations and curvature in a way which treats both effects on an equal footing .
We start recalling with critical eyes the mathematical methods used in gauge theory and prove that they are not coherent with continuum mechanics , in particular the analytical mechanics of rigid bodies or hydrodynamics , though using the same group theoretical methods and despite the well known couplings existing between elasticity and electromagnetism ( piezzoelectricity , photoelasticity , streaming birefringence ) .	The purpose of this paper is to avoid such contradictions by using new mathematical methods coming from the formal theory of systems of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups .
Maximal entangled states ( MES ) provide a basis to two d-dimensional particles Hilbert space , d=prime $ \ne 2 $ .	The MES forming this basis are product states in the collective , center of mass and relative , coordinates .

The plane boundary of one of the half-spaces is clamped while the plane boundary of the other one is free of stresses .	The twelve velocities of propagation of these surface waves and the corresponding existence conditions are obtained in explicit forms .
Here we show ( like others before ) that an infrared divergence in the amplitude of this power asymmetry predicted in single-field slow-roll models is canceled by projection effects when considering the observed power spectrum .	We then further evaluate the nonzero , but finite , residual quadrupolar power asymmetry that remains after the divergences are canceled .
The Goldstone mode in a helical magnetic phase , also known as the helimagnon , is a propagating mode with a highly anisotropic dispersion relation .	Here we study theoretically the helimagnon excitations in a complex chiral ground state of pyrochlore antiferromagnets such as spinel CdCr2O4 and itinerant magnet YMn2 .
We describe here a minimal theory of tight binding electrons moving on the square planar Cu lattice of the hole-doped cuprates and mixed quantum mechanically with pairs of them ( Cooper pairs ) .	Superconductivity occurring at the transition temperature T_c is the long-range , d-wave symmetry phase coherence of these Cooper pairs .

The resulting criterion has several advantages , including the avoidance of certain technical difficulties relating to sets of measure zero .	By considering the 'reality ' not of the wavefunction but of the observable properties of any ontological physical theory a novel characterisation of non-locality and contextuality is found .
In contrast to Dirac points , which are their two-dimensional analogues , Weyl points are stable in the momentum space and the associated surface states are predicted to be topologically non-trivial .	However , Weyl points are yet to be discovered in nature .
We will mainly analyze the stochastic systems using the measurements performed in two experiments : a ) a harmonic oscillator driven out of equilibrium by an external force b ) a colloidal particle trapped in a time dependent double well potential .	We will rapidly describe some consequences of fluctuation theorems and some useful applications to the analysis of experimental data .
This guarantees that residuals can be used to tightly bound errors from below and above and is crucial for a posteriori error control and the development of adaptive strategies .	In this framework , the so-called Discontinuous Petrov -- Galerkin ( DPG ) concept can be viewed as a systematic strategy of contriving variational formulations which possess these desirable stability properties , see e. g. Broersen et al . [ 2015 ] .
This could be obtained through two processes : 1 ) the late infalling gas from the external warm IGM is efficiently mixed within the halo and brings some additional entropy , or 2 ) the shocks generated by larger non-linear scales are also present within clusters and can heat the ICM .	We show that if assumption ( 1 ) holds , the entropy brought by the warm IGM is sufficient to explain the observed properties of clusters , in particular the entropy floor and the LX-T relation .

Two types of correlations between the radio and X-ray luminosities ( $ L_R $ and $ L_X $ ) have been found in black hole X-ray binaries .	For some sources , they follow the `original ' type of correlation which is described by a single power-law .
A simple , non-chiral , renormalizable model is presented to illustrate this mechanism .	The well known , chiral , $ SU ( 3 ) \times SU ( 2 ) $ model and its generalizations are shown to break supersymmetry by this mechanism in the limit $ \Lambda_2 \gg \Lambda_3 $ .
The original proof uses tools of harmonic analysis , which as powerful as they are , seem to be specific for the structure groups SO ( n ) and Spin ( n ) .	The different approach we propose is based on the relationship between ellipticity and optimal Kato constants and on the representation theory of so ( n ) .
Band-merging crises through which dynamics remains nonchaotic are also studied , and correspondence is made with analogous behavior in the unforced logistic map .	Robustness of these phenomena with respect to additive noise is investigated .

The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for ordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved , due to the large number of labeled patterns that are needed .	The availability of ordinal class labels , however , is often costly to calibrate or difficult to obtain .
We compute the special values of partial zeta function at $ s=0 $ for family of real quadratic fields $ K_n $ and ray class ideals $ \fb_n $ such that $ \fb_n^ { -1 } = [ 1 , \delta ( n ) ] $ where the continued fraction expansion of $ \delta ( n ) $ is purely periodic and each terms are polynomial in $ n $ of bounded degree $ d $ .	With an additional assumptions , we prove that the special values of partial zeta function at $ s=0 $ behaves as quasi-polynomial .
The proof uses elliptic surfaces over the projective line and inseparable base change .	We then present adjusted inequalities .
By a result of Gy\H { o } ry ( 1976 ) , the set of w with Z [ w ] =O is a union of finitely many equivalence classes , where two elements v , w of O are called equivalent if v+w or v-w is a rational integer .	An order O is called k times monogenic if there are at least k different equivalence classes of w with Z [ w ] =O , and precisely k times monogenic if there are precisely k such equivalence classes .
Further , it is shown that the quantum channels used in the existing protocols of BCST forms only a negligibly small subset of the set of all the quantum channels that can be constructed using the proposed method to implement BCST .	It is also noted that all these quantum channels are also suitable for controlled bidirectional remote state preparation ( CBRSP ) .
In the latter case , particular attention is paid to the role of the variable centripetal force .	The students will find analytical solutions of the simplest possible ordinary differential equations of motion and see that the natural frequency strongly depends on the rotation speed , the latter being a simple vector sum .
The scaling behavior of the imaginal part of the Green function relative to $ k_ { \perp } =k-k_F $ is also discussed .	We find , although the system has linear dispersion relation and quadratic quasi-particle width , it does not satisfy Luttinger 's theorem .
The effects of such non-universalities on the sparticle spectrum and observables such as ( g-2 ) _mu , B ( b - & gt ; X_s gamma ) , the SUSY threshold corrections to the bottom mass and Omega_CDM h^2 are examined in detail and the consequences for the allowed parameter space of the model are investigated .	We find that even small deviations to universality can result in large qualitative differences compared to the universal case ; for certain values of the parameters , we find , even at low m_16 , that radiative electroweak symmetry breaking fails as a consequence of either |mu|^2 & lt ; 0 or m_ ( A^0 ) ^2 & lt ; 0 .

In particular , I focuse on application of the Saturation Model .	In addition to the main dipole-nucleon or dipole-dipole contribution included in recent analyses , I propose how to calculate within the same formalism the hadronic single-resolved contribution to heavy quark production .
In many prediction problems , it is not uncommon that the number of variables used to construct a forecast is of the same order of magnitude as the sample size , if not larger .	We then face the problem of constructing a prediction in the presence of potentially large estimation error .
The physical properties of our model satellites ( e.g.mean metallicities , ages , half-light radii and mass-to-light ratios ) are in good agreement with the latest observational measurements .	We do not find a strong dependence upon the particular implementation of supernova feedback , but a scheme which is more efficient in galaxies embedded in smaller haloes , i.e.shallower potential wells , gives better agreement with the properties of the ultra-faint satellites .
Most importantly , additionally to the known asymmetric dependence on the nonlinearity , there is also a notable asymmetry in the sensitivity of the tunneling probability to the nonliearity-induced initial population of the Bloch band to which the tunneling takes place .	This fact can explain the experimentally observed unexpected independence of the upper-to-lower tunneling probablity on the nonlinearity .
It is showed that due to limitations of the mass transfer of nano-Fe0 to contaminants , available concepts can not explain the success of nano-Fe0 injection for in situ groundwater remediation .	It is recommended to test the possibility of introducing nano-Fe0 to initiate the formation of roll-fronts which propagation would induce the reductive transformation of both dissolved and adsorbed contaminants .
The IceCube project transforms a cubic kilometer of deep and ultra-transparent Antarctic ice into a particle detector .	A total of 5,160 optical sensors are embedded into a gigaton of Antarctic ice to detect the Cherenkov light emitted by secondary particles produced when neutrinos interact with nuclei in the ice .
Then , the resulting gauge group in four dimensions is still E6 despite the fact that the Levi-Civita connection has SO ( 6 ) holonomy .	We derive the associated four-dimensional effective theories including matter field terms for such compactifications .
These spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter , eta , which is a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a Principal Component Analysis .	This parameter eta identifies the average emission and absorption line strength in the galaxy rest-frame spectrum and hence is a useful indicator of the present star formation .
Although in the previous approaches there have been many attempts to use some information such as the margin size and the number of support vectors as performance estimators for binary SVMs , they may not accurately reflect the actual performance of the binary SVMs .	We show that the generalization ability evaluated via a cross-validation mechanism is more suitable to directly extract the actual performance of binary SVMs .

Meaningful efficiency metrics are key for design space exploration to quantify the algorithmic and the implementation complexity of a receiver .	Most of the current established efficiency metrics are based on counting operations , thus neglecting important issues like data and storage complexity .
We analyze the current status of the solution to the solar neutrino problem based both on : a ) non-standard flavor changing neutrino interactions ( FCNI ) and b ) non-universal flavor diagonal neutrino interactions ( FDNI ) .	We find that FCNI and FDNI with matter in the sun as well as in the earth provide a good fit not only to the total rate measured by all solar neutrino experiments but also to the day-night and seasonal variations of the event rate , as well as the recoil electron energy spectrum measured by the SuperKamiokande collaboration .

Consider a model parameterized by a scalar parameter of interest and a nuisance parameter vector .	Inference about the parameter of interest may be based on the signed root of the likelihood ratio statistic R. The standard normal approximation to the conditional distribution of R typically has error of order O ( n^ { -1/2 } ) , where n is the sample size .
We construct a class of generalized non-local gravity ( GNLG ) model which is the modified theory of general relativity ( GR ) obtained by adding a term $ m^ { 2n-2 } R\Box^ { -n } R $ to the Einstein-Hilbert action .	Concretely , we not only study the gravitational equation for the GNLG model by introducing auxiliary scalar fields , but also analyse the classical stability and examine the cosmological consequences of the model for different exponent $ n $ .
In a recent article , however , we have determined the magnetic coupling induced by the charge stripes between bond- or site-centered spin stripes modeled by two- or three-leg ladders , respectively .	We found that only the site-centered models order .
The traditional information theoretic approach to studying feedback is to consider ideal instantaneous high-rate feedback of the channel outputs to the encoder .	This was acceptable in classical work because the results were negative : Shannon pointed out that even perfect feedback often does not improve capacity and in the context of symmetric DMCs , Dobrushin showed that it does not improve the fixed block-coding error exponents in the interesting high rate regime .
The effectiveness of our algorithm grows with the number of nodes ( or threads ) .	This algorithm should be applicable for any parallel simulation with short-range interactions , including parallel or grid simulations of partial differential equations .

DGSS galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( z=0.6-0.82 ) are brighter , on average , by ~1 mag at fixed metallicity compared to the lowest DGSS redshift bin ( z=0.26-0.40 ) and brighter by up to ~2.4 mag compared to local ( z & lt ; 0.1 ) emission-line field galaxies .	Alternatively , DGSS galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( z=0.6-0.82 ) are , on average , 40 % ( 0.15 dex ) more metal-poor at fixed luminosity compared to local ( z & lt ; 0.1 ) emission-line field galaxies .
The absolute lower bound for the detection rate can naturally be due to SD interaction .	An experiment aimed at detecting DM with sensitivity higher than 10^ { -5 } event/day/kg should have a non-zero-spin target .
Methods to quantify the dust content of these systems based on optical imaging data usually yield dust masses which are an order of magnitude lower than dust masses derived from the observed FIR emission .	High-quality optical data from the Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey ( NGVS ) and FIR/submm observations from the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey ( HeViCS ) allow us to revisit previous methods to determine the dust content in galaxies and explore new ones .

We find that the average Seyfert 1 power law has an index of 1.7 with a dispersion of 0.2 .	The mean cut-off energy is at around 100 keV , with most objects displaying Ec in the range 50-150 keV ; the average amount of Compton reflection is 1.5 with a typical dispersion of 0.7 .
We demonstrate this technique as an efficient means to accomplish broadband dipolar recoupling of homonuclear spins , while decoupling heteronuclear dipolar couplings and anisotropic chemicals shifts and retaining influence from isotropic chemical shifts .	In this manner , it possible to synthesize Ising interactions in homonuclear spin networks and thereby avoid dipolar truncation - a serious problem essentially all previous homonuclear dipolar recoupling experiments suffer from .
A four-momentum operator is given in terms of bare fermion-antifermion-boson creation and annihilation operators with discrete indices .	In continuum quantum field theories the fermion-antifermion creation and annihilation operators appear as bilinears in the four-momentum operator and generate a unitary algebra .
The decrease is consistent with the expected behaviour , $ m_m ( T ) \sim g^2 ( T ) T $ .	We find $ m_e ( T ) = 2.484 ( 52 ) T $ and $ m_m ( T ) = 0.466 ( 15 ) g^2 ( T ) T $ .
One of the central questions in sensor networks is what to do with the data , i.e. , how to reason with it and how to communicate it .	This paper argues that the lessons of the UAI community , in particular that one should produce and communicate beliefs rather than raw sensor values , are highly relevant to sensor networks .
Using a stochastic control problem formulation , the existence and structure of optimal quantization policies are studied .	For a finite-horizon problem with bounded per-stage distortion measure , the existence of an optimal zero-delay quantization policy is shown provided that the quantizers allowed are ones with convex codecells .
Values for Q^ { -1 } above T_c are temperature independent and have a weak pressure dependence .	Below T_c , a deliberate axial compression of the aerogel by 10 % widens the range of metastability for a superfluid Equal Spin Pairing ( ESP ) state ; we observe this ESP phase on cooling and the B phase on warming over an extended temperature region .
For a rigid body to be in static equilibrium the condition is that net force and net torque acting on the body should be zero .	That clearly signifies that if equal weights are placed on either sides of a balance , the balance should be in equilibrium , even if its beam is not horizontal ( we have considered the beam to be straight and have no thickness , an ideal case ) .
We report and discuss post-explosion observations of supernova iPTF13bvn .	We find that the brightness of the SN at +740 days is below the level of the pre-explosion source and thus confirm that the progenitor star has gone .
The bulk partition function is given by a functional integral over string fields in AdS_2 .	Using recent results on localization we reduce the infinite-dimensional functional integral to a finite number of ordinary integrals over a space of localizing instantons .
In general , the sensitivity matrix is related to the equilibrium fluctuations of the system .	In particular , it may be used as the basis for a statistical model to efficiently predict the sensitivity of the circuit response to small component variations .
If $ A $ and $ B $ are derived-equivalent , then the $ \Phi $ -Auslander-Yoneda algebras of $ X $ and $ Y $ are derived-equivalent for every admissible set $ \Phi $ .	In particular , the Auslander algebras of $ A $ and $ B $ are both derived-equivalent and stably equivalent .
In this paper , we show this approach needs caution because the rematching step of the algorithm is not explicitly accounted for , and applying it to the point-to-point version of ICP leads to completely erroneous covariances .	We then provide a formal mathematical proof why the approach is valid in the point-to-plane version of ICP , which validates the intuition and experimental results of practitioners .
The NJL model findings are compared with recent lattice results obtained in two -- flavor QCD at finite chemical potential .	On a qualitative level , the NJL model provides a consistent description of the dependence of quark number fluctuations on temperature and baryon chemical potential .
Enhanced B ( E2 ) , B ( E1 ) values as well as energetics provide evidences for superdeformation and existence of parity doublet cluster structure in an odd-A nucleus for the first time in A = 40 region .	Large scale shell model calculations assign ( sd ) 16 ( pf ) 3 as the origin of these states .
Since the discovery of the first exoplanets , those most adequate for life to begin and evolve have been sought .	Due to observational bias , however , most of the discovered planets so far are gas giants , precluding their habitability .
They can have a regular horizon , and we show that this implies the existence of an infinite number of black rings , labeled by a continuous parameter , with the same mass and angular momentum as neutral black rings and black holes .	We also discuss the solution for a rotating loop of fundamental string .
Our attempt to understand this observation led us to discover further connections between projective geometry and representation theory .	Among other things , we calculate the variety of tangent directions to lines on $ X $ through a point and determine unirulings of $ X $ .
These results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on 2D metallic dot arrays .	We have also investigated the effects of an ac drive as well as a suddenly applied dc drive .
This solves a long standing problem of understanding the different chemical characteristics of the inner and outer parts of the disk .	The time required to build up the metallicity difference between the two sides of the step is a measure of the minimal life-time of the present grand-design spiral pattern structure , of the order of 3 Gyr .
A QCD analysis of the measured dijet fraction as a function of Q**2 allows both a precise determination of alpha_s ( M_Z ) and a test of the energy-scale dependence of the strong coupling constant .	A detailed analysis provides an improved estimate of the uncertainties of the NLO QCD cross sections arising from the parton distribution functions of the proton .
CLOUDY photoionization models show that the observed transition represents a true difference in ionization source and can not be explained by variations of physical parameters .	The electron density and ionization parameter decrease with radius indicating that the NLR is photoionized by the central source only .
Entanglement is an useful resource because some global operations can not be locally implemented using classical communication .	We prove a number of results about what is and is not locally possible .
The model is applied to a C60 molecule and a cluster , and is treated by the Hartree-Fock approximation followed by a configuration interaction method .	Lattice fluctuations are taken into account by a bond disorder model .
From weak seed fields , convective motions produce highly intermittent magnetic fields in the intergranular lanes which collect over the boundaries of the underlying meso-granular scale cells .	Instances of both emerging magnetic flux loops and magnetic flux disappearing from the surface occur in the simulations .
We study the creep regime and compute the crossover current between line-like creep and pancake-like creep motion .	We find that columnar defects effectively increase interlayer Josephson coupling by suppressing thermal fluctuations of pancakes .
We present intermediate and low resolution optical spectroscopy ( 650-915 nm ) of seven faint , very red objects ( 20 & gt ; I & gt ; = 17.8 , I-Z & gt ; = 0.5 ) discovered in a CCD-based IZ survey covering an area of 1 sq .	deg in the central region of the Pleiades open cluster .
We refined the physical parameters of the system using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simultaneous fitting of the available photometric and spectroscopic data .	An analysis of the tidal evolution of the system shows how the currently measured obliquity and its uncertainty translate into an initial absolute value of less than about 10 degrees on the zero-age main sequence , for an expected average modified tidal quality factor of the star Q'* & gt ; 4 x 10^6 .
Moreover , since the dynamics of populations are dependent on the life-history of the species and its environment , it is conceivable that the stabilizing effects of control methods would also be affected by such factors , a complication that has typically not been investigated .	In this study we compare six different control methods with respect to their efficiency at inducing a common level of enhancement ( 50 % increase ) for two kinds of stability ( constancy and persistence ) under four different life history/ environment combinations .
The linear compressibilities and the thermal expansion of an untwinned , nearly optimal doped YBa2Cu3O6.94 single crystal were measured along the three crystallographic axes with a high-resolution dilatometer mounted in a high-pressure cell .	The measurements were performed in a temperature range from 50 K to 320 K under hydrostatic gas pressure of maximal 0.65 GPa .
We show that modern quantum field theoretical approaches to quark matter including color superconductivity and a vector meanfield allow a microscopic description of hybrid stars which fulfill the new , strong constraints .	For these objects color superconductivity turns out to be an essential ingredient for a successful description of the cooling phenomenology in accordance with recently developed tests .
We investigated the thermal evolution of non-spherical primordial gas clouds of mass $ M=10^6M_\odot $ .	We studied two cases : 1 ) prolate and oblate clouds without angular momentum , 2 ) initially spherical , oblate and prolate clouds with angular momentum .
To determine this functor , however , it remains to determine the homotopy groups of the topological Whitehead spectrum of the circle .	The cyclotomic trace of B okstedt , Hsiang , and Madsen and a theorem of Dundas , in turn , lead to an expression for these homotopy groups in terms of the equivariant homotopy groups of the homotopy fiber of the map from the topological Hochschild T-spectrum of the sphere spectrum to that of the ring of integers induced by the Hurewicz map .
We complete the list of one loop renormalization group equations and matching conditions relevant for the computation of the electroweak precision parameters $ S $ and $ T $ in the three site Higgsless model .	We obtain one-loop formulas for $ S $ and $ T $ expressed in terms of physical observables such as the KK gauge boson mass $ M_ { W ' } $ , the KK fermion mass $ M $ , and the KK gauge boson ( $ W ' $ ) couplings with light quarks and leptons $ g_ { W'ff } $ .
This paper discusses the development and engineering of electrical spectroscopy for simultaneous and non invasive measurement of electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity .	A suitable quadrupolar probe is able to perform measurements on a subsurface with inaccuracies below a fixed limit ( 10 % ) in a bandwidth of low ( LF ) frequency ( 100kHz ) .
Clustering analyses are still very confidential , and do not take into account the unavoidable characteristics in our Universe : evolution .	Assuming branching evolution of galaxies as a 'transmission with modification ' , we have shown that the concepts and tools of phylogenetic systematics ( cladistics ) can be heuristically transposed to the case of galaxies .
In this paper we investigate such scenarios , and propose a model and corresponding privacy friendly protocols for efficient and fine-grained management of access permissions to tags .	In particular we propose an efficient mutual authentication protocol between a tag and a reader that achieves a reasonable level of privacy , using only symmetric key cryptography on the tag , while not requiring a costly key-search algorithm at the reader side .
Furthermore , we analyse two short archival observations performed in February 2002 and January 2003 ( the latter already reported by Gohler et al .	2005 ) in order to study the long term behaviour of this AXP .
Such cores are called `` protostellar '' or `` starless , '' depending on whether they do or do not contain compact sources of luminosity .	In this chapter , the first half of the review of low-mass dense cores , we describe the numerous inferences made about the nature of starless cores as a result of recent observations , since these reveal the initial conditions of star formation .
The spin 1 bilinear-biquadratic model on square lattice in the region $ 0 & lt ; \phi & lt ; \pi/4 $ is studied in a fermion representation with a p-wave pairing BCS type mean-field theory .	Our results show there may exist a non-trivial gapped spin liquid with time-reversal symmetry spontaneously breaking .
For a one-particle circuit ( or for N non-interacting particles ) , the induced electromagnetic fields depend upon the mass and charge of the current carriers while energy is transferred to the kinetic energy of the particle ( or particles ) .	However , for an interacting multiparticle circuit , the mutual electromagnetic interactions between particles can dominate the behavior so that the mass and charge of the individual particles becomes irrelevant ; the induced fields are then comparable to the inducing fields and energy goes into magnetic energy .
A topological p-n junction ( TPNJ ) is an important concept to control spin and charge transport on a surface of three dimensional topological insulators ( 3D-TIs ) .	Topological surface states with up and down helical spin locking provide unique rectification in the flow of current , such as Klein tunneling and Veselago lensing .
Moreover , we show how to compute a so-called `` fingerprint '' for every predicate .	Fingerprints capture those characteristics of the predicate that are significant when searching for duplicated functionality .
By combining the data of the Two Micron All Sky Survey , the \textit { Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer } and the \textit { AKARI } satellite , we study the infrared colour properties of a sample of 2712 nearby radio-luminous galaxies ( RLGs ) .	These RLGs are divided into radio-loud ( RL ) active galactic nuclei ( AGNs ) , mainly occurring at redshifts of $ 0.05 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.3 $ and star-forming-dominated RLGs ( SFGs ) , mainly occurring at redshifts of $ 0.01 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.15 $ .
Our main result shows that nonexistence for a given volume implies that the isoperimetric profile of the cone coincides with the one of the half-space .	This allows us to give some criteria ensuring existence of isoperimetric regions : for instance , local convexity of the cone at some boundary point .
It turns out that the energy conversion from gravitational to electromagnetic waves can be significantly altered due to the QED effects .	The consequences of our results are discussed .
In this article we describe the instruments developed for and used in such accelerators as Fermilab 's Tevatron ( FNAL , Batavia , IL USA ) and for the studies toward an International Linear Collider ( ILC ) .	The instrumentation includes Hydrostatic Level Sensors ( HLS ) for very low frequency measurements .
Here our factorisation is completely independent from the derivation in Kyprianou ( 2015 ) , moreover there is no clear way to invert the factors in Kyprianou ( 2015 ) to derive our results .	Our method gives direct access to the potential densities of the ascending and descending ladder MAP of the Lamperti-stable MAP in closed form .
In the 1D HM , we show that this scheme reproduces correctly the metallic behavior given by the well-known Luttinger liquid fixed-point result .	Then , we use the same approach to deal with the more complicated 2D HM .
In this case the properties of the Higgs resonance can differ substantially from those predicted by the standard model .	In this letter we construct an effective Lagrangian description of a theory with a non-standard Higgs boson and analyze the features of a theory with such a resonance coupled to the Goldstone Bosons of the breaking of $ \su $ .
The emergence of the seeds of cosmic structure , from a perfect isotropic and homogeneous Universe , has not been clearly explained by the standard version of inflationary models as the dynamics involved preserve the homogeneity and isotropy at all times .	A proposal that attempts to deal with this problem , by introducing `` the self-induced collapse hypothesis , '' has been introduced by D. Sudarsky and collaborators in previous papers .
The model based on the extended Hilbert space and free of these shortages has been proposed ; parameters being until now denoted as `` hidden '' have been involved .	Some earlier arguments against a hidden-variable theory have been shown to be false , too .
Dark matter , $ X $ , may be generated by new physics at the TeV scale during an early matter-dominated ( MD ) era that ends at temperature $ T_R \ll { \rm TeV } $ .	Compared to the conventional radiation-dominated ( RD ) results , yields from both Freeze-Out and Freeze-In processes are greatly suppressed by dilution from entropy production , making Freeze-Out less plausible while allowing successful Freeze-In with a much larger coupling strength .
We examine the efficiency with which supernova-enriched gas may be ejected from dwarf disk galaxies , using a methodology previously employed to study the self-enrichment efficiency of dwarf spheroidal systems .	Unlike previous studies that focused on highly concentrated starbursts , in the current work we consider discrete supernova events spread throughout various fractions of the disk .
We present discovered properties of sums of polynomial , power , and exponential functions of one variable .	It is shown that for an equation composed of one type of function there is a corresponding equation composed of functions of the other type .
We analytically calculate the dephasing factor $ \gamma ( t ) $ and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information ( QFI ) for the amplitude parameter $ \alpha $ and the phase parameter $ \phi $ .	It is shown that the QFI for the amplitude parameter $ \alpha $ is invariant in the whole process , while the QFI for the phase parameter $ \phi $ strongly depends on the reservoir squeezing .
In this work , we first derive an innovative formulation of the problem over acyclic overlay networks with arbitrary underlay capacity constraints .	Then , based on the formulation , we develop a distributed algorithm to achieve the maximum broadcast rate and every user only maintains one queue per-neighbor .
We obtain a characterization of $ { \mathcal S } ^ { \ { M_p\ } } _ { \ { M_p\ } } ( \mathbb R^n ) $ and $ \mathcal { S } ^ { ( M_p ) } _ { ( M_p ) } ( \mathbb { R } ^n ) $ , the general Gelfand-Shilov spaces of ultradifferentiable functions of Roumieu and Beurling type , in terms of decay estimates for the Fourier coefficients of their elements with respect to eigenfunction expansions associated to normal globally elliptic differential operators of Shubin type .	Moreover , we show that the eigenfunctions of such operators are absolute Schauder bases for these spaces of ultradifferentiable functions .
The countermeasure expenditure , together with its ability to mitigate risks , is factors that affect the selection .	While many approaches have been proposed to perform risk analysis , there has been less focus on delivering the prescriptive and specific information that managers require to select cost-effective countermeasures .
First , we study the two-dimensional case , in particular we examine the effects of the relative phases of the different fragments and the removal rate of the optical potential on the vortex formation .	We find that many vortices are created by instant removal of the optical potential regardless of relative phases , and that fewer vortices are created if the intensity of the optical potential is gradually ramped down and the condensed fragments gradually merge .
We present a study of M dwarfs discovered in a large area , multicolor survey .	We employ a combination of morphological and color criteria to select M dwarfs to a limiting magnitude in V of 22 , the deepest such ground-based survey for M dwarfs to date .
Recently , researchers investigated epidemic models in { \em arbitrary } networks ( i.e. , no restrictions on network topology ) .	However , all these models only capture { \em push-based } infection , namely that an infectious node always actively attempts to infect its neighboring nodes .
However , Kerr combs may exhibit strong phase noise and multiplet spectral lines , and this has made high-speed data transmission impossible up to now .	Recent work has shown that systematic adjustment of pump conditions enables low phase-noise Kerr combs with singlet spectral lines .
The former gives some lessons on the method and shows the advantage of the method compared with continued fraction formalism .	The latter is treated by selecting important dynamic processes contributing to the Green 's function when correlation is strong .
To date , over 8000 stars with [ Fe/H ] & lt ; = -2.0 and effective temperatures in the range 4500K & lt ; T_eff & lt ; 7000K have been found , with the expected numbers in this temperature range to be well over 10,000 once SEGUE is completed .	The numbers roughly double when one includes warmer blue stragglers and Blue Horizontal-Branch ( BHB ) stars in these counts .
We further provide an explicit construction of the exact color-polarized two-coloron eigenstates , and thereby show that colorons are free but that their relative momentum spacings are shifted according to fractional statistics with parameter $ g=2/3 $ .	We evaluate the SU ( 3 ) spin currents .
Consumers are card-holders , who are allowed to entry to all the museums in the network for one year .	We employ graphical models to highlight associations among the museums driven by card-holder visiting behaviour .
To $ X $ a normal operator bimodule $ \nor { X } $ is associated so that completely bounded $ A , B $ -bimodule maps from $ X $ into normal operator bimodules factorize uniquely through $ \nor { X } $ .	A construction of $ \nor { X } $ in terms of biduals of $ X $ , $ A $ and $ B $ is presented .
We investigate the behavior of the moments of the partially transposed reduced density matrix \rho^ { T_2 } _A in critical quantum spin chains .	Given subsystem A as union of two blocks , this is the ( matrix ) transposed of \rho_A with respect to the degrees of freedom of one of the two .
By enumerating the states and energies of compact 18 , 27 , and 36mers on a simplified lattice model with an ensemble of random sequences , we test the validity of the self-averaging approximation .	We find that fluctuations in the free energy between sequences are weak , and that self-averaging is a valid approximation at the length scale of real proteins .
By precisely tuning the tip-sample distance in the submicron region we found out that the field enhancement factor is not affected by distance variations up to 2um .	Finally , the study of current stability showed that the field emission current with intensity of about 3,3*10-5A remains remarkably stable ( within 5 % fluctuations ) for several hours .
We analyze current fluctuations in mesoscopic coherent conductors in the presence of electron-electron interactions .	In a wide range of parameters we obtain explicit universal dependencies of the current noise on temperature , voltage and frequency .
We propose a possible resolution to the cosmological constant problem through a scenario in which the universe is composed of three components : matter , radiation ( CMB ) and vacuum energy such that vacuum energy is not constant and is decaying into the matter component .	Matter in this scenario consists of baryonic matter and primordial black holes ( PBHs ) as the dark matter .
Here we reinterpret MUBs as quantum phase states , i.e.as eigenvectors of Hermitean phase operators generalizing those introduced by Pegg & amp ; Barnett in 1989 .	We relate MUB states to additive characters of Galois fields ( in odd characteristic p ) and to Galois rings ( in characteristic 2 ) .
A quantum computer uses quantum states analogous to CMOS registers .	With efficient initialization , number of CMOS registers is proportional to ( n-1 ) !
Characterizing the importance of data has two potential direct benefits : ( 1 ) increased privacy and ( 2 ) reduced data management costs , including storage .	For privacy , we enable increased recommendation accuracy for comparable privacy levels using existing data obfuscation techniques .
Then the fluxes derived using the high energy gratings ( HEGs ) were compared to those derived from the medium energy gratings ( MEGs ) .	The flux ratio was fit to a low order polynomial , which was allocated to the MEGs above 1 keV or the HEGs below 1 keV .
The reported low frequency of carbon detections may be due to low signal-to-noise data , low abundance of unburned material , line blending between C II 6580 and Si II 6355 , ejecta temperature differences , asymmetrical distribution effects , or a combination of these .	However , a survey of published pre-maximum spectra reveals that more SNe Ia than previously thought may exhibit C II 6580 absorption features and relics of line blending near 6300 Angstroms .
It has been found out that the existing WCA lacks in forming efficient clusters .	Thus , this work proposes an Extended weighted partitioning around cluster head mechanism by considering W-PAC as a base to form clusters .
In this model the compact ( on-brane ) dimension is assumed to be sufficiently small in order to describe our universe ( hybrid compactification ) .	The bulk geometry is non-static , unlike most of the braneworld models in the literature .
We begin by focusing on isolated toric singularities without vanishing 6-cycles , which we classify , and propose for them field theory duals .	We then study in detail the cone over Q^111 and find agreement between the spectrum of baryonic operators in this theory and M5 branes wrapping 5-cycles in the Q^111 space .
The 0.5 -- 5 keV ACIS spectrum of the diffuse emission is described by a two-component model , consisting of a soft thermal plasma emission from the host galaxy halo and a hard non-thermal power-law component .	The hard component is ascribed to the inverse Comptonization of cosmic microwave background photons by the synchrotron emitting electrons in the lobes , because its spectral energy index , 0.68+-0.28 , is consistent with the radio synchrotron index , 0.78 .
In this paper we investigate the relation between the multiplicities of split strongly abelian p-chief factors of finite-dimensional restricted Lie algebras and first degree restricted cohomology .	As an application we obtain a characterization of solvable restricted Lie algebras in terms of the multiplicities of split strongly abelian p-chief factors .
We show that it is possible to satisfy most of recent observational boundaries on masses and radii if a diquark condensate forms in a hybrid or a quark star .	Moreover , we find that a huge amount of energy , of the order of $ 10^ { 53 } $ erg , can be released in the conversion from a ( metastable ) hadronic star into a ( stable ) hybrid or quark star , if the presence of a color superconducting phase is taken into account .
Since it is impossible to predict and identify all the vulnerabilities of a network , and penetration into a system by malicious intruders can not always be prevented , intrusion detection systems ( IDSs ) are essential entities for ensuring the security of a networked system .	To be effective in carrying out their functions , the IDSs need to be accurate , adaptive , and extensible .
Then the t-J Hamiltonian is used to establish the formation of the charge stripes in underdoped oxides .	It is proposed that these stripes make up the boundaries between the two degenerate anti-ferromagnetic ( AFM ) states , and that they are a key factor in switching between these states .
We followed the evolution of the OH , NH , CN , $ \mathrm { C_3 } $ , and $ \mathrm { C_2 } $ production rates as well as the $ Af\rho $ parameter as a proxy for the dust production .	We detected an outburst two weeks after perihelion , with gas and dust production rates being multiplied by a factor five within a few days .
A model equation for the evolution of the earth 's topography by erosional processes which produces fractal topography and fractal river networks is presented and its solutions compared in detail to real topography .	The model is the diffusion equation for sediment transport on hillslopes and channels with the local diffusivity proportional to the square of the discharge .
The resistivity anomaly associated with the spin-density-wave ( SDW ) transition in the undoped compound is gradually suppressed by the P doping .	Superconductivity with the maximum $ T_c $ of 30 K emerges at $ x $ =0.32 , coinciding with a magnetic quantum critical point ( QCP ) which is evidenced by the disappearance of SDW order and the linear temperature-dependent resistivity in the normal state .
The cluster centered on the BL Lac works as a strong gravitational lens , forming a large arc around itself .	The aim of this paper is to study the environment and characteristics of this object more accurately than the environments of other BL Lac objects have been before.We measured the redshifts of galaxies in the cluster from the absorption lines in their spectra .
Recently , requirement for fast and event-driven data acquisition has increased , and the synchronization of a set of data from the different VME systems is requested .	We added new data-taking software to the standard framework with a shared memory network .
Rather than obfuscating network identity through higher level protocols , we propose a more direct solution : a routing protocol that allows communication without exposing network identity , providing a strong foundation for Internet privacy , while allowing identity to be defined in those higher level protocols where it adds value .	Given current research initiatives advocating `` clean slate '' Internet designs , an opportunity exists to design an internetwork layer routing protocol that decouples identity from network location and thereby simplifies the anonymity problem .
The dynamics are studied by means of the return probability and the mean square displacement .	The wave packets show anomalous diffusion in a stepwise process of fast expansion followed by time intervals of confined wave packet width .
We develop the formalizm for calculating semi inclusive observables at high energy in the JIMWLK/KLWMIJ approach .	We consider several examples including diffractive processes , elastic and inclusive over the target degrees of freedom , scattering with fixed total transverse momentum transfer and inclusive gluon production .
Hubble Space Telescope observations of Uranus- and Neptune-crossing object ( 65489 ) Ceto/Phorcys ( provisionally designated 2003 FX128 ) reveal it to be a close binary system .	The mutual orbit has a period of 9.554 +/- 0.011 days and a semimajor axis of 1840 +/- 48 km .
Our Night 1 transit depths are 0.85 +/- 0.04 % in z ; 1.00 +/- 0.03 % in g ; and 1.1 +/- 0.3 % in u .	We employ a residual-permutation method to assess the impact of correlated noise on the depth difference between the z and g bands and calculate the significance of the color dependence at 3.2 { \sigma } .
For each cluster we derived up to 20 abundance ratios sampling the main chemical elemental groups , namely light odd-Z , alpha , iron-peak and neutron-capture elements .	All the analysed abundance patterns behave similarly in the 4 clusters and also show negligible star-to-star scatter within each cluster .
The search has uncovered 58 candidates , corresponding to a completeness-corrected source density of ~0.07 sq.arcmin^-2 .	Our sources have red colors ( B-I~=1.8 ) which imply either that a large fraction of the light is highly reddened and we are detecting Lyman alpha through special lines of sight , or that these objects contain an underlying older stellar population .
Our two main rigorous results are the following : ( i ) a theorem that provides a bound on the FDR for adaptive procedures that use any estimator for the number of true hypotheses ( $ m_0 $ ) , ( ii ) a theorem that proves a monotonicity property of general BH-like procedures , both for the case where the hypotheses are independent .	We also propose two improved procedures for which we prove FDR control for the independent case , and demonstrate their advantages over several available bounds , on simulated data and on a large number of gene expression data sets .
These sampling mechanisms subsume most nonuniform sampling techniques applied in practice .	Our analyses illuminate interesting connections between under-sampled channels and multiple-input multiple-output channels .
We confirm the existence of a critical chiral state in the middle of the energy band and calculate the critical exponent nu=0.35 +/- 0.03 for the divergence of the localization length .	The sample averaged scale independent critical conductance & lt ; g & gt ; _c turns out to be a function of the amplitude of the flux fluctuations whereas the variance of the respective conductance distributions appears to be universal .
The outer region of the intracluster gas is roughly isothermal , with temperature ~6-7 keV , and metal abundance ~ 0.3 Solar .	Spectral analysis of the central pointing is consistent with the presence of a cooling flow and a central metal abundance gradient .
Quasi-stellar objects ( QSOs ) whose spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) are reddened by dust either in their host galaxies or in intervening absorber galaxies are to a large degree missed by optical color selection criteria like the one used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) .	To overcome this bias against red QSOs , we employ a combined optical and near-infrared color selection .
This has important consequences for modeling inflation : the scalar power spectrum and spectral index measured in our Hubble volume would depend on an adjacent background of super Hubble perturbations .	In other words , a detection of nongaussianity implies a possible portal to the superhorizon .
Supplemented by the Great Observatory Origins Deep Survey ( GOODS ) Early Release Science ( ERS ) and further UDF pointings , these data will provide crucial information about the most distant known galaxies .	However , achieving tight constraints on the z~7 galaxy luminosity function ( LF ) will require even more ambitious photometric surveys .
The spin domain can be used to construct a model in which spin 1 and spin1/2 particles coexist .	Using the geometric tri-product , we develop the geometry of this domain .
Pulsar B is seen in almost all orbital phases , except in the range of $ \sim 6\deg $ to $ 65\deg $ .	This may be interpreted as an { \it eclipse } of pulsar B 's signal by its own magnetopause region produced by interaction with pulsar A 's relativistic wind .
Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning perform poorly in the early stages of learning in noisy environments , because much effort is spent on unlearning biased estimates of the state-action function .	The bias comes from selecting , among several noisy estimates , the apparent optimum , which may actually be suboptimal .
Using the data collected by the AMS-01 experiment in the range ~0.2-1.5 GeV/nucleon , we compare the measurements on 1H , 2H , 3He , and 4He with calculations for interstellar propagation and solar modulation .	These data are described well by a diffusive-reacceleration model with parameters that match the B/C ratio data , indicating that He and heavier nuclei such as C-N-O experience similar propagation histories .
This essentially affects the electron elastic scattering phases as well as corresponding cross-sections .	We illustrate the general trend by concrete examples of electron scattering by endohedrals of Neon and Argon .
The channel polarization is found to be universal in many signal processing problems and has been applied to the coded modulation schemes .	In this paper , the channel polarization is further extended to the multiple antenna transmission following a multilevel coding principle .
To evaluate the proposed method , we manually constructed a gold standard where for each ( word , definition ) pair and given the set of synonyms defined for that word by the 5 synonym dictionaries , 4 lexicographers specified the set of synonyms they judge adequate .	While inter-annotator agreement ranges on that task from 67 % to at best 88 % depending on the annotator pair and on the synonym dictionary being considered , the automatic procedure we propose scores a precision of 67 % and a recall of 71 % .
We present the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey ( SERVS ) , an 18 square degrees medium-deep survey at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with the post-cryogenic Spitzer Space Telescope to ~2 microJy ( AB=23.1 ) depth of five highly observed astronomical fields ( ELAIS-N1 , ELAIS-S1 , Lockman Hole , Chandra Deep Field South and XMM-LSS ) .	SERVS is designed to enable the study of galaxy evolution as a function of environment from z~5 to the present day , and is the first extragalactic survey both large enough and deep enough to put rare objects such as luminous quasars and galaxy clusters at z & gt ; 1 into their cosmological context .
We introduce a scheduling-based cooperation incentive scheme which enables machine nodes to organize themselves locally , create machine groups , and communicate through group representatives to the base station .	This scheme benefits from a novel scheduler design which takes into account the cooperation level of each node , reimburses the extra energy consumptions of group representatives , and maximizes the network lifetime .
Our main purpose is to clarify the dependence of $ & lt ; \phi^ { 2 } & gt ; _ { H } $ on field mass $ m $ in relation to the excitation mechanism .	It is shown for small-mass fields with $ mr_ { + } \ll1 $ how the excitation of $ & lt ; \phi^ { 2 } & gt ; _ { H } $ caused by finite black-hole temperature is suppressed as $ m $ increases , and it is verified for very massive fields with $ mr_ { + } \gg1 $ that $ & lt ; \phi^ { 2 } & gt ; _ { H } $ decreases in proportion to $ m^ { -2 } $ with the amplitude equal to the DeWitt-Schwinger approximation .
High-z SMGs are dust rich , i.e.they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared to local spiral galaxies ( by a factor of 30 ) and also compared to local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ULIRGs , by a factor of 6 ) .	This indicates that the large masses of gas typically hosted in SMGs have already been highly enriched with metals and dust .
Grid computing consists of the coordinated use of large sets of diverse , geographically distributed resources for high performance computation .	Effective monitoring of these computing resources is extremely important to allow efficient use on the Grid .
We present a series of similar cases , the most general of which is the one in which the outer process is Poisson and the inner one is a nonlinear fractional birth process .	We highlight generalisations of these results where the external process is infinitely divisible .
In the existing literature , the quantization error is modeled typically as additive noise and the multi-bit and 1-bit quantized CS problems are dealt with separately using different treatments and procedures .	In this paper , a novel variational Bayesian inference based CS algorithm is presented , which unifies the multi- and 1-bit CS processing and is applicable to various cases of noiseless/noisy environment and unsaturated/saturated quantizer .
On the plane , beyond patches , patterns periodic in both dimensions , we remark the presence of structures periodic in one dimension , that we call strings .	We classify completely their constituents in terms of their principal periodic vector k , that we call momentum .
Here , using a toy model of a quantum well structure with two suitably designed tunnel-coupled wells kept at different temperature , we study a laser operated on an actual spatial temperature gradient between pump and gain region .	We predict gain and narrow band laser emission for a sufficient temperature gradient and resonator quality .
A substantial fraction of the lowest metallicity stars show very high enhancements in carbon .	It is debated whether these enhancements reflect the stars ' birth composition , or if their atmospheres were subsequently polluted , most likely by accretion from an AGB binary companion .
In this paper biharmonic maps between doubly warped product manifolds are studied .	We show that the inclusion maps of Riemannian manifolds $ B $ and $ F $ into the doubly warped product $ _ { f } B\times_ { b } F $ can not be proper biharmonic maps .
By summing over all low-lying levels , the partition functions are obtained explicitly .	Similar analysis is performed also at the phase boundary of zero horizontal field in which case the energy gaps scale as $ N^ { -2 } $ .
In two dimensions analytical results show that there are two collapse mechanisms .	For long posts the drop collapses when it is able to overcome the free energy barrier presented by the hydrophobic posts .
In particular , we give natural definitions of the notion of suborbifold and orbifold embedding and provide many examples .	Surprisingly , we show that there are ( topologically embedded ) smooth suborbifolds which do not arise as the image of a smooth orbifold embedding .
These systems are characterized by being defined on a Boolean state space and by simultaneous updating at discrete time steps .	Of particular importance for biological applications are networks in which the indegree for each variable is bounded by a fixed constant , as was stressed by Kauffman in his original papers .
It is shown that through the method studied in Ref .	[ 1 ] , it is possible to obtain a unified result for the one-loop correction to the Euclidean effective action in 2+1 dimensions .
In III we constructed a degeneration of the Veronese surface of order 3 to union of planes with the desired property and in IV we used I -III to compute the braid monodromy of the associated branch curve .	Here we use the Van-Kampen method to compute the fundamental group of the complement from a braid monodromy factorization and some extra properties of the factorization , namely invariant properties , also proven in IV .
These equations are generated by the superspace action when it is expressed in terms of prepotentials .	For that reason we reproduce the superspace action for integer superspin , using unconstrained superfields .
We find that scalar charge may increase entropy , temperature and probability , while may decrease black hole mass , free and internal energy .	Also electric charge increases probability and decreases temperature and internal energy .
We study the colorings of these 2977 knots by all of the 431 connected quandles of order at most 35 found by L. Vendramin .	Among other things , we collect information about quandles that have the same number of colorings for all of the 2977 knots .
In this paper , we show that alternative non-perspective cameras such as the crossed-slit or XSlit cameras exhibit a different depth-dependent aspect ratio ( DDAR ) property that can be used to 3D recovery .	We first conduct a comprehensive analysis to characterize DDAR , infer object depth from its AR , and model recoverable depth range , sensitivity , and error .
The processes are Markov processes in the usual sense .	Their structure is similar to perpetuity or autoregressive model .
Dust is detected in 31 out of 64 galaxies , although the sample is biased against the detection of dust .	From the distribution of observed axis ratios of the dust features it is inferred that 78 \pm 16 % of early-type galaxies contain nuclear dust .
As an algorithmic tool , we develop an efficient algorithm to schedule a broadcast along a BFS tree under the affectance model .	To provide a rigorous and accurate analysis , we define two novel network characteristics based on the network topology and the affectance function .
In this paper , we analyze Gelfand-Pinsker coding scheme and capacity to bring out further understandings .	We show that Gelfand-Pinsker capacity is equal to the interference-free capacity .
We identify several fragments based on ( a ) whether negation is permitted on all nouns , including those in the subject of a sentence ; and ( b ) whether the subject noun phrase may contain a relative clause .	The logics we present are extensions of the classical syllogistic , and we pay special attention to the question of whether reductio ad absurdum is needed .
The surface of a topological crystalline insulator ( TCI ) carries an even number of Dirac cones protected by crystalline symmetry .	We epitaxially grew high quality Pb $ _ { 1-x } $ Sn $ _x $ Te ( 111 ) films and investigated the TCI phase by in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy .
In the collision-dominated high temperature regime the linear thermoelectric transport coefficients are shown to obey the constraints of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics which we derive microscopically from Boltzmann theory .	The latter also allows us to describe the crossover to disorder-dominated Fermi liquid behavior at large doping and low temperatures , as well as the crossover to the ballistic regime at high fields .
After recalling several constructions of the moduli space of curves of genus zero by different people we give our alternative construction of the moduli space .	This gives a simple description of the intersection ring of this space .
This article examines whether these two different descriptions are mutually consistent .	It is shown that if the dynamical variable used in the first apparatus is represented by an operator of the Weyl-Wigner type ( for example , if it is a linear coordinate ) , then the conversion from quantum to classical terminology does not affect the final result .
Hypothesising that these symmetries exist implies the existence of a new form of matter , called mirror matter .	The mirror matter theory ( or exact parity model ) makes four main predictions : 1 ) Dark matter in the form of mirror matter should exist in the Universe ( i.e.mirror galaxies , stars , planets , meteoroids ... ) , 2 ) Maximal ordinary neutrino - mirror neutrino oscillations if neutrinos have mass , 3 ) Orthopositronium should have a shorter effective lifetime than predicted by QED ( in `` vacuum '' experiments ) because of the effects of photon-mirror photon mixing and 4 ) Higgs production and decay rate should be 50 % lower than in the standard model due to Higgs mirror - Higgs mixing ( assuming that the seperation of the Higgs masses is larger than their decay widths ) .
At first I briefly review such general topics as the structure of the operator product expansion in QCD and intrinsic limitations of the quark-hadron duality concept .	In the second part I comment on holographic constructions - a focus of the current efforts to say something new on QCD at strong coupling .
We discuss the comparison between calculated capture rates , measured capture rates and analogous transitions in ( $ e $ , $ e^ { \prime } $ ) scattering in terms of the particle-hole structure of the $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca- $ ^ { 40 } $ K nuclei .	We highlight the $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca $ ( 0^+ , 0 ) $ $ \to $ $ ^ { 40 } $ K $ ( 0^- , 2626 ) $ axial charge transition and its sensitivity to the induced pseudoscalar coupling $ g_p $ of the proton 's weak interaction .
Since the photon box gedanken experiments of several of the founding fathers of modern physics , considerable progress has been made in differentiating the quantum and classical worlds .	In this pursuit , the cavity as an open quantum system has been indispensable .

Liquid marbles , which are droplets coated with a hydrophobic powder , were exposed to a uniform electric field .	It was established that a threshold value of the electric field , 15 cgse , should be surmounted for deformation of liquid marbles .
We also analyze the spectral properties of classical amplitudes of the plane waves -- the eigenmodes of the time averaged one -- particle density matrix .	Looking at the zero momentum component -- the order parameter of the condensate , we obtain the nonperturbative results for the chemical potential .
To exploit these devices fully , optimization algorithms should reduce to multiple parallel tasks , each accessing a limited amount of data .	These criteria favor EM and MM algorithms that separate parameters and data .
First , by reformulating a result of control theory , we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral sensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium , with respect to constant changes of its coefficients .	However , for this equivalence to hold , imaginary changes of the Jacobian 's coefficients have to be allowed .
The spectral profile of the molecules in the trapping field is measured to probe their spatial distribution .	Electrostatic trapping of metastable NH followed by optical pumping of the trapped molecules to the electronic ground state is an important step towards accumulation of these radicals in a magnetic trap .
At least one third of the compact cores are completely unresolved on the longest VLBA baselines , indicating brightness temperatures above 10^ { 11 } K. The unresolved cores tend to have electric vectors that are aligned with the inner jet direction , suggesting the presence of a stationary transverse shock near the base of the jet .	Many of the extended jet regions display exceedingly high fractional polarizations ( & gt ; 50 % ) and electric vectors aligned with the jet ridge line , consistent with optically thin emission from transverse shocks .
We investigate bridging and aggregation of two colloidal particles in a near-critical binary mixture when the fluid far from the particles is outside the coexistence ( CX ) curve and is rich in the component disfavored by the colloid surfaces .	In such situations , the adsorption-induced interaction is enhanced , leading to bridging and aggregation of the particles .
Trends are localized in space and time as they are driven by activity in specific geographic areas that act as sources of traffic and information flow .	Taken independently , trends and geography have been discussed in recent literature on online social media ; although , so far , little has been done to characterize the relation between trends and geography .
Cold reflection provides an acceptable fit to the energy spectrum .	Employing binary geometry to scale the model and assuming companion star reflection , we are able to reconstruct the incident X-rays which are removed from our direct line-of-sight ( presumably by the accretion disk ) .
The radial basis function we select is the Cubic Spline .	We also propose a simple numerical algorithm for finding a finite computational range of an improper integral term in the PIDE so that the accuracy of approximation of the integral can be improved .
Hence an interacting thermal vacuum is a necessary component of the exact real-time formalism .	Consequences for Thermo-field dynamics are discussed .
Such a series are called as Fourier-Laplace series on sphere .	There are a number of works devoted investigation of these expansions in different topologies and for the functions from the various functional spaces .
Individual qubits are characterized by energy level differences $ \Delta_i $ and we take into account a spread of parameters $ \Delta_i $ .	Non-interacting qubits display coherent quantum beatings with N different frequencies , i.e. $ \omega_i=\Delta_i/\hbar $ .
Hence it will be nice if it is possible to get the boundary terms in an efficient manner .	As is well-known , in gauge theory the Ward identity imposes constraints on the form of the amplitude .
The Gaisser-Hillas and Greisen functions work equally well for describing the shower profile .	The Gaussian function is a poor fit .
Visibility is defined by a directed graph ; that is , vertices correspond to players , and a player can see each player to whom she or he is connected by an arc .	The team wins if at least one player guesses his hat color correctly , and no one guesses his hat color wrong ; otherwise the team loses .
In this thesis four separate problems in general relativity are considered , divided into two separate themes : coordinate conditions and perfect fluid spheres .	Regarding coordinate conditions we present a pedagogical discussion of how the appropriate use of coordinate conditions can lead to simplifications in the form of the spacetime curvature -- such tricks are often helpful when seeking specific exact solutions of the Einstein equations .
Applications involving dictionary learning , non-negative matrix factorization , subspace clustering , and parallel factor tensor decomposition tasks motivate well algorithms for per-block-convex and non-smooth optimization problems .	By leveraging the stochastic approximation paradigm and first-order acceleration schemes , this paper develops an online and modular learning algorithm for a large class of non-convex data models , where convexity is manifested only per-block of variables whenever the rest of them are held fixed .

A computed list of H $ _ { 2 } $ $ ^ { 16 } $ O infra-red transition frequencies and intensities is presented .	The list , BT2 , was produced using a discrete variable representation two-step approach for solving the rotation-vibration nuclear motions .
We emphasize relationships between the slope of the power spectrum and its first derivative that are nearly universal among existing slow-roll inflationary models , and show how these relationships can be tested on several scales with new observations .	Among other things , our results give additional motivation for an all-out effort to measure CMB polarization .
On the identifiability question , we show that the knowledge of the output state completely fixes the dynamics up to a `coordinate transformation ' consisting of a multiplication by a phase and a unitary conjugation of the Kraus operators .	When the dynamics depends on an unknown parameter , we show that the latter can be estimated at the `standard ' rate $ n^ { -1/2 } $ , and give an explicit expression of the ( asymptotic ) quantum Fisher information of the output , which is proportional to the Markov variance of a certain `generator ' .
We also show that the difference between the bar fraction distributions as a function of galaxy luminosity ( and mass ) in the field and Coma cluster are statistically significant , with Virgo being an intermediate case .	The fraction of barred galaxies shows a maximum of about 50 % at $ M_r\ , \simeq\ , -20.5 $ in clusters , whereas the peak is shifted to $ M_r\ , \simeq\ , -19 $ in the field .
The nuclear reactions are at the heart of the changes of composition of the baryonic matter in the Universe .	This change of composition , in its turn , has profound consequences on the evolution of stars and galaxies .
We discuss only models with well defined asymptotic states .	For such models the long time , large distance asymptotics of the correlation functions fall into two universality classes .
Here we analyze the microscopic mechanisms underlying discontinuous percolation processes and reveal a strong impact of single link additions .	We show that in generic competitive percolation processes , including those displaying explosive percolation , single links do not induce a discontinuous gap in the largest cluster size in the thermodynamic limit .
Power consumption requirements of the sensor nodes may turn some of these applications impractical .	Hence , implementing efficient encoding schemes are essential to reduce power consumption in such applications .
Conceptually the diference between the InHZ and the Abiotic HZ ( AHZ ) depends on unique and robust properties of life as an emergent physical phenomenon and not necesarily on the particular life forms bearing in the planet .	Our aim here is to provide conceptual basis for the development of InHZ models incorporating consistently life-environment interactions .
The toric version of this result , translated to the realm of convex geometry , thus confirms Ehrhart 's volume conjecture for a large class of rational polytopes , including duals of lattice polytopes .	The case of spherical varieties/multiplicity free symplectic manifolds is also discussed .
Near-infrared photometry ( JHKL 'M ) was obtained for 78 semiregular variables ( SRVs ) in field # 3 of the Palomar-Groningen survey ( PG3 , l=0 , b=-10 ) .	Together with a sample of Miras in this field a comparison is made with a sample of field SRVs and Miras .
Mile the effects of confinement pore polarizability , and discrete channel charge sites have been much studied , the potentially dramatic impact of dipole-lined synthetic pores on electrolytes has seldom been addressed .	Dipole layers naturally occur on the interior surfaces of certain nanopores , leading to intrinsic preference for cations or anions .
The blob lies within a known large overdensity of optical sources in the z=3.07-3.11 range , and is centered on a locally overdense peak within this region .	The best explanation for the copious sub-mm emission is a dust obscured continuum source , which may produce the ionizing flux for the Ly-alpha cloud .
Online social media provide multiple ways to find interesting content .	One important method is highlighting content recommended by user 's friends .
Instead , we demonstrate that it is the violation of long-range translation symmetry inherent in CDMFT-like schemes which opens a gap at Dirac points .	The gap found at small $ U $ therefore does not correspond to a Mott gap .
The oscillator strengths calculated with a Schiff-like dipole transition operator and folded with Lorentzian functions are used to calculate the photoabsorbtion cross section spectra .	The results are further employed to establish the dependence of the plasmon frequency on the number of cluster components .
Swallow is an open-source architecture , designed from the ground up to deliver scalable increases in usable computational power to allow experimentation with many-core applications and the operating systems that support them .	Scalability is enabled by the creation of a tile-able system with a low-latency interconnect , featuring an attractive communication-to-computation ratio and the use of a distributed memory configuration .
For any isotopy class of closed curves $ \gamma $ , we compute the first three derivatives of the length function $ \ell\_\gamma : \mathcal { T } ( S ) \rightarrow\mathbf { R } \_+ $ in the shearing coordinates associated to a maximal geodesic lamination $ \lambda $ .	We show that if $ \gamma $ intersects every leaf of $ \lambda $ , then the Hessian of $ \ell\_\gamma $ is positive-definite .
We include all relevant next -- to -- leading order ( NLO ) QCD corrections and dominant NLO SUSY effects from the gluino .	We find that gluino -- squark corrections to down -- type quark masses induce large NLO corrections to the dominant Wilson coefficients whose size is often similar to those at LO , especially at large $ \tan\beta $ .
These four quantities and the gravity constant G are determined by three measurements units : mass M , length L and time T. Therefore one can form two non-dimensional similarity criteria : $ \Pi_1 $ and $ \Pi_2 $ .	Any chosen observable can be formed as a function of the other three ones .
The study is based on our radio observations performed at the Expanded Very Large Array and at the Green Bank Telescope and on archival infrared datasets , including recent images obtained by the Herschel Space Observatory .	We confirm that the radio central object is characterized by a stellar wind and derive a current mass-loss rate of about 1.4x10-6 Msun yr-1 .
The spatial distribution of radioactive 44Ti , synthesized in an exploding star near the boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and that ejected into the surrounding medium , directly probes the explosion asymmetries .	CassiopeiaA is a young , nearby , core-collapse remnant from which 44Ti emission has previously been detected but not imaged .
In the opposite regime , which is realized for example in the facultatively sexual populations that outcross in only a fraction of reproductive cycles , selection can amplify individual genotypes into large clones .	Such clones emerge when the fitness advantage of some of the genotypes is large enough that they grow to a significant fraction of the population despite being broken down by recombination .

Face recognition is a popular application of pat- tern recognition methods , and it faces challenging problems including illumination , expression , and pose .	The most popular way is to learn the subspaces of the face images so that it could be project to another discriminant space where images of different persons can be separated .
The Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin inequalities play an important role in the study of quantum mechanical processes in Nature , since they provide general limits on the speed of dynamical evolution .	However , to date there has been only one derivation of the Margolus-Levitin inequality .
This paper represents the first in a series presenting a study of a sample of cold front clusters selected from the Chandra , archives with the aim of relating cold fronts to merger activity , understanding the dynamics of mergers and their effect on the cluster constituents .	The Chandra X-ray imagery of Abell 1201 reveals two conspicuous surface brightness discontinuities , which are shown to be cold fronts , and a remnant core structure .
In this paper , we highlight the close connections between these approaches .	We find that the main differences are attributable to the amount of smoothing applied to the counts .

Long GRBs with narrow , energetic jets accelerating particles to ultra-high energies could explain the Auger observations of UHE cosmic rays from sources within 100 Mpc for nano-Gauss intergalactic magnetic fields .	The total energy requirements in a proton synchrotron model are proportional to Gamma^ ( 16/3 ) .
We use numerical simulations to explore whether direct collapse can lead to the formation of SMBH seeds at high-z .	We follow the evolution of gas within DM halos of 2 x 10^8 Mo and 1 kpc .
Alon and Peres provided a general framework for this problem , and showed quantitatively that one can restrict the dilation to be of the form $ f ( n ) X $ where $ f \in \mathbb { Z } [ x ] $ is not constant .	Building upon the work of Alon and Peres , we study this phenomenon in higher dimensions .
For their control we use the information obtained from the ions ' fluorescence .	We demonstrate that by means of this feedback technique , we can transport a predefined number of ions and also split and unify ion crystals .
In this note , we briefly describe a technique which can be used to calculate exact control limits without the use of graphs or tables .	We also describe what are commonly referred to in the literature as fiducial limits .
In this paper , we study non-Gaussianity generated by a single scalar field in slow-roll inflation in the framework of the non-relativistic general covariant Ho\v { r } ava-Lifshitz theory of gravity with the projectability condition and an arbitrary coupling constant $ \lambda $ , where $ \lambda $ characterizes the deviation of the theory from general relativity ( GR ) in the infrared .	We find that the leading effect of self-interaction , in contrary to the case of minimal scenario of GR , is in general of the order $ \hat { \alpha } _ { n } \epsilon^ { 3/2 } $ , where $ \epsilon $ is a slow-roll parameter , and $ \hat { \alpha } _ { n } ( n = 3 , 5 ) $ are the dimensionless coupling coefficients of the six-order operators of the Lifshitz scalar , and have no contributions to power spectra and indices of both scalar and tensor .
In this an equivalent description in terms of a variable speed of light ( VSL ) is given , and the agreement with the four classical tests of general relativity is shown .	Moreover , VSL opens the possibility to write the total energy of a particle as E=mc^2 ; this necessarily leads to the proportionality of inertial and gravitating mass , the equivalence principle .
He & amp ; Yu have given an indicative proof at one-loop level in 4-dimensions .	However , their construct involves the 4th rank Levi-Civita tensor defined only unambiguously in 4-dimensions exactly where the loop integrals diverge .
However by relaxing the hypothesis that the fluctuation spectrum can be described by a single power law , we demonstrate that an Einstein-de Sitter universe with { \em zero } cosmological constant can fit the data as well as the best concordance model .	Moreover unlike a $ \Lambda $ -dominated universe , such an universe has no strong integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect , so is in better agreement with the low quadrupole seen by WMAP .
By generating a low-energy effective model , we unveil the effect of interactions using mean-field analysis : the density of a narrow band around half-filling is anti-correlated with the on-site potential , whereas the density of lower occupied bands follows the potential and strengthens it .	As a result , the states around half-filling are squeezed by the background density , their band becomes flatter , and the compressibility increases .
A simplified thermodynamic approach of the incompressible axisymmetric Euler equations is considered based on the conservation of helicity , angular momentum and microscopic energy .	Statistical equilibrium states are obtained by maximizing the Boltzmann entropy under these sole constraints .
This scalar product depends on the signature ( p , q ) of Clifford algebra .	So , we arrive at unitary spaces on Clifford algebras .
The expected log-likelihood is lower bounded by the negative lp-norm , which allows understanding the generalization ability of probabilistic models .	The exponential of the negative lp-norm is involved in the lower bound of the Bayes error rate , which shows that it is reasonable to use parameters as features in algorithms that rely on metric spaces ( e.g.classification , dimensionality reduction , clustering ) .
Detecting single atoms ( qubits ) is a key requirement for implementing quantum information processing on an atom chip .	The detector should ideally be integrated on the chip .
[ V. Braginsky , Y. I. Vorontsov , and K. P. Thorne , Science 209 , 547 ( 1980 ) ] , allows a back-action free measurement of one quadrature of the cantilever 's motion , and hence the possibility of generating a squeezed state .	We present a complete quantum theory of this system , and derive simple conditions on when the quantum limit on the added noise can be surpassed .
Fouvry and Iwaniec [ FI ] proved that the 1-level density for L-functions attached to imaginary quadratic fields agrees with results predicted by random matrix theory .	In this paper , we show a similar agreement with random matrix theory occurring in more general sequences of number fields .
In this paper , we study some FC single-top quark production processes , $ pp\to t\bar { c } $ and $ pp\to tV $ , at the LHC in the LHT model .	We find that the cross sections of these processes are strongly depended on the mirror quark masses .

Since young stars are also brightest , we can see the spiral structure of other galaxies from afar .	Typically spiral galaxies are copiously observed at redshifts z ~ 1 .
One important benefit of the algorithm is that it allows domain knowledge to be conveniently encoded as a prior distribution to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively .	While it is generally believed that the algorithm 's regret is low ( high ) when the prior is good ( bad ) , little is known about the exact dependence .
We find a new positive feedback mechanism capable of producing shells of H_2 in the intergalactic medium , which are optically thick in some Lyman-Werner bands .	While these shells exist , this feedback effect is important in reducing the H_2 dissociating background flux and the size of photo-dissociation spheres around each luminous object .
Though appropriate for core Internet infrastructure , the Internet Protocol is unsuited to routing within and between emerging ad-hoc edge networks due to its dependence on hierarchical , administratively assigned addresses .	Existing ad-hoc routing protocols address the management problem but do not scale to Internet-wide networks .
The system is described in the Hamiltonian formalism by the mass shell condition and constraints that reduce the number of spin degrees of freedom .	The constraints are second class and are modified into a set of first class constraints by adding combinations of gauge fixing functions .
In the strong coupling limit , a long-range N\'eel order of entangled spin and orbital angular momentum appears in the ground state .	We find that , depending on the relative scales of the spin and orbital gaps , the linear chain follows two distinct routes to reach the N\'eel state .
The kinematics of the different ejections close to XZ Tau reveal a rotating and expanding structure with a southeast-northwest velocity gradient .	The youngest eruptive bubbles unveiled in the optical HST images are inside of this molecular expanding structure .
It is highly transparent to electromagnetic radiation throughout a broad spectral range apart from at one isolated wavelength .	When the structure is superimposed on a metallic mirror it becomes a good broadband reflector everywhere apart from one wavelength where the reflectivity is small .
The latter has been a subject of much interest in recent years .	This conversion of the random phase into the random Cauchy potential is a notable feature of our work .
Sufficient energy resolution is the key issue for the calorimetry in particle and nuclear physics .	The calorimeter of the A4 parity violation experiment at MAMI is a segmented calorimeter where the energy of an event is determined by summing the signals of neighbouring channels .
People may try to find an unified fundamental theory which mainly aims to merge gravity with quantum theory .	However , difficulty in merging those theories self-consistently still exists , and no such theory is generally accepted .
Here , we focus on the study of normal state electronic properties , in particular the temperature and doping dependence of the total density of states , $ A ( \omega ) $ , and of $ A ( \vec { k } , \omega ) $ in different Brillouin zone regions , and compare them to the existing angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( ARPES ) and previous theoretical results in ferropnictides .	We obtain an asymmetric effect of electron and hole doping , quantitative agreement with the experimental chemical potential shifts as a function of doping , as well as spectral weight redistributions near the Fermi level as a function of temperature consistent with the available experimental data .
We propose some illustrative applications to both Bravais ( square , triangular ) and non-Bravais ( graphene , kagom\'e ) lattices , studying both ideal periodic systems and experimental-size and disordered ones .	Some remarkable spectral properties of these atomic artificial lattices are pointed out , such as the emergence of single and multiple gaps , flat bands , and Dirac cones .
We investigate the properties of forced inertial modes of a rotating fluid inside a spherical shell .	Our forcing is tidal like , but its main property is that it is on the large scales .
This paper is concerned with two problems .	One is to count Hitchin bundles on a projective curve and the other is to get an explicit formula for the nilpotent part of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula for a simple test function .
The vertical velocity dispersion of the discs is measured from absorption lines ( near the V-band ) of near-face-on spiral galaxies , with the light coming from a mixed population of giants of all ages .	However , the scale heights for these galaxies are estimated statistically from near-IR surface photometry of edge-on galaxies .
Even though the conformal symmetry is anomalous , this may still provide an explanation of the smallness of electroweak scale compared to the Planck scale .	Specifically we start from a classically conformal model , in which a strongly coupled hidden sector undergoes spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .
Australia Telescope Compact Array HI observations reveal the existence of 5.8x10^8 M_sun of HI gas in the central 7 kpc of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3175 .	The detected HI and CO gas can explain why star formation , as traced by other emission processes , is going on in the inner part of its disk .
In this paper are discussed the results of new numerical experiments on zero distribution of type I Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials of order $ n=200 $ for three different collections of three functions $ [ 1 , f_1 , f_2 ] $ .	These results are obtained by the authors numerically and do not match any of the theoretical results that were proven so far .
We use the first systematic samples of CO millimeter emission in z & gt ; 1 'main-sequence ' star forming galaxies ( SFGs ) to study the metallicity dependence of the conversion factor { \alpha } CO , from CO line luminosity to molecular gas mass .	The molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio of the star formation rate ( SFR ) to CO luminosity , is ~1 Gyr-1 for near-solar metallicity galaxies with stellar masses above M_S~1e11 M_sun .
We develop the theoretical description of this source , and in particular study QCD based processes of strangeness production in the deconfined , thermal quark-gluon plasma phase , allowing for approach to chemical equilibrium and dynamical evolution .	We also address thermal charm production .
Our task is to derive expressions for the $ \beta $ functions valid to all orders .	To this end we use a variety of methods : ( i ) perturbative analysis ; ( ii ) instanton calculus ; ( iii ) analysis of the supercurrent supermultiplet ( the so-called hypercurrent ) and its anomalies , and some other arguments .
A geometrical reformulation of those results is presented .	The present paper proves numerically , using periodic orbits for the Lorentz gas , that SCPR can not hold for isoenergetic ( IE ) stationary states , which have a given total internal energy .
Normal maps between discrete groups $ N\rightarrow G $ were characterized [ FS ] as those which induce a compatible topological group structure on the homotopy quotient $ EN\times_N G $ .	Here we deal with topological group ( or loop ) maps $ N\rightarrow G $ being normal in the same sense as above and hence forming a homotopical analogue to the inclusion of a topological normal subgroup in a reasonable way .
The study of exoplanetary atmospheres is one of the most exciting and dynamic frontiers in astronomy .	Over the past two decades ongoing surveys have revealed an astonishing diversity in the planetary masses , radii , temperatures , orbital parameters , and host stellar properties of exoplanetary systems .
We present the full details of a calculation at next-to-leading order of the momentum diffusion coefficient of a heavy quark in a hot , weakly coupled , QCD plasma .	Corrections arise at O ( g_s ) ; physically they represent interference between overlapping scatterings , as well as soft , electric scale ( p ~ gT ) gauge field physics , which we treat using the hard thermal loop ( HTL ) effective theory .
Then the fundamental rank of $ G $ is $ 2 , $ and according to the conjecture made in \cite { BV } , lattices in $ G $ should have 'little ' -- - in the very weak sense of 'subexponential in the co-volume ' -- - torsion homology .	Using base change , we exhibit sequences of lattices where the torsion homology grows exponentially with the \emph { square root } of the volume .
The latter is naturally incorporated by embedding the theory into a spontaneously broken SU ( N|N ) super-gauge theory , which guarantees finiteness to all orders in perturbation theory .	The effective action , from which one extracts the physics , can be computed whilst manifestly preserving gauge invariance at each and every step .
Abelian and center gauges are considered in continuum Yang-Mills theory in order to detect the magnetic monopole and center vortex content of gauge field configurations .	Specifically we examine the Laplacian Abelian and center gauges , which are free of Gribov copies , as well as the center gauge analog of the ( Abelian ) Polyakov gauge .
We define the Sylow graph $ \Gamma_A ( G ) $ of the group $ G $ , with set of vertices $ \pi ( G ) $ , as follows : Two vertices $ p , q\in\pi ( G ) $ form an edge of $ \Gamma_A ( G ) $ if either $ q\in\pi ( A_p ( G ) ) $ or $ p\in \pi ( A_q ( G ) ) $ .	The following result is obtained : Theorem : Let $ G $ be a finite almost simple group .

In a nonextensive scenario , these indices are quantities that measure the degree of nonextensivity present in the system .	Recent studies reveal that the index $ q $ is correlated to the formation rate of high-energy tails present in the distribution of rotation velocity .
To demonstrate this , a Boltzmann-Poisson transport model of miniband superlattices with inelastic collisions is proposed and hydrodynamic equations for electron density , electric field and the complex amplitude of the Bloch oscillations are derived by singular perturbation methods .	For appropriate parameter ranges , numerical solutions of these equations show stable Bloch oscillations with spatially inhomogeneous field , charge , current density and energy density profiles .
In general , subgrid scale techniques consist in the addition of a residual based term to the basic Galerkin formulation .	The application of a standard residual based stabilization method to a linear eigenvalue problem leads to a quadratic eigenvalue problem in discrete form which is physically inconvenient .

We have conducted an LTE abundance analysis for SAO 40039 a warm post-AGB star whose spectrum is known to show surprisingly strong He I lines for its effective temperature and has been suspected of being H-deficient and He-rich .	High-resolution optical spectra are analyzed using a family of model atmospheres with different He/H ratios .
CFFs have been of interest for a long time both in discrete mathematics as part of block design theory , and in theoretical computer science where they have found a variety of applications , for example , in parametrized algorithms where they were introduced in the recent breakthrough work of Fomin , Lokshtanov and Saurabh under the name `lopsided universal sets ' .	In this paper we give the first explicit construction of cover-free families of optimal size up to lower order multiplicative terms , { for any $ r $ and $ s $ } .

The three-dimensional secular behavior of a system composed of a central star and two massive planets is modeled semi-analytically in the frame of the general three-body problem .	The main dynamical features of the system are presented in geometrical pictures allowing us to investigate a large domain of the phase space of this problem without time-expensive numerical integrations of the equations of motion and without any restriction on the magnitude of the planetary eccentricities , inclinations and mutual distance .
Massive photon-like particles are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model .	They have interactions similar to the photon , are vector bosons , and can be produced together with photons .
The major novel element of our proposal is the optimally reconstructed 'first integral ' approximation to the recurrence relation defining the scalar majorizing sequence .	Compared to the previous results of Argyros , it enables one to obtain a weaker convergence condition that leads to a better bound on the location of the solution of the equation F ( x ) =0 and allows for a wider choice of initial guesses .
Otherwise , the flow may be unstable .	We use the sonic point analysis to study the solution .
It is also generally assumed that planets form in protoplanetary discs like those observed in nearby star forming regions .	On what timescale does the transformation from discs to planets occur ?
We show that the lightcone worldsheet formalism , constructed to represent the sum of the bare planar diagrams of scalar \phi^3 field theory , survives the renormalization procedure in space-time dimensions D not greater than 6 .	Specifically this means that all the counter-terms , necessary to produce a successful renormalized perturbation expansion to all orders , can be represented as local terms in the lightcone worldsheet action .
The double-peaked RC is inconsistent with a tilted bar morphology .	Most of our fields show the two RCs at roughly constant distance with longitude , which is also inconsistent with a tilted bar , although an underlying bar may be present .

The families $ \mathcal { P } _ { n , n , n } $ and $ \mathcal { P } _ { n , r , n } $ describe permutations of $ [ n ] $ and $ r $ -partial permutations of $ [ n ] $ , respectively .
The spectra provide a potentially powerful test of the inflationary hypothesis ; they are not independent but instead are linked by consistency relations reflecting their origin from a single inflationary potential .	To lowest-order in a perturbation expansion there is a single , now familiar , relation between the tensor spectral index and the relative amplitude of the spectra .
The new combinatorial interpretations involve the notions of flag excedance and descent in the wreath product $ \ZZ_r \wr \mathfrak { S } _n $ .	A related result on the derangement polynomial for $ \ZZ_r \wr \mathfrak { S } _n $ , studied by Chow and Mansour , is also derived from results of Linusson , Shareshian and Wachs on the homology of Rees products of posets .

In fact , the structure of the kinetic mechanism makes half of the decay times vanish identically from the turnover time distribution .	The terms that cancel out correspond to the eigenvalues of a certain sub-matrix of the master equation matrix for the first exit time problem .
It starts from the Smoluchowski equation of interacting Brownian particles in a given shear flow , derives generalized Green-Kubo relations , which contain the transients dynamics formally exactly , and closes the equations using mode coupling approximations .	Shear thinning of colloidal fluids and dynamical yielding of colloidal glasses arise from a competition between a slowing down of structural relaxation , because of particle interactions , and enhanced decorrelation of fluctuations , caused by the shear advection of density fluctuations .
In the paper , we generalize the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem in the setting of uniform spaces .	At first , we recall well-known facts and theorems coming from monographs of Kelley and Willard .
Mass is constantly being recycled in the universe .	One of the most powerful recycling paths is via stellar mass-loss .
The study of such a large sample of X-ray selected AGN with a high quality multi-wavelength coverage from the far-infrared ( now with the inclusion of Herschel data at 100 micron and 160 micron ) to the optical-UV allows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities , bolometric corrections and Eddington ratios .	The kbol-Lbol relations derived in the present work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable AGN sample , and rely on observed redshifts , X-ray luminosities and column density distributions .
This is typically attributed to the existence of dark matter , which possesses mass but does not radiate ( or absorb radiation ) .	Alternatively , the mismatch can be explained if the underlying dynamics is not Newtonian .
The task is to determine a feasible schedule on a minimum number of machines .	We rigorously study this problem and derive various algorithms with small constant competitive ratios for interesting restricted problem variants .
sandpile model which had exponential waiting time PDFs .	However , it is not sufficient to distinguish between turbulence , some other SOC-like models , and other red noise sources .
Since both a direct approach based on distribution-valued operators and a limit process starting from a non-singular flux tube , i.e.of finite size , fail , an alternative method is applied leading to consistent results .	An essential feature is quantum mechanical supersymmetry at g=2 which imposes , by proper representation , the correct choice of `` boundary conditions '' .
In this paper , we view registers as elements of a finite field and we compute linear permutations without memory .	We first determine the maximum complexity of a linear function when only linear instructions are allowed .
We propose and analyze the concept of the vertical hot-electron terahertz ( THz ) graphene-layer detectors ( GLDs ) based on the double-GL and multiple-GL structures with the barrier layers made of materials with a moderate conduction band off-set ( such as tungsten disulfide and related materials ) .	The operation of these detectors is enabled by the thermionic emissions from the GLs enhanced by the electrons heated by incoming THz radiation .
In this paper we classify all reflection arrangements which belong to the smaller class of recursively free arrangements .	Moreover for the case that $ W $ admits an irreducible factor isomorphic to $ G_ { 31 } $ we obtain a new ( computer free ) proof for the non-inductive freeness of $ \mathcal { A } ( W ) $ .
An argument is given which demonstrates that at higher orders in g the classical description of the process breaks down .	As an application , we calculate the energy , number , and multiplicity distributions of produced soft gluons and reproduce earlier results by Gunion and Bertsch and by Kovner , McLerran , and Weigert .
The scheme associates , with every `experimentally accessible ' system , a symplectic superalgebra and operates essentially as noncommutative Hamiltonian mechanics incorporating the extra condition that the sets of observables and pure states be mutually separating .	The latter condition serves to smoothly connect the algebraically defined quantum systems to ilbert space-based ones ; the rigged Hilbert space - based Dirac bra-ket formalism naturally appears .
However , the users are not domain experts and quite often enter values that do not match precisely the underlying data .	Samsung makes 46- or 55- inch led tvs , but not 50-inch ones .
In this paper we define the notion of survivability : Given a random initial condition , what is the likelihood that the transient behaviour of a deterministic system leaves the region of desirable states .	In three conceptual examples we show that this basic measure captures notions of fundamental interest for climate models , transient chaos , and synchronisation .

The best gravitational lenses for detecting distant galaxies are those with the largest mass concentrations and the most advantageous configurations of that mass along the line of sight .	Our new method for finding such gravitational telescopes uses optical data to identify projected concentrations of luminous red galaxies ( LRGs ) .
We study the nonlinear dynamics of a warped or twisted accretion disc , in which the viscosity coefficients are assumed to be locally proportional to the rotational velocity ( beta- prescription ) .	Using asymptotic methods for thin discs , dynamical equations of the disc are obtained in a warped spherical polar coordinates .
We propose an $ SO ( 10 ) $ supersymmetric grand unified theory ( SUSY GUT ) , where the $ SO ( 10 ) $ gauge symmetry breaks down to $ SU ( 3 ) _c \times SU ( 2 ) _L \times U ( 1 ) _Y\times U ( 1 ) _ { X } $ at the GUT scale and $ U ( 1 ) _X $ is radiatively broken at the SUSY-braking scale .	In order to achieve the observed Higgs mass around $ 126 $ GeV and also to satisfy constraints on flavor- and/or CP-violating processes , we assume that the SUSY-breaking scale is $ O ( 100 ) $ TeV , so that the $ U ( 1 ) _X $ breaking scale is also $ O ( 100 ) $ TeV .
On the other hand , it has been shown that the smoothing of the shock front could lower the acceleration efficiency .	These controversies motivated us to investigate numerically by Monte Carlo simulations the particle acceleration efficiency in oblique modified shocks .
Computations are carried out via a parallel high-order finite-differences code .	Due to the presence of a gradient of pressure in the model equations , waves hitting the obstacle may impart acceleration to it .
The fundamental factor to this is the increasingly growing size of the datasets available and needed in the information sciences .	To address this , in this work we propose to use structured random compression , that is , random projections that exploit the data structure , for two NMF variants : classical and separable .
In particular , this paper addresses the problem of encoding a Bernoulli ( 0.5 ) source : for randomly generated LDGM codes with suitably irregular degree distributions , our methods yield performance very close to the rate distortion limit over a range of rates .	Our approach is inspired by the survey propagation ( SP ) algorithm , originally developed by Mezard et al .
In the lithography process , a thin adhesion layer , typically titanium , is used to promote the adhesion of the gold nanowires to the substrate .	Here , we demonstrate that such an adhesion layer plays a vital role in the electrical transport behavior of electromigrated tunnel junctions .
The mid-infrared is an optimal window to trace stellar mass in nearby galaxies and the 3.6 $ \mu m $ IRAC band has been exploited to this effect , but such mass estimates can be biased by dust emission .	We present our pipeline to reveal the old stellar flux at 3.6 $ \mu m $ and obtain stellar mass maps for more than 1600 galaxies available from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies ( S $ ^ { 4 } $ G ) .
We continue the investigation of locally testable codes , i.e. , error-correcting codes for whom membership of a given word in the code can be tested probabilistically by examining it in very few locations .	We give two general results on local testability : First , motivated by the recently proposed notion of { \em robust } probabilistically checkable proofs , we introduce the notion of { \em robust } local testability of codes .
In this paper , we prove that inequality $ q_1 ( G ) + q_2 ( G ) & lt ; = e ( G ) +3 $ is tighter for the graph $ S_ { n } ^ { + } $ among all firefly graphs and also tighter to $ S_ { n } ^ { + } $ than to the graphs $ K_ { k } \vee \overline { K_ { n-k } } $ recently presented by Ashraf , Omidi and Tayfeh-Rezaie .	Also , we conjecture that the same inequality is tighter to $ S_ { n } ^ { + } $ than any other graph on $ n $ vertices .
In particular , critical Casimir forces have been measured for surfaces consisting of stripes with periodically alternating adsorption preferences , forming chemical steps between them .	Motivated by these experiments , we analyze the contribution of such chemical steps to the critical Casimir force for the film geometry and within the Ising universality class .
When $ k & gt ; 2 ( N-M ) $ , the theory flows to a superconformal fixed point in the IR .	Theories with $ k & lt ; 2 ( N-M ) $ , on the other hand , flows to strong coupling .
The non-perturbative behavior of the N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is both highly non-trivial and tractable .	In the last three years the valuable progress was achieved in the instanton counting , the direct evaluation of the low-energy effective Wilsonian action of the theory .
Such parameters must be chosen carefully to yield initial data with the desired physical properties .	In this paper , we examine these choices in detail for the quasiequilibrium method coupled to apparent-horizon/quasiequilibrium boundary conditions .
Molecular phylogeny has focused mainly on improving models for the reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alignments .	Yet , most phylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species .
Then we give an explicit form of sharp two-sided estimates on the Green functions of these subordinate Brownian motions in any bounded $ C^ { 1,1 } $ open set .	As a consequence , we prove the boundary Harnack inequality for $ X $ on any $ C^ { 1,1 } $ open set with explicit decay rate .
We study two classes of states in detail : Class A is a one parameter family of states which are the superposition of the highest energy and lowest energy states , and Class B states which are the linear combinations of the symmetric and the antisymmetric Bell states .	Our results for an initial Bell state are similar to those obtained before for the same model derived under the Born-Markov approximation .
These probabilities are important in many fields of study , including statistics , finance , and engineering , as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory .	In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics , the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein 's theory of fluctuations .
Nevertheless , few approaches have proposed a framework to combine agile and component-based development , allowing an application to be tested throughout the entire development cycle .	To address this problematic , we have built CALICO , a model-based framework that allows applications to be safely developed in an iterative and incremental manner .

The X-ray isophotes are oriented similarly to the optical isophotes of the central cD galaxy and to the isopleths of the galaxy distribution in the cluster , but are otherwise quite regular , suggesting that this cluster is reasonably relaxed and in hydrostatic equilibrium .	The merged HRI and PSPC surface brightness profile is not adequately fit by a beta model because of the central X-ray surface brightness peak , indicating the presence of a cooling flow .
A quantitative estimate of this effect is successfully applied to the blazar 3C279 .	Our prediction can be tested with the satellite-borne Fermi/LAT detector as well as with the ground-based IACTs H.E.S.S. , MAGIC , CANGAROOIII , VERITAS and the Extensive Air Shower arrays ARGO-YBJ andMILAGRO .
In this paper we propose to use a search strategy that adaptively directs computational resources to sub-regions likely to contain objects .	Compared to methods based on fixed anchor locations , our approach naturally adapts to cases where object instances are sparse and small .

Interestingly , our analysis provides a reduction method that is valid regardless of whether or not the system is isotropic .	We provide the linear harmonic chain as a prototypical example .
Incorporating both strong spin-orbit coupling and the Hubbard repulsion on Re leads to a band structure consistent with ab initio calculations .	Using our model , we find a large spin polarization at the Fermi level , and obtain a semi-quantitative understanding of the saturation magnetization of Ba2FeReO6 , as well as X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data indicating a significant orbital magnetization .
We show that the scattering map $ S : u\mapsto r $ is real-analytic with real-analytic inverse .	To do so , we exploit a natural complexification of the scattering map associated with the ZS-AKNS system .
On every finite time interval , its distribution is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the unconditioned process .	A martingale problem characterization is also given .
The evolution of the dissipative state in such system is a complex process .	It starts as an avalanche process characterized by nucleation , growth , and thermal destruction of such dissipative elements as continuous conducting chains of particles as well as electroconvective vortices .
In the temperature range 293 K & lt ; T & lt ; 400 K a highly anisotropic quasielastic diffuse scattering is observed .	Above 400 K this scattering disappears .
The high viscosity case , which corresponds to a dwarf nova in outburst , shows a optically thick BL which after one Keplerian rotation period ( t_K=19s ) extends more than 30 degrees to either side of the disk plane .	The BL is optically thick and thus occludes part of the star .
Scattering is produced by magnetic micro-turbulence driven by the current carried by returning particles , which had not been considered till now , but turns out to be more intense than Weibel 's one around the transition .	The current is also responsible for a buffer effect on the motion of the incoming flow , on which the threshold for the onset of turbulence depends .
We show that in the presence of a harmonically varying magnetic field the fundamental or $ f $ -mode in a stratified layer is altered in such a way that it fans out in the diagnostic $ k\omega $ diagram , but with mode power also within the fan .	In our simulations , the surface is defined by a temperature and density jump in a piecewise isothermal layer .

For length scales $ \delta $ larger than a characteristic scale $ \delta^* $ , we find that the distribution of the height increments $ \Delta h = h ( x+ \delta ) -h ( x ) $ is Gaussian .	Self-affinity enters through the scaling of the standard deviation $ \sigma $ , which is proportional to $ \delta^\zeta $ with a unique roughness exponent .
Some technical problems which appear in the calculations are discussed .	An interpretation of the theory as a particular D=2 higher-derivative $ \sigma $ -model is given .
Two of them are straightforward generalizations of the two-gap order parameter while the third one corresponds to a time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter , altogether absent within the two-band model .	Potential observation of such a genuinely frustrated state would be a particularly vivid manifestation of the repulsive interactions being at the root of iron-based high temperature superconductivity .
These relations are applied to estimate the change in mean frequency for the cycle 21 and 23 .	A remarkable agreement between the calculated and observed frequency shifts for the ascending phase of cycle 23 indicates that the derived relations are independent of epoch and do not change significantly from cycle to cycle .
Additionally the exact form of the associated mass distributions P ( m ) is derived .	Using these results we show examplary the exactness of the mean-field ansatz for monomial fraction densities $ \phi ( r ) = ( n-1 ) r^ { n-2 } $ with $ n \geq 2 $ .
In the neutral envelope , the NI permitted lines are excited by fluorescence , and almost all the OI lines are excited by recombination .	Electron excitation produces the forbidden optical lines of OI , but continuum fluorescence excites most of the NI forbidden line intensities .
Existing experimental results on the wide Tc variation in the single layer cuprate families , such as the low Tc ( $ \approx 38 K , 33 K $ ) of LSCO and Bi-2201 compared to high Tc ( $ \approx 95 K , 98 K $ ) of Tl-2201 and Hg-1201 , the strain induced increase in Tc ( 25 to 50 K ) observed in LSCO are qualitatively explained by our mechanism .	We predict that under proper epitaxial strain the Tc of LSCO and Bi-2201 should increase from 30 's all the way upto the intrinsic Tc $ \sim $ 90 K , at optimal doping .

Such violations trigger adaptation mechanisms that prevent the violations to occur and/or to propagate their effect in the choreography .	Our model is equipped with local and global mechanisms for reacting to security violations ; type soundness results ensure that global protocols are still correctly executed , while the system adapts itself to preserve security .
Expansion of an analytical expression for $ A_ { \rm loop } $ obtained for the model system in the low-force regime revealed that there is a new scaling exponent associated with force ( $ A_ { \rm loop } \approx \nu^ { -1 } F^ { 2.5 } $ ) , which has been validated by high-precision numerical calculation .	By a combination of analytical and numerical arguments , we also deduce that for large but finite $ L $ , the exponents are robust and independent of temperature and friction coefficient .

We find and study a variety of the spectral-temporal behavior during the decay phase of long and bright GRB pulses .	Even though only a small fraction of observed bursts exhibit such pulses , these are of interest to study as they reflect individual emission episodes during the burst .
The code can treat an arbitrary number of fluid shells ( representing baryons ) and collisionless shells ( representing cold dark matter ) .	As a test of the code , we reproduce analytic solutions for the pulsation behavior of a polytrope and for the self-similar collapse of a spherically symmetric , cosmological perturbation .
A theorem is presented , allowing to infer from an approximate solution the existence of an exact solution .	According to this theorem , the interval of existence of the exact solution and the distance of the latter from the approximate solution can be evaluated solving a one-dimensional `` control '' integral equation , where the unknown gives a bound on the previous distance as a function of time .

For downlink transmitter options , the study considers zero-forcing ( ZF ) and maximum ratio transmission ( MRT ) , while for uplink receiver options it considers ZF and maximum ratio combining ( MRC ) .
However , scalar field , inside the matter , has characteristics like gravitation permeability of material similar electromagnetic permeability of material in Maxwell theories of electromagnetism .	Investigation of obtained exact solutions for given functions of a matter distributions in the Newtonian limit of Jordan , Brance - Dicke theory show the efficient value of gravitation constant depends on density of matter , sizes and form of object , as well as on the value of theories coupling constant .
To quantify the clustering , we derive positive pair correlations and fractal dimensions that hold for scales smaller than $ l_0 $ .	Statistics of the number of particles in a small volume are non-Poissonian manifesting deviations from the case of uncorrelated particles .
The Navier -- Stokes equations can be reformulated in terms of so-called magnetization variables $ w $ that satisfy \begin { equation } \label { Abs_magform } \partial_tw + ( \mathbb { P } w \cdot\nabla ) w + ( \nabla \mathbb { P } w ) ^\top w - \mathrm { \Delta } w =0 , \end { equation } and relate to the classical velocity $ u $ via a Leray projection $ u=\mathbb { P } w $ .	Working on the 3-dimensional torus , we review how this is an equivalent formulation for classical solutions .
We find that the lowest order vertex correction , which is the first non-trivial correlation contribution , is finite , and about 30 % of the RPA result at strong coupling $ \alpha \sim 1 $ .	The vertex correction leads to further reduction of the effective charge .
The final tally is as follows : 54 M dwarfs , 25 sdK and sdM subdwarfs , 14 esdK and esdM extreme subdwarfs , and 11 DA and DC white dwarfs .	Among the most interesting cases , we find one star to be the coolest subdwarf ever reported ( LSR2036+5059 , with spectral type sdM7.5 ) , a new M9.0 dwarf only about 6pc distant ( LSR1835+3259 ) , and a new M6.5 dwarf only 7pc from the Sun ( LSR2124+4003 ) .
This work is focused on the phase diagrams and physical properties of Y-doped and Lu-doped EuMnO3 .	The differences in the corresponding phase boundaries in the ( x , T ) phase diagram could be overcome by considering a scaling of the Y3+ and Lu3+ concentrations to the tolerance factor .
The partition function of the theory in the Omega-background can be calculated explicitly .	We investigate various representations for this partition function : a statistical sum over random partitions , a partition function of the ensemble of random curves , a free fermion correlator .
This paper introduces the method in the context of the pure anharmonic oscillator and then goes on to apply it to the case of tunneling between both symmetric and asymmetric minima .	It concludes with an introduction to the extension of these methods to the discussion of a quantum field theory .
In the case that $ \sM $ is not of type \threeonec the family of partial isometries can be replaced by a family of unitaries in \cMp One can not expect to have this result in the usual integration thoery .	To have a similar result , one needs to bring in some kind of non-commutativity .
In particular , we study the random electric potential model , as well as a mixed disorder case .	We also clarify the supersymmetric alternative derivation , even though it proves less efficient than the replica treatment for such thermodynamic quantities .
Coherent diffraction imaging ( CDI ) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a major goal for the x-ray free electron lasers ( XFELs ) .	However , during an imaging pulse , the fast laser-induced ionization may strongly affect the recorded diffraction pattern of the irradiated sample .
Further we compute the quantum rank of simple representations .	We also show that the quantum semi-group is `` Zariski '' dense in the quantum group .
We present the X-ray analysis of a deep ~200 ksec Chandra observation of the compact steep spectrum radio-loud quasar 3C 186 ( z=1.06 ) and investigate the contribution of the unresolved radio jet to the total X-ray emission .	The spectral analysis is not conclusive on the origin of the bulk of the X-ray emission .
For the MGS , results suggest a small and positive tail index $ \xi $ , effectively ruling out the possibility of having a finite maximum cutoff luminosity , and implying that the luminosity distribution function may decay as a power law at the high luminosity end .	Assuming , however , $ \xi=0 $ , a non-parametric comparison of the maximal luminosities with the Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel distribution ( limit distribution for variables distributed by the Schechter fit ) indicates a good agreement provided uncertainties arising both from the finite batch size and from the batch size distribution are accounted for .
Feature selection is an indispensable preprocessing step when mining huge datasets that can significantly improve the overall system performance .	Therefore in this paper we focus on a hybrid approach of feature selection .
Precise interferometric fringe visibility measurements were obtained over seven spectral channels dispersed across the H band with the four-telescope VLTI/PIONIER interferometer .	Thorough analysis of interferometric data was performed to measure the stellar angular diameter and to search for circumstellar material .
In this formalism , the source of Kerr nonlinearity is the interplay of optical fields that cooperatively drive the transition from valence to conduction band .	This formalism makes it possible to identify and compute the rates of distinct nonlinear processes that contribute to the Kerr nonlinear refractive index coefficient .
Later , Maxwell ( 1983 ) interpreted Boyd 's construction in terms of root systems in Lorentz space .	In particular , he showed that the space-like weight vectors correspond to a ball packing if and only if the associated Coxeter graph is of `` level $ 2 $ . ''
Similarly , the mass function is a single power law dN/dM propto M^beta with beta=-2.10+/-0.20 for clusters with ages t & lt ; 3x10^8 yr , corresponding to lower mass limits that range from 10^4 to 10^5 Msun , depending on the age range of the subsample .	Hence the power law indices for the luminosity and mass functions are essentially the same .
We then consider the effects of varying the cluster velocity dispersion , the relative importance of binaries versus single stars , different stellar host masses , and finite starting eccentricities of the planetary orbits .	For each state of the initial system , we perform an ensemble of numerical scattering experiments and determine the cross sections for eccentricity increase , inclination angle increase , planet ejection , and capture .

We use finite size scaling to study Ising spin glasses in two spatial dimensions .	The issue of universality is addressed by comparing discrete and continuous probability distributions for the quenched random couplings .
The asymptotic behaviors of vector fields generating diffeomorphism of the manifold with boundaries are discussed .	In order to get more precise estimation for the `` central extension '' of the algebra , it is analyzed in the Newman-Penrose formalism and shown that the `` central extension '' for a large class of vector fields is always zero on the Killing horizon .
By rigorous asymptotic analysis we show that the sharp-interface limit of this model recovers the continuum model equations for the Grinfeld instability .	Moreover , we use our approach to derive hitherto unknown sharp-interface equations for a situation including a field of body forces .
A larger ratio of the sound horizon to the photon diffusion length follows , implying a smaller inferred Neff .	This neutrino-mass/recombination effect depends strongly on the neutrino rest masses .
The Kummer case ( when $ K $ contains $ \mu_ { m } $ ) is easy since it is almost an application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem .	In this note , we solve this problem completely in general case , and give three versions of bound , one is with \GRH , and the other two are unconditional bounds .
104 , 226803 ( 2010 ) ] .	We perform a detailed study of this effect and the related adiabatic Coulomb blockade spectroscopy , and , in particular , extend it to spin pumping .
Our mechanism also leads naturally to amplification of the standard-model Z-boson field due to its coupling to the electroweak Higgs field .	At preheating , the spectrum of the Z field is transferred to the hypercharge field , which remains frozen in the plasma and is converted into a magnetic field at the electroweak phase transition .
$ \N=1 $ supersymmetric field theories on this non-commutative space ( such theories are called $ \N=1/2 $ supersymmetric theories . )	can be reduced to supermatrix models as in hep-th/0303210 \cite { KKM } .
Our sample consists of 20 GRB absorbers and a comparison sample of 72 QSO-DLAs with redshift 1.2 & lt ; z & lt ; 4.0 and down to Z = 0.002 Z_Sol metallicities .	The dust-to-metal ratio in QSO- and GRB-DLAs increases both with metallicity and metal column density , spanning ~10 -- 110 % of the Galactic value and pointing to a non universal dust-to-metal ratio .
Moreover , the subclass of norm-complete Riesz MV-algebras is equivalent with the class of commutative unital C $ ^* $ -algebras .	The propositional calculus $ { \mathbb R } { \cal L } $ that has Riesz MV-algebras as models is a conservative extension of \L ukasiewicz $ \infty $ -valued propositional calculus and it is complete with respect to evaluations in the standard model $ [ 0,1 ] $ .
A multi-spin interaction is used to capture the competition between local and global satisfaction of constraints characteristic for geometric frustration .	We define an athermal dynamics designed to model repeated taps of a given strength .
Our results suggest that galaxies in dense environments have either ( i ) consumed their molecular gas via star formation in the past or ( ii ) that dense environments leads to an inhibition of molecular gas from atomic phase .	The similarities in star formation efficiency of the dense environments and field galaxies suggest that the physical processes controling the formation of stars from the molecular gas are local rather than global .
We develop oracle and adaptivity inequalities , as well as model selection properties , that hold under continuity of the transition probabilities and polynomial $ \beta $ -mixing .	In particular , model misspecification is allowed .
The selection problem consists in selecting the $ k $ -th smallest element from an array of size $ n $ , called $ k $ -th order statistic .	We focus on calculating the median of a sample , the $ n/2 $ -th order statistic .
However , to the best knowledge of the authors , a quantitative analysis of the cost of such networks is yet to be undertaken .	This paper develops a theoretic framework that enables computation of the deployment cost of a network ( modeled using various spatial point processes ) to answer the question posed by the paper 's title .
In order to understand nature of building blocks of galaxies in the early universe , we investigate `` genuine irregular galaxies ( GIGs ) '' in the nearby universe .	Here , GIGs are defined as isolated galaxies without regular structures ( spheroid , bulge , disk , bar , spiral arm , and nucleus ) .
Under an additional hypothesis , which is satisfied by all uniformly quasiregular maps , this bound can be improved to be the same as those in a Baker domain of a transcendental entire function .	We construct a quasiregular map of transcendental type from $ \mathbb { R } ^3 $ to $ \mathbb { R } ^3 $ with a periodic domain in which all iterates tend locally uniformly to infinity .
Our algorithm computes an approximation of the log-determinant in time near-linear with respect to the number of non-zero entries and with high probability .	This algorithm builds upon the utra-sparsifiers introduced by Spielman and Teng for Laplacian matrices and ultimately uses their refined versions introduced by Koutis , Miller and Peng in the context of solving linear systems .
Single and collective cellular oscillations involving the actomyosin cytoskeleton have been observed in numerous biological systems .	We show here that a generic model of a contractile material , which is turning over and contracts against an elastic element , exhibits spontaneous oscillations .
Some rigorous bounds on the condition number of the associated linear problem are derived .	On the basis of these bounds and some experimentation it is argued that domain wall fermions will in general be associated with a condition number that is of the same order of magnitude as the { \it product } of the condition number of the linear problem in the physical dimensions by the inverse bare quark mass .
A challenging task then was proving existence of this unconventional mechanism and a wealth of possibilities , with a rigor acceptable in standard condensed matter physics , in a microscopic theory and develop suitable many body techniques .	Shortly , a paper by Anderson , Zou and us ( BZA ) undertook this task and initiated a program .
We investigate the equilibrium supercurrent noise and evaluate the electron-electron interaction correction to the Josephson current across superconducting contacts .	At T=0 this correction is found to vanish for fully transparent contacts indicating the absence of Coulomb effects in this limit .
We discuss the applicable parameter range of the reweighting method for models which have more than one simulation parameter .	The applicability range is determined by the fluctuations of the modification factor of the Boltzmann weight .
We report on the high energy spectrum of the source , concentrating on cyclotron resonant scattering features .	The spectrum is strongly pulse phase dependent and absorption features are detected at virtually all phases .
Numerical results for the additive white Gaussian noise ( AWGN ) channel with various inputs show that , at high signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , the amplitude and phase terms dominate the mixed terms .	For the AWGN channel with a Gaussian input , analytical expressions are derived for high SNR .
We show that the retrograde rotation of the debris stars at $ \sim -100 $ km/s accords with a recently discovered , large radial velocity stream at $ \sim 300 $ km/s towards the Galactic longitude of $ \sim 270^\circ $ .	These stars also contribute , only in part , to a reported retrograde motion of the outer halo at the North Galactic Pole .
This study is carried on within the frame of linear elasticity by using the unfolding method .	It is based on several decompositions of the structure displacements and on the passing to the limit in fixed domains .
Biological databases can be analysed as a complex network which may reveal some its underlying biological mechanisms .	Frequently , such databases are identified as scale-free networks or as hierarchical networks depending on connectivity distributions or clustering coefficients .
We give a brief outline in Section 0 .	We give a more detailed plan in Sections 1-5 .
Recent studies suggest that the helium content of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters ( GCs ) is not uniform .	The range of helium varies from cluster to cluster with more massive GCs having , preferentially , large helium spread .
The evidence of the blob with almost similar shape and velocity concurrent in H $ \alpha $ and TRACE 171 \AA\ supports its formation by multi-temperature plasma .	The energy release by a recurrent 3-D reconnection process via the separator dome below the magnetic null point , between the emerging flux and pre-existing field lines in the lower solar atmosphere , is found to be the driver of a radial velocity pulse outwards that accelerates this plasma blob in the solar atmosphere .
The logarithmic growth of resistance for both the systems confirms the presence of the Kondo effect in the two respective temperature ranges .	The two-scale behavior is explained by consecutive splitting of Ce ion levels in the crystal field .
We reconsider the Standard Model interactions of ultra-high energy neutrinos with matter .	The next to leading order QCD corrections are presented for charged-current and neutral-current processes .
These experiments directly detect the possible existence of the chargon - a charge $ e $ spinless boson - in the insulator .	The effects described in this paper provide a means to probing whether the undoped cuprate ( despite it 's magnetism ) is fractionalized .
The results of investigation of the processing in the vortical magnetic field ( PVMF ) and its effect on the structure of the natural magnetite Fe3O4 and the SnO2 films were presented .	The methods of M & amp ; # 246 ; ssbauer and X-ray spectroscopy were used .
We identify SDSS J010657.39-100003.3 ( hereafter J0106-1000 ) as the shortest period detached binary white dwarf ( WD ) system currently known .	We targeted J0106-1000 as part of our radial velocity program to search for companions around known extremely low-mass ( ELM , ~ 0.2 Msol ) WDs using the 6.5m MMT .
In current services , users however have to give up their location privacy in order to acquire the service .	The literature features a large number of contributions which aim at enhancing user privacy in location-based services .
For small values of the magnetic field they possess localized closed string tachyons analogous to the Nielsen-Olesen instability of a constant magnetic field in SO ( 3 ) Yang-Mills theory .	When the magnetic field is embedded in the SO ( 32 ) gauge group of the heterotic string it is possible to study the lowest level tachyon in supergravity .
In particular all systems must include an auxiliary detector that monitors any incoming light .	We show that such counter-measures can be efficient , provided enough additional privacy amplification is applied to the data .
It was observed that at the utmost degree of disorder , the Raman spectra lines disappear which is accompanied by the exponential increase of resistance and change in the current-voltage characteristics.These effects are explained by suggestion that highly disordered graphene film ceases to be a continuous and splits into separate fragments .	The relationship between structure ( intensity of RS lines ) and sample resistance is defined .
The semi-relativistic bound state energy spectra and the corresponding normalized wave functions are calculated by means of the Nikiforov-Uvarov ( NU ) method .	We also obtain the numerical energy spectrum of the SS equation without any approximation to centrifugal term for the same potential and compare them with the approximated numerical ones obtained from the analytical expressions .
Based on recent progress by one of us ( A.V.S . )	in semi-classical functional calculus for pseudo-differential operators with discontinuous symbols , we provide here a complete proof of that formula and of its generalization to R\'enyi entropies of all orders $ \alpha & gt ; 0 $ .
A single bubble in water is excited by a standing ultrasound wave .	At high intensity the bubble starts to emit light .
To reveal the correspondence between the two phenomena , we compute the optical conductivity of a noncentrosymmetric metal to linear order in the wave vector of the light wave , specializing to the low-frequency regime .	We show that it is the orbital magnetic moment of quasiparticles that is responsible for the natural optical activity , and thus the chiral magnetic effect .
We propose a feasible active set method for convex quadratic programming problems with non-negativity constraints .	This method is specifically designed to be embedded into a branch-and-bound algorithm for convex quadratic mixed integer programming problems .
A method of quantizing parametrized systems is developed that is based on a kind of `` gauge invariant '' quantities -- -the so-called perennials ( a perennial must also be an `` integral of motion '' ) .	The problem of time in its particular form ( frozen time formalism , global problem of time , multiple choice problem ) is met , as well as the related difficulty characteristic for this type of theory : the paucity of perennials .
This lack of radial variation for low masses is what we would expect with the ejection scenario for brown dwarf formation , although considering that IC2391 has an age about three times older than its crossing time , we expect that brown dwarfs with a velocity greater than the escape velocity have already escaped the cluster .	Alternatively , the variation in the mass function of the stellar objects could be an indication that they have undergone mass segregation via dynamical evolution .
We find that the outflowing gas is multiphase , ionized by both photoionization ( SiII and SiIII ) and collisional ionization ( SiIV and CIV ) .	We estimate a total mass and outflow rate to be $ & gt ; 10^7 $ Msun and $ & gt ; 0.4 $ Msun/yr .
Combining data of the Leiden/Dwingeloo HI Survey and the ROSAT All-Sky Survey ( RASS ) , we set up a radiation transport equation in order to model the SXRB .	Two different techniques lead to the model parameters : An image oriented approach which compares observed and modeled maps of the 1/4 and 3/4 keV X-ray energy regime and a more analytic approach using scatter diagrams .
This picture has , however , recently been brought into question by the discovery of large masses of dust in the host galaxies of quasars at redshift z & gt ; 6 , when the age of the Universe was less than 1 Gyr .	Theoretical studies , corroborated by observations of nearby supernova remnants , have suggested that supernovae provide a fast and efficient dust formation environment in the early Universe .
Formalising the pi-calculus is an illuminating test of the expressiveness of logical frameworks and mechanised metatheory systems , because of the presence of name binding , labelled transitions with name extrusion , bisimulation , and structural congruence .	Formalisations have been undertaken in a variety of systems , primarily focusing on well-studied ( and challenging ) properties such as the theory of process bisimulation .
This approach transforms the dense system of the pseudospectral discretization approximately into an sparse system via an equivalent integral reformulation and a specially-designed sparsifying operator .	The resulting sparse system is then solved efficiently with sparse linear algebra algorithms and serves as a reasonably accurate preconditioner .
We present the first determination of the Galactic polarized emission at 353 GHz by Archeops .	The data were taken during the Arctic night of February 7 , 2002 after the balloon -- borne instrument was launched by CNES from the Swedish Esrange base near Kiruna .
The recovery method is optimizationless in the sense that trace minimization in the PhaseLift procedure is unnecessary .	That is , PhaseLift reduces to a feasibility problem .
Taking into account this effect , we compare the CP violation in B_d \to \psi K_S and B_d \to \phi K_S processes .	We will find that a significant difference is possible between the CP violating phases in two decay processes .
Classification has been an important research topic in machine learning and data mining .	Different classification methods have been proposed and applied to deal with various real-world problems .
However , study of these effects is difficult .	The conventional high-field magnets used for most hyperpolarized 3He MRI of the human lung , and most other common radiological imaging modalities including PET and CT , restrict subjects to lying horizontally , minimizing most gravitational effects .
We study the energy dissipation rate in a mesoscopic system described by the parametrically-driven random-matrix Hamiltonian H [ \phi ( t ) ] for the case of linear bias \phi=vt .	Evolution of the field \phi ( t ) causes interlevel transitions leading to energy pumping , and also smears the discrete spectrum of the Hamiltonian .
In the free probability theory of Voiculescu two of the most frequently used *-distributions are those of a Haar unitary and of a circular element .	We define an $ R $ -diagonal pair as a generalization of these distributions by the requirement that their two-dimensional $ R $ -transform ( or free cumulants ) have a special diagonal form .
A $ U ( 1 ) _ { * } $ topological shift symmetry protects the masslessness of one dual photon .	This symmetry emerges in the IR as a consequence of the Callias index theorem and abelian duality .
During nanoindentations , maximum load ranged from 2000 $ \mu $ N to 5000 $ \mu $ N , with a 1000 $ \mu $ N/sec loading rate .	Slow unloading rate at 100 $ \mu $ N/sec was chosen to favor the formation of the crystalline end phases , high pressure phase ( Si-III and Si-XII ) .
We find excellent agreement between the experimental VNA-FMR spectra and micromagnetic simulations result for various applied magnetic fields .	We find that the demagnetization factor for longitudinal conditions , Nz ( Ny ) increases ( decreases ) as decreasing the nanowire width in the micromagnetic simulations .
Each movement classifier is a simple exemplar-SVM trained on low-level features , i.e. , an SVM learned using a single annotated positive space-time volume and a large number of unannotated videos .	Our representation offers two main advantages .
Quantum cryptography is therefore an interesting target for formal verification , and provides our first example ; we expect the approach to be transferable to more general quantum information processing scenarios .	The example we use is the quantum key distribution protocol proposed by Bennett and Brassard , commonly referred to as BB84 .
We study polynomials with integer coefficients which become Eisenstein polynomials after the additive shift of a variable .	We call such polynomials shifted Eisenstein polynomials .
The model for extreme values is constructed by embedding a trawl process in a hierarchical framework , which ensures that the marginal distribution is generalised Pareto , as expected from classical extreme value theory .	We also consider a modified version of this model that works with a wider class of generalised Pareto distributions , and has the advantage of separating marginal and temporal dependence properties .
The short and medium range structure of a NaFeSi2O6 ( NFS ) glass has been investigated by high-resolution neutron diffraction with Fe isotopic substitution , combined with Empirical Potential Structure Refinement ( EPSR ) simulations .	The majority ( ~60 % ) of Fe is 4-coordinated ( [ 4 ] Fe ) and corresponds only to ferric iron , Fe3+ , with a distance d [ 4 ] Fe3+-O=1.87 $ \pm $ 0.01 { \AA } .
V1.0 released 1/1/2000 includes the following physics modules : ideal hydrodynamics , ideal MHD , and self-gravity .	Future releases will include flux-limited radiation diffusion , thermal heat conduction , two-temperature plasma , and heating and cooling functions .
Stars whose orbits cross the event horizon r_s or the tidal disruption radius r_t are promptly destroyed in an orbital period P. Stars with orbital periapse r_p slightly larger than the sink radius q=max ( r_s , r_t ) may slowly spiral in due to dissipative interactions with the MBH , e.g.gravitational wave emission , tidal heating or accretion disk drag , with observable consequences and implications for the MBH growth rate .	Unlike prompt destruction , the inspiral time is typically & gt ; & gt ; P. This time is limited by the same scattering process that initially deflected the star into its eccentric orbit , since it can deflect it again to a wider orbit where dissipation is inefficient .
However reaching this goal the observation of several events with high detection significance , meaning more powerful telescopes .	The telescope concept we present in this paper is composed of a Laue lens held 30 m apart from the focal instrument ( a compact Compton telescope ) by an extensible mast .
The mmWave overlaid network however incurs a pitfall that its ample data rate is only applicable for downlink transmissions due to the implementation difficulty at mobile users , leading to an immense difference between uplink and downlink rates .	We therefore turn our attention not only to maximize downlink rate but also to ensure the minimum uplink rate .
We also discuss the sensitivity of the results to other parameters , such as the Hubble parameter and the baryon fraction .	We obtain constraints by combining the COBE data , cluster abundances , abundance of damped Lyman- $ \alpha $ systems at $ z\sim3 $ , the small-angle Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy , and the small-scale non-linear power spectrum .
Using a new suite of semi-analytic reionization models , we show that the high value of tau requires a surprisingly high efficiency epsilon of the first generation of UV sources for injecting ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium .	We find that no simple reionization model can be consistent with the combination of the WMAP result with data from the z & lt ; 6.5 universe .
The electron-electron and electron-photon interactions are treated in a nonperturbative manner using `` exact numerical diagonalization '' .	Our results demonstrate that including the diamagnetic term in the photon-electron interaction Hamiltonian drastically improves numerical convergence .
Since these projections of the potential are weighted differently along the line-of-sight , we propose a method to combine them and remove the degeneracy between two cases : ( i ) a cluster consisting of a single potential well , or ( ii ) an apparent cluster composed of several potential wells projected onto each other .	We demonstrate with simulated data of potential models that this method indeed allows to significantly distinguish multiple from single clusters .
It is shown that such impact can lead to creation of bubbles which can propogate through the molecule .	The interaction of such bubbles with an excess electron or hole is considered .
We investigate the consequences of possible medium modifications of the phi meson at finite nuclear matter density on the K+K- mass distribution in photonuclear reactions .	The inclusive cross sections for K+K- pair production are calculated within a semi -- classical BUU transport model , which combines the initial state interaction of the incoming photon with the final state interactions of the produced particles .
We review the status and future of direct searches for light dark matter .	We start by answering the question : `Whatever happened to the light dark matter anomalies ? 'i.e.the fate of the potential dark matter signals observed by the CoGeNT , CRESST-II , CDMS-Si and DAMA/LIBRA experiments .
Ultra-high energy cosmic rays ( UHECRs ) are the highest energy messengers of the present universe , with energies up to $ 10^ { 20 } $ eV .	Studies of astrophysical particles ( nuclei , electrons , neutrinos and photons ) at their highest observed energies have implications for fundamental physics as well as astrophysics .
Evolutionary algorithms have been frequently used for dynamic optimization problems .	With this paper , we contribute to the theoretical understanding of this research area .
Using the TOSM+UCOM approach , we investigate the role of tensor interaction on each spectrum in He isotopes .	It is found that the tensor interaction enhances the LS splitting energy observed in 5He , in which the p1/2 and p3/2 orbits play different roles on the tensor correlation .
The spectrum of the color singlet Reggeon compound states - perturbative Pomerons and Odderons , is expressed by means of the Bethe Ansatz in terms of the fundamental $ Q- $ function , which satisfies the Baxter equation for the XXX Heisenberg magnet .	The exact solution of the Baxter equation is known only in the simplest case of the compound state of two Reggeons , the BFKL Pomeron .
The coupled Burgers equation is solved by way of the trigonometric B-spline collocation method .	The unknown of the coupled Burgers equation is integrated in time by aid of the Crank-Nicolson method .
Next , we show how in the presence of quantum noises which cause ESD , a Bell state may lose its capacity for $ \cal S $ before ESD occurs .	Finally , we show that a Bell state may indeed fail to yield information transfer better than classically possible when the encoding operations of $ \cal S $ are noisy , even though entanglement is not totally destroyed in the process .
The SU ( 2 ) collective coordinates expansion of the Born-Infeld\break Skyrmion Lagrangian is performed .	The classical Hamiltonian is computed from this special Lagrangian in approximative way : it is derived from the expansion of this non-polynomial Lagrangian up to second-order variable in the collective coordinates .
The purpose is to check whether orbifolding commutes with the infrared limit .	On the one hand , one considers the orbifold projection of SQCD and obtains the low-energy description of the resulting theory .
We get explicit descriptions of the spectrum and the eigenfunctions .	In particular in both cases we get a Weyl 's law with leading term $ E\log E $ .
In this study , we investigate the significance of the dynamical non-Condon effect on the ET rate in the coherent resonant tunneling regime .	To deal with the resonance , we generalize the time-dependent Fermi 's golden rule expression for the ET rate in the $ T $ -matrix framework .
Taking into account minispike depletion processes , we only sum contributions from a cosmological distribution of IMBHs with maintained minispikes .	Our conservative scenario ( BH mass 10^2 M_sun with a r^ { -3/2 } minispike ) predicts gamma-ray fluxes that are an order larger than the equivalent flux , using the same DM parameters ( mass 100 GeV and annihilation cross-section 3 \times 10^ { -26 } cm^3 s^ { -1 } , from the host halo without IMBH minispikes .
The square of the four momentum of a photon in vacuum is zero .	However , in an unmagnetized plasma it is equal to the square of the plasma frequency .
In this context , we focus on behavior models ; that is , we aim to ensure that the refined , low-level behavior models conform to the corresponding high-level behavior models .	Based on existing formal verification techniques , we propose containment checking as a means to assess whether the system 's behaviors described by the low-level models satisfy what has been specified in the high-level counterparts .
If $ \alpha $ is a quadratic irrationality of certain type , such as the square root of a rational number , we show that the minimal gap is roughly of size 1/N , which is essentially consistent with Poisson statistics .	We also give related results for a set of $ \alpha $ 's of full measure .
We show that for some equation of state ( EoS ) of matter , matching all conditions at the surface of the star is impossible .	Hence the model brings two major fine-tuning problems : ( i ) only some particular classes of EoS are consistent with Schwarzschild at the surface and ( ii ) given that EoS , only a very particular set of boundary conditions at the centre of the star will satisfy the given boundary conditions at the surface .
We show that the FL represents the `` { \it fractional continuum limit } '' of a discrete `` self-similar Laplacian '' which is obtained by Hamilton 's variational principle from a discrete spring model .	We deduce from generalized self-similar elastic potentials regular representations for the FL which involve convolutions of symmetric finite difference operators of even orders extending the standard representation of the FL .
Over the past few years , we have been developing a charge-2 VVC induced by rotationally symmetric subwavelength gratings ( SGVC2 ) , also known as the Annular Groove Phase Mask ( AGPM ) .	Since 2013 , several SGVC2s ( or AGPMs ) were manufactured using synthetic diamond substrate , then validated on dedicated optical benches , and installed on 10-m class telescopes .
One of the most important properties of quantum information , and the one ultimately responsible for its cryptographic applications , is that it ca n't be copied .	That statement , however , is not completely accurate .
The use of Martin 's formula in a model developed earlier is substituted by the introduction of a complex elementary ( parton-parton ) amplitude .	With this the total cross section and the real part of the hadronic amplitude may be simultaneously investigated and , with the exception of the diffraction minimum at some ISR energies , a satisfactory description of all experimental data is obtained .
We focus on the simulation of whole scan process rather than the simulation of cantilever dynamics and the force interactions between the probe tip and the surface alone , as in most of the earlier numerical studies .	This enables us to quantify the scan performance under Q control for different scan settings .
This map allows us to explain the different qualitative behaviour between even and odd ladders , exactly in the same way it explains the difference between integer and half-integer spin chains .	Namely , for even ladders the topological term in the sigma model action is absent , while for odd ladders the $ \theta $ parameter , which multiplies the topological term , is equal to $ 2 \pi S $ , where $ S $ is the spin of the ladder .
The final energy spectrum of the accelerated ion beam is improved dramatically .	Collimated GeV quasi-mono-energetic ion beams carrying as much as 18 % of the laser energy are observed in multi-dimensional simulations .
have reported the supersymmetric QCD corrections to this process we indicate clearly a comparison of their and our work .	In particular , we find additional corrections [ crossed box and gluon self-energy ] at the one loop level which are not given by Li et .
We searched for Technetium ( Tc ) in a sample of bright oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) stars located in the outer galactic bulge .	Tc is an unstable element synthesised via the s-process in deep layers of AGB stars , thus it is a reliable indicator of both recent s-process activity and third dredge-up .
We estimate the cross section for small momentum transfer using known experimental information .	To first order in the momentum transfer , we obtain a model independent result for the photon-exchange part of the cross section , which is completely determined by the decay width $ \Gamma ( \Sigma^+ \rightarrow p\gamma ) $ .
After a recall of some definitions , we consider at first the free network , that is to say which does not exchange any information with outside .	Then we study the evolution of the network connected with its environment , that is to say immersed into an information field created by this environment which so dictates to it the apprenticeship constraints .
The question referring to considering the vector Schwinger model as a limit of the generalized anomalous model is also discussed .	We show that this limit can only be consistently defined for a field subalgebra of the generalized model .
The results are compared against the properties of the corresponding unrestricted problems .	The latter are subject to a detailed analysis in a companion paper [ LU TP 97-11 ] .
This leads to a hierarchy of soft masses between the charged and neutral fields and provides a solution to the $ \mu $ -problem .	Among these models , we present a scenario in which the Higgs arises as a pseudo-Goldstone boson .
That the recorded EMS and nanostructures induced in water carry the DNA information ( sequence ) is shown by retrieval of that same DNA by classical PCR amplification using the TAQ polymerase , including both primers and nucleotides .	Moreover , such a transduction process has also been observed in living human cells exposed to EMS irradiation .
The map of Voronoi polygons is known as the Dirichlet tessellation and used for grid generation in computational fluid dynamics .	From the hydrodynamics point of view the moving Voronoi polygon looks as a material particle ( MP ) .
Somatosensory system is the one of the critical and must have systems of human body .	This literature concentrates on the body discriminative touch and proprioception mechanism of somatosensory system .
The sample generalized eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by `` whitening '' the signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix with the noise-only sample covariance matrix .	In this article we prove a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample generalized eigenvalue based detection of signals in arbitrarily colored noise when there are relatively few signal bearing and noise-only samples .
This paper proposes a fuzzy neural approach for call admission control in a multi class traffic based Next Generation Wireless Networks ( NGWN ) .	The proposed Fuzzy Neural Call Admission Control ( FNCAC ) scheme is an integrated CAC module that combines the linguistic control capabilities of the fuzzy logic controller and the learning capabilities of the neural networks .The model is based on Recurrent Radial Basis Function Networks ( RRBFN ) which have better learning and adaptability that can be used to develop the intelligent system to handle the incoming traffic in the heterogeneous network environment .
We also present the linear growth rate as a function of beta , the ratio between radiation force and gravity , and c_s , the sound speed of the disk , obtained using two methods : a semi-analytic analysis of the linearized equations and a numerical simulation using the GPU-accelerated hydrodynamical code PEnGUIn .	In particular , we find that IRI occurs at beta~0.1 if the transition region extends as wide as ~0.05r , and at higher beta values if it is wider .
The magnitude of the energy barrier against the vortex expansion into superconductor is found .	The possibilities of formation of an equilibrium vortex line determined by the structure of the applied magnetic field by creating the expanding vortex loops near the surface of type -- II superconductor are discussed .
But unlike transient conditions like flu , social media users are less vocal about chronic conditions such as obesity , as users might not tweet `` I 'm still overweight '' .	As , however , obesity-related conditions such as diabetes , heart disease , osteoarthritis , and even cancer are on the rise , this obese-or-not label could be one of the most useful for studies in public health .
A useful representation of $ \int \varphi \mathrm { d } F_n $ is derived which yields asymptotic normality under optimal moment conditions on the score function $ \varphi $ .	No continuity assumption on $ F $ is required .
It is demonstrated that the existence of long-lived quasistationary eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian for the Maxwell theory naturally explains the extraordinary transmission properties observed in various nanostructured materials .	Such states correspond to quasistationary electromagnetic modes trapped in the scattering structure .
Current constraints on the IGM temperature from the Lya forest are restricted to the redshift range 2 & lt ; z & lt ; 4.5 , limiting the ability to probe the thermal memory of HI reionisation toward higher redshift .	In this work , we present the first direct measurement of the IGM temperature around a z=6 quasar by analysing the Doppler widths of Lya absorption lines in the proximity zone of SDSS J0818+1722 .
In view of a more systematic study , we use an effective model inspired by the above to relate directly rare meson decays to possible LHC observations .	In terms of effective Lagrangians , this can be seen as the introduction in the model of only one overall scaling parameter to extend our approach without modifying the 4D ( gauge ) structure .
We then investigate the associated topological groupoids and in particular their representations on certain direct integrals with non constant fibres .	Via non-commutative-integration theory these representations give rise to von Neumann algebras of random operators .
Directionality is a crucial feature of the Twitter social graph - information flows from the followed to the followers - but is often ignored in social network analyses ; our methods are based on the behaviour of dynamic processes on the network and can be applied naturally to directed networks .	We uncover robust communities of users and show that these communities reflect how information flows through the Twitter network .
In the semi-classical regime $ \epsilon\ll1 $ , even a spatially spectrally accurate time splitting method \cite { HuJi:05 } requires the mesh size to be $ O ( \epsilon ) $ , which makes the direct simulation extremely expensive .	In this paper , we present the Gaussian beam method for the Dirac equation .
Differentiability ( $ C^ { 1 , \alpha } $ regularity ) of the boundary data implies the corresponding result for the solution in the interior , despite the fact that the solution need not be continuous up to the boundary .	Secondary results are the characterization of the convex envelope as : ( i ) the value function of a stochastic control problem , and ( ii ) the optimal underestimator for a class of nonlinear elliptic PDEs .
Non -- Abelian duality in relation to supersymmetry is examined .	When the action of the isometry group on the complex structures is non -- trivial , extended supersymmetry is realized non -- locally after duality , using path ordered Wilson lines .
They represent stationary configurations with horizons , and are surrounded by ( quasi ) topologically massive Abelian gauge hair , in addition to the dilaton and the Kalb-Ramond axion .	Our analysis suggests that there exists a more general family , where our solutions are special limits .

The potential term $ W $ is a $ C_0^\infty $ kernel operator which , in general , will be non-local in time , and $ \lambda $ is a complex parameter .
There is thus a growing need to identify and eliminate `` influence bots '' - realistic , automated identities that illicitly shape discussion on sites like Twitter and Facebook - before they get too influential .	Spurred by such events , DARPA held a 4-week competition in February/March 2015 in which multiple teams supported by the DARPA Social Media in Strategic Communications program competed to identify a set of previously identified `` influence bots '' serving as ground truth on a specific topic within Twitter .
Models of the dynamical evolution of the early solar system following the dispersal of the gaseous protoplanetary disk have been widely successful in reconstructing the current orbital configuration of the giant planets .

We show that the analysis of the single top rapidity distribution in t-channel and tW production can also set direct limits on V_td .	At LHC with 10 fb^-1 at 14 TeV the combined limits on V_td may be reduced by almost a factor of two when the top rapidity distribution is used .
Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks ( WSNs ) indeed is critical ; due to the criticality of the resources in the sensor nodes as well as due to their ubiquitous and pervasive deployment , with varying attributes and degrees of security required .	The proliferation of the next generation sensor nodes , has not solved this problem , because of the greater emphasis on low-cost deployment .
In La_ { 2-x } Sr_xCuO4 the spin excitations are overdamped which leads to a broad low-frequency feature in the susceptibility .	The low-frequency incommensurability in the magnetic response is attributed to a dip in the magnon damping at Q .
Neutrinos from the decay of mesons , which are themselves produced in collisions of accelerated ions with the solar atmosphere would provide a novel window on the underlying physics of the hadronic acceleration and interaction processes during solar flares .

Because quantum mechanics separates the two parts of any description , it is known that between the statements of results and the explanations lurks a logical gap : given any statement of results one has a choice of explanations .	Here we work out some consequences of this openness to choice .
We note that the fake curvature condition which is commonly used in the literature would restrict the dynamics to be either a free theory or a topological system .	We then propose a modification of transformation law which simplifies the gauge transformation of 3-form field strength and enables us to write down a gauge invariant action .
At moderately low Rossby number and large Rayleigh number , we show that a large-scale depth-invariant flow is formed , reminiscent of the condensate state observed in two-dimensional flows .

However , we show that this is parametrically incorrect in the case of chiral perturbation theory , and is probably theoretically incorrect in general .	In the chiral theory , we explore perturbative unitarity violation as a function of the number of colors and the number of flavors , holding the scale of the `` new physics '' ( i.e.QCD ) fixed .
The Dempster -- Shafer ( DS ) theory is a powerful tool for probabilistic reasoning based on a formal calculus for combining evidence .	DS theory has been widely used in computer science and engineering applications , but has yet to reach the statistical mainstream , perhaps because the DS belief functions do not satisfy long-run frequency properties .
We present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forming galaxies at $ z\sim 0 $ .	We combine empirically derived star formation histories with updated supernova and AGB yields and rates to estimate the total mass of metals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of $ 10^ { 9.3 } $ -- $ 10^ { 11.6 } M_ { \odot } $ .
Even at this relatively early epoch , the ISM of this galaxy is already highly enriched in elements released by Type II supernovae ; the abundances of O , Mg , Si , P , and S are all about 2/5 of their solar values .

Multilevel quadrature methods for parametric operator equations such as the multilevel ( quasi- ) Monte Carlo method are closely related to the sparse tensor product approximation between the spatial variable and the stochastic variable .	In this article , we employ this fact and reverse the multilevel quadrature method via the sparse grid construction by applying differences of quadrature rules to finite element discretizations of different resolution .

Another mechanism of an enhancement of $ I_ { c1 } $ can come from decreasing the decay length of the charge imbalance $ \lambda_Q $ at weak magnetic fields because $ I_ { c1 } $ is inversely proportional to $ \lambda_Q $ .	The enhancement of the first critical current leads to a larger intrinsic dissipation of the phase slip process .
Towards the end of brane inflation , the brane pair annihilation produces massive closed strings .	The transfer of this energy to Standard Model ( SM ) open string modes depends on where the SM branes and the brane annihilation are located : in the bulk , in the same throat or in different throats .
Our choice of parameters of lattice Lagrangian corresponds to large values of the Higgs boson mass $ M_H & gt ; 2 M_W $ .	We find that the density of Nambu monopoles can not be predicted by the choice of the initial parameters of Electroweak theory and should be considered as the new external parameter of the theory .

An improved method of calculation based on the inclusion of electromagnetic corrections to the kernel of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the interacting K\bar K pair is outlined to cover this case and applied to re-evaluate the two-photon decay width for f_0 ( 980 ) in a one boson exchange model for the interkaon interaction .	The corrections are significant and result in a much better agreement with experiment .

We show connectedness of conformal infinity for appropriately regular such space-times .
As far as chiral symmetry is concerned , corrections to these processes begin respectively at $ \cO ( q^2 ) $ and $ \cO ( q^4 ) $ .	The two-pion exchange interaction also yields a new spin structure , that promotes the presence of $ P $ waves in trinuclei and is associated with profile functions which do not coincide with neither central nor spin-orbit ones .
We study the thermodynamic behaviour of Inozemtsev 's long-range elliptic spin chain using the Bethe ansatz equations describing the spectrum of the model in the infinite-length limit .

Lastly , we show how this method may also be applied to probe d-wave pairing , a possible ground state candidate for the doped repulsive Hubbard model .
It has been proved ( Klauck , STOC'00 ) that the exact one-way quantum finite automata have no advantage comparing to classical finite automata in recognizing languages .	However , the result ( 3 ) shows that the exact 2QCFA do have an advantage in comparison with their classical counterparts , which has been the first example showing that the exact quantum computing have advantage in time-space tradeoff comparing to classical computing .
We show how the mapping class biset of maps preserving a multicurve decomposes into mapping class bisets of smaller complexity , called `` small mapping class bisets '' .	We phrase the decision problem of `` Thurston equivalence '' between branched self-coverings of the sphere in terms of the conjugacy and centralizer problems in a mapping class biset , and use our decomposition results on mapping class bisets to reduce these decision problems to small mapping class bisets .
The presence of dense material in the equatorial plane observed in the two classes of bubbles constrains the jets and CFW activity in PNs to occur while the AGB star still blows its dense wind , or very shortly after .	I argue that only a stellar companion can account for such jets and CFW .
Motivated by the study of social insects , we introduce a stochastic model based on interacting particle systems in order to understand the effect of communication on the division of labor .	Members of the colony are located on the vertex set of a graph representing a communication network .
A true jet rebound on a solid surface , for which the cylindrical geometry is preserved , has never been yet observed .	Here we experimentally demonstrate that a water jet can impact a solid surface without being destabilized .
We calculate the solution of the equations of motion for one layer of small surface elements distributed along the equator of the star , as they respond to the forces due to gas pressure , centrifugal , coriolis , viscous forces , and the gravitational forces of both stars .	This calculation provides variability timescales that can be compared with the observations .
The data are consistent with a correlation between the mm and radio fluxes indicating a physical connection between the mechanisms responsible for the radio and mm emission .	However , this conclusion is based on data which includes many upper limits , and deeper observations are clearly needed to verify this correlation .
The ability to independently tune the pump and probe wavelength enables the investigation of the influence of excitation energy on the optically induced electron spin dynamics in semiconductors .

Probabilistic inference over large data sets is a challenging data management problem as exact inference is generally # P-hard and requires sampling-based methods .	This paper proposes an alternative approach for approximate evaluation of queries with probabilistic databases : In our approach , every query is evaluated entirely in the database engine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans , each providing an upper bound on the true probability , then taking their minimum .
In a recent paper , a new parametrization for the dark matter ( DM ) speed distribution f ( v ) was proposed for use in the analysis of data from direct detection experiments .

It is easily observed that $ \mathsf d ( G ) +1\leq \mathsf D ( G ) $ , and if $ G $ is abelian , then equality holds .
One of the most striking examples for the production of particles out of the quantum vacuum due to external conditions is cosmological particle creation , which is caused by the expansion or contraction of the Universe .	Already in 1939 , Schr\ '' odinger understood that the cosmic evolution could lead to a mixing of positive and negative frequencies and that this `` would mean production or annihilation of matter , merely by the expansion '' .
It also turns out that the entire quantum formalism , operators as observables and all the rest , naturally emerges in Bohmian mechanics from the analysis of `` measurements .

We introduce a meaningful notion of Shannon capacity for such systems , evaluate this capacity as a function of signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , and develop a simple two-phase cooperative network protocol that achieves it .	We observe that the resulting capacity is the same for both unicasting and multicasting , but show that the network size required to achieve any target error probability is smaller for unicasting than for multicasting .
A solution to such a problem can not be exactly determined ( it is a function in the set of `` possible solutions '' formed by generalized solutions related to possible data ) .	The problem is to find parameters of this set .
Signomial programs ( SPs ) are optimization problems specified in terms of signomials , which are weighted sums of exponentials composed with linear functionals of a decision variable .	SPs are non-convex optimization problems in general , and families of NP-hard problems can be reduced to SPs .

through the calculation of theoretical lag spectra for a range of source parameters in general relativistic ray tracing simulations , combined with knowledge of the observed variability of the X-ray emission from AGN .	Due to the proximity of the emission to the central black hole , Shapiro delays are important and the effects of general relativity should be considered when interpreting the lags as the light travel time between the source and reflector .

We fit two models for the flattening , a `knee ' model , analogous to the low-frequency break seen in the power spectra of BHXRBs in the low state ( where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=0 ) and a `high-frequency break ' model ( where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=1 ) , analogous to the high-frequency break seen in the high and low-state power spectra of the classic BHXRB Cyg X-1 .	Both models provide good fits to the power spectra of all four AGN .

We derive the plasma electron temperatures using the line-to-continuum ratios and use them as proxies for the nebular [ O/H ] abundances , because in thermal equilibrium the abundance of the coolants ( O , N , and other heavy elements ) in the ionized gas sets the electron temperature , with high abundances producing low temperatures .	Combining these data with our previous work produces a sample of 90 HII regions with high quality electron temperature determinations .

Using these results , we assess whether the binary could induce a thermonuclear explosion , and whether the explosion could be observed as a type Ia supernova ( SN Ia ) .	We investigate three explosion mechanisms : a helium-ignition following the dynamical merger ( `helium-ignited violent merger model ' ) , a carbon-ignition ( `carbon-ignited violent merger model ' ) , and an explosion following the formation of the Chandrasekhar mass WD ( `Chandrasekhar mass model ' ) .
It is argued that the time evolution of these quantities provides an unambiguous description of the quantal dynamics .	This is shown explicitly for a single spin s , using a quorum of expectation values which contains no redundant information .
A search for charginos and neutralinos , predicted by supersymmetric theories , has been performed using a data sample of 10.3 pb^-1 at centre-of-mass energies of sqrt ( s ) = 170 and 172 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP .	No evidence for these particles has been found .
We say that a given knot $ J\subset S^3 $ is detected by its knot Floer homology and $ A $ -polynomial if whenever a knot $ K\subset S^3 $ has the same knot Floer homology and the same $ A $ -polynomial as $ J $ , then $ K=J $ .	In this paper we show that every torus knot $ T ( p , q ) $ is detected by its knot Floer homology and $ A $ -polynomial .
We consider a theory for a two-dimensional interacting conduction electron system with strong spin-orbit coupling on the interface between a topological insulator and the magnetic ( ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ) layer .	For the ferromagnetic case we derive the Landau-Lifshitz equation , which features a contribution proportional to a fluctuation-induced electric field obtained by computing the topological ( Chern-Simons ) contribution from the vacuum polarization .
Ground- and excited-state quantum fidelities in combination with generalized quantum fidelity susceptibilites , obtained from exact diagonalizations , are used to explore the phase diagram of the anisotropic next-nearest-neighbour triangular Heisenberg model .	Specifically , the $ J'-J_2 $ plane of this model , which connects the $ J_1-J_2 $ chain and the anisotropic triangular lattice Heisenberg model , is explored using these quantities .
Several indicators have pointed to the presence of an Electron Cloud ( EC ) in some of the CERN accelerators , when operating with closely spaced bunched beams .	In particular , spurious signals on the pick ups used for beam detection , pressure rise and beam instabilities were observed at the Proton Synchrotron ( PS ) during the last stage of preparation of the beams for the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , as well as at the Super Proton Synchrotron ( SPS ) .
When exactly the same set of d-separation relations hold in two directed graphs , no matter whether respectively cyclic or acyclic , we say that they are Markov equivalent .	In other words , when two directed cyclic graphs are Markov equivalent , the set of distributions that satisfy a natural extension of the Global Directed Markov condition ( Lauritzen et al .
In this paper , we describe the phenomenological template bank that was used to search for gravitational waves from non-spinning black hole binaries ( from stellar mass formation ) in the second , third and fourth LIGO science runs .	We briefly explain the design of the bank , whose templates are based on a phenomenological detection template family .
These distributions are a generalization of commonly studied Gaussian randomness ( $ \alpha = 2 $ ) .	However , the more general case ( $ \alpha & lt ; 2 $ ) includes also heavy-tailed behavior with a divergent second moment .
The method is formulated on the basis of the theory of envelopes , as was done for scalar fields .	This formulation actually completes the discussion of the previous work for scalar equations .
The model is extended further to describe seven excited D meson states .	We find that semileptonic B decays into the ground and excited D meson states do not account for the total semileptonic decay width of the B0 .
The strong electromagnetic field and the QCD vacuum can both completely be produced in the off-central nuclear-nuclear collision .	We used the Wood-Saxon nucleon distribution to calculate the electric field distributions of the off-central collisions .
In addition , observations of clusters up to redshift ~1.3 allowed us to trace the thermodynamical and chemical evolution of the ICM on a time interval as large as 8 Gyr .	In this presentation , I will give a personal introduction to the most debated topics in this field , to end with some prospects for the next-generation X-ray satellites .
The critical crossover limit is driven by the Ginzburg number G. The corresponding scaling functions are universal with respect to any possible microscopic mechanism which can vary G , such as changing the range or the strength of the interactions .	The critical crossover describes the unique flow from the unstable Gaussian to the stable nonclassical fixed point .
We calculate the effective viscosity $ \zeta ( \omega ) $ from perturbation theory in the screened Coulomb interaction and compare it with the commonly used three-dimensional LDA viscosity $ Y ( \omega ) $ .	Significant differences are found .
It provides a unified view of how to model and solve them , even though they involve very different types of constraints : obvious symmetric ones in Sudoku , non-symmetric but transitive ones ( inequalities ) in Futoshiki , topological and geometric ones in Map colouring , Numbrix and Hidato , and even much more complex non-binary arithmetic ones in Kakuro ( or Cross Sums ) .	It also shows that the most familiar techniques for these puzzles can indeed be understood as mere application-specific presentations of the general rules .
We then apply these results to various approximation properties on reduced free products .	As a first application , we give a quick proof of Dykema 's theorem on the stability of exactness under the reduced free product for $ C^* $ -algebras .
Due to the inherent difficulty in the direct trapping of single molecules at approximately 300 K , most of the current studies on laser trapping utilize the experimental technique to grasp microbeads that are attached to a single macromolecule , instead of using direct trapping .	A few studies have demonstrated the applicability of laser trapping for highly packed compact DNA under a `poor ' solvent condition without any beads .
The transits of rapidly rotating planets that are deformed in shape will lead to distortions in the ingress and egress of their light curves .	We report the first tentative detection of an oblate planet outside of the solar system , measuring an oblateness of $ 0.22 \pm 0.11 $ for the 18 $ M_J $ mass brown dwarf Kepler 39b ( KOI-423.01 ) .
We apply this method to the case of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field with fixed $ z $ -component of the angular momentum .	This is then compared with numerical results obtained by a high precision finite element approach .
In a linear transformation model , there exists an unknown monotone nonlinear transformation function such that the transformed response variable and the predictor variables satisfy a linear regression model .	In this paper , we present CENet , a new method for estimating the slope vector and simultaneously performing variable selection in the high-dimensional sparse linear transformation model .
These statistical quantities are simple , easy to calculate from the observed visibility and thus suitable for the early exploration of the EoR with ongoing telescopes such as the Murchison Widefield Array ( MWA ) and LOw Frequency ARray ( LOFAR ) .	We show , by performing Fisher analysis , that the variance and skewness at $ z=7-9 $ are complementary to each other to constrain the EoR model parameters such as the minimum virial temperature of halos which host luminous objects , ionizing efficiency and mean free path of ionizing photons in the IGM .
Events at particle locations on the hypersurface are identified as the causal event set .	It is demonstrated that a Lorentz boost applied to the causal event set maintains the property of connectedness and with this formalism it is simple to derive the redshift equation .
In this paper the heat signaling in microtubules ( MT ) is investigated .	It is argued that for the description of the heat signaling phenomena in MT , the hyperbolic heat transport ( HHT ) equation must be used .
We also present a generalized scheme of the probability-changing cluster algorithm , which has been recently developed by the present authors , based on the FSS property of the correlation ratio .	We investigate the two-dimensional quantum XY model of spin 1/2 with this generalized scheme , obtaining the precise estimate of the KT transition temperature with less numerical effort .
Any such double groupoid characteristically has associated to it `homotopy groups ' , which are defined using only its algebraic structure .	Thus arises the notion of `weak equivalence ' between such double groupoids , and a corresponding `homotopy category ' is defined .
Center vortices corresponding to magnetic flux J ( in units of 2\pi /N ) are composites of J elementary J=1 constituent vortices that come in N-1 types , with repulsion between like constituents and attraction between unlike constituents .	The scalar field theory involves N scalar fields \phi_i ( one of which is eliminated ) that can merge , dissociate , and recombine while conserving flux mod N. The properties of these fields are deduced directly from the corresponding gauge-theory quantum solitons .
A systematic search for silicon allotropes was performed by employing a modified ab initio minima hopping crystal structure prediction method .	The algorithm was optimized to specifically investigate the hitherto barely explored low-density regime of the silicon phase diagram by imitating the guest-host concept of clathrate compounds .
Furthermore , we introduce two experimental schemes including the spin-resolved Bloch oscillation to carry out the measurement .	These schemes are highly feasible under realistic experimental conditions .
For very low values of amplitude of oscillating field and the width of randomly quenched magnetic field , the magnetisation oscillates asymmetrically about a nonzero value and the oscillation becomes symmetric about a zero value for higher values of amplitude of oscillating field and the width of the quenched disorder .	The time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of the oscillating magnetic field defines the dynamic order parameter .
We find enhanced star formation activity in bulges towards stronger bars , although not predominantly , consistent with previous studies .	Our results suggest that different stages of the secular process and many other factors may contribute to the complexity of the secular evolution .
We comment on the relation of our previous work on the classical gluodynamics of high energy nuclear collisions to recent work by Lappi ( hep-ph/0303076 ) .	While our results for the non-perturbative number liberation coefficient agree , those for the energy disagree by a factor of 2 .
Near Tc low field deviations of the MR with respect to a H^2 variation permit us to extract the superconducting fluctuation contribution to the conductivity .	Though below Tc the anisotropy of superconductivity is rather small , the superconducting fluctuations display a quasi ideal two-dimensional behavior which persists up to 1.4 Tc .
The role of the observer is addressed and as an extension of the special relativistic case , the field of observers comoving with the matter is seen to compute the intrinsic global energy of a system .	The new localized energy supports the Bonnor claim that the Szekeres collapsing dust solutions are energy-conserving .
These training data limitations constitute a challenge to certain classification methodologies .	Feature selection techniques can be used to extract the marker genes which influence the classification accuracy effectively by eliminating the un wanted noisy and redundant genes This paper presents a review of feature selection techniques that have been employed in micro array data based cancer classification and also the predominant role of SVM for cancer classification .
The data were obtained by profiling the Doppler-broadened absorption of metastable Ar atoms at 763.51 nm in argon and argon/nitrogen plasmas ( 3 , 45 , and 90 % N2 in Ar ) at pressure 0.5-70 Pa and inductive power of 100 and 300 W. The results were compared to rotational temperature derived from the N2 emission at the ( 0,0 ) transition of the C - B system .	The differences in integrated rotational and Doppler temperatures were attributed to non-uniform spatial distributions of both temperature and thermometric species ( Ar* and N2* ) that varied depending on conditions .
The measurement of the absorption , corresponding to the excitation of SPP modes is realized with a new goniometer-based experimental setup for oblique incidence laser beam scattering at a single wavelength .	A device is developed that allows a simultaneous measurement of the scattering amplitude in s- and p-polarization under varied incident angle .
Electronic states of PrCoO $ _3 $ are studied using x-ray photoemission spectroscopy .	Pr 3d $ _ { 5/2 } $ core level and valence band ( VB ) were recorded using Mg K $ _\beta $ source .
We also use 1000 mock galaxy catalogs that match the geometry , density , and clustering properties of the BOSS sample in order to characterize the statistical uncertainties of our measurements and take into account systematic errors such as redshift space distortions .	For both BOSS data and mock catalogs , we use the ZOBOV algorithm to identify voids , we stack together all voids with effective radii of 30-100Mpc/h in the redshift range 0.43-0.7 , and we accurately measure the shape of the stacked voids .
The understating of the origin of the H2 line emission from the central regions of galaxies represent an important key to improve our knowledge about the excitation and ionization conditions of the gas in these locations .	Usually these lines can be produced by Starburts , shocks and/or radiation from an active galactic nucleus ( AGN ) .
The X-ray luminosities in the 2 -- 10 keV band for the two observations are nearly identical ( LX $ \approx $ 2 $ \times10^ { 41 } $ ergs/s ) , but they are $ \sim $ 35 % larger than that measured in 1995 July by Terashima et al .	An Fe K emission line is detected at $ 6.39\pm0.09 $ keV ( source rest frame ) which is lower than the line energy $ 6.73^ { +0.13 } _ { -0.12 } $ keV in the 1995 observation .
We aimed to find a probability distribution that we could use to model them , and hypothesized that there is a two-parameter model that fits the pattern of those data well in the entire domain .	We considered the major failures produced between 2002 and 2009 in the European power grid ; analyzed those reliability indicators : ENS , TLP and RT ; fitted six alternative models : Pareto II , Fisk , Lognormal , Pareto , Weibull and Gamma distributions , to the data by maximum likelihood ; compared these models by the Bayesian information criterion ; tested the goodness-of-fit of those models by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test method based on bootstrap resampling ; and validated them graphically by rank-size plots .
The simulations include the gravitational N-body forces within the cluster and the effects of stellar evolution on the cluster population .	In addition the gravitational forces due to the Milky Way potential are accounted for in a self-consistent manner .
We report detailed analyses of the resonance lines , which fully resolve the cyclotron mass structure of the main Fermi surface sheets .	A particular focus is given to the anomalous splitting of the sharpest resonance line near the [ 110 ] direction under in-plane magnetic-field rotation , which implies peculiar electronic structure in the hidden order phase .
We reconstructed the neutron spectrum in the core by means of the isotope ratios : $ ^ { 147 } $ Sm/ $ ^ { 148 } $ Sm and $ ^ { 176 } $ Lu/ $ ^ { 175 } $ Lu .	These ratios unambiguously determine the spectrum index and core temperature .
At low densities there are no equilibrium distributions , and on the hydrodynamic scale the initial profile is transported rigidly .	We elaborate this situation further by finding the correct order of the correction from the hydrodynamic limit , together with distributional bounds averaged over the disorder .
The ERASMUS mobility program is one of the largest international student exchange programs in the world , which has supported already more than three million participants since 1987 .	We analyzed the mobility pattern within this program in 2011-12 and found a gender gap across countries and subject areas .
We also show that there do not exist Shimura curves lying generically in the Torelli locus of hyperelliptic curves of genus $ g\geq 8 $ .	The first result proves a slightly weaker form of the conjecture for the case of Shimura curves of Mumford type .
It has been revealed that the image positions , amplifications and time delays of this lensing system can not be explained by the single transparent lens model .	We compare this elliptical lens model with a multipole expansion model .
Generators and relations are given for the subalgebra of cocommutative elements in the quantized coordinate rings of the classical groups , where the deformation parameter q is transcendental .	This is a ring theoretic formulation of the well known fact that the representation theory of the quantized group is completely analogous to its classical counterpart .
Object properties variability and different situations of object combination represent important aspects of such type of application which makes that the user can be interested as much in the restitution of certain global properties of an entire object domain as in the restitution of properties that are specific to an isolate object .	In the traditional approaches , the usual criteria are founded on the paradigm of transparency and are related to the impedance error introduced by the technical aspects of the system .
We show that the temperature hysteresis loop occurs due to non-monotonic behavior of exchange interaction versus temperature .	The origin of this hysteresis is related to the presence of stable magnetic domains which are robust against thermal fluctuations .
Here we show how recent work relating discontinuous systems to singular limits of continuous ( or regularized ) systems extends to nonlinear combinations .	We show that if sliding occurs in a discontinuous systems , there exists a differentiable slow-fast system with equivalent slow invariant dynamics .
The latter should be questioned in the presence of singular ( e.g.Coulomb ) potentials .	Then , we show that a singular potential in a one-body operator considerably decreases the class of time-dependent external potentials to which the original argument can be applied .
It is a facile and fast mask-less lithography process to produce large area periodic patterns .	The objective in this study is to simulate and design periodic and quasi-periodic 1D , 2D and 3D nanostructures using two-beam interference technique .
The tests may be noiseless or noisy , and the testing procedure may be adaptive ( the pool defining a test may depend on the outcome of a previous test ) , or non-adaptive ( each test is performed independent of the outcome of other tests ) .	A rich body of literature demonstrates that $ \Theta ( D\log ( N ) ) $ tests are information-theoretically necessary and sufficient for the group-testing problem , and provides algorithms that achieve this performance .
We study the absolute continuity of the convolution $ \delta_ { e^X } ^\natural \star \delta_ { e^Y } ^\natural $ of two orbital measures on the symmetric space $ SO_0 ( p , q ) /SO ( p ) \timesSO ( q ) $ , $ q & gt ; p $ .	We prove sharp conditions on $ X $ , $ Y\in\a $ for the existence of the density of the convolution measure .
For a Non-radiative model , we find scaling relations in good agreement with self-similar predictions : $ Y\propto T_X^ { 5/2 } $ and $ Y \propto L_X^ { 5/4 } $ .	Our main results focus on predictions from Cooling and Preheating simulations , shown by Muanwong et al .
The following two-stage procedure has been proposed to determine the form of the model .	In Stage 1 , we carry out an F test of the null hypothesis that the slopes are all zero against the alternative hypothesis that they are not all zero .
This paper is concerned with the existence of multiple stable fixed point solutions of the homogeneous Kuramoto model .	We develop a necessary condition for the existence of stable fixed points for the general network Kuramoto model .
A comparison with contemporaneous X-ray monitoring observations shows that the nIR brightness correlates well with X-ray flux and X-ray spectral state .	We also find possible indications for a change in the slope of the nIR/X-ray flux relation between different X-ray states .
In this part of the article we use essentially the concept of harmonic section in a sphere bundle with respect to an Euclidean connection .	Second , we concentrate on moduli spaces of instantons on definite 4-manifolds with arbitrary first Betti number .
In contrast , a multivariate approach including new discriminants such as R-cores , which characterize the shape of the W-jet , subjet planar flow , and grooming-sensitivities is shown to provide a much larger factor of ~5 improvement in S/sqrt ( B ) .	For longitudinally polarized W 's , such as those coming from many new physics models , the discrimination is even better .
We use the Herschel ATLAS ( H-ATLAS ) Phase I data to study the conditional luminosity function of far-IR ( 250 um ) selected galaxies in optically-selected galaxy groups from the GAMA spectroscopic survey , as well as environmental effects on the far-IR-to-optical colour .	We applied two methods , which gave consistent results for the far-IR conditional luminosity functions .
A general theorem on conservation laws for arbitrary difference equations is proved .	The theorem is based on an introduction of an adjoint system related with a given difference system , and it does not require the existence of a difference Lagrangian .
This difference may be due to a change in the source emission region on a scale of 10 Schwarzschild radii or due to a change of 3 x 10^5 rad m^-2 in the rotation measure .	We consider a change in the source physics unlikely , however , since we see no corresponding change in the total intensity or polarized intensity fraction .
For the data assimilation scheme , the supervised NN , the multilayer perceptrons ( MLP-NN ) , is applied .	The MLP-NN are able to emulate the analysis from the local ensemble transform Kalman filter ( LETKF ) .
This ability can be sustained with addition of distracting dots around the object .	However , such capability has not been reproduced algorithmically on computers .
One of them is similar to the residual norm of an approximate solution of the linear system , and the other one is determined critically by the first term of the error expansion of the Arnoldi approximation to $ e^ { -\tau A } v $ due to Saad .	We prove that each of the two estimates is reliable to measure the true error norm , and the second one theoretically justifies an empirical claim by Saad .
We consider systems of dipoles randomly placed on a fraction x of all L^3 sites of a simple cubic lattice that point up or down along a given crystalline axis .	For x & lt ; 0.65 these systems are known to exhibit an equilibrium spin-glass phase below a temperature T_sg proportional to x .
The same white-hole horizon is observed in quantum liquid -- superfluid 4He .	The ergoregion for the `` non-relativistic '' ripplons is generated in the experiments with two sliding 3He superfluids .
Quite surprisingly , in some cases the Taylor polynomials converge to a function which differs from the original one .	We provide explicit expressions for the integral remainder .
This makes the critisized Klein-Gordon Equation for spinless massparticles obsolete .	Therefore Dirac 's Equation is presented from a different viewpoint and it is shown that the relativistic covariance of Schrodinger 's Equation gives a natural explanation for the dual energy outcome of Dirac 's derivation and for the nature of antiparticles .
The use of machine-learning in neuroimaging offers new perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases .	Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data , traditional approaches provide irregular ( l2 penalty ) or scattered ( l1 penalty ) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance .
We use the stellar SEDs to estimate the spectral types of the three newly-identified O stars in RCW49 and one previously undiscovered O star in M17 .	One of the bowshocks in RCW49 reveals the presence of a large-scale flow of gas escaping the H II region at a few 10^2 km/s .
Vertex operator approach is a powerful method to study exactly solvable models .	We review recent progress of vertex operator approach to semi-infinite spin chain .
It is explained in terms of the decay instability of homogeneous transverse NMR mode into spin waves of the longitudinal NMR .	Recently the cross interaction amplitude between the two modes has been calculated by Sourovtsev and Fomin \cite { SF } for the so-called Brinkman-Smith configuration , i.e.for the orientation of the orbital momentum of Cooper pairs along the magnetic field , $ { \bf L } \parallel { \bf H } $ .
Line-of-sight projection effects increase the scatter to ~25 % , where we include the known velocity anisotropies .	The classical `` caustic '' technique incorporates a calibration factor which is determined from N-body simulations .
We show that the quantum tunneling can be quasi-periodic and in this way one could generate coherent Bose condensed atomic pulses .	In the second part of the report , we discuss an effective 1D time-dependent non-polynomial nonlinear Schrodinger equation ( NPSE ) , which describes cigar-shaped condensates .
The basic framework for this article is the causal set approach to discrete quantum gravity ( DQG ) .	Let $ Q_n $ be the collection of causal sets with cardinality not greater than $ n $ and let $ K_n $ be the standard Hilbert space of complex-valued functions on $ Q_n $ .
The generalized Killing equations for the configuration space of anisotropically spinning particles ( anisotropic spinning space ) are analyzed .	Simple solutions of the homogeneous part of these equations are expressed in terms of some anisotropically modified Killing-Yano tensors .
As a result , the value of B at which the singlet -- triplet crossing occurs in the $ X^- $ spectrum also depends on $ \delta $ and decreases from 35 T in a symmetric 10 nm GaAs well to 16 T for $ \delta=0.5 $ nm .	Since the critical values of $ \delta $ at which different $ X^- $ states unbind are surprisingly small compared to the well width , the observation of strongly bound $ X^- $ states in an experimental PL spectrum implies virtually no layer displacement in the sample .
Before comparing the methods , we extend a published Bayesian IRL approach that is only applicable to the case where the reward is only state dependent to a general one capable of tackling the case where the reward depends on both state and action .	Comparison between IRL and MIRL is made in the context of an abstract soccer game , using both a game model in which the reward depends only on state and one in which it depends on both state and action .
We study a change in the spin magnetization of a superconductor-ferromagnet ( SF ) heterostructure , when temperature is lowered below the superconducting transition temperature .	It is assumed that the SF interface is smooth on the atomic scale and the mean free path is not too short .
The two-sided quaternionic Fourier transformation ( QFT ) was introduced in \cite { Ell:1993 } for the analysis of 2D linear time-invariant partial-differential systems .	In further theoretical investigations \cite { 10.1007/s00006-007-0037-8 , EH : DirUP_QFT } a special split of quaternions was introduced , then called $ \pm $ split .
A number of writers have been attracted to the idea that some of the peculiarities of quantum theory might be manifestations of 'backward ' or 'retro ' causality , underlying the quantum description .	This idea has been explored in the literature in two main ways : firstly in a variety of explicit models of quantum systems , and secondly at a conceptual level .
But experiments may be less expensive than BO methods assume : In some simulation models , we may be able to conduct multiple thousands of experiments in a few hours , and the computational burden of BO is no longer negligible compared to experimentation time .	To address this challenge we introduce a new Dimension Scheduling Algorithm ( DSA ) , which reduces the computational burden of BO for many experiments .
We derive the relevant graviton equations .	For an extended brane , the properties of the solution depend on apropriate boundary conditions that the exterior solutions have to satisfy near the core .
This parameter , which can be considered a quantum precursor of ordinary physical time , is a coordinate of Euclidean 5-sphere metrics .	We must now examine what the privileged role of the x0 axis consists in .
Thus , its application to objects not dominated by hydromagnetic turbulence is questionable .	We calibrate the CF-method and Zeeman measurements against numerical models of self-gravitating molecular cloud cores .
This feeling is exacerbated given the success of the Big Bang model .	However , there are cogent reasons for considering this new model .
The spatial completeness of the sample has been carefully determined by statistical methods , and the NIR luminosity function of the stars has been derived by direct star counts .	We find a local volume luminosity of 0.121 +/- 0.004 L_K_sun/ ( pc**3 ) , corresponding to a volumetric mass-to-light ratio of M/L_K = 0.31 +/- 0.02 M_sun/L_K_sun , where giants contribute 80 per cent to the light but less than 2 per cent to the stellar mass .
Nystrom discretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the generating curve .	The quadrature is a high-order Gaussian rule that is modified near the diagonal to retain high-order accuracy for singular kernels .
However , this transfer is usually hampered because the memory system is subjected to some noise and this can limit the performance of the state transfer to a great extent .	In this paper , we consider the transfer of a Gaussian state of light to a linear medium memory such as an opto-mechanical oscillator and propose a dynamical feedback controller that suppresses the noise in the memory system .
For a condensate in a toroidal trap , the interaction in combination with the central repulsive Gaussian barrier produces an azimuthal dependence of the particle density for a fixed radial distance .	We find that along the magnetization direction the density decreases as the scattering length is reduced but presents two symmetric density peaks in the perpendicular axis .
We propose two ways in which storages can achieve non-zero profit and show that they are optimal in the sense that storages achieve the maximum possible profit .	The first is a decentralized approach in which storages are exposed to artificial cost functions that incentivize them to behavior as a coalition .
The wavefunction is expressed from the optimized linear combination of retained states in the truncated Hilbert space with numerically chosen basis .	This algorithm does not suffer from the negative sign problem and can be applied to any type of Hamiltonian in any dimension .
Assuming the orbital period of the planet is known and the signal is periodic , we illustrate that systematic noise can be removed in Fourier space at all frequencies , by only using data within a fixed time frame with a width equal to an integer number of orbital periods .	This results in a reconstruction of the full transit signal which on average is unbiased , despite that no prior knowledge of either the noise or the transit signal itself is used in the analysis .
For the case of hypersurfaces , transversality in this context was proved by Baouendi and the second author in 1990 .	The general case of generic manifolds of higher codimension , which we treat in this paper , had remained an open problem since then .
Add to that the mobility of the agents comprising many of these networks .	It is difficult or even impossible for such systems to be managed centrally in an efficient manner .
When the volume is above $ 300 \mu\rm { l } $ , the droplet splits into smaller drops .	These experimental results regarding mode selection are interpreted in terms of the wave number selection depending on the droplet volume .
The two contributions for the impact parameter averaged fluctuations are comparable .	As a result , standard procedures for selecting peripheral ( central ) collisions lead to selection of configurations in the projectile which interact with smaller ( larger ) than average strength .
The theory of second order phase transitions is one of the foundations of modern statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory .	A central concept is the observable `order parameter ' , whose non-zero average value characterizes one or more phases and usually breaks a symmetry of the Hamiltonian .
A freely cooling granular gas with velocity dependent restitution coefficient is studied in one dimension .	The restitution coefficient becomes near elastic when the relative velocity of the colliding particles is less than a velocity scale $ \delta $ .
The first one is based on four silicon pads and allows to monitor the neutron beam flux as a function of the neutron energy .	The second one , based on position sensitive silicon detectors , is intended for the reconstruction of the beam profile , again as a function of the neutron energy .
Using UKIDSS and SDSS archive data , we outline the pre-processing necessary to standardise all images to a common zeropoint , the steps taken to correct for seeing bias across the dataset , and the creation of Gigapixel-scale mosaics of the three 4x12 deg GAMA regions in each filter .	From these mosaics , we extract source catalogues for the GAMA regions using elliptical Kron and Petrosian matched apertures .
As a master , the clock module sends out messages in response to an external synchronization signal over a serial fiber optic line .	As a slave , it receives the messages and interrupts an associated computer in its VME crate .
Be/X-ray binary systems exhibit both periodic ( Type I ) X-ray outbursts and giant ( Type II ) outbursts , whose origin has remained elusive .	We suggest that Type II X-ray outbursts occur when a highly misaligned decretion disk around the Be star becomes eccentric , allowing the compact object companion to capture a large amount of material at periastron .
A system of conductivity sensors was deployed to monitor the propagation of a tracer plume in the structure , including tracer trapping inside some compartments and its release to the outside environment through the external openings .	The experimental data is processed by employing the ideas of scaling and self-similarity of underlying transport processes .
We introduce a relativistic splitting structure as a means to map fields and equations of electromagnetism from curved four-dimensional space-time to three-dimensional observer 's space .	We focus on a minimal set of mathematical structures that are directly motivated by the language of the physical theory .
This paper provides a nonparametric analysis for several classes of models , with cases such as classical measurement error , regression with errors in variables , factor models and other models that may be represented in a form involving convolution equations .	The focus here is on conditions for existence of solutions , nonparametric identification and well-posedness in the space of generalized functions ( tempered distributions ) .
The paper tries to point out the benefits that can be derived from research advances in the implementation of concepts such as ambient intelligence ( AmI ) and ubiquitous or pervasive computing for promoting Universal Access ( UA ) to the Information Society , that is , for contributing to enable everybody , especially Physically Disabled ( PD ) people , to have easy access to all computing resources and information services that the coming worldwide Information Society will soon make available to the general public .	Following definitions of basic concepts relating to multimodal interaction , the significant contribution of multimodality to developing UA is briefly argued .
We discuss also a new setting where the experts can give advice conditional on the learner 's future decision .	Both the algorithms can be adapted to the new setting and give the same performance guarantees as in the traditional setting .
Selected recent information-theoretic works dealing directly with such channels are reviewed .	Finally , several characteristics of the still unknown limiting spectrum of such matrices are listed , and some reflections are touched upon .
The students attending the school had very different backgrounds , some of them were doing their Ph.D. in experimental particle physics , others in theory .	As a result , and in order to make the lectures useful for most of the students , we focused on basic topics of broad interest , avoiding the more technical aspects of Flavour Physics and CP Violation .
We do not find variability with the previously claimed orbital period of V745 Sco .	This voids previous findings based on this value ( e.g.the distance determination ) .
We mainly focus our attention on a previously constructed model .	We show how , with few minor modifications and by relaxing the requirement of SO ( 4,1 ) symmetry , a potentially realistic model can be obtained with a moderate tuning in the parameter space of the theory .
We have developed the Grid of RSG and AGB ModelS ( GRAMS ) to measure the mass-loss return from evolved stars .	The models span the range of stellar , dust shell and grain properties relevant to evolved stars .
The thermal conductivity is of the order for intermetallics , larger than that of borocarbides and smaller than $ MgB_2 $ .	In the normal state , the electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity is slightly larger than the lattice contribution .
We confirm the previously-reported excess of co-rotating satellite pairs located near diametric opposition with respect to the host , but show that this signal is unlikely to be due to rotating discs ( or planes ) of satellites .	In particular , no overabundance of co-rotating satellites pairs is observed within $ \sim 20^ { \circ } -50^ { \circ } $ of direct opposition , as would be expected for planar distributions inclined relative to the line-of-sight .
A summary is given of an analysis of the Hipparcos trigonometrical parallaxes and proper motions of classical Cepheids .	It is possible for the first time to derive zero-points for the period-luminosity and period-luminosity-colour relations from parallaxes alone , avoiding the problems of less direct methods .
We present both experimental and theoretical investigations of a laser-driven quantum dot ( QD ) in the dressed-state regime of resonance fluorescence .	We explore the role of phonon scattering and pure dephasing on the detuning-dependence of the Mollow triplet and show that the triplet sidebands may spectrally broaden or narrow with increasing detuning .
We study the mechanism behind dynamical trappings experienced during Wang-Landau sampling of continuous systems reported by several authors .	Trapping is caused by the random walker coming close to a local energy extremum , although the mechanism is different from that of critical slowing down encountered in conventional molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations .
By pointing out an error in the previous derivation of the area spectrum based on Ashtekar 's variables , we suggest a new area spectrum ; instead of the norm of Ashtekar 's gravitational electric field , we show that the norm of our `` new '' gravitational electric field based on our `` newer '' variables , which we construct in this paper for this purpose , gives the correct area spectrum .	In particular , our `` newer '' variables are mathematically consistent ; the constraint algebra is closed .
A key component of the Sanford Underground Research Facility ( SURF ) is the Davis Campus , which is in operation at the 4850-foot level ( 4300 m.w.e . )	and currently hosts two main physics projects : the LUX dark matter experiment and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment .
We find that in an experimentally accessible low temperature regime the symmetry allowed spin orbit potential converts graphene from an ideal two dimensional semimetallic state to a quantum spin Hall insulator .	This novel electronic state of matter is gapped in the bulk and supports the quantized transport of spin and charge in gapless edge states that propagate at the sample boundaries .
To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia spectral energy distribution ( SED ) , we outline a prescription for deriving a mean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneous sample of observed spectra .	We then remove the effects of broad-band colors and measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the diversity in spectral features .
Phys.-JETP Vol.61 ( 1985 ) 843 .	This is due to the fact that the gap vanishes in quadratic manner around the point on the Fermi surface .
Such a model can capture the main features of the interaction but because of the complexity of the environment we can not assume that it is fully accurate .	We study the robustness of quantum error correction operations against completely unexpected and subsequently undetermined type of channel uncertainties .
We are undertaking a multi-frequency Expanded Very Large Array ( EVLA ) survey of edge-on protoplanetary disks to probe the growth of solids in each disk , sedimentation of such material into the disk midplane , and the connection of these phenomena to the planet formation process .	The projection of edge-on disk systems along our line of sight enables a study of the vertical stratification of large grains with fewer model dependencies than would be required for disks that are more face-on .
We explore some consequences of the `` alpha model , '' also called the `` Lagrangian-averaged '' model , for two-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD ) turbulence .	This model is an extension of the smoothing procedure in fluid dynamics which filters velocity fields locally while leaving their associated vorticities unsmoothed , and has proved useful for high Reynolds number turbulence computations .
Nonlinear imaging systems can surpass the limits of linear optics , but to date they have all relied on physical media ( e.g.crystals ) to work .	These materials are all constrained by their physical properties , such as frequency selectivity , environmental sensitivity , time behavior , and fixed nonlinear response .
We show that the wave type field equation is satisfied by the pseudo-conformal frame if the conformal factor is determined by a scalar 3D-harmonic function .	This function can be related to the Newtonian potential of classical gravity .
Allowing the black hole to approach extremality we found that all fields of the vortex are expelled from the extreme black hole .	In the thin string limit we obtained the metric of a conical electrically charged dilaton black hole .
For the flat wall , interfacial free energies as a function of different densities of the LJ liquid and as a function of temperature along the coexistence curve are calculated .	In case of a structured wall , the interaction strength between the wall and the LJ system and the lattice constant of the structured wall are varied .
An English translation of the report by the latter was given before ( Stephenson & amp ; Green 2002 ) , but the original Arabic text was not yet published .	In addition , we present for the first time the earlier report , also from Yemen , namely by al-Yamani in its original Arabic and with our English translation .
We consider the relationship between ballistic and diffusive transport , the effect of different transport regimes on spin polarization measurements , and the importance of unambiguous identification of the type of transport regime .	We find that in a realistic parameter range , the analysis of PCAR spectra of purely diffusive character by a ballistic model yield approximately the same ( within ~3 % ) values of the spin polarization and the barrier strength Z larger by ~ 0.5-0.6 .
However , prior work shows that this approach to pairing can be prone to human errors of different forms that may directly or indirectly translate into man-in-the-middle attacks .	To address this problem , we propose a general direction of the use of computer games for pairing .
This paper is concerned with the development and analysis of an iterative solver for high-dimensional second-order elliptic problems based on subspace-based low-rank tensor formats .	Both the subspaces giving rise to low-rank approximations and corresponding sparse approximations of lower-dimensional tensor components are determined adaptively .
We present hydrodynamical simulations , using a 2-D two component model ( ambient medium and pul sar wind have different specific heat ratios ) , of bow shocks in a representative regime for pu lsar wind driven bow-shock nebulae .	We also investigate the behaviour of a passive toroidal ma gnetic field wound around the pulsar velocity direction .
In this case , $ \mathnormal { \Phi } $ can be written as a weighted composition operator : $ \mathnormal { \Phi } f ( y ) =\mathnormal { \Pi } ( y ) ( f ( \varphi ( y ) ) ) $ , where $ \varphi $ is a homeomorphism from $ Y $ onto $ X $ , and $ \mathnormal { \Pi } ( y ) $ is a Riesz isomorphism from $ E $ onto $ F $ for every $ y $ in $ Y $ .	This generalizes some known results obtained recently .
We also study in detail the type of singularities in the projection of the transported measure in configuration space ( averaging out the momentum variable ) .	We study the conditions under which this projected measure can have atoms , and give an example in which the projected measure is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and diffuse .
Unlike Ising-like models with short-range interactions , domains always grow from the corners of the system .	The present clustering mechanism provides an insight into the switching dynamics of SC solids , in particular , in nano-scale systems .
We demonstrate that traditional estimators of correlation , which rely on averaging products , exhibit large and paradoxical noise when the correlation is strong .	However , we also show that these estimators are fully optimal in the limit of vanishing correlation .
Google 's Android is a comprehensive software framework for mobile communication devices ( i.e. , smartphones , PDAs ) .	The Android framework includes an operating system , middleware and a set of key applications .
Flow cytometry ( FC ) is a single-cell profiling platform for measuring the phenotypes of individual cells from millions of cells in biological samples .	FC employs high-throughput technologies and generates high-dimensional data , and hence algorithms for analyzing the data represent a bottleneck .
This leads to the `` gluing equations '' and the Neumann-Zagier symplectic space .	Building on the works of Dimofte-Gabella-Goncharov and Bergeron-Falbel-Guilloux , we complete the picture in the case of PGL ( n , C ) .
The four-state model is also employed to exhibit the vacuum-Rabi splitting and to calculate the optical spectrum .	We next extend this model to incorporate the relevant Zeeman hyperfine states as well as a simple description of the pumping processes in the presence of polarization gradients and atomic motion .
Here the experimentally relevant cases of 1D stripe patterns and 2D square lattice symmetry are considered .	The nucleation properties in the transition region depend in a complex way on the parameters of the system , i.e.the flux , the surface diffusion constant , the geometric properties of the pattern and the desorption rate .
They serve only as place holders .	The representation is based on the distribution of four types of systems on an integer lattice .
We consider the `` combinatorial Fermi problem '' of estimating h given the citation count .	Using the Euler-Gauss identity for integer partitions , we compute confidence intervals .
Quasiparticles simultaneously counterflow resulting in zero total electric current through the contact .	The Josephson oscillations can be accompanied by Carlson-Goldman collective modes leading to a resonance in the voltage oscillation amplitude .
In this paper , we propose a GP Regression model with a latent variable that serves as an additional unobserved covariate for the regression .	This model ( which we call GPLC ) allows for heteroscedasticity since it allows the function to have a changing partial derivative with respect to this unobserved covariate .
The transition between these two states was often detected .	Observation shows that the transition luminosity between these two states is different for different sources , ranging from 1 % to 4 % of the Eddington luminosity .
We use this relation to transform the measured velocity widths of 32 LBGs to the distribution of circular velocities , for the population of LBGs brighter than R=25.5 .	We compare this distribution against the predicted distribution for the 'massive-halo ' model in which LBGs pinpoint all of the highest mass dark matter haloes at that epoch .
A numerical method is given for finding spherically symmetric compactly supported potentials which produce practically the same set of fixed-energy phase shifts for all values of angular momentum .	Concrete example of such potentials is given .
In particular , there exist infinitely many strings of k consecutive integers whose phi-values are arranged from largest to smallest in any prescribed manner .	Also , under the necessary condition ad \ne bc , any inequality of the form phi ( an+b ) & lt ; phi ( cn+d ) infinitely often has k consecutive solutions .
It is commonly believed that decoherence is the main obstacle to quantum information processing .	In contrast to this , we show how decoherence in the form of dissipation can improve the performance of certain quantum gates .
In addition to their large enhancements of carbon all three stars exhibit strong enhancements of the s-process elements relative to iron .	HE 1305+0007 exhibits a large enhancement of the 3rd-peak s-process element lead , with [ Pb/Fe ] = +2.37 , as well as a high abundance of the r-process element europium , [ Eu/Fe ] = +1.97 .
The energy density was connected with the energy flux by continuity equation .	New method was proposed to deal with multi -- body interaction .
We shall prove the existence of game value under natural conditions .	Another main feature of the paper is that we allow for non-Markovian structure , and thus the game value is a random process .
We provide a theoretical framework to describe the interaction of a propagating guided matter wave with a localized potential in terms of quantum scattering in a confined environment .	We analyze how this scattering correlates the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom and work out analytically the output state under the Born approximation using a Gaussian localized potential .
Results are presented to provide observational data with which to compare theoretical predictions .	The results in this paper confirm previously suggested relationships between C , C/O and s-process element enhancements .
Therefore , to apply the diquark picture to the phenomenological calculations , at the effective vertices for the diquark-gauge boson interactions , suitable form factors must be introduced to compensate the effects caused by the inner structure of the diquark .	It is crucial to derive the appropriate form factors for various interactions .
In addition , services from heterogeneous , possibly unknown sources may be used .	This motivates a need to ensure the correct behaviour of the adapted systems , and its continuing compliance to time bounds and other QoS properties .
We study the properties of emission bursts in which an amount of energy $ E $ is released .	The analysis shows that the size of the energy bursts has a minimum when the system is half-way from the collapse point .
The following notes provide an introduction to recent work of Branner , Hubbard and Yoccoz on the geometry of polynomial Julia sets .	They are an expanded version of lectures given in Stony Brook in Spring 1992 .
The microstate consists of a black string microstate with an additional D6-brane .	We show that with an appropriate choice of parameters the piece involving the black string microstate falls down a long AdS throat , whose M-theory lift is AdS_3 X S^2 .
Recent study of gamma rays originating from the region of galactic centre has confirmed an anomalous $ \gamma $ -ray excess within the energy range 1-3 GeV .	This can be explained as the consequence of pair annihilation of a 31-40 GeV dark matter into $ b \bar b $ with thermal annihilation cross-section $ \sigma v \sim 1.4-2.0 \times 10^ { -26 } ~\rm { cm^3/s } $ .
We have mapped this region , which comprises four distinct molecular clouds spanning a wide range of star-formation activity , in four transitions : 13CO ( 1-0 ) CO ( 2-1 ) and ( 4-3 ) , and [ CI ] ( 1-0 ) .	Combining these data with existing [ CII ] observations provides a complete picture of the predominant forms of carbon in the gas phase of the ISM .
We naturally also obtain variants of all these methods using blocks and importance sampling .	However , our method allows for a much wider selection of these two parameters , which leads to a number of new specific methods .
$ \ell_1 $ regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity ( i.e. , there are no connections between points from different subspaces ) under broad theoretical conditions , but the clusters may not be connected .	$ \ell_2 $ and nuclear norm regularization often improve connectivity , but give a subspace-preserving affinity only for independent subspaces .
Here , we map the Landau spectrum by angle-resolved magnetostriction , and quantify the carrier number in each valley : while the electron valleys keep identical spectra , they substantially differ in their density of states at the Fermi level .	Thus , the electron fluid does not keep the rotational symmetry of the lattice at low temperature and high magnetic field , even in the absence of internal strain .
We analyze the resultant RG equations , derive an analytical condition for such a drive to take the system out of the gaussian regime , and show that the onset of the non-gaussian regime occurs concomitantly with appearance of non-perturbative mode coupling terms in the effective action of the system .	We supplement the above-mentioned results by obtaining them from equations of motions of the bosons and discuss their significance for systems near critical points described by time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg theories .
Ten new low mass companions have emerged from the Keck precision Doppler velocity survey , with minimum ( msini ) masses ranging from 0.8 mjup to 0.34 msun .	Five of these are planet candidates with msini & lt ; 12 mjup , two are brown dwarf candidates with msini ~30 mjup , and three are low mass stellar companions .
Information carried by these particles characterize their sources , but such information are affected by the trajectories of the carriers .	Recently , it is shown that these trajectories are spin dependent .
The standard theory of metals , Fermi liquid theory , hinges on the key assumption that although the electrons interact , the low-energy excitation spectrum stands in a one-to-one correspondence with that of a non-interacting system .	In the normal state of the copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors , drastic deviations from the Fermi liquid picture obtain , highlighted by a pseudogap , broad spectral features and $ T- $ linear resistivity .
One of the main research areas in Bayesian Nonparametrics is the proposal and study of priors which generalize the Dirichlet process .	Here we exploit theoretical properties of Poisson random measures in order to provide a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of random probabilities which are obtained by an appropriate normalization .
Considering regular `` open '' LTB models whose space slices allow for a diverging $ \ell $ , we provide the conditions on the radial coordinate so that its asymptotic limit corresponds to the limit as $ \ell\to\infty $ .	The `` asymptotic state '' is then defined as this limit , together with asymptotic series expansion around it , evaluated for all metric functions , covariant scalars ( local and quasi-local ) and their fluctuations .
However , the existence and the onset of a dynamo happen to depend on the exact experimental configuration .	By performing kinematic dynamo simulations on real flows , we study their influence on dynamo action , in particular the sense of rotation and the presence of an annulus in the shear layer plane .
With the advent of the infrared space observatories , this definition has been extended to the mid-infrared .	We show that the softness parameters , as determined both in the optical and the mid-infrared wavelengths , are sensitive to the effective temperature using a sample of data in both spectral regimes .
According to theoretical simulations and experimental results the TM-rich regions appear either in the form of nanodots ( the { \em dairiseki } phase ) or nanocolumns ( the { \em konbu } phase ) buried in the host semiconductor .	Particular attention is paid to Mn-doped group III arsenides and antimonides , TM-doped group III nitrides , Mn- and Fe-doped Ge , and Cr-doped group II chalcogenides , in which ferromagnetic features persisting up to above room temperature correlate with the presence of nanodecomposition and account for the application-relevant magneto-optical and magnetotransport properties of these compounds .
Further , we have Monte-Carlo simulated the data from this run on a star-by-star basis to produce robust detection constraints .	These simulations demonstrate clear differences in the exoplanet detectability functions from star to star due to differences in sampling , data quality and intrinsic stellar stability .
These high-resolution observations provide essential information on jet emission and propagation within the inner parsec of an AGN jet .	We present the results of a kinematic study performed within the framework of the Southern-hemisphere AGN monitoring program TANAMI .
We investigate the dynamics of spon- taneous or triggered cavitation inside water filled microcavities of a hydrogel .	Results show that a stable bubble is created in only a microsecond timescale , after transient oscillations .
There exists a threshold coupling above which the kaon condensate forms at densities exceeding some critical value .	This is in contrast to the case of rising symmetry energy , as e.g.for relativistic mean field models , when the kaon condensate can form for any coupling at a sufficiently high density .
The discussion of the orthogonality for such a sesquilinear form includes , among others , matrix Hankel cases with linear functionals , general matrix Sobolev orthogonality and discrete orthogonal polynomials with an infinite support .	The first transformation considered is that of Geronimus type , two different methods are developed .
The clumps may form by gravitational instabilities in gas-rich turbulent disks ; they do not appear to be separate galaxies merging together .	We show here that the formation of the observed clumps requires initial disks of gas and stars with almost no stabilizing bulge or stellar halo .
The relative importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors determining the variety of geometric shapes exhibited by dendritic trees remains unclear .	This question was addressed by developing a model of the growth of dendritic trees based on diffusion-limited aggregation process .
Supersymmetry breaking sector is based on the model with an Affine quantum moduli space .	The model has no gauge messengers and no light scalars charged under the Standard Model which give a negative contribution to the soft masses .
Microscopic description of phase transitions is notoriously difficult because of the absence of small parameters .	Here we present a general approach allowing to treat situations , when there are no small parameters .
In addition to the two color-singlet $ S $ -wave states , we also discuss the production of the four color-singlet $ P $ -wave states $ | ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) ( ^1P_1 ) _ { \bf 1 } & gt ; $ and $ ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) ( ^3P_J ) _ { \bf 1 } & gt ; $ ( with $ J= ( 1,2,3 ) $ ) together with the two color-octet components $ | ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) ( ^1S_0 ) _ { \bf 8 } & gt ; $ and $ | ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) ( ^3S_1 ) _ { \bf 8 } & gt ; $ .	Improved trace technology is adopted to derive the simplified analytic expressions at the amplitude level , which shall be useful for dealing with the following cascade decay channels .
However , for a new result it is also pointed out that the cosmological evolution of the 3-brane in the model of Dvali , Gabadadze and Porrati may follow the standard Friedmann equation.Contents : 1 .	Introduction 2 .
This resolves a conjecture of Bohman and Keevash for the K_4-free process and improves on previous bounds obtained by Bollob\'as and Riordan and by Osthus and Taraz .	Combined with results of Bohman and Keevash this shows that with high probability G has $ \Theta ( n^ { 8/5 } \sqrt [ 5 ] { \log n } ) $ edges and is `nearly regular ' , i.e. , every vertex has degree $ \Theta ( n^ { 3/5 } \sqrt [ 5 ] { \log n } ) $ .
Superconductors are predicted to be macroscopic quantum gravitational antennas and transducers , which can directly convert upon reflection a beam of quadrupolar electromagnetic radiation into gravitational radiation , and vice versa , and thus serve as both sources and receivers of gravitational waves .	An estimate of the transducer conversion efficiency on the order of unity comes out of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for an extreme type II , dissipationless superconductor with minimal coupling to weak gravitational and electromagnetic radiation fields , whose frequency is smaller than the BCS gap frequency , thus satisfying the quantum adiabatic theorem .
We investigate relevant deformation and the renormalization group flow in a defect conformal field theory from the point of view of the holography .	We propose a candidate of g-function in the context of the holography , and prove the g-theorem : the g-function is monotonically non-increasing along the RG flow .
In this paper , we introduce a definition of BV functions in a Gelfand triple which is an extension of the definition of BV functions in [ 2 ] by using Dirichlet form theory .	By this definition , we can consider the stochastic reflection problem associated with a self-adjoint operator $ A $ and a cylindrical Wiener process on a convex set $ \Gamma $ in a Hilbert space $ H $ .
Besides the effect of variation of the refractive index on the transport of radiative intensity , the curved ray trajectory will induce geometrical effects on the transport of polarization ellipse .	This paper presents a complete derivation of vector radiative transfer equation for polarized radiation transport in absorption , emission and scattering graded index media .
More importantly , sphingolipid metabolism disorders were observed in various pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegeneration .	Results : Existing formal models of sphingolipids metabolism concentrates mostly on de novo ceramide synthesis or restrict their focus to biochemical transformations of a particular subspecies .
We model the polymer { \sl via } the continuum Frank elastic free energy augmented by a simple density dependent part as well as by taking proper care of the connectivity of the polymer chains when compared with simple nematics .	The free energy { \sl ansatz } is capable of describing an orientational ordering transition within the sample between an isotropic polymer solution and a polymer nematic phase .
This is the first measurement of this effect in a complete gravitational wave interferometer .	Only one of the two angular modes survives with feedback control , since the other mode is suppressed when the control gain is sufficiently large .
Using 2766 binding energies of nuclei with $ Z\geq 8 $ and $ N\geq 8 $ it is shown that the performance of the new approach is improved by a factor of about 6 , compared to the previously published liquid drop model results , in terms of both the masses ( new r.m.s .	deviation $ & lt ; \delta M & gt ; = 0.698 $ MeV ) and the fission barriers ( new r.m.s .
The main point is that chemical potential of substance , $ \mu $ , plays role of ruling parameter in basic GCC-dependence of internal energy under compression , $ U = U ( \mu ) $ , in contrast to the standard form $ U = U ( \rho ) $ .	This substitution changes radically low-density ( `` gaseous '' ) part of GCC .
Namely , we remove smoothness and quasiprojectivity assumptions on $ X $ and $ S $ and work with t-structures that are not necessarily Noetherian but are close to Noetherian in the appropriate sense .	The main new tool is the construction of induced t-structures that uses unbounded derived categories of quasicoherent sheaves and relies on the results of \cite { AJS } .
These asymmetries or line shifts are caused predominantly by vertical mass motions in flaring layers and they provide a good diagnostics for plasma flows during solar flares .	There are many controversial results of observations and theoretical analysis of plasma flows in solar chromospheric flares .
However , the possible implications of spin-active interfaces in Cooper pair splitters so far have not been investigated .	We analyse the current and the cross correlation of currents in a superconductor ferromagnet beamsplitter including spin-active scattering .
We study the dynamics of $ \phi^4 $ theory and the FPU $ \beta $ model under thermal gradients , from first principles .	We analyze quantitatively how local equilibrium and linear response are violated , paying special care to how we find observables that unambiguously display these violations .
The orthoperovskites TbCoO $ _3 $ and DyCoO $ _3 $ with Co $ ^ { 3+ } $ in a non-magnetic low-spin state have been investigated by neutron diffraction down to 0.25 K. Magnetic ordering is evidenced below $ T_N=3.3 $ K and 3.6 K , respectively , and the ordered arrangements are of canted type , A $ _x $ G $ _y $ for TbCoO $ _3 $ and G $ _x $ A $ _y $ for DyCoO $ _3 $ in Bertaut 's notation .	The experiments are confronted with the first-principle calculations of the crystal field and magnetism of Tb $ ^ { 3+ } $ and Dy $ ^ { 3+ } $ ions , located in the $ Pbnm $ structure on sites of $ C_s $ point symmetry .
We show the effectiveness of using the procedure of the potential reconstruction ( the V-method ) in the estimation of the transition redshift corresponding to switch from deceleration to acceleration phase of the Universe .	We investigate the FRW models with dark energy by applying the particle-like description of their dynamics .
We provide a comprehensive analytic study ( rigorous and qualitative ) of the conditions for the existence of a a positive kinematic back reaction term $ \QQ & gt ; 0 $ , in the context of Buchert 's scalar averaging formalism applied to spherically symmetric Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi ( LTB ) dust solutions in which averaging domains are given as spherical comoving regions containing a symmetry center .	We introduce proper volume and quasi-local average functionals and functions in order to examine the conditions for $ \QQ\geq 0 $ , and in the process we also explore the relation between back reaction , spatial curvature and binding energy for a wide variety of LTB configurations .
We calculate the gravitational radiation emitted by an infinite cosmic string with two oppositely moving wave-trains , in the small amplitude approximation .	After comparing our result to the previously studied cases we extend the results to a new regime where the wavelengths of the opposing wave-trains are very different .
Vacuum polarization effects make the physics of this atom at finite temperature very close to that of heavy quarkonium states .	We comment on the implications of our results for these states in the quark gluon plasma .
Here we comment why the results from Cilibrizzi et al .	take place in a very different regime than previous investigations on dark soliton nucleation and do not reproduce all the signatures of its rich nonlinear phenomenology .
Such study provides a foundation of knowledge for interpreting observations of more distant galaxies and their environment .	The Astro 2010 Science Frontier Galactic Neighborhood Panel identified four key scientific questions : 1 ) What are the flows of matter and energy in the circumgalactic medium ?
FIGARCH is essentially governed by a system of nonlinear stochastic difference equations $ { u_t } $ = $ { z_t } $ $ ( 1-\sum\limits_ { j=1 } ^q \beta_j L^j ) \sigma_ { t } ^2 = \omega+ ( 1-\sum\limits_ { j=1 } ^q \beta_j L^j - ( \sum\limits_ { k=1 } ^p \varphi_k L^k ) ( 1-L ) ^d ) u_t^2 $ , where $ \omega\in $ R , and $ \beta_j\in $ R are constant parameters , $ \ { u_t\ } _ { { t\in } ^+ } $ and $ \ { \sigma_t\ } _ { { t\in } ^+ } $ are the discrete time real valued stochastic processes which represent FIGARCH ( p , d , q ) and stochastic volatility , respectively .	Moreover , L is the backward shift operator , i.e. $ L^d u_t \equiv u_ { t-d } $ ( d is the fractional differencing parameter 0 $ & lt ; $ d $ & lt ; $ 1 ) .
Besides , motivated by the need of traceability , collecting production data is now commonplace in most companies .	Our paper aims to show that we can ensure the required quality thanks to an `` on-line quality approch '' and proposes a neural network based process to determine the optimal setting for production machines .
Growing dynamic length scales due to cooperative motion of particles are believed to be central to the understanding of both the slow dynamics and the emergence of rigidity .	Here , we provide experimental evidence of a growing dynamical heterogeneity length scale that increases with increasing waiting time in an aging colloidal glass of Laponite .
An interesting feature of the interface group is that it allows for distinguishing between expectations and promises in interfaces of process components .	This distinction comes into play in case components with both client and server behaviour are involved .
USA realizations are found for $ \alpha $ -values that approach $ \alpha=1 $ from above with increasing number of spins $ N $ .	We consider small spin numbers in $ 2 \le N \le 18 $ .
The oscillation behavior is very different from the case of a single junction .	Depending on the stack lateral size , oscillations may have either the period of half flux quantum per junction ( wide-stack regime ) or one flux quantum per junction ( narrow-stack regime ) .
We consider a class of topological objects in the 3-sphere $ S^3 $ which will be called { \it $ n $ -punctured ball tangles } .	Using the Kauffman bracket at $ A=e^ { \pi i/4 } $ , an invariant for a special type of $ n $ -punctured ball tangles is defined .
By mapping the two-dimensional linear stability theory into a one-dimensional eigenfunction problem for an ordinary differential equation , we solve the problem numerically .	We demonstrate agreement between the numerics and analytics , and show convergence to the known results at both small and large $ \kappa $ .
As these predictions are based on poorly understood binary interaction processes , it is of prime importance to confront the predictions to observational data .	In this contribution we aim to determine the absolute dimensions of the long-period sdB+MS binary system PG1104+243 .
The characteristics of the JHK spectra are very similar to those observed in a nova outburst occurring on a carbon-oxygen white dwarf .	We analyse an observed line at 2.088 micron and suggest it could be due to FeII excited by Lyman alpha fluorescence .
However , the real crystal structure of the LOFF phase is still unclear because an exact treatment of 3D crystal structures is rather difficult .	In this work we present a solid-state-like calculation of the ground-state energy of the body-centered cubic ( BCC ) structure for two-flavor pairing by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the Bloch space without assuming a small amplitude of the order parameter .
The 5/2- states attributed to the the f5/2 orbital and positive parity 5/2+ and 7/2+ states from the g9/2 orbital have been identified in both 71,73Ni .	In 71Ni the location of a 1/2- { \beta } -decaying isomer is proposed and limits are suggested as to the location of the isomer in 73Ni .
Due to the massively parallel nature of GPU hardware , Fireflies is able to simulate millions of trajectories in parallel ( even on standard desktop computer hardware ) , producing `` swarms '' of particles that move around the screen in real-time according to the equations of the system .	Particles that move forwards in time reveal stable attractors ( e.g.fixed points and limit cycles ) , while the option of integrating another group of trajectories backwards in time can reveal unstable objects ( repellers ) .
Muon spin rotation ( { \mu } +SR ) measurements of square-root second moments of local magnetic fields { \sigma } in superconducting mixed states , as published for oriented crystals and powder samples of YBa2Cu3O7- { \delta } ( { \delta } { \approx } 0.05 ) , YBa2Cu4O8 and La2-xSrxCuO4 ( x ~ 0.15-0.17 ) , are subjected to comparative analysis for superconducting gap symmetry .	For oriented crystals it is shown that anomalous dependences of { \sigma } on temperature T and applied field H , as-measured and extracted a- and b-axial components , are attributable to fluxon depinning and disorder that obscure the intrinsic character of the superconducting penetration depth .
We describe in greater detail approaches which have not been covered in recent `` Quantum Gravity Phenomenology '' reviews .	In particular , we outline a new framework for describing Lorentz invariance violation in the Maxwell sector .
Gap solitons in a nonlinear oppositely directional coupler with one channel or both channels fabricated from nonlinear medium having negative refraction index are discussed .	Generalization of the usually waveguide array is zigzag array .
These are shown to be long lived metastable states that are qualitatively far from eigenstates of the true Hamiltonian .	Extensions of this give an explicit description of phonon oscillations in terms of the wavefunction itself and some consequences for the general validity of the quasiparticle picture are presented .
We show that the period of these oscillations , and their exponential decrease with the distance to the singularity , are fully determined by the position and the width of the roton minimum .	Only an overall amplitude factor and a phase shift are shown to depend on the details of the interaction potential .
We recall our attempts to use distribution functions with a memory of self-similar relaxation , but mostly they apply only in restricted regions of the global system .	We are forced to consider related distribution functions that are steady but not self-similar.Results .
In this paper we develop a variation of the direct imaging correlator we call the MOFF correlator .	The MOFF correlator shares the computational advantages of a direct imaging correlator , while avoiding a number of its shortcomings .
There are four older star-forming regions in the tail , and an underlying disk with a photometric age of ~1 Gyr .	The mass distribution function of 61 star clusters is a power law with a slope of -1.73+-0.51 .
We explain this field dependence by the quenched random fields and coupling between the orientable dipoles with average polarization .	For crystals with 0.06 & lt ; x & lt ; 0.13 , the T-E phase diagrams are constructed , which include the relaxor , ferroelectric , glass and mixed ferroelectric-glass phases .
The system also shows two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless ( BKT ) transitions for the different physical situation of the system .	The presence of single Rabi frequency oscillation in the system leads to the BKT transition where system shows the quantum phase transition from photonic metallic state to the Coulomb blocked induced insulating phase .
We perform a complete numerical simulation including systematics , correlations , and degeneracies on an equal footing for all experiments using the GLoBES software .	After discussing the improvement of our knowledge on the atmospheric parameters $ \theta_ { 23 } $ and $ \Delta m^2_ { 31 } $ by these experiments , we investigate the potential to determine $ \theta_ { 13 } $ within the next ten years in detail .
We examine the microscopics of two processes which are key for energy transport , focusing on the unusual behavior arising due to graphene 's unique combination of material properties .	One is hot carrier generation in its photoexcitation dynamics , where hot carriers multiply through an Auger type carrier-carrier scattering cascade .
Such effects are observed for the non-ballistic ( not spectral ) regime of current flow in the nanocontacts .	Thus , the current induced magneto-conductance effects in multilayered N -- F structures ( nanopillars ) extensively studied in the recent literature have much more general character and can be stimulated by elastic electron scattering at single N -- F interfaces .
The problem is reformulated as a sum-of-absolute-values ( SOAV ) optimization that can be efficiently solved by the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm ( FISTA ) .	The proximity operator for the convex optimization is derived analytically .
A simple metamaterial-based wide-angle plasmonic absorber is introduced , fabricated , and experimentally characterized using angle-resolved infrared spectroscopy .	The metamaterials are prepared by nano-imprint lithography , an attractive low-cost technology for making large-area samples .
Features of a topological phase , and edge states in particular , may be obscured by overlapping in energy with a trivial conduction band .	The topological nature of such a conductor , however , is revealed in its transport properties , especially in the presence of disorder .
In resolving instances of a computational problem , if multiple instances of interest share a feature in common , it may be fruitful to compile this feature into a format that allows for more efficient resolution , even if the compilation is relatively expensive .	In this article , we introduce a formal framework for classifying problems according to their compilability .
( Abridged ) Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to be associated with powerful shock fronts that originate during cluster mergers , and are a testbed for the acceleration of relativistic particles in the intracluster medium .	Recently , radio relic observations have pushed into the cm-wavelength domain ( 1-30 GHz ) where a break from the standard synchrotron power-law spectrum has been found , most noticeably in the famous 'Sausage ' relic .
We present a catalog of 374 carefully chosen stars among the all-sky network of infrared sources provided by Cohen et al.1999 .	The catalog benefits from a very good sky coverage and a median formal error on the angular diameters of only 1.2 % .
In this work , we examine exact black hole configurations in vector-tensor theories , originally proposed to explain dark energy by breaking the Abelian symmetry with a non-minimal coupling of the vector to gravity .	We are able to evade the no-go theorems by Bekenstein on the existence of regular black holes in vector-tensor theories with Proca mass terms , and exhibit regular black hole solutions with a profile for the longitudinal vector polarization , characterised by an additional charge .
Snyder has shown that if $ e & gt ; 1 $ , then $ |G| $ is bounded by a function of $ e $ .	This bound has been improved by Isaacs and by Durfee and Jensen .
The baryon number is almost conserved at zero temperature by means of a localization mechanism recently analyzed by Arkani-Hamed and Schmaltz : leptons and quarks are located at two slightly displaced positions in the extra space , and this naturally suppresses the interactions which `` convert '' the latter in the former .	We show that this is expected to be no longer true when finite temperature effects are taken into account .
Furthermore , we present our tool PaREM that accepts regular expressions and finite automata as input and automatically generates the corresponding code for our algorithm that is amenable for parallel execution on shared-memory systems .	We evaluate our parallel algorithm empirically by comparing it with a commonly used algorithm for sequential regular expression matching .
Then , we review the recent progress on materials realization of 3DTI including simple elements , binary compounds , ternary compounds , and quaternary compounds .	In these potential host materials , some of them have already been confirmed by experiments while the others are not yet .
We investigate the viability of thermal leptogenesis in type-I seesaw models with leptonic flavour symmetries that lead to tribimaximal neutrino mixing .	We consider an effective theory with an A4 x Z3 x Z4 symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale .
It is made explicit in the special cases when k is real closed respectively algebraically closed .	Furthermore , we discuss the generalisation of this problem to representations of quivers .
In many cases , in the investigation of natural processes , stochasticity arises every time one considers the dynamics of a system in contact with a somehow bigger system , an environment , that is considered in thermal equilibrium .	Any small fluctuation of the environment has some random effect on the system .
The presence of these disks can be revealed by their blackbody spectrum in the infrared , optical and UV bands .	We present a re-reduction of the archival optical and infrared data of the Vela pulsar , together with the existing infrared and UV spectrum of Vela , and model their unpulsed components with the blackbody spectrum of a supernova debris disk .
The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature .	The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time ( or function calls per independent sample ) .
All ammonia absorption lines have two distinct velocity components : one is at the systemic velocity and the other is blueshifted , and both components are aligned along the nuclear jets .	For the systemic components , the relatively low temperature gas is extended more than the high temperature gas .
Precisely how the theory can describe bulk physics using only surface degrees of freedom is not well understood .	A particularly paradoxical situation involves an event deep in the interior of the bulk space .
Both NGC 1333 and NGC 2068 have no previously-published analysis of near-infrared spectra .	Our study reveals that the rotational-vibrational states of molecular hydrogen in NGC 1333 are populated quite differently from NGC 2023 and NGC 7023 .
More precisely , we develop the theory of connections on Lie groupoid $ G $ -extensions , which we call `` connections on gerbes '' , and study the induced connections on various associated bundles .	We also prove analogues of the Bianchi identities .
On average , the high-redshift infrared-active galaxies are slightly more asymmetric than the less-active ones , although they do include a significantly higher portion of highly asymmetric ( merging ? )	systems and a lower portion of more concentrated , symmetric ones .
Both the classic data and more recent results are considered .	While the data can be fitted to the inverse square-root dependence excellently ( but using two free fitting parameters for each dataset ) , it is also consistent with a dependence on the simple inverse of grain size ( with one free fitting parameter for each dataset ) .
We present some weak detections of plasma several times cooler than the ambient cluster temperatures .	The results further suggest that either morphological mass deposition rates systematically overestimate the actual cooling rate or the emission measure of cooling-flows has a much steeper distribution than that predicted by a simple isobaric multi-phase model .
Taking advantage of the time-tagged events recorded with the GALEX photon counting detectors , we present high temporal resolution ( & lt ; 0.01 sec ) analysis of these UV flare data .	A statistical analysis of 700 seconds of pre-flare quiescence data for both CR Dra and SDSS J084425.9+513830.5 failed to reveal the presence of significant micro-flare activity in time bins of 0.2 , 1 and 10 second intervals .
By means of large-scale Quantum Monte Carlo simulations , the ground-state phase diagram are studied .	We find a continuous transition between the atomic superfluid phase and the pair superfluid when the ratio of the atomic hopping and the atom-pair hopping is adapted .
This observation and the brightness of the source rule out synchrotron emission and dichroic extinction by dust as the polarizing mechanism , leaving scattering as the only plausible cause of the polarized emission .	The narrowness of the lines requires that the scatterers be dust grains or cool ( $ & lt ; 1.6\times $ 10 $ ^4 $ ~K ) electrons .
We propose the Friend-or-Foe coefficient , a metric to measure voting biases among participants of a Eurovision contest .	We validate how this metric represents cultural affinity through its relation with known cultural distances , and through numerical analysis of biased Eurovision contests .
Next , we evaluated and proposed a fused DMARF over GIPSY Run-time Architecture ( DoGRTA ) as a domain concept .	Later on , the team extracted and studied the actual class diagrams and determined classes of interest .

The angular domain utilizes the phase-space angles of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs to construct the physical model of a Gaussian sub-channel .	The subcarrier domain injects physical attributes to the description of the subcarrier transmission .
A numerical study is presented of the 3d Gaussian Random Field Ising Model at T=0 driven by an external field .	Standard synchronous relaxation dynamics is employed to obtain the magnetization versus field hysteresis loops .
Generating the mass from a sequential process of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking followed by a conventional Higgs mechanism can account for less than 35 % of the cosmological dark matter abundance for dark matter mass $ M_s & gt ; 80 GeV $ .	However in a dynamical approach where both Higgs and scalar singlet masses are generated via radiative electroweak symmetry breaking we obtain much higher levels of dark matter abundance .
In this paper , we propose an extension to mixed multidimensional constraints of the problem of state and input constrained control introduced in DeDona and L\'evine , SIAM J .	Control and Optimiz. , Vol .
We investigate galaxy bias in the framework of the `` Halo Occupation Distribution '' ( HOD ) , which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by the conditional probability P ( N|M ) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies , together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos .	By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models , we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD .
We prove that the characteristic foliation $ F $ on a non-singular divisor $ D $ in an irreducible projective hyperkaehler manifold $ X $ can not be algebraic , unless the leaves of $ F $ are rational curves or $ X $ is a surface .	More generally , we show that if $ X $ is an arbitrary projective manifold carrying a holomorphic symplectic $ 2 $ -form , and $ D $ and $ F $ are as above , then $ F $ can be algebraic with non-rational leaves only when , up to a finite \'etale cover , $ X $ is the product of a symplectic projective manifold $ Y $ with a symplectic surface and $ D $ is the pull-back of a curve on this surface .
We target mechanisms that are Bayesian Incentive Compatible , but that are ex-post Individually Rational and ex-post budget respecting .	Virtually no such mechanisms are known that satisfy all these conditions and guarantee any revenue approximation , even with just a single item .
Inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons produces a major component of the diffuse emission from the Galaxy .	The photon fields involved are the cosmic microwave background and the interstellar radiation field from stars and dust .
The magnetic properties of Mn $ _ { 2 } $ Ni $ _ { ( 1+x ) } $ In $ _ { ( 1-x ) } $ ( $ x $ = 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 ) and Mn $ _ { ( 2-y ) } $ Ni $ _ { ( 1.6+y ) } $ In $ _ { 0.4 } $ ( $ y $ = -0.08 , -0.04 , 0.04 , 0.08 ) shape memory alloys have been studied .	Magnetic interactions in the martensitic phase of these alloys are found to be quite similar to those in Ni $ _2 $ Mn $ _ { ( 1+x ) } $ In $ _ { ( 1-x ) } $ type alloys .
Assuming GR and taking a prior on the linear matter power spectrum at high redshift from the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , anisotropic clustering of the CMASS DR9 galaxies alone constrains $ \Omega_ { \rm m } = 0.308 \pm 0.022 $ and $ 100\Omega_ { \rm k } = 5.9 \pm 4.8 $ for $ w = -1 $ , or $ w = -0.91 \pm 0.12 $ for $ \Omega_k = 0 $ .	When combined with the full CMB likelihood , the addition of the anisotropic clustering measurements to the spherically-averaged BAO location increases the constraining power on dark energy by a factor of 4 in a flat CDM cosmology with constant dark energy equation of state $ w $ ( giving $ w = -0.87 \pm 0.05 $ ) .
We then analyse the quantum phase transition associated with the disappearance at zero temperature of the boson condensate above a critical boson-fermion coupling .	We find a pronounced dependence of the critical coupling on the mass ratio and a weak dependence on the density imbalance .
This idea is unified with an efficient diagonal partition strategy .	A novel technique balancing usage of local and global information during partitioning is proposed .
We show that the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic gravitational clustering is approximately spatial local in the $ x $ - $ k $ ( position-scale ) phase space if the initial perturbations are Gaussian .	That is , if viewing the mass field with modes in the phase space , the nonlinear evolution will cause strong coupling among modes with different scale $ k $ , but at the same spatial area $ x $ , while the modes at different area $ x $ remain uncorrelated , or very weakly correlated .
We calibrate the fraction of gas converted into stars to be 6 % so as to reproduce the 1 % solar C/H ratio observed in the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) at z=3 .	With this star-formation efficiency , we find that NGST would be able to image more than 10^4 star clusters from high redshifts ( z & gt ; 10 ) within its 4'x4 ' field of view .
1 , 496 ( 1999 ) ] .	Possibilities arising from these schemes include the generation of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state in the positions and momenta of distantly-separated trapped atoms and the preparation of delocalized mesoscopic vibrational states .
Burst contention is a well-known challenging problem in Optical Burst Switching ( OBS ) networks .	Deflection routing is used to resolve contention .
The resolution is achieved by replacing these transverse spaces with Eguchi-Hanson or Taub-NUT spaces , both of which admit a normalisable self-dual ( or anti-self-dual ) harmonic 2-form .	Due to the manner in which the interaction terms for the form fields modify their Bianchi identities or equations of motion , these normalisable harmonic 2-forms provide regular sources for the branes .
We discuss a strong relationship between Majorana fermions and odd-frequency Cooper pairs which appear at a disordered normal ( N ) nano wire attached to a topologically nontrivial superconducting ( S ) one .	The transport properties in superconducting nano wire junctions show universal behaviors irrespective of the degree of disorder : the quantized zero-bias differential conductance at 2e^ { 2 } /h in NS junction and the fractional current-phase ( J-\varphi ) relationship of the Josephson effect in SNS junction J\propto \sin ( \varphi/2 ) .
However , it remains an open question what adaptive mechanisms facilitated its expansion .	Here we show , using gyrencephaly index ( GI ) and other physiological and life-history data for 102 mammalian species , that gyrencephaly is an ancestral mammalian trait .
Thermodynamics properties , such as average energy or entropy and other physical quantities such as end-to-end distance or radius of gyration can be easily calculated using this method .	Ground-state energy can also be determined .
A 50-keV Ga+ focused ion beam ( FIB ) in the fluence range of 1x1014 -2x10^16 ions cm^-2 is used for the irradiation process .	A blueshift is observed for the yellow luminescence ( YL ) band with increasing fluence .
We propose a minimal model in which the equations of motion of the particles , including a short-range repulsive force , are self-consistently coupled with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation .	We use this model to demonstrate the existence of an effective superfluid-mediated attractive interaction between the particles ; and we study numerically the collisional dynamics of particles as a function of their incident kinetic energy and the length-scale of the repulsive force .
This paper develops insight into the performance of biasing and uplink/downlink decoupling for user association in HetNets with dual slope path loss models .	It is shown that dual slope path loss models change the tradeoffs inherent in biasing and reduce gains from both biasing and uplink/downlink decoupling .
We study processes related to magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence occurring in the presence of the heliopause ( HP ) and the heliospheric current sheet .	It is shown that the interaction of plasmoids initiated by magnetic reconnection may provide connections between the inner and outer heliosheath and lead to an exchange of particles between the interstellar medium and the solar wind plasma shocked at the heliospheric termination shock .
The concept of soliton gun is introduced for the first time ; a light pair is produced moving with high velocity , after the annihilation of a bound , heavy pair .	We also apply boundary conditions to static , periodic and quasi-periodic solutions .
We find that , under typical SNR conditions , either the resonant instability or the Weibel instability is the most unstable .	This mechanism may amplify the magnetic field to more than 100 micro G and changes the shock structure .
A technique is presented to characterize the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio ( SINR ) of a representative link with a multiantenna linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error receiver in a wireless network with transmitting nodes distributed according to a doubly stochastic process , which is a generalization of the Poisson point process .	The cumulative distribution function of the SINR of the representative link is derived assuming independent Rayleigh fading between antennas .
We review the perturbative approach to multiparticle production in hard collision processes .	It is investigated to what extent parton level analytical calculations at low momentum cut-off can reproduce experimental data on the hadronic final state .
The range of possible materials which could be incorporated into such stacks is very large .	Indeed , there are many other materials where layers are linked by weak van der Waals forces , which can be exfoliated and combined together to create novel highly-tailored heterostructures .
We discuss the formation of planetary nebulae ( PNe ) having a pair of lobes , or multi-lobes , in their inner region surrounded by an elliptical or spherical shell or halo .	We suggest that most of these PNe are formed by wide binary systems , with final orbital periods in the range of 40-10,000 years , such that there is no strong tidal interaction .
We then explore the consequences which 3-He separation has on the pulsational spectra of DBV models .	Since GD 358 is the best-studied member of this class of variables , we examine fits to its observed pulsation spectrum .
We present high-resolution optical spectra of the young brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2M0535-05 , obtained during eclipse of the higher-mass ( primary ) brown dwarf .	Combined with our previous spectrum of the primary alone ( Paper I ) , the new observations yield the spectrum of the secondary alone .
The scientific interest in directly image and identifying Earth-like planets within the Habitable Zone ( HZ ) around nearby stars is driving the design of specialized direct imaging mission such as ACESAT , EXO-C , EXO-S and AFTA-C .	The inner edge of Alpha Cen A and B Habitable Zone is found at exceptionally large angular separations of 0.7 and 0.4 arcseconds respectively .
We develop a microscopic magnetoelectric coupling in Ni $ _3 $ V $ _2 $ O $ _8 $ ( NVO ) which gives rise to the trilinear phenomenological coupling used previously to explain the phase transition in which magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters appear simultaneously .	Using combined neutron scattering measurements and first-principles calculations of the phonons in NVO , we determine eleven phonons which can induce the observed spontaneous polarization .
We investigate some structure scalars developed through Riemann tensor for self-gravitating cylindrically symmetric charged dissipative anisotropic fluid .	We show that these scalars are directly related to the fundamental properties of the fluid .
We find the minimum probability of lifetime ruin of an investor who can invest in a market with a risky and a riskless asset and who can purchase a reversible life annuity .	The surrender charge of a life annuity is a proportion of its value .
We develop a method for the construction of the effective potential at high temperatures based on the effective field theory approach and renormalization group .	It allows one to sum up the leading logarithms in all orders of perturbation theory .
We automatically compute the optimal parameters for each of these different models based on prior tracked data and use the best model as motion prior for our particle-filter based tracking algorithm .	We also use our `` mixture of motion models '' for adaptive particle selection and accelerate the performance of the online tracking algorithm .
Deep HST imaging of the area identifies a further 12 % of radio sources .	We present new spectroscopic observations for 98 of the radio sources , and supplement these spectroscopic redshifts with photometric ones calculated from 5-band optical imaging .
Such devices have to show reproducible resistance switching at reasonable voltage and current values even if scaled down to the nanometer sizes .	Here we study the switching characteristics of nanoscale junctions created between a tungsten tip and a silver film covered by a thin ionic conductor layer .
We report on ground-based and HST ( +STIS ) imaging of the afterglow and host galaxy of the Gamma-Ray Burst ( GRB ) of March 5 2002 .	The GRB occurred in a R=25.17+/-0.14 galaxy , which apparently is part of an interacting system .
Thus , new technologies need to deal with more and more complexity .	Several efforts have been made to deal with this complexity using the concept of self-organization .
According to a triggered star formation scenario ( e.g.Martin-Pintado & amp ; Cernicharo 1987 ) outflows powered by young stellar objects shape the molecular clouds , can dig cavities , and trigger new star formation .	NGC 1333 is an active site of low- and intermediate star formation in Perseus and is a suggested site of self-regulated star formation Norman & amp ; Silk 1980 .
Moreover , it is shown that for the the Chern ( Rund ) and Hashiguchi connections , the associated semispray coincides with the canonical spray and the associated nonlinear connection coincides with the Barthel connection .	Explicit intrinsic expressions relating these connections and the Cartan connection are deduced .
Numerical prediction of multiscale heat transfer is a challenging problem due to the wide range of time and length scales involved .	In this work a discrete unified gas kinetic scheme ( DUGKS ) is developed for heat transfer in materials with different acoustic thickness based on the phonon Boltzmann equation .
We derive upper and lower bounds for the trace distance and for the fidelity between two quantum states , which imply bounds for the Bures distance between the unitary orbits of both states .	We thus show that when analysing minimal and maximal distances between states of fixed spectra it is sufficient to consider diagonal states only .
In-spite of significantly correlated production due to baryon number , electric charge conservation and kinematical correlations of protons and anti-protons , the measured cumulants of the net-proton distribution follow the independent production model .	In the present work we demonstrate how the introduction of the correlations will affect the cumulants and their ratios for the difference distributions .
Such operational models provide support to civil and environmental protection activities ( e.g. , driving sub-models for oil-spill dispersion , storm surge , coastal morphodynamic changes during storms , saline wedge intrusion along Po River ) , in a growing context of stake-holders at regional , national and international level .	Besides , ROMS and COAWST research based activities are also carried out , mostly aiming at investigating sediment transport , eggs and larvae dispersion , hypoxic events in the basin ; through successive nesting very high resolutions nearshore the Italian coast can be reached , allowing to simulate river mouth environments and artificial reefs .
The dependence of the J/ $ \psi $ $ v_2 $ on the collision centrality and on the J/ $ \psi $ transverse momentum is studied in the range $ 0 & lt ; p_ { \rm T } & lt ; 10 $ GeV/ $ c $ .	For semi-central Pb-Pb collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { \rm NN } } = 2.76 $ TeV , an indication of non-zero $ v_2 $ is observed with a maximum value of $ v_2 = 0.116 \pm 0.046 { \rm ( stat . ) }
Human demography , spatial conflicts , and the construction of networks of contacts between linguistic groups are mutually dependent processes .	Here we introduce an adaptive network model that takes all of them into account and successfully reproduces , using only four model parameters , not only those features of linguistic groups already described in the literature , but also correlations between demographic and topological properties uncovered in this work .
We extend these results in two important ways .	First , we prove equilibration over a finite ( rather than infinite ) time-interval , allowing us to bound the equilibration time .
GHM and CCA are mathematically tractable prototypes for the spatially distributed periodic wave activity of so-called excitable media observed in diverse disciplines of experimental science .	Earlier work by Fisch , Gravner , and Griffeath studied the ergodic behavior of these excitable cellular automata on Z^2 , and identified two distinct ( but closely-related ) elaborate phase portraits as the parameters vary .
In the framework of Sklyanin 's quantum separation of variables ( SOV ) , we provide the complete characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the transfer matrix and the proof of the simplicity of the transfer matrix spectrum .	Moreover , we use these integrable quantum models as further key examples for which to develop a method in the SOV framework to compute matrix elements of local operators .
It is well known that such a boson bath initially at thermal equilibrium thermalises the system .	We show that assuming a priori an equilibrium state is not necessary to obtain the thermalisation of the system .
Two examples of asymptotic $ \ell_ { 1 } $ Banach spaces are given .	The first , $ X_ { u } $ , has an unconditional basis and is arbitrarily distortable .
We find that larger noble gas atoms are generally released at a slower rate and that helium is released considerably more rapidly than any of the other noble gases .	The differing release rates are due not only to the differences in the size and mass of a given endohedral species but also because larger trapped atoms tend to stabilize the fullerene cage against thermal fluctuations .
Our technique includes estimates of the efficiency for finding the lensed galaxy pair .	We find no evidence for cosmic strings with a mass per unit length of G mu/c^2 & lt ; 3.0E-7 out to redshifts greater than 0.6 and set 95 % upper limits .
Cooperation among mobile devices by exploiting both cellular and local area connections is a promising approach to meet the increasing demand .	In this paper , we consider that a group of cooperative mobile devices , exploiting both cellular and local area links and within proximity of each other , are interested in the same video content .
Cosmic infrared background ( CIB ) contains information about galaxy luminosities over the entire history of the Universe and can be a powerful diagnostic of the early populations otherwise inaccessible to telescopic studies .	Its measurements are very difficult because of the strong IR foregrounds from the Solar system and the Galaxy .
This result allows us to conclude that the heavy quasi-particles form the spin-singlet Cooper pairs in CeCu $ _2 $ Si $ _2 $ , CeCoIn $ _5 $ and UPd $ _2 $ Al $ _3 $ .	On the other hand , no reduction in the Knight shift is observed in UPt $ _3 $ and UNi $ _2 $ Al $ _3 $ , nevertheless the estimated values of $ \chi^ { qp } _ { \gamma } $ and $ \chi^ { qp } _ { T_1 } $ are large enough to be probed experimentally .
In this paper , we generalize the concept to a multi-shift setting : a multi-shift de Bruijn sequence tau ( m , n ) of shift m and order n is a word such that every word of length n appears exactly once in w as a factor that starts at index im+1 for some integer i & gt ; =0 .	We show the number of the multi-shift de Bruijn sequence tau ( m , n ) is ( a^n ) ! a^ { ( m-n ) ( a^n-1 ) } for 1 & lt ; =n & lt ; =m and is ( a^m !
The $ s $ dependence of the cross section has been directly studied and our result indicates that the $ 1/s^3 $ scaling is more favored than $ 1/s^4 $ .	We also find that the gluonic contribution for the processes involving $ \eta^ { ( ' ) } $ is tiny .
Here we concentrate on a class of computer generated networks and on three well-studied real networks which constitute a bench-mark for network studies ; the karate club , the US college football teams and a gene network of yeast .	We utilize some standard ways of clustering data ( originally not designed for finding community structures in networks ) and show that these classical methods sometimes outperform the newer ones .
This randomized method only uses zeroth-order information about the objective function and does not need any problem-specific parametrization .	We prove convergence and give convergence rates for smooth objectives assuming that the one-dimensional optimization can be solved exactly or approximately by an oracle .
In particular , he considered the sets $ W ( { \bf\Si } ^0_ { k } ) $ ( respectively , $ W ( { \bf\Pi } ^0_ { k } ) $ , $ W ( { \bf\Delta } _1^1 ) $ ) of dictionaries $ V \subseteq 2^\star $ whose omega-powers are $ { \bf\Si } ^0_ { k } $ -sets ( respectively , $ { \bf\Pi } ^0_ { k } $ -sets , Borel sets ) .	In this paper we first establish a new relation between the sets $ W ( { \bf\Sigma } ^0_ { 2 } ) $ and $ W ( { \bf\Delta } _1^1 ) $ , showing that the set $ W ( { \bf\Delta } _1^1 ) $ is `` more complex '' than the set $ W ( { \bf\Sigma } ^0_ { 2 } ) $ .
Within the framework of the t-J model we calculate the doping dependence of the antiferromagnetic order parameter using the self-consistent diagrammatic techniques .	We show that in the presence of non-magnetic impurities the antiferromagnetic order is more robust against hole doping in comparison with the impurity-free host , implying that magnetic order can re-appear upon Zn doping into lightly hole-doped cuprates .
No optical afterglow was found for the dark burst GRB 981226 and hence no absorption redshift has been obtained .	We here use ground-based and space imaging observations to analyse the spectral energy distribution ( SED ) of the host galaxy .
In particular , we allow for position dependent noncommutativity and do not restrict ourselves to the Moyal-Weyl deformation .	We construct action functionals for real scalar fields on noncommutative curved spacetimes , and derive the corresponding deformed wave equations .
By tuning the non-commutativity parameter \theta in terms of the values of magnetic field at the maxima of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations we accomplished the experimentally observed Landau plot of the peaks for graphene .	Accepting that the experimentally observed behavior is due to the confinement of carriers , we conclude that our method of introducing noncommutative coordinates provides another formulation of the confined massless Dirac fermions in graphene .
The Milky Way has been estabished to emit gamma rays .	These gamma rays are presumably dominated by decays of neutral pions , although inverse Compton scatterings and bremsstrahlung also contribute .
The analysis shows that for the elements in the first row , there are two types of experimental measurements leading to different results for the violation of unitarity .	A conclusive result can not be derived at present .
Considered is a class of pursuit-evasion games , in which an evader tries to avoid detection .	Such games can be formulated as the search for sections to the complement of a coverage region in a ( trivial ) vector bundle over a timeline .
It is suggested here that the development and successful operation of the Hubble Space Telescope marked a turning point in the perception of value for free-space siting of astronomical telescopes , and for telescopes on the Moon .	As the astronomical community considers the scientific potential of the Vision for Space Exploration ( VSE ) and the return to the Moon in particular , it should construct a value proposition that includes the tools , technology , and architecture being developed for this return , as these can well be seen as being more astronomically enabling than the lunar surface itself - a destination that offers little more than rocks and gravity .
In order to clarify the controversy a different set of GDP data is hereby examined .	The conclusion about a power law distribution of recession periods seems better though the matter is not entirely settled .
The population activity of random networks of excitatory and inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF ) neurons has been studied extensively .	In particular , a state of asynchronous activity with low firing rates and low pairwise correlations emerges in sparsely connected networks .
+0.012 -0.010 ( sys . ) .	Using the map of the Soudan rock overburden , the muon momenta as measured underground were projected to the corresponding values at the surface in the energy range 1-7 TeV .
We also analyze the chiral condensate in the flux-tube .	Chiral symmetry is partially restored inside the flux , and the reduction of the condensate is about 20 % at the center of the tube .
Here , we propose a generalized CAR model that allows for inclusion of points with no neighbors at all , something that is not possible under conventional CAR models .	We consider also neighborhoods based on criteria other than physical location , such as genetic pathways in microarray determined from existing biological knowledge .
This structure was first introduced by Randers ~\cite { [ 8 ] } from the standpoint of general relativity .	In this paper , we replace $ L $ by a Finsler structure , calling the resulting manifold a generalized Randers manifold .
Here we report on such a source that provides a method for generating quantum correlated beams that can be extended to a large number of modes by using multiple four-wave mixing ( FWM ) processes in hot rubidium vapor .	Experimentally we show that two cascaded FWM processes produce strong quantum correlations between three bright beams but not between any two of them .
With respect to a cognitive motivated situation like a conversation between partners , mind-maps become interesting as they are able to process stimulating signals whenever they occur .	If these signals are close to an own understanding of the world , then the conversational partner becomes automatically more trustful than if the signals do not or less match the own knowledge scheme .
The ellipse and the hyperbola are seldom perfect , and the FCD textures also suffer large transformations ( in shape or/and in nature ) when approaching the transition to the nematic phase , or appear imperfect on cooling from the nematic phase .	We interpret these imperfections as due to the interaction of FCDs with dislocations .
We have combined our submillimeter images with Spitzer data at 70 microns to produce 2-d maps of line-of-sight optical depth ( relative column density ) .	These `` tau maps '' suggest that the mm-sized grains are located preferentially in three symmetrically-located concentrations .
Individual objects reveal in detail that dark halos have a density core , whose size correlates with its central value .	These properties will guide $ \Lambda $ CDM Cosmology to evolve to match the challenge that observations presently pose .
} , can be formulated as a problem of solving a linear system of equations .	Several recent works propose different distributed algorithms for solving these problems , usually by using linear iterative numerical methods .
Optical variability is expected if the electron population responsible for the soft X-ray emission is changing rapidly and Compton-upscattering infrared photons in the nucleus , or if the mechanism responsible for X-ray emission causes all the emission processes to vary together .	We find that there is no significant optical variability with a firm upper limit of 2 per cent and conclude that the primary soft X-ray emission region produces little of the observed optical emission .
We demonstrate that by generating a grid in the full space of the CMSSM , one can interpolate between the output of an LHC detector simulation using machine learning techniques , thus obtaining a superfast likelihood calculator for LHC-based SUSY parameter fits .	We further investigate how much training data is required to obtain usable results , finding that approximately 2000 points are required in the CMSSM to get likelihood predictions to an accuracy of a few per cent .
However , we obtain a clear detection by ASCA yielding a luminosity in the 2-10 keV band of 2 \times 10^ { 42 } erg/s .	Its X-ray spectrum is very hard , equivalent to a photon index of Gamma=1.0+-0.35 .
Ultracold atom-based electron sources have recently been proposed as an alternative to the conventional photo-injectors or thermionic electron guns widely used in modern particle accelerators .	The advantages of ultracold atom-based electron sources lie in the fact that the electrons extracted from the plasma ( created from near threshold photo-ionization of ultracold atoms ) have a very low temperature , i.e.down to tens of Kelvin .

These results are obtained by employing a general procedure to construct effective low energy actions describing states of electromagnetic systems interacting with charges and defects .	The procedure consists in taking into account the proliferation or dilution of these charges and defects and its consequences for the low energy description of the electromagnetic response of the system .

We have solved the spin - polarized Hartree - Fock - Gorkov equations together with the Maxwell 's equation ( Ampere 's law ) fully self-consistently .	We have found that a Proximity Effect - Fulde - Ferrell - Larkin - Ovchinnikov state is realized in such a heterostructure .
The batch settling test is widely used to estimate the compressive rheology of strongly flocculated colloidal suspensions , in particular the compressive yield strength and hydraulic permeability .	Recently it has been discovered that wall adhesion effects in these tests may be significantly greater than previously appreciated , which can introduce unbounded errors in the estimation of these rheological functions .
The derived properties are used to make detailed predictions of Apollo 's Yarkovsky and YORP effects , which are then compared with published measurements of orbital drift and rotational acceleration .

An explicit combinatorial algorithm is given for computation of $ { \rm Ext } ^i ( L_I , L_J ) $ when $ i $ is odd , and for $ i $ even , we show that $ { \rm Ext } ^i ( L_I , L_J ) $ is cyclic over the centre , and we give an explicit formula for its computation .	At the end of the paper we give a vanishing condition of $ { \rm Ext } ^i ( L_I , L_J ) $ for any $ i & gt ; 0 $ .
The problem of time evolution in quantum cosmology is studied in the context of a dust-filled , spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe .	In this model , two versions of the commonly-adopted notion of internal time can be implemented in the same quantization , and are found to yield contradictory views of the same quantum state : with one choice , the big-bang singularity appears to be resolved , but with another choice it does not .
At m & lt ; 14 mag , most of the sources are Galactic stars , in agreement with models .	After removal of Galactic stars , galaxy counts are consistent with what few measurements exist at nearby wavelengths .

We propose a theory of electron-hole recombination via inter-molecular inter-conversion from inter-molecular weakly bound polaron pairs ( or charge-transfer excitons ) to intra-molecular excitons .
HTSASMs are interesting combinatorial objects in their own right and have been the focus of recent study .	Here we explore counting weighted HTSASMs with respect to a number of statistics to derive an orthogonal group version of Tokuyama 's factorisation formula , which involves a deformation and expansion of Weyl 's denominator formula multiplied by a general linear group character .
Let R be a real closed field and A=R [ x_1 , ... , x_n ] .	Let sper A denote the real spectrum of A .
Small droplets in turbulent flows can undergo highly variable deformations and orientational dynamics .	For neutrally buoyant droplets smaller than the Kolmogorov scale , the dominant effects from the surrounding turbulent flow arise through Lagrangian time histories of the velocity gradient tensor .
The ionization parameter log U = -3.5 is in accord with its weak X-ray emission .	We find no high-ionization gas near the nucleus , adding to evidence that the AGN is currently at low radiative output ( perhaps now dominated by kinetic energy ) .

At fixed luminosity and color , density is not closely related to surface brightness or to Sersic index -- the parameter in this study that astronomers most often associate with morphology .	In the text , we discuss what measureable residual relationships exist , generally finding that at red colors and fixed luminosity , the mean density decreases at the highest surface brightnesses and Sersic indices .
The resulting spacetime may be statistically uniform on average , or have random , non-repeating variation .	The construction utilises the Darmois junction conditions to join many different component spacetime regions .
For example , universal four-body states have recently been predicted and observed in experiment .	These phenomena are often referred to as `` Efimov Physics '' .
Topologically nontrivial solutions already arise even in the one-dimensional case because the fundamental group of SO ( 3 ) is Z_2 .	We explicitly find and analyze one-dimensional static solutions .
The theories can be seen as presentations of Boolean algebras , and the collections of models can be topologized in such a way that the theory can be recovered from its space of models .	The situation can be cast as a formal duality relating two categories of syntax and semantics , mediated by homming into a common dualizing object , in this case 2 .
Subject of this paper is a detailed analysis of the PINOCCHIO algorithm for studying the relative velocity statistics of merging haloes in Lagrangian perturbation theory .	Given a cosmological background model , a power spectrum of fluctuations as well as a Gaussian linear density contrast field $ \delta_ { \rm l } $ is generated on a cubic grid , which is then smoothed repeatedly with Gaussian filters .
Thus many researchers have been dreaming of a much simpler method for quantum mechanics .	In this chapter , we give a overview of the reduced-density matrix method ; details of the theories , methods , history , and some new computational results .
In particular , we recover the logarithmic divergence of the thickness of the disordered layer as the bulk transition is approached , we calculate the critical behavior of the maxima of the layer susceptibilities , and demonstrate that it is in reasonable agreement with the simulation data .	Directly at the ( 110 ) surface , the theory predicts that all order parameters vanish continuously at the surface with a nonuniversal , but common critical exponent .
The questions we address concern their role in this field , the behavior of the scattering amplitude ( or of the total cross-section ) at high energy , and how to fit all high energy elastic data .	The data are extremely well reproduced by our approach at all momenta and for sufficiently high energies .
Our results go beyond minimal flavour violation investigated in previous works .	We show that the absolute best fits provide a signal for $ B_s\to \mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } $ at the borderline of the present limits and hence the ongoing search at the Tevatron will start having an impact on the global analysis of this class of SUSY models .

Based on these results , the necessary and sufficient conditions of faithful teleportation of an unknown state |\phi & gt ; in C^d with an entangled resource { \rho } in C^m \otimes C^d and C^d \otimes C^n are derived .
We prove the equivalence of Gromov , Osin , and Bowditch 's definitions of relative hyperbolicity for countable groups .	We then give several equivalent definitions of relatively quasiconvex subgroups in terms of various natural geometries on a relatively hyperbolic group .
Thus , redundant paths are created between any two endpoints enabling multipath or the use of multiple paths to handle a communication .	The benefits of multipath are the enhancement of robustness against failure , and minimizing communication cost .

The algorithms for the computation of the almost-sure winning set for parity objectives iteratively use the solutions for the almost-sure winning set for B\ '' uchi objectives ( a special case of parity objectives ) .	We study for the first time the average case complexity of the classical algorithm for computing almost-sure winning vertices for MDPs with B\ '' uchi objectives .
The aim of this paper is to address the following question : given a contact manifold $ ( \Sigma , \xi ) $ , what can be said about the aspherical symplectic manifolds $ ( W , \omega ) $ bounded by $ ( \Sigma , \xi ) $ ?	We first extend a theorem of Eliashberg , Floer and McDuff to prove that under suitable assumptions the map from $ H_ { * } ( \Sigma ) $ to $ H_ { * } ( W ) $ induced by inclusion is surjective .
Within this work we investigate the relation between current sheets and vortex sheets in incompressible , stationary equilibria .	For this approach it is helpful that the similar mathematical structure of magnetohydrostatics and stationary incompressible hydrodynamics allows us to transform static equilibria into stationary ones .
This phenomenon is related to the elasticity of the fluid .	We have observed that this effect can appear when the fluid is stirred without a rod .
In this paper we derive , purely in terms of the gauge theory , the cluster transformations of face weights under square moves in the graph .	In this context , we obtain them by connecting regular parametrizations of the master space of the associated BFTs .
The direct collapse of protogalactic gas clouds in primordial halos with $ \rm T_ { vir } \geq 10^ { 4 } K $ provides the most promising way to assemble massive black holes .

We given an alternate and elementary proof that the wake-up time , i.e.the expected time for every particle to be activated , is Theta ( log n ) .	Additionally , we give an explicit distributional equation for the wakeup time as a weighted sum of geometric random variables .
The space of distribution functions is decomposed into independent subspaces that remain invariant under Liouville dynamics .	For integrable systems in Poincar\'e 's sense the invariant subspaces follow the dynamics of uncoupled , renormalized particles .
Occurrence of lines at frequencies less then 30 cm-1 is attributed to the presence of orientation disorder of molecules .	Apparently , structure C10H8 has both types of defects , both orientation disorder of molecules and vacancies , which causes occurrence of additional lines in a spectrum of small frequencies .
Starting from the microscopic Hamiltonian with local attraction , we calculated using the Gor'kov equations , the phase diagram of the superconducting transition at arbitrary chemical potential , its magnetic properties and critical exponents close to the quantum critical point .	The Ginzburg - Landau effective theory is derived for small chemical potential allowing to consider effects of spatial dependence of order parameters in magnetic field .
The mass function of super-massive black holes in our cosmic neighborhood is required to understand the statistics of their activity and consequently the origin of the ultra high energy particles .

Chiral corrections including both positive and negative parity heavy meson doublets are calculated to the effective strong couplings featuring in the effective theory leading order interaction Lagrangian , to the Isgur-Wise functions in semileptonic B to D decays and to the complete set of supersymmetric four-quark operators mediating heavy neutral meson mixing .	Bare values of the effective strong couplings are extracted from the measured decay widths of charmed resonances .
In this paper we prove new constructive coercivity estimates for the Boltzmann collision operator without cutoff , that is for long-range interactions .	In particular we give a generalized sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral gap which involves both the growth behavior of the collision kernel at large relative velocities and its singular behavior at grazing and frontal collisions .
Then , by formulating novel , and suitable Bayesian tests of hypotheses using a suitable metric for comparing clusterings in conjunction with the interaction parameters of the matrix-normal , we attempt to single out the roles of the genes , individually , and in interaction with other genes , in case-control studies .	Quite importantly , we also attempt to identify the disease producing loci .
First , we demonstrate the properties of such a walk by studying the phase diagram of a percolation problem .	We find a line of second and first order phase transitions separated by a tricritical point .
We define a new selection scheme , the centric selection , which is tunable and allows controlling the selective pressure with a single parameter .	The equilibrium model is used to study the influence of the centric selection on the selective pressure and a new model which takes into account problem dependent statistics and selective pressure in order to deal with the exploration / exploitation trade-off is proposed : the punctuated equilibria model .
We show that the induced oscillations of charged particles interacting with a GW , which lead to the emission of electromagnetic radiation , will also result in wave attenuation .	These ideas are supported by a small body of literature , as well as additional arguments for particle acceleration based on GW memory effects .
In this diagram the period ratio of the radial first overtone to the fundamental mode , P_1/P_0 , is plotted against the period of the fundamental mode .	The period ratio is sensitive to the chemical composition as well as to the rotational velocity of a star .
The notion of a delta shock wave and a singular shock wave was introduced and employed by different authors , and it was shown that a large class of Riemann problems can be solved globally with these additional building blocks .	The aim of this paper is to study the interaction of one type of these new solutions , the delta shock waves , with the classical types of solutions .
We prove global existence of weak solutions to the FENE dumbbell model of polymeric flows for a very general class of potentials .	The main problem is the passage to the limit in a nonlinear term that has no obvious compactness properties .
In this scheme , we had tried to spread the watermark in an image so that the information at one place is very small and undetectable .	In order to extract the watermark and verify ownership of an image , one would have the advantage of prior knowledge of embedded locations .
We then model the overall spectral energy distribution including radio and infrared data .	The combined Suzaku , Swift and INTEGRAL data are represented by an absorbed exponentially cut-off power-law with reflection from neutral material with a photon index Gamma = 1.68+-0.03 , a high-energy cut-off Ecut = 227+143-67 keV , a reflection component with R = 0.7+-0.3 and a Gaussian component to account for the iron emission-line at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width of EW = 85+-11 eV .
We consider magnetohydrodynamical interaction between relativistic pulsar wind and static magnetosphere in binary pulsar system PSR J0737-3039 .	We construct semi-analytical model describing the form of the interface separating the two pulsars .
The importance of the idea of relativeness in Everett 's theory is emphasized .	To free the relative-state theory from its roots both of classicalness and of subjective observation in the argument of this study , the general or unfolded version of Everett 's theory is sketched .
Application to the quark-antiquark ( $ q\bar { q } $ ) bound states is emphasized .	An essential aspect of our formulation is that it applies to any underlying quantum field theoretic model of the $ q\bar { q } $ system , and not just to models , like exact QCD , where the quark self-energy $ \Sigma $ couples to the electromagnetic field solely via dressed quark propagators .
Beams { \bf 3 } , 061301 ( 2000 ) ] and the quasi-static code QuickPIC [ Huang et al. , J. Comp.Phys .	{ \bf 217 } , 658 ( 2006 ) ] .

These invariants take values in the same space of `` Jacobi diagrams '' , but it is not known whether they are equal .	In 2004 , Lescop proved that the KKT invariant satisfies some `` splitting formulas '' which relate the variations of KKT under replacement of embedded rational homology handlebodies by others in a `` Lagrangian-preserving '' way .
BICEP2 was designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) on angular scales of 1 to 5 degrees ( $ \ell $ =40-200 ) , near the expected peak of the B-mode polarization signature of primordial gravitational waves from cosmic inflation .	Measuring B-modes requires dramatic improvements in sensitivity combined with exquisite control of systematics .
The emergence and promotion of cooperation are two of the main issues in evolutionary game theory , as cooperation is amenable to exploitation by defectors , which take advantage of cooperative individuals at no cost , dooming them to extinction .	It has been recently shown that the existence of purely destructive agents ( termed jokers ) acting on the common enterprises ( public goods games ) can induce stable limit cycles among cooperation , defection , and destruction when infinite populations are considered .
This last component appears to be compatible with an evaporation from an equilibrated source at normal density , as described by the statistical code Gemini at the appropriate excitation energy .	On the contrary , the midvelocity emission presents remarkable differences for what concerns both the dependence of the multiplicities on the energy deposited in the midvelocity region and the isotopic composition of the emitted light charged particles .
All critical areas belong to a universality with central charge $ c=1 $ .	On the other hand , we employ Abelian and non-Abelian bosonization techniques in the weak rung-coupling region .

Storage requirements for visual data have been increasing in recent years , following the emergence of many new highly interactive , multimedia services and applications for both personal and corporate use .	This has been a key driving factor for the adoption of cloud-based data outsourcing solutions .
We select sources based on their categorization in the BSL , taking all confirmed or possible Galactic sources in the field of view of Milagro .	Of the 34 Fermi sources selected , 14 are observed by Milagro at a significance of 3 standard deviations or more .
A strong necessary condition for the Schur-positivity of s_A - s_B is that the support of B is contained in that of A , where the support of B is defined to be the set of partitions lambda for which s_lambda appears in the Schur expansion of s_B .	We show that to determine the maximal connected skew shapes in the Schur-positivity order and this support containment order , it suffices to consider a special class of ribbon shapes .

48 , 033504 ( 2007 ) ] provides a univocal way to obtain such equations , stemming from a least action principle .	However , no matter how equations are obtained , the dimension of the fractional derivative differs from the classical one and may induce problems of temporal homogeneity in fractional objects .
Roughly speaking , free objects found here are in relation to $ m $ -ary trees , triangular numbers and more generally $ m $ -tetrahedral numbers , homogeneous polynomials on $ m $ commutative indeterminates over a field $ K $ and polygonal numbers .	Involutive connected P-Hopf algebras are constructed and a link to genomics is discussed .
The objective of the optimal PMU placement ( OPP ) problem is to minimize the number of PMUs and select the bus locations to make a power system completely observable .	In this paper , the OPP problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming ( NLP ) problem and a sequential quadratic programming ( SQP ) method is used for its solution .
By setting our simulations in the context of those carried out in the past that contain at least one giant star , we conclude the following : the reason for the larger final orbital separation in simulations starting with a wider orbital separation has more to do with the expanded giant at the time of in-spiral and less to do with a larger amount of angular momentum .	We also suggest that the large range in unbound mass for different simulations is difficult to explain and may have something to do with simulations that are not fully converged .
This parameter is fixed from correlators of conserved vector and axial-vector currents , and using lattice QCD determinations of the string tension .

We calculate growth rates and corresponding gains for RX and LO mode radiation associated with the cyclotron maser instability for parameterized horseshoe electron velocity distributions .	The velocity distribution function was modeled to closely fit the electron distribution functions observed in the auroral cavity .
In the Gubinelli framework ( Hoelder , level 2 ) of rough paths , they were then able to prove a Hoermander type result ( SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion , $ H & gt ; 1/3 $ ) .	We take a step back and propose a natural `` roughness '' condition relative to a given $ p $ -rough path in the sense of Lyons ; the aim being a Doob-Meyer result for rough integrals in the sense of Lyons .
However , the elliptical and clumpy lens model proposed by Kneib et al .	( 1993 ) is surprisingly consistent with the X-ray observations assuming that the X-ray emitting hot gas is isothermal and in a hydrostatic equilibrium state .
Although highly original , Eddington 's attempt to provide physics with a new foundation had to some extent parallels in the ideas of other British physicists , including P. Dirac and E. A. Milne .	Eddington 's project was however a grand failure in so far that it was rejected by the large majority of physicists .
In the case of heavy nuclear targets the very concept of nuclear parton density becomes ill-defined as exemplified by the recent derivation [ 2 ] of nonlinear nuclear k_\perp-factorization for forward dijet production in DIS off nuclei .	Here we report a derivation of the related breaking of k_\perp-factorization for single-jet processes .
( 2003 ) in recent RXTE observations .	In a set of short exposures with the Chandra HRC camera we detect a strongly modulated signal ( 55+/-4 % pulsed fraction ) with the expected period located at ( J2000 ) 18:09:51.08 , -19:43:51.7 , with a uncertainty radius of 0.6 arcsec ( 90 % C.L . ) .
We perform analytical calculations of the supernova neutrino fluxes including collective effects due to the neutrino-neutrino interactions , the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein ( MSW ) effect due to the neutrino interactions with the background matter and decoherence of the wave packets as they propagate in space .	We predict the numbers of one- and two-neutron charged and neutral-current electron-neutrino scattering on lead events .

Astronomical observations , analytical solutions and numerical simulations have provided the building blocks to formulate the current theory of young stellar object jets .	Although each approach has made great progress independently , it is only during the last decade that significant efforts are being made to bring the separate pieces together .
As for space curves , our method finds the involutions in all cases , and all the rotation symmetries in the particular case of Pythagorean-hodograph curves .	Our algorithms solve these problems without converting to implicit form .
A number of experiments are presently under preparation to cover the quasi-degenerate region of the neutrino mass spectrum .	Improved sensitivities are however required to sound the so-called inverted hierarchy region .
Both objects have similar luminosities ( ~500 Lsun ) and are located in the same molecular cloud which minimizes the chemical differences due to different stellar masses or initial cloud conditions .	Moreover , since they are located at the same distance , we have the same spatial resolution in both objects .
The orbital-selective Mott transition of the $ a_g $ state , which is essentially degenerate with the $ e'_ { g } $ states , occurs because of the slightly wider bandwidth of the $ a_g $ bands .	The metal-insulator transition is found to be strongly coupled to the Co-O bond length , due to associated changes in the $ t_ { 2g } $ bandwidth , but the largest effects occur only at a reduced oxygen height that lies below the equilibrium position .
We generalize the problem for k \geq 2 , introducing two models , and we seek for solutions to both the weighted version and the unweighted version of this more general problem .	In the model of all-pairs ( AP ) , k separations are needed for every pair of distinct vertices of V , while in the non-landmarks model ( NL ) , such separations are required only for pairs of distinct vertices in V \setminus L. We study the weighted and unweighted versions for both models ( AP and NL ) , for path graphs , complete graphs , complete bipartite graphs , and complete wheel graphs , for all values of k \geq 2 .
The time dependent evolution of habitable zone boundaries are calculated for each stellar evolution track based on stellar mass , effective temperature , and luminosity parameterizations .	The rate of change of stellar surface quantities and the surrounding habitable zone position are strong functions of all three quantities explored .
Attention is also given to the conditions for conservation of currents of a different kind -- representing surface fluxes of generalised momentum or energy -- associated with symmetries not of the internal target space but of the underlying spacetime background structure , including the metric and any relevant gauge field .	For the corresponding current to be conserved the latter need not be manifestly invariant : preservation modulo a gauge adjustment will suffice .
The first being on how long it takes for the graph to reach stationarity .	We give an explicit expression for this time , as well as proving that this is the fastest time to reach stationarity among all strong stationary times .
These two stars also display the distinct irradiation effect typical of sdB stars with a close M-dwarf companion with orbital periods of less than half a day .	Because the orbital period is so short , the stars should be in synchronous rotation , and if so , the rotation period should imprint itself on the multiplet structure of the pulsations .
Even though this limit appears to be of little use for computing the standard rectangular Wilson loop ( which always singles out two directions out of D ) , a meaningful large D limit can be defined for a randomized Wilson loop ( in which all D directions contribute equally ) .	In this article , a proof-of-concept demonstration of this approach is given for the simplest reduced model ( the original Eguchi-Kawai model ) and the simplest randomization of the Wilson loop ( Brownian sum over random walks ) .
A Higgs boson with mass between $ \sim 120\gev $ and $ \sim 140\gev $ or above $ \sim 230-250\gev $ almost certainly would not be seen .	A Higgs boson with $ \mhsm\sim 150\gev $ or $ 200\lsim\mhsm\lsim 230-250\gev $ has a decent chance of being detected in the $ ZZ\rta 4l $ mode .
Surprisingly , our results suggest that , even at unitarity , the effect of interactions is fairly weak and can be accurately described using single particle-hole excitations .	We also consider the case of unequal masses .
Our detailed study of anisotropy of EMHD turbulence supports our earlier result of k_par ~ k_perp^ ( 1/3 ) scaling .	We find that the high-order statistics show a scaling that is similar to the She-Leveque scaling .
We discuss { \em two } possibilities which appear in the multivector algebra approach : the $ \sigma_ { 123 } $ and $ \sigma_ { 21 } $ complex geometries .	Our formalism permits to perform a set of rules which allows an immediate translation between the complex standard Dirac theory and its version within geometric algebra .
In the corresponding T^3 fibration description , the strings live on the edges of the polyhedron , where the T^3 fibration degenerates to T^1 .	Moreover , we find that for each deformed Sasaki-Einstein manifold the BPS string solutions exist only for particular values of the deformation parameter .
In many cases , the line profiles of these absorbing components are unresolved .	Given the importance of the atmospheric composition of white dwarfs to studies of stellar evolution , extra-solar planetary systems and the interstellar medium , we examine the effect of including circumstellar line profiles in the abundance estimates of photospheric metals in six DA stars .
We present an investigation of the microscopic interplay between excitons and charge carriers by means of combined photoluminescence ( PL ) and charge carrier transport measurements on organic thin film transistors ( OTFT ) .	For this purpose , the prototypical organic semiconductor Diindenoperylene ( DIP ) was utilized as active material .
Using our global dust modelling approach THEMIS ( The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model at the IaS ) we explore the effects of dust evolution in dense clouds , through aliphatic-rich carbonaceous mantle formation and grain-grain coagulation.Methods .	We model the effects of wide band gap a-C : H mantle formation and the low-level aggregation of diffuse interstellar medium dust in the moderately-extinguished outer regions of molecular clouds.Results .
For a fixed marked surface $ S $ , we show that the problem of deciding whether or not a mapping class is reducible lies in $ \textbf { NP } $ .	As usual this immediately gives an exponential time algorithm to decide whether or not a mapping class is reducible .
The numerical stability of the algorithm is demonstrated .	The three body binding energy is calculated for Malfliet-Tjon type potentials and compared with results obtained from calculations based on partial wave decomposition .
Another is that the functional form of the word-frequency distribution of a novel depends on the length of the text in the same way as the null model .	This means that an approximate power-law tail ascribed to the data will have an exponent which changes with the size of the text-section which is analyzed .
We compare the extinction distribution to that of the dust emission traced by SPITZER IRAC ( 8microns ) and MIPS ( 24microns ) maps .	The intrinsic extinction shows spatial variations , from zones with negligible extinction to zones with values up to A ( V ) =0.8mag .
By construction , the class of G-FIO contains the class of equivariant families of ordinary Fourier integral operators on the manifolds Gx , x $ \in $ G ( 0 ) .	We then develop for G-FIO the first stages of the calculus in the spirit of Hormander 's work .
The ejection of the gas out of the disk in late-type galaxies is related to star formation and is due mainly to Type II supernovae .	In this paper we studied in detail the development of the Galactic fountains in order to understand their dynamical evolution and their influence in the redistribution of the freshly delivered metals over the disk .
Computer experiments have become ubiquitous in science and engineering .	Commonly , runs of these simulations demand considerable time and computing , making experimental design extremely important in gaining high quality information with limited time and resources .
We investigate the effect of the window function on the multipole power spectrum in two different ways .	First , we consider the convolved power spectrum including the window effect , which is obtained by following the familiar ( FKP ) method developed by Feldman , Kaiser and Peacock .
For the case that the lightest Higgs boson is dominated by the singlet scalar , the Higgs mixing increases the mass of a SM-like Higgs boson while reducing its signal rate at collider experiments compared to the SM case .	The Higgs mixing is important also in the region of parameter space where the NMSSM contribution to the Higgs mass is small , but its size is limited by the experimental constraints on the singlet-like Higgs boson and on the lightest neutralino constituted mainly by the singlino whose Majorana mass term is forbidden by the PQ symmetry .
These nuclei were produced at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory ( NSCL ) by fragmenting a 120 MeV/nucleon $ ^ { 112 } $ Sn primary beam on a Be target .	The resulting radioactive beam was filtered in the A1900 and the newly commissioned Radio Frequency Fragment Separator ( RFFS ) to achieve a purity level suitable for decay studies .
Somewhat surprisingly , we show that there is a PTAS for the games whose equilibria are guaranteed to have small-O ( 1/n ) -values , and therefore large-Omega ( n ) -supports .	We also point out that there is a PTAS for games with sparse payoff matrices , which are known to be PPAD-complete to solve exactly .
One possible signature is the presence of irregularities in a limited energy range of the spectrum .	In this study , anomalous irregularities are searched for in the spectrum of the bright extragalactic TeV emitter PKS 2155-304 as measured by H.E.S.S .
We focus on conservation properties of this scheme which were not previously considered .	To emphasize the necessity of this scheme , we present how a too simple numerical scheme may induce spurious flows when the basic static shape of the radius changes .
Recently , various quantitative expressions have been found for quantum limits on measurements induced by additive conservation laws , and have been applied to the study of fundamental limits on quantum information processing .	Here , we investigate generalizations of the WAY theorem to multiplicative conservation laws .
Then , the O ( 2 ) symmetry is broken by the spin ordering into a helical magnetic state .	Possible candidate materials are also discussed .
In addition , information pertaining to evolutionary relationships is contained in homologous sequences .	One powerful method for inferring these sequence attributes is through comparison of a query sequence with reference sequences that contain significant homology and whose structure , function , and/or evolutionary relationships are already known .
For the analysis , a base origin-destination matrix is chosen , to which different growth factors are applied in order to simulate various travel demand conditions .	Results show that overall the 2-ring web network offers the most efficient traffic performance , followed by the grid and the 1-ring networks .
In this paper we show how a nonlinear , nonparametric version of these models can be recovered through the Gaussian process latent variable model .	This gives us a flexible formalism for multi-view learning where the latent variables can be used both for exploratory purposes and for learning representations that enable efficient inference for ambiguous estimation tasks .
By explicitly modeling both the low-level compositional structure of individual actions and the high-level structure of full plans , we are able to learn both grounded representations of sentence meaning and pragmatic constraints on interpretation .	To demonstrate the model 's flexibility , we apply it to a diverse set of benchmark tasks .
It turns out that values of exchange integrals at which the ferromagnetic state becomes unstable with respect to a creation of one and two magnon are different .	This difference shows that the classical approximation is inapplicable to the study of the transition from the ferromagnetic to the singlet state in contrast with 1D case .
`` Uniqueness '' means there is a set of moves which are sufficient to go between two homotopic indefinite Morse 2-functions while remaining indefinite throughout .	We extend the existence and uniqueness results to indefinite , Morse 2-functions with connected fibers .
By comparing to formation models , we show that in situ formation of the system is unlikely .	Instead we propose that it is a water-rich system of sub-Neptunes that migrated from beyond the snow line .
These are the first detections of rest-frame optical emission lines from high-redshift DLA galaxies .	Unlike the Lyman-alpha line , the [ OIII ] line provides a measure of the systemic velocity of the galaxy .
Certain states that were bound to the helium surface then dissolve into the continuum turning into long-lived resonances .	As a result microwave absorption lines acquire an asymmetric Fano lineshape that is tunable by varying the microwave polarisation or the in-plane magnetic field .
However , external pollution of a cool white dwarf by , e.g. , planetary debris , leads to the appearance of metal lines in its spectral energy distribution .	These lines provide a unique tool to identify and measure magnetism in the coolest and oldest white dwarfs in the Galaxy .
The density of states at the junction does not reveal any electronic induced interface states .	A dominant perovskite character is found at the interface layer .
We study the kinetics of polariton condensation accounting for the condensation process as well as the energy relaxation of condensed polaritons due to their scattering with phonons and excitons .	By assuming a Boltzmann kinetic description of the scattering process , we show that intra-condensate relaxation can be accounted for by an additional time-dependent term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation .
Many data in the high energy physics are , in fact , sample means .	It is shown that when this exact meaning of the data is taken into account and the most weakly bound states are removed from the hadron resonance gas , the acceptable fit to the whole spectra of pions , kaons and protons measured at midrapidity in central Pb-Pb collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } = 2.76 $ TeV [ Phys.Rev.Lett.109,252301 ( 2012 ) ] is obtained .
Despite the intractability of generic optimal partially observable Markov decision process planning , there exist important problems that have highly structured models .	Previous researchers have used this insight to construct more efficient algorithms for factored domains , and for domains with topological structure in the flat state dynamics model .
First-order perturbation theory and many-body Green function analysis are used to quantify the influence of size , surface reconstruction and surface treatment on exciton transport between small silicon quantum dots .	Competing radiative processes are also considered in order to determine how exciton transport efficiency is influenced .
Adhesion of membranes may be achieved by specific and non-specific interactions , and typically requires the clustering of many adhesion bonds into `` adhesion domains '' .	One potential mediator of the early stages of the aggregation process is the Casimir-type forces between adhesion sites induced by the membrane thermal fluctuations .
We find that very compact ( $ \lesssim $ 1 pc ) and massive ( $ \sim6\times10^5 M_\odot $ ) clusters form rapidly when pristine gas collapses isothermally with the aid of efficient Ly $ \alpha $ emission during the transition from molecular-cooling halos to atomic-cooling halos .	Because the local free-fall time of dense star-forming gas is very short ( $ \ll 1\ , { \rm Myr } $ ) , a large fraction of the collapsed gas is turned into stars before stellar feedback processes blow out the gas and shut down star formation .
This one will be called the osculating cyclide here .	Directions of this tangency of higher order form a line filed on the surface and its integral curves will be called Dupin lines on the surface under consideration .
PT-symmetric models form a natural class where the partition function is necessarily real , but not necessarily positive .	The correlation functions of these models display a much richer set of behaviors than Hermitian systems , displaying sinusoidally-modulated exponential decay , as in a dense fluid , or even sinusoidal modulation without decay .
We explain why the `traditional ' UFB bounds are neither necessary nor sufficient and propose , instead , a sufficient condition which ensures that there are no local minima along the flat directions .	This conservative ( but meaningful ) condition divides the parameter space into regions which are allowed , regardless of cosmology , and regions in which cosmology is expected to play a major role .
Here we realize a dissipative gas of rubidium Rydberg atoms and measure its full counting statistics for both resonant and off-resonant excitation .	We find strongly bimodal counting distributions in the off-resonant regime that are compatible with intermittency due to the coexistence of dynamical phases .
In both cases , we use a simple trace criterion that arranges all first-order systems in three classes with a clear geometrical meaning : they represent rotations , translations , or parallel displacements .	We analyze in detail the relevant example of an optical resonator .
Here we develop a real-space renormalization group method for excited state ( RSRG-X ) , that allow us to overcome this challenge , and establish the existence and universal properties of such temperature-tuned dynamical phase transitions .	We characterize a specific example : the 1D disordered transverse field Ising model with interactions .
The foreshock region of a CME shock front , where shock accelerated electrons form a beam population in the otherwise quiescent plasma is generally assumed to be the source region of type II radio bursts .	Nonlinear wave interaction of electrostatic waves excited by the beamed electrons are the prime candidates for the radio waves ' emission .
Comparison of the X-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidence of the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock , offering an interesting experimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halo generation .	The halo in A520 apparently consists of two spatially distinct parts , the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structure related to the shock , where the latter may provide pre-energized electrons for subsequent turbulent re-acceleration .
We report on the results of XMM-Newton observations of two Broad Absorption Line Quasars ( BAL QSOs ) , Q1246-057 and SBS 1542+541 .	Unprecedented sensitivity of XMM allows spectral analysis of these X-ray weak sources .
Furthermore , we study an $ F ( R ) $ gravity model with a sum of exponentials form of the scale factor , where the bounce in the early universe as well as the late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized in a unified manner .	As a result , we build a second order polynomial type model in terms of $ R $ and show that it could be stable .
While changes in the single-particle electronic properties have been extensively investigated , modifications in the many-body collective phenomena in the exact 2D limit , where interaction effects are strongly enhanced , remain mysterious .	Here we report a combined optical and electrical transport study on the many-body collective-order phase diagram of 2D NbSe $ _2 $ .
Enhancement of the corresponding cross-section with respect to the Standard Model value can probe the electroweak symmetry breaking sector or test extra dimensional models with heavy Kaluza-Klein gluons and quarks .	We perform a detailed analysis including background and detector simulation in the specific case of a universal extra-dimensional model with two extra dimensions compactified using the geometry of the real projective plane .
They are customized for three observational strategies , such as the single pointing , the mosaicking , and the drift-scanning .	For each strategy , derived are the optimal strategy parameters that yield band power estimates with minimum uncertainty .
The modified version was easier to handle and more combinatorial than the original one .	On the other hand , it was known that the Kashaev invariant coincides with the evaluation of the colored Jones polynomial at the certain root of unity .
A single integro-differential equation for the initial state amplitude has been obtained .	Exact numerical solutions of this equation are computed and compared with the full time dependent Schr { \ '' o } dinger equation solution for Hydrogen atoms .
We investigate the behavior of the entanglement entropy of dual field theory in this model .	When the above two model parameters change , we observe the second order , first order and zeroth order phase transitions from the behavior of the entanglement entropy at some intermediate temperatures .
[ 1,2,3 ] as a scheme for constructing models of { \it naturally } light composite Higgs boson .	These are models in which -- { \it without fine -- tuning of parameters } -- the composite Higgs 's mass M and vacuum expectation value v are much lighter than its binding energy scale \Lambda .
We generate the k-omega diagram of the Fourier power and find a straight ridge that represents the dispersion relation of the waves .	Along the ridge , we find a lot of prominent nodes which represent the available frequencies of the QFP waves .
We determine the mass-radius relation of relativistic white dwarf stars ( a self-gravitating degenerate Fermi gas at T=0 ) in a D-dimensional universe and study the influence of the dimension of space on the laws of physics when we combine quantum mechanics , special relativity and gravity .	We exhibit characteristic dimensions D=1 , D=2 , D=3 , D= { 1\over 2 } ( 3+\sqrt { 17 } ) , D=4 , D=2 ( 1+\sqrt { 2 } ) and show that quantum mechanics can not balance gravitational collapse for D\ge 4 , even in the non-relativistic regime .
Solving Dyson-Schwinger equation at large $ N $ , we find that different phases of gauge theories are characterized by gaps in eigenvalue distribution over a unit circle .	In particular , we obtain no-gap , one-gap and two-gap solutions at large $ N $ for a class of matrix model we are considering .
In the Chandra Deep Field South 1Msec exposure we have found , at redshift 3.700 +- 0.005 , the most distant Type 2 AGN ever detected .	It is the source with the hardest X-ray spectrum with redshift z & gt ; 3 .
The sparsity of the analysis in every individual frame of the multi-frame is evaluated through the R\'enyi entropy measures : the best local resolution is determined minimizing the entropy values .	The overall spectrogram of the signal we obtain thus provides local optimal resolution adaptively evolving over time .
Let $ \text { Mat } _\mathfrak { X } ( \mathbb { K } ) $ denote the $ \mathbb { K } $ -algebra consisting of the matrices with entries in $ \mathbb { K } $ and rows and columns indexed by $ \mathfrak { X } $ .	A matrix $ C \in \text { Mat } _\mathfrak { X } ( \mathbb { K } ) $ is called Cauchy whenever there exist mutually distinct scalars $ \ { x_i\ } _ { i \in \mathfrak { X } } , \ { \tilde { x } _i\ } _ { i \in \mathfrak { X } } $ from $ \mathbb { K } $ such that $ C_ { ij } = ( x_i - \tilde { x } _j ) ^ { -1 } $ for $ i , j \in \mathfrak { X } $ .
In this paper , we prove that for the 2-URMS networks : $ 1 ) $ the solvability can be determined with time $ O ( |E| ) $ ; $ 2 ) $ a solution can be constructed with time $ O ( |E| ) $ ; $ 3 ) $ an optimal solution can be obtained in polynomial time ; $ 4 ) $ the number of encoding links required to achieve a solution is upper-bounded by $ \max\ { 3,2N-2\ } $ ; and $ 5 ) $ the field size required to achieve a linear solution is upper-bounded by $ \max\ { 2 , \lfloor\sqrt { 2N-7/4 } +1/2\rfloor\ } $ , where $ |E| $ is the number of links and $ N $ is the number of sinks of the underlying network .	Both bounds are shown to be tight .
The approach is based on models recently developed in science mapping , being a generalization of the so-called Science Overlay Mapping methodology , referred to as Topic Overlay Mapping ( TOM ) .	It is shown that via applications of TOM in visualization , document clustering , time series analysis etc .
If the experimentally measured numbers and the theoretical input parameters are used with Gaussian errors , we find $ \epe= ( 3.6\pm 3.4 ) \cdot 10^ { -4 } $ and $ \epe= ( 10.4\pm 8.3 ) \cdot 10^ { -4 } $ respectively .	We also give results for $ { \rm Im } V_ { ts } ^*V_ { td } $ .
The obtained experimental data unambiguously demonstrate that a temperature difference between the roots and the leaves of a bean sprout induces a thermoelectric voltage between these two points .	Basing our analysis of the data on the force-flux formalism of linear response theory , we found that the strength of the vegetal equivalent to the thermoelectric coupling is one order of magnitude larger than that in the best thermoelectric materials .
For the ground state modes , we find the mass relation : $ m ( 0^ { ++ } ) & lt ; m ( 2^ { ++ } ) & lt ; m ( 1^ { -+ } ) $ .	Contrary to expectation , the mass of our new $ 0^ { ++ } $ state ( $ m^2=5.4573 $ ) associated with the graviton is smaller than the mass of the $ 0^ { ++ } $ state ( $ m^2=11.588 $ ) from the dilaton .
We will consider the case where one can not or does not want to compute the conditional likelihood density of the observation given the hidden state because of increased computational complexity or analytical intractability .	Instead we will assume that one may obtain samples from this conditional likelihood and hence use approximate Bayesian computation ( ABC ) approximations of the original HMM .
We present first INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observations of a Seyfert galaxy , the type 2 AGN NGC 4388 .	Several INTEGRAL observations performed in 2003 allow us to study the spectrum in the 20 - 300 keV range .
It is shown how Clifford algebra provides much more : it provides room for new physics , with the prospects of resolving certain long standing puzzles .	The theory of branes and the idea of how a 3-brane might represent our world is discussed in detail .
We study three models of driven sandpile-type automata in the presence of quenched random defects .	When the dynamics is conservative , all these models , termed the random sites ( A ) , random bonds ( B ) , and random slopes ( C ) , self-organize into a critical state .
In an illustrative model , a filament contracts radially by self-gravity , increasing the mass of its cores .	During this contraction , FUV photoevaporation and ablation by shocks and winds disperse filament gas and limit core growth .
Alanates and boranates are studied intensively because of their potential use as hydrogen storage materials .	In this paper we present a first-principles study of the electronic structure and the energetics of beryllium boranate , Be ( BH4 ) 2 .
This irregularity is induced by magnetization oscillations which arise due to excitation of the spin waves when the core annihilates .	We show that the core switching can be controlled with the assist magnetic field and by changing the waveform .
Our main technical ingredient is a sufficient condition for almost sure criticality of the ASM on sequences of finite cacti ( i.e. , separable graphs whose blocks are cycles or single edges ) under the assumption that the random weak limit is almost surely 1-ended .	Examples that allow explicit computations of the critical exponents come from actions of finitely generated groups on regular rooted trees , by automorphisms .
Since general relativity , which is the basis of modern cosmology , is a non-linear theory , one can expect some backreactions in the case of an inhomogeneous matter distribution .	Estimates of the magnitude of these backreactions ( feedback ) range from insignificant to being perfectly able to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe .
Atmospheric point concentration measurements are modelled as the sum of a spatially and temporally smooth atmospheric background concentration , augmented by concentrations due to local sources .	We model source emission rates with a Gaussian mixture model and use a Markov random field to represent the atmospheric background concentration component of the measurements .
We propose a new qubit consisting of a superconducting ring with two ordinary zero junctions and one ferromagnetic pi junction .	In the system , two degenerate stable states appear in the phase space without an external magnetic field because of a competition between the zero and pi states .
Then we provide examples of Polish groups with ample metric generics , such as the isometry group $ \Iso ( \bU_1 ) $ of the bounded Urysohn space , the unitary group $ { \mathcal U } ( \ell_2 ) $ of a separable Hilbert space , and the automorphism group $ \Aut ( [ 0,1 ] , \lambda ) $ of the Lebesgue measure algebra on $ [ 0,1 ] $ .	We deduce from this and earlier work of Kittrell and Tsankov that this last group has the automatic continuity property , i.e. , any morphism from $ \Aut ( [ 0,1 ] , \lambda ) $ into a separable topological group is continuous .
However contrary to Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) the PLS components are also choosen to be optimal for predicting the response $ Y $ .	In this paper we provide a new and explicit formula for the residuals .
We consider systematic unitary errors , random unitary errors , and decoherence processes .	We show that unitary errors which destroy the interference destroy the efficiency of the algorithm , too .
The DIR net is a system consisting of two components , called DIR Manager ( or , shortly , the manager ) and DIR Backup Agent ( shortly , the backup ) .	One manager and a set of backups is located in the system to be `guarded ' , one component per node .
We prove a useful identity valid for all $ ADE $ minimal S-matrices , that clarifies the transformation of the relative thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz ( TBA ) from its standard form into the universal one proposed by Al.B.Zamolodchikov .	By considering the graph encoding of the system of functional equations for the exponentials of the pseudoenergies , we show that any such system having the same form as those for the $ ADE $ TBA 's , can be encoded on $ A , D , E , A/Z_2 $ only .
The influences of Si sheet doping levels on the properties of InAs/GaAs quantum dots ( QDs ) are investigated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and photoluminescence ( PL ) .	AFM measurements reveal that Si sheet doping does n't change the morphology of InAs QDs .
We find that the behavior of the capacitance is widely different depending on whether the system is in the magnetic or charge polarized phases .	In the magnetic phase , the capacitance is dominated by the presence of the edge states while the ribbon width is small .
Using this description , a characterization of compact-valued retracts of a given space in terms of functional extenders is obtained .	For example , if $ X\subset Y $ , then there exists a continuous compact-valued retraction from $ Y $ onto $ X $ if and only if there exists a normed weakly additive extender $ u\colon C* ( X ) \to C* ( Y ) $ with compact supports preserving $ \min $ ( resp. , $ \max $ ) and weakly preserving $ \max $ ( resp. , $ \min $ ) .
However , the connectivity patterns that appear in brain networks , and their individual effects on network dynamics , are far from being fully understood .	We study the connections between edge configuration and dynamics in a simple oriented network composed of two interconnected cliques ( representative of brain feedback regulatory circuitry ) .
As a concrete example , we offer a subdivision for which the associated tropical surfaces are smooth cubics with exactly 27 tropical lines in the general case , and always at least 27 tropical lines .	We also give examples of smooth tropical surfaces of arbitrary degree greater than 3 , containing no tropical lines .
The class of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces , first introduced by Chern and Tenenblat [ 3 ] , is characterized by the property that to each solution of a differential equation , within the class , there corresponds a 2-dimensional Riemannian metric of curvature equal to $ -1 $ .	The class of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces carries close ties to the property of complete integrability , as manifested by the existence of infinite hierarchies of conservation laws and associated linear problems .
In the framework of heavy quark effective theory , the leading order Isgur-Wise form factors relevant to semileptonic decays of the ground state $ \bar { b } s $ meson $ B_ { s } $ into orbitally excited $ D $ -wave $ \bar { c } s $ mesons , including the newly observed narrow $ D^ { * } _ { s1 } ( 2860 ) $ and $ D^ { * } _ { s3 } ( 2860 ) $ states by the LHCb Collaboration , are calculated with the QCD sum rule method .	With these universal form factors , the decay rates and branching ratios are estimated .
We consider ensembles of Gaussian ( Hermite ) and Wishart ( Laguerre ) $ N\times N $ hermitian matrices .	We study the effect of finite rank perturbations of these ensembles by a source term .
We proof that the constructed homomorphisms $ \M_ { g,1 , p } \to \M_ { g',1 , ( b-1 ) } $ are injective .	One of these embeddings for $ g = 0 $ is classic .
How Very Young Massive star Clusters ( VYMCs ; also known as `` starburst '' clusters ) , which typically are of $ \gtrsim 10^4M_\odot $ and are a few Myr old , form out of Giant Molecular Clouds is still largely an open question .	Increasingly detailed observations of young star clusters and star-forming molecular clouds and computational studies provide clues about their formation scenarios and the underlying physical processes involved .
It is not known with certainty at what chain length the linear conformation is no longer the global minimum .	To clarify this point , we use { \it ab initio } and density functional methods to compute the relative energies of the linear and hairpin alkane conformers for increasing chain lengths .
The flattening effect ensures the observed linear behaviour of the radial Regge trajectories $ M^2 ( n ) =m_0^2 + n_r \mu^2 $ GeV $ ^2 $ , where the slope $ \mu^2 $ is very sensitive to the parameter $ \gamma $ , which determines the weakening of the string tension $ \sigma ( r ) $ at large distances .	For the $ \rho $ -trajectory the linear behaviour starts with $ n_r=1 $ and the values $ \mu^2=1.40 ( 2 ) $ ~GeV $ ^2 $ for $ \gamma=0.40 $ and $ \mu^2=1.34 ( 1 ) $ ~GeV $ ^2 $ for $ \gamma=0.45 $ are obtained .
The first part of the paper is devoted to the long time/long range rescaling of the fractional Fisher-KPP equation .	This rescaling is based on the exponential speed of propagation of the population .
Then , we make specific predictions about temporal evolution of several light and heavy species in the Galactic bulge .	We predict that alpha-elements should be enhanced relative to Fe for most of the [ Fe/H ] range , with different degrees of enhancement due to the different nucleosynthetic history of each element , and show that Lithium abundance should follow a trend with metallicity similar to that found for the solar neighbourhood .
Spiking Neural P systems , SNP systems for short , are biologically inspired computing devices based on how neurons perform computations .	SNP systems use only one type of symbol , the spike , in the computations .
Although , in the conventional sense , this higher scale means more tuning , it may well make the underlying theory simpler as illustrated with one example .	Direct production of new particles heavier than about 5 TeV becomes very difficult at LHC though indirect signals such as deviations in the Higgs to gamma gamma branching ratio may still be possible .
The result is due to the contribution of noise to the generation of autonomous responses by each copy , which are altogether associated with a common decision .	Moreover , factors that correlate the responses of the redundant units ( extrinsic noise or regulatory cross-talk ) contribute to reduce fidelity , while those that further uncouple them ( heterogeneity within the copies ) can lead to stronger information gain .
Since [ FeII ] emission has been linked primarily to supernova shocks , we attribute the high [ FeII ] / [ NeII ] ratios in low-metallicity galaxies to enhanced supernova activity .	We consider this to be a dominant mechanism for PAH destruction , rather than grain destruction in photoionized regions surrounding young massive stars .
We construct quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) of the source for the flaring period of 2008 and during a quiescent period in May 2010 .	Data have been compiled from observations with Fermi , Swift , RXTE , the VLBA , and various ground-based optical and radio telescopes .
Extraction of fuzzy rules from raw data based on the combining of statistical machine learning models is base of this proposed approach .	In the proposed model , SOM is used as a clustering algorithm to partition the whole input space into the several disjoint regions .
We explore the role of resonance sticking in the scattered disk , a phenomenon characterized by multiple temporary resonance captures ( 'resonances ' refers to external mean motion resonances with Neptune , which can be described in the form r : s , where the arguments r and s are integers ) .	First , all scattered TNOs evolve through intermittent temporary resonance capture events and gravitational scattering by Neptune .
Here we analyse the Greenland Ice Shelf and Nevada Test Site borehole g anomalies , and confirm with increased precision this value of alpha .	This and other successful tests of this theory of gravity , including the supermassive black holes in globular clusters and galaxies , and the `dark-matter ' effect in spiral galaxies , demonstrates the validity of this theory of gravity .
Thanks to the recent detection of solar-like oscillations in G-K giants in open clusters with Kepler , we can now directly determine stellar masses for a statistically significant sample of stars in the old open clusters NGC6791 and NGC6819 .	The aim of this work is to constrain the integrated RGB mass loss by comparing the average mass of stars in the red clump ( RC ) with that of stars in the low-luminosity portion of the RGB ( i.e.stars with L & lt ; ~ L ( RC ) ) .
However , in large dimensions , when the shape of the integrand function is far from that of the Gaussian density and/or the sample size is small , the standard Laplace approximation can be inaccurate .	We propose an improved Laplace approximation which increases asymptotically the accuracy of the standard Laplace formula by one order of magnitude , and which is also accurate in high-dimensions .
In this model , each cell is selected for division with a probability that corresponds to the ratio between its area and the area of the whole window .	This selected cell is then divided by throwing a ( uniformly distributed ) point into the cell and drawing a line segment through the point under a random angle with the segment ending at the cell 's boundary .
We find that this result is independent of the initial configuration of the field , as well as of coalescence effects between migrating dunes .	The time for the final state to be reached is studied as a function of the relevant phenomenological parameters .
The sky region between 0 deg & lt ; = RA & lt ; = 360 deg and 26 deg & lt ; = DEC 49 deg ( ca .	6500 square degrees ) was observed with an angular resolution of 0.9 deg .
Then the problem of sum power minimization is considered .	Each design problem can be solved efficiently using optimal joint power allocation and beamforming under the framework of convex optimization .
The present paper extends these equations to include models with variable Newton parameter and variable cosmological term , motivated by the nonperturbative renormalization program for quantum gravity based upon the Einstein-Hilbert action .	We focus on the Brans-Dicke form of the renormalization-group improved action functional .
These models have radii , masses , density contrasts , turbulent linewidths , and projected velocity gradients consistent with observations of low-mass molecular cloud cores .	Our models are evolved in time under self-gravitational hydrodynamics with AMR using a barotropic equation of state that models the transition from an isothermal to an adiabatic equation of state .
Among 648 12 $ \mu $ m detected quiescent red-sequence galaxies without H $ \alpha $ emission , 26 % and 55 % show near-UV and mid-IR excess emissions , respectively .	When we consider only bright ( $ M_ { r } $ $ & lt ; $ $ - $ 21.5 ) galaxies with early-type morphology , the fraction of galaxies with recent star formation is still 39 % .
The characteristic time between metabasin transitions is comparable to the structural relaxation time , suggesting that these transitions are relevant for the long time dynamics .	The crossing between metabasins is accompanied by very rapid diffusional jumps of several groups of dynamically correlated particles .
Usually these signals are contaminated during the acquisition process , therefore several power spectrum methods are used to improve the frequency resolution .	In this article classical and modern power spectrum methods are used .
We use the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory to study the topological superconducting proximity effects between a segment of a nanowire with a p-wave order parameter and a metallic segment .	This model faithfully represents key qualitative features of an experimental setup , where only a part of a nanowire is in immediate contact with a bulk superconductor , inducing topological superconductivity .
We discuss our results for different combinations of inter and intra species interaction strengths with commensurate and incommensurate fillings of the bosons .	The phases we have obtained are superfluid , Mott insulator and a novel phase separation , where different species reside in spatially separate regions .
We consider dynamical stabilization of Bose-Einstein condensates ( BEC ) by time-dependent modulation of the scattering length .	The problem has been studied before by several methods : Gaussian variational approximation , the method of moments , method of modulated Townes soliton , and the direct averaging of the Gross-Pitaevskii ( GP ) equation .
The distribution of the order-parameter fluctuations , P ( M_x ) , is evaluated numerically for spin-chains of up to 20 spins .	For the equilibrium case ( j_E=0 ) , we find the expected Gaussian fluctuations away from the critical point while the critical order-parameter fluctuations are shown to be non-gaussian with a scaling function Phi ( x ) =Phi ( M_x/ & lt ; M_x & gt ; ) = & lt ; M_x & gt ; P ( M_x ) strongly dependent on the boundary conditions .
This illustrates that temperature-composition phase diagram for hole-doped 122 can be simply parameterized by x , similar to the electron-doped 122 systems found in literature .	Compared to 122 with a coupled antiferromagnetic order ( TN ) and orthorhombic structural transition ( To ) at ~ 132 K , 1.3 % Mo-doped 122 ( x = 0.013 ) gives TN = To = 125 ( 1 ) K according to neutron diffraction results and features in specific heat , magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity .
Assuming a single power law model for the spatial correlation function ( SCF ) , quantitative limits on the AGN clustering have been obtained : a comoving correlation length 1.5 & lt ; ~ r_0 & lt ; ~ 3.3/h Mpc is implied for comoving evolution , while 1.9 & lt ; ~ r_0 & lt ; ~ 4.8 for stable clustering and 2.2 & lt ; ~ r_0 & lt ; ~ 5.5 for linear evolution .	These values are consistent with the correlation lengths and evolutions obtained for galaxy samples , but imply smaller amplitude or faster evolution than recent UV and optically selected AGN samples .
Context : Their high intrinsic brightness and small dispersion in absolute magnitude make red clump ( RC ) stars a prime tracer of Galactic structure and kinematics .	Aims : We aim to derive accurate , multi-epoch radial velocities and atmospheric parameters ( Teff , log g , [ M/H ] , Vrot sin i ) of a large sample of carefully selected RC stars , fainter than those present in other spectroscopic surveys and located over a great circle at high Galactic latitudes .
The theory is derived from the first-principles magnetic-field coupling Hamiltonian of Pickard and Mauri , which is applicable to nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotentials in the local density approximation to density functional theory .	The pseudopotential of the nanostructure is treated as a perturbation of a bulk reference crystal , with linear and quadratic response terms included in k.p perturbation theory .
The morphology of the diffuse emission strongly resembles that of a pulsar wind nebula ( PWN ) and extends asymmetrically to the South-West of a point-source presented as a potential pulsar .	The spectrum of the putative pulsar and compact nebula are well-characterized by an absorbed power-law model which , for a reasonable $ N_ { \rm H } $ value of $ 14\times 10^ { 22 } \rm cm^ { -2 } $ , exhibit an index of 1.1 and 2.5 respectively , typical of Vela-like PWNe .
{ We utilised the EUV observations from SDO/AIA .	We extracted a wide slit along the jet axis and 12 thin slits across its axis to investigate the longitudinal motion and transverse rotation .
We compare the present algorithm with the two existing and widely used methods for reconstructing missing entries for DNA microarray gene expression data : the Bayesian principal component analysis ( BPCA ) and the local least squares imputation method ( LLS ) .	The three algorithms were applied to four microarray data sets and two synthetic low-rank data matrices .
In analogy with the classical theory of Whittaker coefficients for automorphic functions , we construct a `` Fourier transform '' functor , called $ \mathsf { coeff } _ { G , \mathsf { ext } } $ , from the DG category of $ \mathfrak { D } $ -modules on $ \operatorname { Bun } _G $ to a certain DG category $ \mathcal { W } h ( G , \mathsf { ext } ) $ , called the \emph { extended Whittaker category } .	Combined with work in progress by other mathematicians and the author , this construction allows to formulate the compatibility of the Langlands duality functor $ \mathbb { L } _G : \operatorname { IndCoh } _ { \mathcal N } ( \operatorname { LocSys } _ { \check { G } } ) \to \mathfrak { D } ( \operatorname { Bun } _G ) $ with the Whittaker model .
However , few papers have used optimization techniques with guaranteed convergence in order to increase the efficiency of the passive coupling of adjacent structures .	In this paper , the combined problem of optimal arrangement and mechanical properties of dampers placed between two adjacent buildings is considered .
In a virialized stellar system , the mean-square velocity is a direct tracer of the energy per unit mass of the system .	Here , we exploit this to estimate and compare root-mean-square velocities for a large sample of nuclear star clusters and their host ( late- or early-type ) galaxies .
Summing infinitely many diagrams in the cumulant , a numerically exact solution for the interband polarization is found .	Its full time dependence and the absorption lineshape of the quantum dot are calculated .
The instability appears with an Elsasser number above unity , and saturates with an azimuthal mode number $ m $ which increases with the Elsasser number .	Measurements of the structure agree well with 2D global linear mode analyses and 3D global nonlinear simulations .
Under these settings , the conventional intuitive properties for the open and closed balls will not hold true .	Therefore , four kinds of open and closed sets are proposed .
Such covariance matrices are frequently occurring in the problems of optimal filtering , extrapolation and interpolation of MRP and Markov Random Fields ( MRF ) .	It is shown , that the structure of these three forms of matrices has the same form , but the matrix elements in the first case are scalar quantities ; in the second case matrix elements representing a product of vectors of dimension m ; and in the third case , the off-diagonal elements are the product of matrices and vectors of dimension m. The properties of such matrices were investigated and a simple formulas of their inversion was founded .
McLerran-Venugopolan ( MV ) model and iterative solution of DGLAP equation in the double leading log approximation for small x gluon distribution function were used to derive the new formula for initial chromofield energy density .	This initial chromofield energy is distributed among color neutral clusters or strings of different length .
Some of these materials were discarded for insufficient emissivity , others for inadequate beta .	By contrast , CHONS clusters ( beta=1.4 , T=19 K ) combine nicely with magnesium silicate ( beta=2 , T=18.7 K ) to give a spectrum which falls well within the observational error bars ( total emission cross-section at 250 mum : 8.6 10^ { -26 } cm^ { 2 } per H atom ) .
We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types , and apply them to a variety of real-world networks , showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks .	We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks , both analytic ones based on generating function methods , and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques .
The infrared exponent of the ghost propagator at 0.4GeV region is \alpha_G=0.20 but there is an exceptional Gribov copy with \alpha_G=0.27 .	The features of the exceptional Gribov copy are investigated by measuring four one-dimensional Fourier transform ( 1-d FT ) of the gluon propagator transverse to each lattice axis .
Such structure is predicted theoretically , as a consequence of refraction by large-scale plasma fluctuations in the interstellar medium .	Along with the much-studied $ \theta_\mathrm { d } \propto \lambda^2 $ scaling of angular broadening $ \theta_\mathrm { d } $ with observing wavelength $ \lambda $ , our observations indicate that the spectrum of interstellar turbulence is shallow , with an inner scale larger than 300 km .
We introduce an explicit solution for the non-equilibrium steady state ( NESS ) of a ring that is coupled to a thermal bath , and is driven by an external hot source with log-wide distribution of couplings .	Having time scales that stretch over several decades is similar to glassy systems .
Using Internet discussion communities as model systems , we define the concept of a word niche as the relationship between the word and the characteristic features of the environments in which it is used .	We develop a method to quantify two important aspects of the size of the word niche : the range of individuals using the word and the range of topics it is used to discuss .
A band inversion can occur at a single point $ \Gamma $ with considerably large inversion strength , in addition to the opening of a bulk band gap throughout the Brillouin zone .	We also demonstrate that both of these families are related to each other by cross-substitutions of cations in the underlying tetragonal structure and that one can suitably tune their topological properties in a desired manner .
The main result is the twofold case of 3 speeds .	On the one hand , we prove that accumulations can not happen when all ratios between speeds and all ratios between initial distances are rational .
In the latter case , thefamilies of trajectories depend also strongly on the value of $ \gamma $ .	We also study carefully the modifications of the resultswhen a regularization is introduced in the potential at small scales.We check and illustrate all the results with the exact integration ofthe equations of motion .
Fortunately , very often these processes are dominated by only a limited subset of the network 's reaction pathways .	In this work we propose a novel computationally inexpensive method to identify and select the key pathways of complex reaction networks , so that high-level ab-initio calculations can be more efficiently targeted at these critical reactions .
Posterior probabilistic statistical inference without priors is an important but so far elusive goal .	Fisher 's fiducial inference , Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions , and Bayesian inference with default priors are attempts to achieve this goal but , to date , none has given a completely satisfactory picture .
We also provide a definitive compilation of the various PMS model sets .	In the H-R diagram , the masses inferred for the individual stars by the models are accurate to better than 10 % above 1 Msun , but below 1 Msun they are discrepant by 50-100 % .
Similar results are derived for a nonlinear periodic equation with zero equilibrium position ; in the autonomous case , they are valid for any periodic solution .	All the estimates are attained at a scalar equation and , thereby , are accurate for any norm .
Recently we have develop a formalism \cite { Toyota3 } , \cite { Toyota4 } to explore the subject based on the string formalism developed by Aoyama\cite { Aoyama } .	The formalism can systematically investigate the effect of closed paths , especially generalized clustering coefficient $ C_ { ( p ) } $ introduced in \cite { Toyota4 } , on six degrees of separation .
Many authors have discussed techniques to excise or mitigate RFI in searches for fast transients , but comparisons between different approaches are lacking .	This work develops RFI mitigation techniques for use in searches for dispersed pulses , employing data recorded in a `` Fly 's Eye '' mode of the Allen Telescope Array as a test case .
It is found that data supports the picture where X ( 3872 ) is mainly a ( $ \bar cc $ ) Breit-Wigner resonance with a small contribution to the self-energy generated by $ \bar DD^* $ final state interaction .	For our optimal fit , the pole mass and width are found to be : $ M_X=3871.2\pm0.7 $ MeV and $ \Gamma_X=6.5\pm1.2 $ MeV .
Determining the validity of this approximation -- known as the spin model approximation -- is complicated , and has not been addressed in detail .	Here we shed light in this direction by calculating Ramsey dynamics exactly for two interacting spin-1/2 particles in a harmonic trap .
It concentrates on values of the density ratio close to a critical one , where the supercritical bifurcation changes to the subcritical one .	As the solitary wave velocity approaches the minimum phase velocity of linear interfacial waves ( the bifurcation point ) , the solitary wave solutions transform into envelope solitons .
Others allow that a decision is made on a set of hypotheses .	In [ 6 ] , we proposed a decision rule based on a distance measure .
Here we provide an investigation which type of superstatistics is most suitable to properly describe share price dynamics on various time scales .	It is shown that while chi-square superstatistics works well on a time scale of days , on a much smaller time scale of minutes the price changes are better described by lognormal superstatistics .
( b ) $ n\geq 3 $ and $ \kappa ( X ) \geq 0 $ .	Moreover , by using this inequality , we will study $ h^ { 0 } ( K_ { X } +tL ) $ for the case where $ ( X , L ) $ is a quasi-polarized 3-fold .
We theoretically study electronic properties of a graphene sheet on xy plane in a spatially nonuniform magnetic field , $ B = B_0 \hat { z } $ in one domain and $ B = B_1 \hat { z } $ in the other domain , in the quantum Hall regime and in the low-energy limit .	We find that the magnetic edge states of the Dirac fermions , formed along the boundary between the two domains , have features strongly dependent on whether $ B_0 $ is parallel or antiparallel to $ B_1 $ .
We deducted the Hubble law and the age of the Universe , through the introduction of the Inverse Yukawa Field ( IYF ) , as a non-local additive complement of the Newtonian gravitation ( Modified Newtonian Dynamics ) .	As result we connected the dynamics of astronomical objects at great scale with the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ( $ \Lambda $ FRW ) model .
In the microcanonical ensemble , the post-collapse regime is marked by the formation of a `` binary '' -like structure surrounded by an almost uniform halo with high temperature .	These results are consistent with thermodynamical predictions .
As a probabilistic model for classification , we adopt a multinomial logistic regression .	The concept of rejection with contextual information is implemented by modeling the classification problem as an energy minimization problem over a graph representing local and multiscale similarities of the image .
In parallel with the evolution of femtosecond and attosecond laser as well as free-electron laser technology , a variety of theoretical methods have been developed to describe the behavior of atoms , molecules , clusters , and solids under the action of those laser pulses .	Here we review major ab initio wave-function-based numerical approaches to simulate multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules driven by intense long-wavelength and/or ultrashort short-wavelength laser pulses .
I find that entropy perturbations always remain below $ 10^ { -4 } $ during fresh inflation and become negligible when fresh inflation ends .	Hence , the adiabatic fluctuations dominate the primordial spectrum at the end of fresh inflation .
For the transition from dusty to dust-free conditions where gas opacities dominate , we now implement a gradual change as a more realistic approximation of dust destruction .	We study how the above effects , especially the outflow , influence the SEDs and the images of the protostar .
Depending on the evolutionary behaviour of radio-loud AGN , our estimate for the point source contribution to the extragalactic background emission ranges from about ~20 % -40 % for a redshift drop off at Z_ { max } =3 to around ~35 % -85 % for a cutoff at Z_ { max } =5 .	Roughly 70 % -90 % of the AGN contribution to the EGRB would be due to BL~Lacs/FR I objects .
In a graphene Landau level ( LL ) , strong Coulomb interactions and the fourfold spin/valley degeneracy lead to an approximate SU ( 4 ) isospin symmetry .	At partial filling , exchange interactions can spontaneously break this symmetry , manifesting as additional integer quantum Hall plateaus outside the normal sequence .
For the sake of applications , the range of coefficients has been considerably broadened , i.e.extended to semirings , so that the results could be specialized to the boolean and multiplicity cases .	This requires some caution ( use of `` positive formulas '' , iteration replacing inversion , stable submodules replacing finite-rank families for instance ) .
The research results show that for both two models with the lowest Landau level , the increasing $ z $ improves the response of the critical temperature to the applied magnetic field even without the charge density , and the analytical results uphold the numerical results .	In addition , we find even in the Lifshitz black hole , the Maxwell complex vector model is still a generalization of the SU ( 2 ) Yang-Mills model .
The insulator to metal phase transition in NiO is studied within the framework of reduced density matrix functional theory and density functional theory .	We find that the spectral density obtained using reduced density matrix functional theory is in good agreement with experiments both undoped as well as doped NiO .
For net fields strong enough to yield observed protostellar accretion rates , however , zonal flows with a density amplitude of 10-20 % are formed .	These strengths are comparable to those seen in simulations of ideal MHD disk turbulence .
We employ these observations to both investigate the frequency and nature of the circumstellar disk population in the cluster .	The observations are sufficiently sensitive to enable the first detailed measurement of the disk frequency for very low mass stars at the peak of the stellar IMF .
Therefore , a clear understanding of the physics of coronal loops will help us understand the physics of active region heating in particular and coronal heating in general .	This requires a precise measurement of physical quantities such as electron densities and filling factors , temperatures , and flows in coronal loops .
We show that deformations which are marginal but not exactly marginal lead to a non-conformal solution with a logarithmically running coupling constant .	Surprisingly , at third order in the deformation we find the same beta functions for the couplings in field theory and in supergravity , suggesting that the leading order beta functions ( or anomalous dimensions ) do not depend on the gauge coupling ( the coefficient is not renormalized ) .
A waveform channel is considered where the transmitted signal is corrupted by Wiener phase noise and additive white Gaussian noise .	A discrete-time channel model that takes into account the effect of filtering on the phase noise is developed .
The value of the constant agrees with that perturbatively obtained from free gluons , with 20 % discrepancy .	When $ l $ is close to the Hadronic scale , the entropic $ c $ -function decreases smoothly , and it is consistent with zero within error bars at $ l \gtrsim 0.9 $ fm .
It is shown that alternative , equally plausible , choices leads to the definition of a Parity operator that is conserved by the Weak Interactions .	The operator commonly known as CP is a more appropriate choice for a Parity operator .
We find that at large times the cloud and the massless particles are decoupled , with separately conserved energies .	The interaction between them occurs through a scattering process in which the cloud , acting very much like a thin shell , contracts and eventually bounces off the cores of the massive monopoles .
C1s spectromicroscopy provides an independent measurement of the graphene thickness distribution map .	The work function , measured by photoelectron emission microscopy ( PEEM ) , varies across the surface from 4.34 to 4.50eV according to both the graphene thickness and the graphene-SiC interface chemical state .
A star forms when a cloud of dust and gas collapses .	It is generally believed that this collapse first produces a flattened rotating disk , through which matter is fed onto the embryonic star at the center of the disk .
The dominant mode of semiconvection in stars is layered semiconvection , where the layer height is an adjustable parameter analogous to the mixing length in convection .	The rate of mixing across the semiconvective region is sensitively dependent on the layer height .
We derive an Ising Hamiltonian for kinetic simulations involving interstitial and vacancy defects in binary alloys .	Our model , which we term `ABVI ' , incorporates solute transport by both interstitial defects and vacancies into a mathematically-consistent framework , and thus represents a generalization to the widely-used ABV model for alloy evolution simulations .
This paper explores `` black hole '' solutions of various Einstein-wave matter systems admitting an isometry of their domain of outer communications taking every point to its future .	In the first two parts , it is shown that such solutions , assuming in addition that they are spherically symmetric and the matter has a certain structure , must be Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstrom .
A double integration appears in the geometric phase formula because of the presence of two time variables within the theory .	We show that the geometric phases are then identified with horizontal lifts of surfaces in an abelian gerbe with connection , rather than with horizontal lifts of curves in an abelian principal bundle .
Double-peaked velocity profiles are also evident near the two CO peaks , implying that these CO peaks are orbit crowding zones in a barred/oval potential .	Although NIR data only give an upper limit of the possible bar lengths , due to a large inclination of the NGC 5033 disk ( i = 68 deg ) , our CO data clearly suggests the presence of a small ( the semi-major axis of about 12 '' - 15 '' or 1.1 - 1.4 kpc ) nuclear bar ( or oval structure ) in the center of the `` non-barred '' galaxy NGC 5033 .
In our approach , it is transparent how the superconformal structure of the effective 4D actions is inherited from the one of the original 5D supergravity .	We consider both ungauged and gauged 5D supergravities .
In contrast , as uniaxial strain varies from compressive to tensile , a spin-resolved selective self-doping increases the half-metallic character of the ribbons .	The relevant strain-induced changes in electronic properties arise from band structure modifications at the Fermi level as a consequence of a spin-polarized charge transfer between pi-orbitals of the N and Al edge atoms in a spin-resolved self-doping process .
Quantum field theory allows more general symmetries than groups and Lie algebras .	For instance quantum groups , that is Hopf algebras , have been familiar to theoretical physicists for a while now .
Black Holes are unique objects which allow for meaningful theoretical studies of strong gravity and even quantum gravity effects .	An infalling and a distant observer would have very different views on the structure of the world .
This paper discusses the need for an empirical lnterpretatlon of any theory of confidence factors applied to Knowledge Based Systems and describes an empirical lnterpretatlon of DS theory suggesting that the theory has been extensively misinterpreted .	For the essentially syntactic DS theory , a model is developed based on sample spaces , the traditional semantic model of probability theory .
Higgs boson production at hadron colliders at NLO.3 .	Signatures of Heavy Charged Higgs Bosons at the LHC.4 .
The main difficulty is to establish the approximate independence of the eigenvalue counting function $ N_ { ( -\infty , x ) } ( \tilde M_n ) $ ( where $ \tilde M_n $ is a suitably rescaled version of $ M_n $ ) with the event that there is no spectrum in an interval $ [ x , x+s ] $ , in the case of a GUE matrix .	This will be done through some general considerations regarding determinantal processes given by a projection kernel .
This extends a theorem of Vorobyev and Zimmermann , relating solutions of max-plus linear equations and set coverings .	We give various illustrations .
The 1D D $ _2 $ equation of state is reported , and the one-dimensional character of the adsorbed D $ _2 $ is analyzed .	The isotopic dependence of the constitutive properties of the quantum fluid are studied by comparing D $ _2 $ and H $ _2 $ .
Classical algorithms for solving such problems typically take time polynomial in the number of vectors and the dimension of the space .	Quantum computers are good at manipulating high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces .
Neutrino masses at the tree level are generated through $ R- $ parity violation and seesaw mechanism .	We have analyzed the full effect of one-loop contributions to the neutrino mass matrix .
The bounds for the lower tail have a fast Gaussian decay and the bounds for the upper tail satisfy an optimality condition .	A special feature of the presented inequalities is that the underlying Poisson process does not need to have finite intensity measure .
We studied electron spectral indices of nonthermal emissions seen in hard X-rays ( HXRs ) and in microwaves .	We analyzed 12 flares observed by the Hard X-ray Telescope aboard { \it Yohkoh } , Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters ( NoRP ) , and the Nobeyama Radioheliograph ( NoRH ) , and compared the spectral indices derived from total fluxes of hard X-rays and microwaves .
Using the Parkes radio telescope , we have searched for pulsed radio emission from the recently discovered X-ray pulsars AX J1811.5-1926 and PSR J0537-6910 in the supernova remnants G11.2-0.3 and N157B , respectively .	We detected no significant pulsed radio emission from these pulsars and have set an upper limit of 0.07 mJy on the 1374 MHz flux from AX J1811.5-1926 and upper limits of 0.18 mJy and 0.06 mJy for the flux from PSR J0537-6910 at 660 MHz and 1374 MHz , respectively .
The order of $ H $ depends on $ t $ , $ k $ , $ d $ , and the order of $ G $ .	With $ t=k $ , we obtain large sets of bounded degree vertices .
The problem of determining $ \delta ( H , n ) $ has been widely studied for graphs ( i.e. $ 2 $ -graphs ) , but little is known for $ k \geq 3 $ .	Here we determine the asymptotic value of $ \delta ( H , n ) $ for all complete $ k $ -partite $ k $ -graphs $ H $ , as well as a wide class of other $ k $ -partite $ k $ -graphs .
Just as electrons undergo Thomson scattering with photons , dark matter particles may experience an analogous form of momentum exchange with dark energy .	We investigate the influence such an interaction has on the formation of linear and nonlinear cosmic structure , by running for the first time a suite of N-body simulations with different dark energy equations of state and scattering cross sections .
In particular , we determine the requirements on $ V ( x ) $ in order for the QNM 's to form complete sets , and discuss in what sense they form complete sets .	Among other implications , this study opens up the possibility of using QNM expansions to analyse the behavior of waves in relativistic systems , even for systems whose QNM 's do { \it not } form a complete set .
We explore the phase diagram and analyse the mobility of particles and magnetic properties .	At unit filling , the transition from a paramagnetic Mott insulator to a ferromagnetic superfluid appears continuous , contrary to what was predicted with mean field .
We discuss the precession of spin-polarized Ultra Cold Neutrons ( UCN ) and $ ^ { 3 } $ He atoms in uniform and static magnetic and electric fields and calculate the spin relaxation effects from motional $ v\times E $ magnetic fields .	Particle motion in an electric field creates a motional $ v\times E $ magnetic field , which when combined with collisions , produces variations of the total magnetic field and results in spin relaxation of neutron and $ ^ { 3 } $ He samples .
In the past few years , there has been significant research on the game-theoretic issues that arise in an advertiser 's interaction with the mechanism as well as possible redesigns of the mechanism , but this ranking order has remained standard .	From a search engine 's perspective , the fundamental question is : what is the best assignment of advertisers to slots ?
By taking cheap-to-compute coordinate gradients in each iteration , they are usually faster than accelerated full gradient descent , and thus suitable for large-scale optimization problems .	In this paper , we improve the running time of accelerated coordinate descent , using a clean and novel non-uniform sampling method .
The quiescent mass-loss rate due to a spherically symmetric , non-accelerating wind is found to be in the range 0.4-2.9 x 10E-4 solar masses per year , consistent with other infrared and radio observations , but considerably larger than the 10E-5 solar masses per year deduced from both the orbital change and the X-ray column density .	There is rapid , large amplitude flaring at 4.5 and 11.5 microns at the same time as enhanced radio and X-ray activity , with the infrared spectrum apparently becoming flatter in the flaring state .
Variable selection for structured covariates lying on an underlying known graph is a problem motivated by practical applications , and has been a topic of increasing interest .	However , most of the existing methods may not be scalable to high dimensional settings involving tens of thousands of variables lying on known pathways such as the case in genomics studies .
Using this approach we experimentally demonstrate a significant ( about 20-fold ) enhancement in quantum memory efficiency compared to the no cavity case .	A strong dispersion originating from absorption engineering inside the cavity was observed , which directly affect the cavity line-width .
From this we obtain that $ \operatorname { Im } \log\zeta ( 1/2+it ) $ satisfies a large deviation principle on the critical line .	Results about the moments of the Riemann zeta-function follow .
We prove that for every $ \varepsilon & gt ; 0 $ , every $ \theta\in ( 0,1/p ] $ and every finite metric space $ ( X , d_X ) $ , the metric space $ ( X , d_ { X } ^ { \theta } ) $ embeds into $ \mathscr { P } _p ( \mathbb { R } ^3 ) $ with distortion at most $ 1+\varepsilon $ .	We show that this is sharp when $ p\in ( 1,2 ] $ in the sense that the exponent $ 1/p $ can not be replaced by any larger number .
When the ligand switches between various states induced by chemical interactions or conformational changes , while target activation occurs in only one state , this activation time is affected .	We investigate this dynamics using new equations for the sojourn times spent in each state .
The primary radiation generated in the central continuum-forming region of Active Galactic Nuclei can be reprocessed by very dense , small-scale clouds that are optically-thin to Thomson scattering .	In spite of the extreme conditions expected to prevail in this innermost , central environment , the radiative clouds can survive and maintain cool temperatures relative to the ambient emitting region by means of magnetic confinement .
In this paper we present improved results on the problem of counting triangles in edge streamed graphs .	For graphs with $ m $ edges and at least $ T $ triangles , we show that an extra look over the stream yields a two-pass treaming algorithm that uses $ O ( \frac { m } { \eps^ { 2.5 } \sqrt { T } } \polylog ( m ) ) $ space and outputs a $ ( 1+\eps ) $ approximation of the number of triangles in the graph .
In this paper , by using an alternate polar perovskite insulator ( La0.3Sr0.7 ) ( Al0.65Ta0.35 ) O3 ( LSAT ) for reducing lattice mismatch from 3.0 % to 1.0 % , the low-temperature carrier mobility has been increased 30 fold to 35,000 cm2V-1s-1 .	Moreover , two critical thicknesses for the LSAT/SrTiO3 ( 001 ) interface are found : one at 5 unit cell for appearance of the 2DEG , the other at 12 unit cell for a peak in the carrier mobility .
We introduce a class of Hubbard models in any dimensions which are nonsingular in the sense that both the Coulomb interaction and the density of states ( at the Fermi level ) are finite .	We then prove that the ground states of the models exhibit saturated ferromagnetism , i.e. , have maximum total spins .
Mobile cloud computing , in which resource-rich virtual machines of smart mobile device are provided to a customer as a service , can be terrific solution for expanding the limitation of real smart mobile device , but the resources utilization rate is low and the information can not be shared easily .	To address the problems above , this paper proposes an information system for intelligent community , which is composed of thin clients , wide band network and cloud computing servers .
Each D2D transmitter ( Tx ) uses all its antennas to beamform information towards its desired D2D receiver , which uses only a single antenna for reception .	While beamforming at the D2D Tx reduces D2D interference to the neighbouring cellular UEs ( CUEs ) , the cellular-to-D2D interference is also negligible due to highly directional beamforming at the massive MIMO base station .
This paper confirms the alternating character of the virial series for $ d \ge 6 $ , and provides the first evidence for an alternating character for $ d=4 $ .	Moreover , we show that this sign alternation is due to the existence of a branch point on the negative real axis .
We analyze the gravitational dynamics of a classical scalar field coupled to gravity in asymptotically AdS spacetime , which leads to black hole formation on the shortest nonlinear time scale for some initial conditions .	We show that the observed collapse can not be described by the well-known process of a random-phase cascade in the theory of weak turbulence .
As a matter of fact , our calculation shows a much more dramatic reduction of the effective neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section for the low energy neutrinos with E & lt ; 10MeV than the results of Horowitz .	Therefore , the ion-ion correlation effect will be more important than has hitherto been recognized .
We compute the 1-loop correction to the electroweak observables from spin-1 resonances in SO ( 5 ) /SO ( 4 ) composite Higgs models .	The strong dynamics is modeled with an effective description comprising the Nambu-Goldstone bosons and the lowest-lying spin-1 resonances .
Subclasses of WCM are Warm-dense matter ( WDM ) , ultra-fast matter ( UFM ) , and high-energy density matter ( HEDM ) , containing electyrons ( e ) and ions ( i ) .	Strong e-e , i-i and e-i correlation effects and partial degeneracies are found in these systems where the electron temperature $ T_e $ is comparable to the electron Fermi energy .
An applied electric field can reversibly change the temperature of an electrocaloric material under adiabatic conditions , and the effect is strongest near phase transitions .	This phenomenon has been largely ignored because only small effects ( 0.003 K V^-1 ) have been seen in bulk samples such as Pb0.99Nb0.02 ( Zr0.75Sn0.20Ti0.05 ) 0.98O3 and there is no consensus on macroscopic models .
It is unclear how very close binary stars form , given that during the pre-main-sequence phase the component stars would have been inside each other .	One hypothesis is that they formed further apart , but were brought in closer after formation by gravitational interaction with a third member of the system .
We study scattering from potentials that rise monotonically on one side ; this is generally avoided .	We report that resonant states are absent in such potentials when they are smooth and single-piece having less than three real turning points ( like in the cases of Morse oscillator , exponential and linear potentials ) .
For spin 1 we find several candidate phases of which the most natural one is a phase with spins organized into parallel Haldane chains .	For spin 3/2 we find that the most natural phase has spins organized into parallel ladders .
We consider a charge-and-dipole hidden momentum configuration , and turn off the fields by collapsing a null shell onto the system , forming a black hole .	In numerical calculations we find that the black hole receives a kick corresponding to 0.1 % of the initial stored momentum .
The scattering rates for both electrons and holes are shown to be approximately $ T $ -linear .	When a field is applied , a $ T^2 $ dependence is recovered , indicating that the origin of the $ T $ -linear dependence is spin fluctuations .
Recent progress in the seismic interpretation of field beta Cep stars has resulted in improvements of the physics in the stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars .	Further asteroseismic constraints can be obtained from studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster , which all have similar age , distance and chemical composition .
We use the ACTpol published cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) polarization data to constrain cosmological birefringence , a tracer of parity violation beyond the standard model of particle physics .	To this purpose , we employ all the polarized ACTpol spectra , including the cross-correlations between temperature anisotropy and B mode polarization ( TB ) and between E mode and B mode ( EB ) , which are most sensitive to the effect .
The problem we consider is to select a set of BS locations , a set of relay locations , and an association of sensor nodes with the selected BS locations , so that number of hops in the path from each sensor to its BS is bounded by hmax , and among all such feasible networks , the cost of the selected network is the minimum .	The hop count bound suffices to ensure a certain probability of the data being delivered to the BS within a given maximum delay under a light traffic model .
Here we present Very Large Array observations made in the 18.5 to 36.5 GHz region that indicate a spectral turnover at $ \sim $ 13 GHz and a negative spectral index ( $ \alpha \simeq -2.0 $ ) at higher frequencies .	The spectrum is consistent with that of an extragalactic High Frequency Peaker ( HFP ) .
More recent rules are compared with Efron 's [ Biometrika 58 ( 1971 ) 403-417 ] biased-coin rule and extended to allow balance over covariates .	The main properties are loss of information , due to imbalance , and selection bias .
We discuss the finite-temperature corrections to strong segregation theory in terms of Sommerfeld-like expansion and how these corrections affect the thermodynamic stability of bicontinuous mesophase structures , such as gyroid .	Finally , we explore the opposite limit of weakly-segregated particles , and predict the generic stability of a bicontinuous cluster morphology within the mean-field phase diagram .
Non-fully essential dynamics are , in a way , reducible to surfaces of lower genus , while in the fully essential case the dynamics is decomposed into a disjoint union of periodic bounded disks and a complementary invariant externally transitive continuum $ C $ .	When the Misiurewicz-Ziemian rotation set has non-empty interior the dynamics is fully essential , and the set $ C $ is ( externally ) sensitive on initial conditions and realizes all the rotational dynamics .
Such results are motivated by their applications to SPDEs and in particular financial mathematics .	Vector-valued Malliavin theory in Banach space E is naturally restricted to spaces E which have the so-called UMD property , which arises in harmonic analysis and stochastic integration theory .
We present the results of numerical studies of supernova remnant evolution and their effects on galactic and globular cluster evolution .	We show that parameters such as the density and the metallicity of the environment significantly influence the evolution of the remnant , and thus change its effects on the global environment ( e.g. , globular clusters , galaxies ) as a source of thermal and kinetic energy .
A 3D dynamical model is used to study the motion in the central parts of an elliptical galaxy , hosting a massive and dense nucleus .	Our aim is to investigate the regular or chaotic character of the motion , with emphasis in the different chaotic components , as well as the sticky regions of the dynamical system .
At a first stage , individual telescopes produce a trigger signal from the pixel information in the telescope camera .	The final event trigger is then formed by combining trigger signals from several telescopes .
Why there has been confusion between the wave and particle nature of an entity.4 .	The relation between the speed of light c , Planck 's constant k and time 5 .
A theorem of Leibman asserts that a polynomial orbit $ ( g ( 1 ) , g ( 2 ) , g ( 3 ) , \ldots ) $ on a nilmanifold $ G/\Gamma $ is always equidistributed in a union of closed sub-nilmanifolds of $ G/\Gamma $ .	In this paper we give a quantitative version of Leibman 's result , describing the uniform distribution properties of a finite polynomial orbit $ ( g ( 1 ) , \ldots , g ( N ) ) $ in a nilmanifold .
In this paper we propose a SLA negotiation procedure for femtocell networks .	The Bandwidth Broker controls the allocated bandwidth for femtocell users .
At present , dwarf spheroidal galaxies satellites of the Milky Way may represent the best astrophysical objects for dark matter ( DM ) searches with gamma-ray telescopes .	They present the highest mass-to-light ratios known in the Universe .
It means that Schr\ '' odinger equation predicts infinite speed of the wave function perturbations propagation .	This feature of classical Schr\ '' odinger equation is traditionally interpreted as non-locality of quantum mechanics .
As a characteristic feature of the planar junction we find that $ I_ { \rm c } $ is a concave function of temperature at the strong coupling limit while it crosses over to a convex function with decreasing the coupling strength .	We also find different chemical-potential dependences of $ I_ { \rm c } $ in the monolayer and bilayer cases .
We investigate the difficulties involved in the application of the analysis to observational data .	We derive magnetic power spectra for the three clusters and discuss influences on their shapes .
Motivated by widely observed examples in nature , society and software , where groups of already related nodes arrive together and attach to an existing network , we consider network growth via sequential attachment of linked node groups , or graphlets .	We analyze the simplest case , attachment of the three node V-graphlet , where , with probability alpha , we attach a peripheral node of the graphlet , and with probability ( 1-alpha ) , we attach the central node .
Building on earlier work , we study here its NSNS sector , where Q- and R-fluxes are precisely identified .	Interestingly , the Q-flux is captured in an analogue of the Levi-Civita spin connection , giving rise to a second curvature scalar .
An important consideration is the fact that raising false alarms carries a significantly lower cost than not detecting at- tacks .	For this reason , we examine how cost-sensitive classification methods can be used in Intrusion Detection systems .
Moreover , we define a new sequence of isoperimetric constants which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral gap in a very general setting .	Finally , these results are used to obtain simple sufficient conditions for the existence of a spectral gap in terms of the first and second order transition probabilities .
The rank-three tensor models , which have a rank-three tensor as their only dynamical variable , may be interpreted as models of dynamical fuzzy spaces .	In this interpretation , the generalized Hermiticity condition on the rank-three tensor leads to a cyclic property of the algebra of functions on fuzzy spaces .
Unlike models based on current stellar evolutionary practice , these simulations show a chaotic dynamics characteristic of highly turbulent flow .	Theoretical analysis of this flow , both in the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes ( RANS ) framework and by simple dynamic models , show an encouraging consistency with the numerical results .
For scale free ( SF ) networks , with degree distribution $ P ( k ) \sim k^ { -\lambda } $ , we find that $ \ell_ { \scriptsize opt } $ scales as $ N^ { ( \lambda - 3 ) / ( \lambda - 1 ) } $ for $ 3 & lt ; \lambda & lt ; 4 $ and as $ N^ { 1/3 } $ for $ \lambda\geq 4 $ .	Thus , for these networks , the small-world nature is destroyed .
The benefits and shortcomings of this approach , that may be viewed as a local reweighting strategy , is compared to the ones of recently proposed algorithms involving global event reweighting .	We use the new algorithms to improve on our previous study of the effects of Bose-Einstein correlations on the W mass measurement at LEP 2 .
Based on first-principles calculations , we propose that this type of QAH state could be realized in La2MnIrO6 monolayers , with the size of the gap as large as 26 meV in the ideal case .	We observe that the electronic structure is sensitive to structural distortions , and that an enhanced Hubbard U tends to stabilize the nontrivial gap .
The spatial correlations among multiple spatial subchannels , which have to be considered when CSI is imperfect , are also often neglected .	In this paper , we release the above assumptions and take the CSI uncertainty and the spatial and temporal selectivities into account .
These observables are built on Poincare ' and dilatation generators .	Their commutators are given by spin observables defined from the same symmetry generators .
Based on this idea , a citation network model is proposed , in which a node has two discrete stage : vigorous and dormant .	Vigorous nodes can be deactivated and dormant nodes may be activated and become vigorous .
We elucidate the boundary condition subtleties which hampered previous efforts to build a Lorentzian-signature AdS/CFT correspondence .	For two-point correlators , our construction is automatically equivalent to the previously formulated prescription for the retarded propagator .
We also find that the radial and angular distributions of substructures depend on subhalo mass .	In particular , high mass subhaloes tend to be less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer to the direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their less massive counterparts .
Recently , they have been linked to aging of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) where protein aggregates accumulate at the old pole region of the aging bacterium .	Because of the potential of E. coli as a model organism , elucidating aging and protein aggregation in this bacterium may pave the way to significant advances in our global understanding of aging .
Our results demonstrate when and why our joint optimization methodology is superior to either version of separate optimization .	The methodology is illustrated with simulations and an application in document matching .
In the 1990s a comparison of sparse EGRET measurements with single-dish flux density monitoring from the Metsahovi and UMRAO programs established a temporal connection between the onset of flaring at radio band and the occurrence of gamma-ray activity .	Correlations between the emergence of new VLBI components from the core , flares in linearly polarized radio flux , and gamma-ray activity in bright EGRET-detected blazars supported a picture in which the gamma-ray and the radio band emission arises in the same shocked region of the jet , with the high energy emission produced via inverse Compton scattering by the synchrotron-emitting electrons in the jet .
We develop a model for tidal mass loss , based upon the phase space distribution of particles , which accounts for how both tidal and Coriolis torques perturb the angular momentum of each particle in the system .	This allows us to study how both the density profile and velocity anisotropy affect the degree of mass loss -- we present basic results from such a study .
We observed the object during 10 nights , spread over one month , with the Tuebingen 80cm and the Goettingen 50cm telescopes .	We fitted the observed light curve with a sine and simulated the light curve of this system with the nightfall program .
Fully 3-dimensional computations of flow through a long pipe demand a huge number of degrees of freedom , making it very expensive to explore parameter space and difficult to isolate the structure of the underlying dynamics .	We therefore introduce a `2+epsilon ' dimensional model of pipe flow which is a minimal 3-dimensionalisation of the axisymmetric case : only sinusoidal variation in azimuth plus azimuthal shifts are retained , yet the same dynamics familiar from experiments are found .
Under a certain multiplicative independence condition on the roots of the zeta-function of $ \cC $ , we derive an asymptotic formula for the number of $ n =1 , ... , N $ such that $ ( # \cC ( \F_ { q^n } ) - q^n -1 ) /2gq^ { n/2 } $ belongs to a given interval $ \cI \subseteq [ -1,1 ] $ .	This can be considered as an analogue of the Sato-Tate distribution which covers the case when the curve $ \E $ is defined over $ \Q $ and considered modulo consecutive primes $ p $ , although in our scenario the distribution function is different .
We investigate the behavior of the divisor function in both short intervals and in arithmetic progressions .	The latter problem was recently studied by \'E .
Solutions to the equation $ \partial_t { \cal E } ( x , t ) -\frac { i } { 2m } \Delta { \cal E } ( x , t ) =\lambda| S ( x , t ) |^2 { \cal E } ( x , t ) $ are investigated , where $ S ( x , t ) $ is a complex Gaussian field with zero mean and specified covariance , and $ m\ne 0 $ is a complex mass with $ { \rm Im } ( m ) \ge 0 $ .	For real $ m $ this equation describes the backscattering of a smoothed laser beam by an optically active medium .
That is , states are excluded that have a big bang or big crunch or which split into multiple asymptotic de Sitter spacetimes .	( For simplicity , transitions between different values of the cosmological constant are assumed not to occur , though different positive values are allowed . )
We present a higher-twist production mechanism for $ \eta_c $ and $ \chi_J $ charmonium at large momentum fraction $ x_F $ in pion-nucleon collisions .	The higher-twist contribution is essentially independent of $ x_F $ and therefore becomes dominant at large $ x_F $ , where the leading-twist contribution falls off as $ ( 1-x_F ) ^3 $ .
This setting can be seen as a generalization of the conventional problems of secure source coding with side information at the decoders , and the wiretap channel .	Inner and outer bounds on the rate-distortion-equivocation region for the case of arbitrary channels and side informations are derived .
Numerical simulations have shown that the X-shaped structure in the Milky Way bulge can naturally arise from the bar instability and buckling instability .	To understand the influence of the buckling amplitude on the morphology of the X-shape , we analyze three self-consistent numerical simulations of barred galaxies with different buckling amplitudes ( strong , intermediate and weak ) .
The ground state of this junction is caracterized by the finite phase difference Phi , which is proportional to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and the exchange field in the normal metal .	The proposed mechanism of the Phi junction formation gives a direct coupling between the superconducting current and the magnetic moment in the weak link .
We obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra of seven young M9.5-L3 dwarfs classified in the optical .	We aim to confirm the low surface gravity of the objects in the NIR .
Na5Cu3O6 , a new member of one dimensional charge ordered chain cuprates , was synthesized via the azide/nitrate route by reacting NaN3 , NaNO3 and CuO .	According to single crystal X-ray analysis , one dimensional CuO2 chains built up from planar , edge-sharing CuO4 squares are a dominant feature of the crystal structure .
The influence of surrounding results in ( at least partial ) equilibration and decoherence .	The resulting equilibrium state bears information on initial conditions and is characterized by a representative ensemble .
In 1864 , Waage and Guldberg formulated the `` law of mass action . ''	Since that time , chemists , chemical engineers , physicists and mathematicians have amassed a great deal of knowledge on the topic .
A series of layered CeO $ _ { 1-x } $ F $ _x $ FeAs compounds with x=0 to 0.20 are synthesized by solid state reaction method .	Similar to the LaOFeAs , the pure CeOFeAs shows a strong resistivity anomaly near 145 K , which was ascribed to the spin-density-wave instability .
Their continuum , field theoretic representations are likewise of definite interest .	In this paper we describe various continuum , field theoretic representations of these models based on bosonization and collective field theory techniques .
The coupling to the two particle - two hole states plays a role in shifting the first $ 3^- $ state down to the right position .	It is also found that the dipole strength is fragmented due to the partial occupation of the single-particle states and that the peak position of the giant dipole resonance calculated in ERPA is little changed from that in RPA due to the above-mentioned competing effects : the increase in particle - hole energy and the coupling to two particle - two hole configurations .
We perform a theoretical study of radiative decay of dark intravalley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers .	This decay necessarily involves an electronic spin flip .
We study the low temperature properties of p-spin glass models with finite connectivity and of some optimization problems .	Using a one-step functional replica symmetry breaking Ansatz we can solve exactly the saddle-point equations for graphs with uniform connectivity .
The static structure factor used in the theory is obtained from polymer integral equation theory ; the Debye-H\ '' { u } ckel approximation is inadequate even at low concentrations .	The theory predicts a non-monotonic dependence of the reduced excess viscosity , $ \eta_R $ , on concentration from the behaviour of the static structure factor in polyelectrolyte solutions .
We present the results of gravitational direct $ N $ -body simulations using the commercial graphics processing units ( GPU ) NVIDIA Quadro FX1400 and GeForce 8800GTX , and compare the results with GRAPE-6Af special purpose hardware .	The force evaluation of the $ N $ -body problem was implemented in Cg using the GPU directly to speed-up the calculations .
The anomaly is reproducible between cooling and heating in Nd0:65Eu0:35NiO3 but only appears as a slow stiffening during cooling in undoped NdNiO3 , conformingly with the fact that the MIT in RNiO3 changes from strongly first order to second order when the mean R size is decreased .	The elastic anomaly seems not to be associated with the antiferromagnetic transition , which is distinct from the MIT in Nd0.65Eu0.35NiO3 .
In this work we review some recent developments in the modelling of probabilistic failure times , understood as the time to the formation of a fatigue crack .	We also discuss the how probabilistic models can be used in shape design with the design intent of optimizing the component 's reliability .
We prove the basic properties of canonical characteristic sets .	In particular , we show that in the ordinary case for any ranking the order of each element of the canonical characteristic set of a characterizable differential ideal is bounded by the order of the ideal .
On the other hand , for the determination of the motion of celestial objects , accuracies approaching 0.01 milliarcsec can be obtained by measuring the differential position between the target object and nearby stationary sources .	This astrometric technique uses phase referencing , and the current techniques and limitations are discussed , using the results from four experiments .
The hadronic EOS 's have been obtained in the framework of the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock and relativistic mean field theories , whereas the quark EOS has been derived within the MIT bag model .	We find that the periods of oscillations of neutron stars with a quark core show a kink , which is associated with the presence of a mixed phase region .
Discs with very short thermal evolution time-scales ( i.e . { \tau } & lt ; 0.1 local orbit periods ) develop strong vorticity perturbations that roll up into vortices that have small aspect ratios ( { \chi } & lt ; 2 ) and short lifetimes ( ~ a few orbits ) .	Longer thermal time-scales give rise to vortices with larger aspect ratios ( 6 & lt ; { \chi } & lt ; 10 ) , and lifetimes that depend on the entropy gradient .
Several genetic programming systems are created , each solving a different problem .	In these systems , the median number of generations G needed to evolve a working program is measured .
To better understand the implications of the results of Smalley and collaborators , the electromagnetic response of linear carbon chains to both static and dynamics fields have been studied , making use of ab-initio methods .	It is found that the associated emission currents , plotted as a function of the bias potential , follow Fowler-Nordheim intensity-voltage curves typical of the field emission of metallic tips .
We design the first algorithm for solving these problems that handles constrained resources other than time , and improves over a trivial reduction to the non-contextual case .	We consider very general settings for both contextual bandits ( arbitrary policy sets , e.g.Dudik et al .
In particular , an automorphism $ \af $ on a unital separable simple \CA $ A $ in $ { \cal N } $ with tracial rank zero is asymptotically inner if and only if $ $ [ \af ] = [ { \rm id } _A ] \text { in } KK ( A , A ) $ $ and the rotation map $ { \tilde\eta } _ { \phi_1 , \phi_2 } $ is zero .	Let $ A $ be a unital AH-algebra ( not necessarily simple ) and let $ \af\in Aut ( A ) $ be an automorphism .
One of the important and peculiar features of light-front quantization is that the UV cutoff of the light-cone Hamiltonian manifests itself as an IR cutoff for the light-cone momentum , $ p^+ $ .	Due to this feature , the naive results of covariant quantization for the light-like case allude to the absence of the UV/IR mixing in the light-front quantization .
In photoionized gases with cosmic abundances , dielectronic recombination ( DR ) proceeds primarily via nlj -- & gt ; nl'j ' core excitations ( Dn=0 DR ) .	We have measured the resonance strengths and energies for Fe XVIII to Fe XVII and Fe XIX to Fe XVIII Dn=0 DR .
We attempt to generalize the familiar covariantly conserved Bel-Robinson tensor B_ { mnab } ~ R R of GR and its recent topologically massive third derivative order counterpart B ~ RDR , to quadratic curvature actions .	Two very different models of current interest are examined : fourth order D=3 `` new massive '' , and second order D & gt ; 4 Lanczos-Lovelock , gravity .
Informally speaking , the event that a new state is visited at a large time $ t $ may be considered a `` surprise '' .	We prove the following three bounds : 1 ) In any Markov chain with $ n $ states , $ \mathbf { P } _x ( \tau ( y ) = t ) \le \frac { n } { t } $ .
We construct gravitational non-relativistic brane solutions of type IIA/IIB string theories and M-theory and their near-horizon geometries .	The non-relativistic M2 and M5-brane metrics have Schroedinger symmetries with dynamical exponent z=3/2 and z=3 , respectively , whereas the known D3-brane solution has z=2 .
The advent of devices based on single dopants , such as the single atom transistor , the single spin magnetometer and the single atom memory , motivates the quest for strategies that permit to control matter with atomic precision .	Manipulation of individual atoms by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy provides ways to store data in atoms , encoded either into their charge state , magnetization state or lattice position .
In fact , it remains possible that this index is a perfect discriminant of duality .	The investigation presented here bolsters such optimism .
For models with enhanced mass loss , the zero-intensity-full-widths of the line profiles are proportional to the black hole mass to the power of 1/3 .	This scaling relation suggests that the black hole masses of NLS1s ( narrow-line Seyfert 1s ) are relatively low .
However the system was not spatially resolved by BeppoSAX .	Here we present the analysis of archival Chandra and ( for the first time ) XMM-Newton observations , which allow us to disentangle the X-ray emission of the two galaxies .
After a brief background setting the cosmological context for this work , the first part of this review focuses on redshift surveys .	The practical issues of how redshift surveys are carried out , and how one turns a distribution of galaxies into a smoothed density field , are discussed .
In the present work we study the hadron-quark phase transition by investigating the binodal surface and extending it to finite temperature in order to mimic the QCD phase diagram .	In order to obtain these conditions we use different models for the two possible phases , namely the quark and hadron phases .
The secondary beams were selected and separated by the fragment separator BigRIPS and incident at ~240 meV/u on a natural carbon ( secondary ) target , which was surrounded by the DALI2 array to detect coincident de-excitation gammarays .	Scattered particles were identified by the spectrometer ZeroDegree .
The VLA images show that the fraction of core emission is very large ( f_c \approx 0.5 at 8.4 GHz ) , and reveal a previously undetected , very faint counterjet , implying a radio lobe flux density ratio R & gt ; = 11 and a radio lobe distance ratio Q \approx 1.9 .	Those values are much more common in quasars than in radio galaxies , but the optical/near-IR spectra show a clear type II AGN for B3 J2330+3927 , confirming that it is indeed a radio galaxy .
The hadron emission from the droplet is described following Weisskopf 's statistical model .	We consider evolutions of droplets with different initial temperatures and net baryon number .
B 41 , 5535 ( 1990 ) ] .	In this paper we present calculations , which predict that this phase transition can also be induced by an ultrashort laser pulse in As under pressure .
We consider a model of segregation in which large random insulating spherical inclusions forbid small conducting particles to occupy homogeneously the volume of the composite , and allow tunneling between all pairs of the conducting objects .	By solving numerically the corresponding tunneling resistor network , we show that the composite conductivity is enhanced by segregation and that it may remain relatively large also for very small values of the conducting filler concentration .
The degree of quantization is chosen to eliminate low-order bits that over-sample the noise , contain no information , and are difficult or impossible to compress .	The method is lossy but gives guarantees on the maximum absolute difference , the expected mean difference , and the expected RMS difference between the compressed and original images ; these guarantees make it suitable for use on raw images .
centered sub-Gaussian distribution , how to recover the signal $ \theta^* $ if $ D\theta^* $ is sparse { \rca under a linear transformation } $ D\in\mathbb { R } ^ { m\times p } $ ?	One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the following problem : $ $ \min_ { \theta } { 1\over 2 } \|\Phi\theta - c\|^2 + \lambda\|D\theta\|_1. $ $ This paper provides an upper bound of the estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by assuming that the design matrix $ \Phi $ is a Gaussian random matrix .
The radio jets are roughly perpendicular to the dust which is used to constrain the Doppler boosting factors of the radio jet and cores .	The VLBA core flux correlates with the central Halpha+ [ NII ] flux which might indicate that the VLBA core is dominated by an isotropic component .
The confirmation of this effect in full nonlinear general relativity implies that the accretion of exotic matter could be considered an evaporation process .	We speculate that if this sort of exotic matter has some cosmological significance , this black hole area reduction process might have played a crucial role in black hole formation and population .
At high temperatures thermally induced noise becomes a major problem , which must be overcome in order to reliably write magnetic bits with narrow transitions .	We propose an elementary model based on the effective recording time window ( ERTW ) to compute the switching probability of bits during HARM of bit-patterned media .
Examples of this phenomenon are discussed as well as the relation to supersymmetry .	Our results are also connected with rigidity theorems of Borel-like algebras .
We have counted the number of references in 1179 papers published in Astronomy and Astrophysics over twenty years .	The number of references has increased by 60 % between 1975 and 1995 , reflecting the increase ( by the same amount ) of the literature which must be cited , and of the number of pages per paper .
An embedding $ f : ( S^2\times S^1 ) \sqcup S^3\rightarrow { \mathbb R } ^6 $ is { \it Brunnian } , if the restriction of $ f $ to each component is isotopic to the standard embedding .	For each triple of integers $ k , m , n $ such that $ m\equiv n \pmod { 2 } $ , we explicitly construct a Brunnian embedding $ f_ { k , m , n } : ( S^2\times S^1 ) \sqcup S^3 \rightarrow { \mathbb R } ^6 $ such that the following theorem holds .
We calculate partition function and correlation functions in A-twisted 2d $ \mathcal { N } = ( 2,2 ) $ theories and topologically twisted 3d $ \mathcal { N } =2 $ theories containing adjoint chiral multiplet with particular choices of $ R $ -charges and the magnetic fluxes for flavor symmetries .	According to Gauge-Bethe correspondence , they correspond to Heisenberg XXX and XXZ spin chain models .
The remaining three are older , less energetic , and located off the plane .	Five pulsars are associated with sources included in the LAT bright gamma-ray source list , but only one , PSR J1413-6205 , is clearly associated with an EGRET source .
All predictions are obtained using the automated implementation of NLO QCD+EW corrections in the OpenLoops matrix-element generator combined with the Munich and Sherpa Monte Carlo frameworks .	Electroweak corrections play an especially important role in the context of BSM searches , due to the presence of large EW Sudakov logarithms at the TeV scale .
First , we analyze the general case of a geodesic in a regular perturbed vacuum spacetime admitting a helical Killing vector and a reflection symmetry .	Next , we specialize to focus on circular orbits in the equatorial plane of Kerr spacetime at $ O ( \mu ) $ .
Taking account of capillary waves , we find good quantitative agreement between the Monte Carlo simulations and the self-consistent field calculations .	However , the fluctuations of the local interfacial position are strongly suppressed by confinement and mutual interactions between lamellae .
It is possible to realize strongly direction-dependent group velocities .	They can also be tuned over orders of magnitude so that robust delay lines and interference devices are within reach .
We also observe that there is a shape transition at about $ A=190 $ in $ Z=70-80 $ region .	The shape changes from oblate to highly prolate shape in their intrinsic ground state .
Physical implementations of qubits can be extremely sensitive to environmental coupling , which can result in decoherence .	While efforts are made for protection , coupling to the environment is necessary to measure and manipulate the state of the qubit .
It uses a single-resonance model to describe the optical response of each sub-unit and employs the series circuit model to predict the overall response .	Validity of the circuit model relies on short propagation lengths of the surface plasmons .
A gain graph is a graph whose edges are orientably labelled from a group .	A weighted gain graph is a gain graph with vertex weights from an abelian semigroup , where the gain group is lattice ordered and acts on the weight semigroup .
However , their pairing mechanism remains controversial .	Here , we studied the systematic evolution of electronic structure in potassium-coated FeSe single crystal .
We focus on the simplest possible models : representation of data through visualizations and regressions on single variables .	Exam scores are shown to depend on school type , location , and poverty concentration .
The last few million years on planet Earth have witnessed two remarkable phases of hominid development , starting with a phase of biological evolution characterised by rather rapid increase of the size of the brain .	This has been followed by a phase of even more rapid technological evolution and concomitant expansion of the size of the population , that began when our own particular `sapiens ' species emerged , just a few hundred thousand years ago .
We study the exact solution for this model , by numerical and analytical methods .	In particular , we examine the behavior of the model in the vicinity of an unusual coexistence point that we call the `` conical '' point .
The Maxwell-Bloch evolution is given by an infinitesimal action of a nilpotent subalgebra $ n_+ $ of affine Lie algebra $ \hat { sl } _2 $ on a Maxwell-Bloch phase space treated as a homogeneous space of $ n_+ $ .	A space of local integrals of motion is described using cohomology methods .
We show that the energy may be approximately optimized without solving for the entire scale space , but rather solving time-independent linear equations at the native scale of the image , making the method computationally feasible .	We provide a multi-region scheme , and apply our method to motion segmentation .
The stellar atmospheric parameters and the abundances presented here were derived using the equivalent width of individual lines in the stellar spectra through the excitation/ionization equilibrium of iron .	Moreover , we compared the observed Balmer lines with synthetic pro ? les calculated for model atmospheres with a different line formation code .
Another realization involves a trapped ion whose internal-motional state coupling fluctuates randomly .	Its motional state is made to converge to a Fock state by conditional measurements of the internal state of the ion .
We perform first-principles calculations to investigate the band structure , density of states , optical absorption , and the imaginary part of dielectric function of Cu , Ag , and Au-doped anatase TiO2 in 72 atoms systems .	The electronic structure results show that the Cu incorporation can lead to the enhancement of d states near the uppermost of valence band , while the Ag and Au doping cause some new electronic states in band gap of TiO2 .
We study a model of Josephson layered structure which is characterized by two peculiarities : ( i ) superconducting layers are thin ; ( ii ) due to suppression of superconducting states in superconducting layers the current-phase relation is non-sinusoidal and is described by two sine harmonics .	The governing equation is a nonlocal generalization of double sine-Gordon ( NDSG ) equation .
This paper assesses the dynamical role of fluctuations of a quantum system driven far from equilibrium , with laser-aligned molecules as a physical realization .	Time evolutions of the expectation value and the uncertainty of a standard observable are computed quantum mechanically and classically .
We know that the distribution of kinks created during a second order phase transition in pure systems is determined solely by the correlation length at freeze-out time .	The correlation length at that instant of time intuitively describes the size of the defect and therefore the number density of defects is limited by the possibility of holding kinks in a unit volume .
In the classical theorems of extreme value theory the limits of suitably rescaled maxima of sequences of independent , identically distributed random variables are studied .	So far , only affine rescalings have been considered .
Recognition in the real world is open set , i.e.the recognition system should reject unknown/unseen classes at test time .	We present a methodology to adapt deep networks for open set recognition , by introducing a new model layer , OpenMax , which estimates the probability of an input being from an unknown class .
It is proved that for any static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat regular solution the ADM mass is exactly equal to the dilaton charge .	No solutions were found for $ \beta $ above critical values , in particular , for $ \beta=1 $ .
The stars of the middle main sequence have relatively quiescent outer layers , and unusual chemical abundance patterns may develop in their atmospheres .	The presence of chemical peculiarities reveal the action of such subsurface phenomena as gravitational settling and radiatively driven levitation of trace elements , and their competition with mixing processes such as turbulent diffusion .
Central of these is a self-consistent model for the physical mechanism that provides the energy to start and drive the disruption of the star .	We give arguments why the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism should still be regarded as the standard paradigm to explain most explosions of massive stars and show how large-scale and even global asymmetries can result as a natural consequence of convective overturn in the neutrino-heating region behind the supernova shock .
This model presents two types of current-current interaction terms related to the bi-fundamental representation of the group U ( 1 ) .	Firstly , we address the bosonization of a bi-fundamental free Dirac fermion defined on a noncommutative ( NC ) Euclidean plane $ \IR_ { \theta } ^ { 2 } $ .
Such balls are supposed to make up the dark matter as we earlier proposed .	The expected rate of impact of this kind of dark matter ball with the earth seems to crudely match a time scale of 200 years between the impacts .
The Michaelis-Menten equation has played a central role in our understanding of biochemical processes .	It has long been understood how this equation approximates the dynamics of irreversible enzymatic reactions .
Here we summarize the signatures of the pair production dip model for the transition , most notably the spectrum , the anisotropy and the chemical composition .	The main focus of our work is however on the description of the features that arise in the elongation rate and in the distribution of the depths of shower maximum $ X_ { \rm max } $ in the dip scenario .
It is shown that if the dimension of foliation is constant then the distribution is involutive and each maximal integral manifold is totally geodesic .	Characterization of the k-nullity foliation is given , as well as some results concerning constancy of the flag curvature , and completeness of their integral manifolds , providing completeness of ( M , F ) .
Our model incorporates random fluctuations in the $ \alpha - $ parameter and additive noise arising from the small-scale fluctuations of magnetic and turbulent velocity fields .	We show that the noise effects along with non-normality can lead to the stochastic amplification of the magnetic field even in the subcritical case .
Our approach also is successfully applied to whole space $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ to establish an improvement for the sharp Adams inequalities in $ W^ { m , \frac nm } ( \mathbb { R } ^n ) $ due to Ruf , Sani , Lam , Lu , Fontana and Morpurgo .	This type of improvement is still unknown , in general , except the special case $ m=1 $ due to do \'O , de Souza , de Medeiros and Severo .
Additional measurements in a reduced phase space with absolute pseudorapidity less than 0.8 are also presented , in order to compare with other experiments .	The results are corrected for detector effects , presented as particle-level distributions and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators .
It is diffuse emission towards the center of our Galaxy with spectral behavior that makes it difficult to categorize as any of the previously known emission mechanisms at those wavelengths .	With now seven years of WMAP data publicly available , we have learned much about the nature of the haze , and with the release of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the discovery of the gamma-ray haze/bubbles , we have had a spectacular confirmation of its existence at other wavelengths .
In this paper we obtain the time invariant measure for this shock solution in the ASEP , as seen from such a particle .	The mean density at lattice site $ n $ , measured from this particle , approaches $ \rho_ { \pm } $ at an exponential rate as $ n\to\pm\infty $ , with a characteristic length which becomes independent of $ p $ when $ p/ ( 1-p ) & gt ; \sqrt { \rho_+ ( 1-\rho_- ) /\rho_- ( 1-\rho_+ ) } $ .
Our results are : ( 1 ) Our H-band bar fraction ( ~58 % ) is consistent with that from ellipse fits .	( 2 ) 70 % of the stellar mass is in disks , 10 % in bars , and 20 % in bulges .
We study the stability and dynamics of non-Boussinesq convection in pure gases ( CO $ _2 $ and SF $ _6 $ ) with Prandtl numbers near $ Pr\simeq 1 $ and in a H $ _2 $ -Xe mixture with $ Pr=0.17 $ .	Focusing on the strongly nonlinear regime we employ Galerkin stability analyses and direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations .
METATOYs can change the direction of light in ways that appear to , but do not actually , contravene the laws of wave optics .	This direction change applies only to part of the transmitted light beam ; the remainder gets re-directed differently .
Effectively , the free-electron AC polarizability of Ry electron is modulated by intensity landscape and can accept both positive and negative values .	We apply these insights to determining magic wavelengths for Ry-ground-state transitions for alkali atoms trapped in infrared optical lattices .
We demonstrate that the emergent-vortex structure lives on the verge of a phase separation , and single out the very constituents responsible for this state of polar active matter .	Building on this observation , we establish a continuum theory and lay out a strong foundation for the description of vortical collective motion in a broad class of motile populations constrained by geometrical boundaries .
It employs a well-known result of Schwinger , that static electric fields in excess of a critical value are unstable to pair creation , and catastrophically produces a thermal plasma at temperatures & lt ; = 0.5 MeV .	By using observational values for the energy and volume of the source , it is shown that the radiation pressure of an expanding GRB `fireball ' leads to the formation of a Schwinger critical field at the ambient medium immediately outside the `fireball ' .
We find that the LG 's preferred location is regions with a dark matter overdensity close to the cosmic average .	This makes filaments and sheets the preferred environment .
We find that mesoscopic conductance fluctuations in the quantum Hall regime in silicon MOSFETs display simple and striking patterns .	The fluctuations fall into distinct groups which move along lines parallel to loci of integer filling factor in the gate voltage-magnetic field plane .
LIGO 's discovery of a gravitational wave from two merging black holes ( BHs ) of similar masses rekindled suggestions that primordial BHs ( PBHs ) make up the dark matter ( DM ) .	If so , PBHs would add a Poissonian isocurvature density fluctuation component to the inflation-produced adiabatic density fluctuations .
Technically such an alternative model class is obtained by considering finite dimensional linear stochastic SISO systems driven by a L\'evy process .	In this paper we consider a discrete-time version of this model , focusing on the problem of identifying the dynamics and the noise characteristics of such a so-called L\'evy system .
Furthermore , it is shown that this result can be realized also in a non-minimal vector- $ F ( R ) $ gravity .	In addition , we consider the duality of the non-minimal electromagnetic theory and that of the non-minimal YM theory , and also discuss the cosmological reconstruction of the YM theory .
We introduce a notion of a sheaf of vector spaces on a graph , and develop the foundations of homology theories for such sheaves .	One sheaf invariant , its `` maximum excess , '' has a number of remarkable properties .
We find that for many very extended algebras almost all the A type representations that occur in the decomposition of the fundamental representations also occur in the adjoint representation of G+++ .	In particular , for E8+++ , this applies to all its fundamental representations .
These observations spectroscopically confirm previous suggestions of a break based on photometry .	Using Gemini North 's Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer ( NIFS ) we are able to detect and separate early- and late-type stars with a 75 % completeness at Ks = 15.5 .
We show that the rule is the generalization of a simple , well known , explanation of quantum nonlocality - where logical correlation between measurement outcomes is physically backed by a causal/deterministic/local process with causality allowed to go backward in time with backdated state vector reduction .	The possible objection is that quantum algorithms often produce the solution of the problem in an apparently deterministic way ( when their unitary part produces an eigenstate of the observable to be measured and measurement produces the corresponding eigenvalue - the solution - with probability 1 ) , while the present explanation of the speed up relies on the nondeterministic character of quantum measurement .
Its extension to weak-turbulence theory treats resonant interactions of these Langmuir waves with other plasma wave modes , in particular ion-sound waves .	These are strongly damped in plasma of equal ion and electron temperatures , as sometimes seen in , for example , the solar corona and wind .
We study a class of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with a general form of the energy functional .	The class generalizes various examples of modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities considered previously in the literature .
In particular we determine the torsion subgroup of $ E_ { ( M , N ) } ( \Q ) $ and show that its rank is positive .	Furthermore there are infinitely many positive integers $ M $ that can be written in $ n $ different ways , $ n\in\ { 2,3\ } $ , as the sum of three distinct positive integers with the same product $ N $ and $ E_ { ( M , N ) } ( \Q ) $ has rank at least $ n $ .

An effect of the volume change upon proper ferroelastic ( martensitic ) phase transitions in cubic crystals is considered .	Corresponding terms in the Ginzburg-Landau expansion of the Gibbs free energy are analyzed for the first- as well as second-order phase transitions from cubic to tetragonal lattice under the action of uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure .
Moreover , under the hypothesis that Z and { \Lambda } are statistically independent , the joint PDF coincides with the product of the two marginal PDFs .	In this work we discuss these two constitutive hypotheses .
Universal quantum simulation may provide insights into those many-body systems that can not be described classically , and that can not be efficiently simulated with current technology .	The Trotter formula , which decomposes a desired unitary time evolution of the simulator into a stroboscopic sequence of repeated elementary evolutions , is a key algorithmic component which makes quantum simulation of dynamics tractable .
One can define some criteria to judge the accuracy , or the quality of the trial function .	We employ a simple potential form to check how accurate the variational results obtained by a single-parameter trial function can be .
A key ingredient in our approach is bypassing the need for `` black-box '' rounding of fractional solutions , which yields improved competitive ratios .	We begin with an interpretation of Highest-Density-First ( HDF ) as a primal-dual algorithm , and a corresponding proof that HDF is optimal for total fractional weighted flow time ( and thus scalable for the integral objective ) .
First , we apply the Maxwell iteration to the infinite moment system and determine the magnitude of each moment with respect to the Knudsen number .	After that , we obtain the approximation of high order moments and close the moment systems by dropping some high-order terms .
Little is known about u_* , however for large d , random interlacements on Z^d , ought to exhibit similarities to random interlacements on a ( 2d ) -regular tree , for which the corresponding critical parameter can be explicitly computed , see arXiv:0907.0316 .	We prove in this article a lower bound on u_* , which is equivalent to log ( d ) as d goes to infinity .
We measured the polarization memory of excitonic and biexcitonic optical transitions from single quantum dots at either positive , negative or neutral charge states .	Positive , negative and no circular or linear polarization memory was observed for various spectral lines , under the same quasi-resonant excitation below the wetting layer band-gap .
We investigated the outbursts characteristics in terms of energetics , peak luminosities , durations , decays and recurrence times .	We found that bright outbursts ( peak luminosity & gt ; 10^ { 37 } erg s^-1 ) equal in number dimmer outbursts ( & lt ; 10^ { 36.6 } erg s^-1 ) .
An additional contact close to the first one makes it possible to carry a supercurrent through the metal .	Forcing this supercurrent flow along with an additional quasiparticle current from one or many normal-metal reservoirs makes rise to many interesting effects .
The characteristic features are : negative and non-universal squark and slepton masses squared at the unification scale , non-universal gaugino masses , and sizable soft-trilinear couplings .	In this scenario , all soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the unification scale can be smaller than 400 GeV and all the superpartners can be lighter than 400 GeV and still satisfy all the limits from direct searches for superpartners and also the limit on the Higgs mass .
In the first scenario ( ccq-MAC with common messages ) , the two senders each have their private messages , but would also like to transmit common messages .	In the second scenario ( ccq-MAC with conferencing encoders ) , each sender has its own set of messages , but they are allowed to use a limited amount of noiseless classical communication amongst each other prior to encoding their messages .
NEXT has both good energy resolution ( & lt ; 1 % FWHM ) at the Q value of $ ^ { 136 } $ Xe and an extra handle for background identification provided by track reconstruction .	With the background model of NEXT , based on the detector simulation and the evaluation of the detector radiopurity , we can determine the sensitivity to a measurement of the \beta\beta 2\nu\ mode in NEW and to a \beta\beta 0\nu\ search in NEXT100 .
Using these results , we present two $ Z_3 $ -orbifold constructions as examples .	One is the moonshine VOA $ V^ { \natural } $ and the other is a new CFT No.32 in Schellekens ' list .
All symplectic structures are determined for dimension four and the corresponding Lie algebras are classified up to equivalence .	Symplectic four dimensional Lie algebras are described either as solutions of the cotangent extension problem or as symplectic double extension of $ \Bbb RR^2 $ by $ \Bbb RR $ .
This setting models real-world communication bottlenecks in the processing of massive distributed datasets .	We present several very general sampling-based solutions as well as some two-way protocols which have a provable exponential speed-up over any one-way protocol .
A fault-tolerant strategy that requires no time modulation of the barrier ( and hence no timing synchronization ) switches by tilting the profile by an amount at least equal to the barrier height and dissipates at least that amount of energy .	Here , we present a third strategy that requires a time modulated barrier but no timing synchronization .
The band structure of alfa- ( Per ) 2M ( mnt ) 2 , leads to a description of these materials as nearly perfectly one dimensional conductors .	The conduction is mainly along the stacking direction of the partially oxidized perylene molecules , ( Per ) 1/2+ , with virtually no interchain bandwidth .
While several observational investigations have revealed the presence of magnetic fields in the circumstellar envelopes , jets and outflows of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars ( PAGBs ) and planetary nebulae ( PNe ) , none has clearly demonstrated their presence at the stellar surface .	The lack of information on the strength of the surface magnetic fields prevents us from performing any thorough assessment of their dynamic capability ( i.e.material mixing , envelope shaping , etc ) .
We present a novel method to search for a new CP-violating phase in b - & gt ; ss~ss~s transition using B - & gt ; phi phi Xs decays , where Xs represents a final state with a specific strange flavor such as K+/- , K*+/- , or K+/-pi-/+ .	Direct CP violation can be enhanced due to an interference between an amplitude beyond the standard model ( SM ) and the SM decay amplitude through the eta_c resonance .
Alekseev et al .	conjectured the existence of massless modes in the spectrum of excitations ( `` anomalous massless modes '' ) building upon certain similarities between a spontaneous symmetry breaking and the interplay of axial and vector symmetries in an anomalous theory .
Efficient transport of UCN from the production volume to the experiment is therefore of great importance .	We have developed a method using prestored UCN in order to quantify UCN transmission in tubular guides .
Plasmonic nanoantenna is of promising applications in optical sensing , single-molecular detection , and enhancement of optical nonlinear effect , surface optical spectroscopy , photochemistry , photoemission , photovoltaics , etc .	Here we show that in a carefully-designed dimer gap-antenna made by two metallic nanorods , the longitudinal plasmon antenna mode ( AM ) of bonding dipoles can compete with the transverse plasmonic cavity modes ( CMs ) , yielding dramatically enhanced or suppressed scattering efficiency , depending on the CMs symmetry characteristics ( e.g. , the radial order n and the azimuthal quantum number m ) .
The problem of computing Craig Interpolants has recently received a lot of interest .	In this paper , we address the problem of efficient generation of interpolants for some important fragments of first order logic , which are amenable for effective decision procedures , called Satisfiability Modulo Theory solvers .
In a limit of slightly misaligned charges , this has a gauge theory description , where supersymmetry is broken by Fayet-Iliopoulos D-terms .	Geometric transitions relate these configurations to dual Calabi-Yaus with fluxes , where H_RR , H_NS and dJ are all nonvanishing .
It also offers nonlinear and neural extensions for optimal control , with empirically supported links to what is seen in the brain .	However , the relevant ADP methods in use today -- TD , HDP , DHP , GDHP -- and the Galerkin-based versions of these all have serious limitations when used here as parallel distributed real-time learning systems ; either they do not possess quadratic unconditional stability ( to be defined ) or they lead to incorrect results in the stochastic case .
We find that ~70 % of Seyfert 1s ( ten out of fifteen ) show variability in at least one of these parameters : the centroid energy , intensity , and equivalent width vary in six , four , and eight sources respectively .	Due to the low S/N , limited sampling and time averaging , we consider these results to represent lower limits to the rate of incidence of variability .
This paper presents studies of four significant wind events between December 2007 and February 2008 over southeastern Idaho .	Based on the favorable results highlighted from validation statistics and in the case studies , the RUC TIBL product has demonstrated operational utility in assessing turbulence hazards to low-flying aircraft and ground transportation , and in the assessment of wildfire threat .
The beta-relaxation regime can be described by the mode-coupling scaling function ; amplitudes and time scales allow a consistent determination of the critical pressure P_c ( T ) .	alpha and beta relaxation depend in the same way on the thermodynamic state ; close to the mode-coupling cross-over , this dependence can be parametrised by an effective coupling Gamma ~ n*T** { -1/4 } .
A unified probability-theoretic approach was used to describe bundle under continuous and discrete load increase .	It was shown that the ratio of distribution D ( d ) of avalanches of sizes d to the number of bundle load steps exactly corresponds to burst probability of size d. Evolution of s - power law distribution exponent of D ( d ) was studied as a function of loading step and bundle size .
Those are precisely the interactions responsible for the thermalization of the energy in the spectrum .	We predict that for small amplitude random waves the time scale of such interactions is extremely large and it is of the order of $ 1/\epsilon^8 $ , where $ \epsilon $ is the small parameter in the system .
We studied nonequilibrium oscillations between left-handed electron neutrinos and nonthermalized sterile neutrinos in medium for resonant and nonresonant cases .	The exact kinetic equations for neutrinos , written in terms of neutrino density matrix in { \it momentum space } were analyzed .
The presented procedure does not rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem , and can therefore be applied to account for both internal and external fluctuations in either variational or non-variational phase-field formulations .	In particular , it can be used to introduce thermodynamical fluctuations in non-variational formulations of the phase-field model , which permit to reach better computational efficiency and provide more flexibility for describing some features of specific physical situations .
While there is good observational support for forming at least some giant planets by disk instability , the mechanism has become theoretically contentious , with different three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics codes often yielding different results .	Rigorous code testing is required to make further progress .
In some cases it may be useful to know parton distributions in a photon gas .	This may be relevant , e.g. , for the analysis of interactions of high energy cosmic ray particles with the cosmic microwave background radiation .
One was to solve calculational questions in geometric topology .	The other was to better understand algebraic K-theory .
We first determine potential energy curves for several states using different basis sets and discuss their predicted accuracy by comparing our values of the well depths and position with other available results .	We then calculate permanent and transition dipole moments for several transitions .
A new class of quantum cryptography ( QC ) protocols that are robust against the most general photon number splitting attacks in a weak coherent pulse implementation has been recently proposed .	In this article we give a quite exhaustive analysis of several eavesdropping attacks on these schemes .
In this paper , we propose a new algorithm based on the pattern-growth paradigm to find minimally infrequent itemsets .	A minimally infrequent itemset has no subset which is also infrequent .
The approach used is that of small perturbations around topologically nontrivial classical solutions $ A^I_\mu $ of the Maxwell equations .	The propagator of the gauge fields and the form of the fields $ A^I_\mu $ are explicitly computed in the Feynman gauge .
We work both with non-fading phase spaces $ c_0 ( \ZZ^- , \X ) $ and $ \ll^\infty ( \ZZ^- , \X ) $ and with exponentially fading phase spaces of the $ \ll^p $ and $ c_0 $ types .	For equations of the convolution type , several criteria of UE stability are obtained in terms of the Z-transform $ \wh K ( \zeta ) $ of the convolution kernel $ K ( \cdot ) $ , in terms of the input-state operator and of the resolvent ( fundamental ) matrix .
Using 17 weak , unblended lines of Ni I together with the most accurate atomic and observational data available we find log epsilon_Ni = 6.17 +/- 0.02 ( statistical ) +/- 0.05 ( systematic ) , a downwards shift of 0.06 to 0.08 dex relative to previous 1D-based abundances .	We investigate the implications of the new nickel abundance for studies of the solar oxygen abundance based on the [ O I ] 630 nm line in the quiet Sun .
The application of the derived equations to few-body systems is realized in terms of Generalized Linearization Approximations ( GLA ) and via the Cluster Factorization Theory ( CFT ) .	To check the reliability of the model we present two different applications .
When the control light is coupled to the atoms , the input signal light is nearly totally reflected and this means that there is no direct coupling of the control light and the signal light through the cavity-confined atoms .	We present analytical and numerical calculations that show this type of the interaction-free all-optical switching in the coupled cavity-atom system can be realized with high switching efficiencies and at low light intensities .
The two newly identified pivot types are : the Primal Tricky Pivot with positive indicator and the Dual Tricky Pivot with negative indicator .	If more than one candidate pivot element/cell is of the same type , then a selection among them can be made based on a measure of goodness that is defined as the decrease in the infeasibility index of such cells .
Examples of this include partially missing information about next sub-event , first sub-event , last sub-event , result of an event , input to an event , destination of an event , and raw material involved in an event .	In many cases one can recover part of the missing knowledge through reasoning .
The host star is metal rich , with an estimated [ Fe/H ] = +0.4 .	This is the first planet to emerge from our new survey of 1600 M-to-K dwarf stars .
Using Reddit as an example , we study the evolution of users based on comment and submission data from 2007 to 2014 .	Even using one of the simplest temporal differences between users -- -yearly cohorts -- -we find wide differences in people 's behavior , including comment activity , effort , and survival .
MPI @ LHC2014 concentrated mainly on the phenomenology of LHC measurements whilst keeping in perspective those results obtained at previous hadron colliders .	The workshop has also debated some of the state-of-the-art theoretical considerations and the modeling of MPI in Monte Carlo event generators .
successive sequences .	Here , the successive inserted wors are strongly dependent .
This statement refers to the precise ( additive ) probability model .	I show that the joint distribution of any non-commuting pair of variables can be quantified via upper and lower probabilities , i.e.the joint probability is described by an interval instead of a number ( imprecise probability ) .
We combine transport measurements with high-resolution magnetic torque magnetometry and report here evidence of magnetic ordering of the two-dimensional electron liquid at the interface .	The magnetic ordering exists from well below the superconducting transition to up to 200 K , and is characterized by an in-plane magnetic moment .
Bayesian initialization averaging ( BIA ) is proposed as a method to generate high quality starting values for the EM algorithm .	Competing sets of starting values are combined as a weighted average , which is then used as the starting position for one full EM run .
Rescattering of secondary kaons in the dense hadron gas together with the influence of in-medium kaon potential can lead to a relative decrease of a $ \phi $ yield observed in the hadronic channel .	We analyze how the in-medium modifications of meson properties affect apparent - reconstructed momentum distributions of $ \phi $ mesons .
This enhancement in photostability and recovery rate is found to be explicable by the modified correlated chromophore domain model , with the NPs resulting in the domain free energy advantage increasing from 0.29 eV to 0.41 eV .	Additionally , the molecular decay and recovery rates are found to be in agreement with previous measurements of DO11/PMMA [ Polymer Chemistry \textbf { 4 } , 4948 ( 2013 ) ] .
The scaling of the bounce action with respect to the most relevant dimensionless couplings and ratios of scales is analyzed .	In the case of the decays towards the susy vacua generated by nonperturbative effects , the results confirm previous analytical estimations of this scaling , obtained by assuming a triangular potential barrier .
We investigate also a `` fluid approach '' to describe the mean physical quantities of the dark matter flow .	We test its validity for a wide range of initial density contrast .
Firstly , we provide explicit and compact formulas for computing both Caputo and ( modified ) Riemann-Liouville ( RL ) fractional pseudospectral differentiation matrices ( F-PSDMs ) of any order at general Jacobi-Gauss-Lobatto ( JGL ) points .	We show that in the Caputo case , it suffices to compute F-PSDM of order $ \mu\in ( 0,1 ) $ to compute that of any order $ k+\mu $ with integer $ k\ge 0 , $ while in the modified RL case , it is only necessary to evaluate a fractional integral matrix of order $ \mu\in ( 0,1 ) . $ Secondly , we introduce suitable fractional JGL Birkhoff interpolation problems leading to new interpolation polynomial basis functions with remarkable properties : ( i ) the matrix generated from the new basis yields the exact inverse of F-PSDM at `` interior '' JGL points ; ( ii ) the matrix of the highest fractional derivative in a collocation scheme under the new basis is diagonal ; and ( iii ) the resulted linear system is well-conditioned in the Caputo case , while in the modified RL case , the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are highly concentrated .
We show that $ F $ has a simply connected wandering domain that stays away from the postcritical set .	We interpret these results in terms of the Teichm\ '' uller space of $ f $ , $ Teich ( f ) $ , included in $ M_ { f } $ the marked space of topologically equivalent maps to $ f $ .
We linked these tweets to US Census data through their locations .	This allowed us to measure emotions expressed in the tweets posted from an area , the structure of social connections , and also use that area 's socioeconomic characteristics in analysis .
This paper examines the state of Open Data in Latvia at the middle of 2014 .	The study is divided into two parts : ( i ) a survey of open data situation and ( ii ) an overview of available open data sets .
Here we extend the Axelrod model with social influence interaction for the study of Mass Media effects through the inclusion of a super-agent which acts over the whole system and has nonnull overlap with each agent of the society .	The dependence with different parameters as the initial social diversity , size effects , Mass Media strength and noise is outlined .
Aims : We investigate and discuss the soft X-ray properties of this AGN sample and examine the correlations between X-ray and VLBI properties , test beaming scenarios , and search for the discriminating properties between the sub-samples detected and not detected by ROSAT .	Methods : Comparing the observed and the predicted X-ray fluxes by assuming an Inverse Compton ( IC ) origin for the observed X-rays , we compute the beaming or Doppler factor and contrast the Doppler factors with other beaming indicators derived from the VLBI observations , such as the value of the expansion velocity , and the observed and intrinsic brightness temperature .
In this paper , we first show the existence of a dyadic grid in the group $ S $ , which has { nice } properties similar to the classical Euclidean dyadic cubes .	Using the properties of the dyadic grid we shall prove a Fefferman -- Stein type inequality , involving the dyadic maximal Hardy -- Littlewood function and the dyadic sharp dyadic function .
The actual position of magnetic impurities in the GaN lattice as well as a possible role of magnetic precipitates is discussed .	The question whether the hole introduce by the Mn impurities is localized tightly on the Mn d-levels or rather on the hybridized p-d bonding states is addressed .
For gluon-gluon fusion an enhancement in the parton level cross-section is expected due to the heavy ( s ) fermion loops which couple to the gluons .	This mechanism is expected to dominate over Drell-Yan for $ L^+L^- $ invariant masses above the $ Z^\prime $ mass .
We present a unifying theory of fields with certain classes of analytic functions , called fields with analytic structure .	Both real closed fields and Henselian valued fields are considered .
To this end , we rigorously calculate the force experienced by a circularly polarized dipole radiating above a surface .	Unlike for linearly-polarized dipoles , force components parallel to the surface can exist , caused by the recoil of unidirectional guided modes excited at the surface and/or by dipole-dipole interactions with the induced image dipole .
We apply this to the case $ M_i $ are w-rigid II $ _1 $ factors , with $ B $ equal to either $ \Bbb C $ , to a Cartan subalgebra $ A $ in $ M_i $ , or to a regular hyperfinite II $ _1 $ subfactor $ R $ in $ M_i $ , to obtain the following type of unique decomposition results , \`a la Bass-Serre : If $ M = ( N_1 *_C N_2 *_C ... ) ^t $ , for some $ t & gt ; 0 $ and some other similar inclusions of algebras $ C\subset N_j $ then , after a permutation of indices , $ ( B\subset M_i ) $ is inner conjugate to $ ( C\subset N_i ) ^t $ , $ \forall i $ .	Taking $ B=\Bbb C $ and $ M_i = ( L ( \Bbb Z^2 \rtimes \Bbb F_ { 2 } ) ) ^ { t_i } $ , with $ \ { t_i\ } _ { i\geq 1 } =S $ a given countable subgroup of $ \Bbb R_+^* $ , we obtain continuously many non stably isomorphic factors $ M $ with fundamental group $ \mycal F ( M ) $ equal to $ S $ .
We propose and explore a new finite temperature phase of translationally invariant multi-component liquids which we call a `` Quantum Disentangled Liquid '' ( QDL ) phase .	We contemplate the possibility that in fluids consisting of two ( or more ) species of indistinguishable quantum particles with a large mass ratio , the light particles might `` localize '' on the heavy particles .
The model geometry is assumed to have a torus and an envelope .	The parameters of the dust and the dust shell are constrained by comparing the SED and NIR intensity and polarisation data with the models .
We improved the direction-sensitive dark matter limits by our underground measurement .	After the first underground run , we replaced the detector components with radio-pure materials .
The higher order QCD corrections have been obtained some time ago and turned out to be large .	The full SUSY QCD corrections have been obained recently including the full mass dependence of the loop particles .
Let $ G $ be a simplicial group with Moore complex $ \N G $ in which the normal subgroup of $ G_n $ generated by the degenerate elements in dimension $ n $ is the proper $ G_n $ .	Then $ d ( \N_nG ) = \prod_ { I , J } [ \bigcap_ { i \in I } \ker d_i , \bigcap_ { j \in J } \ker d_j ] $ , for $ I , J \subseteq [ n-1 ] $ with $ I \cup J = [ n-1 ] $ .
A comparison with previously measured data from the fragmentation of 136Xe ions shows that the production yields strongly depend on the neutron excess of the projectile with respect to the line of beta-stability .	The momentum distributions exhibit a dependence on the fragment neutron-to-proton ratio in isobaric chains , which was not expected from systematics so far .
These relations define virial planes at the halo scale , whereas at the galactic scale they define intrinsic dynamical planes that are , however , tilted relative to the virial plane .	Therefore , we predict that massive galaxies must lie on fundamental planes from their formation .
We show here however that , in the spatial setting , on any infinite and bounded-degree graph , the total number of particles will always remain infinite at all times , almost surely .	Moreover , if G=Z^d , and the coalescing mechanism is Kingman 's coalescent , then starting with N particles at the origin , the total number of particles remaining is of order ( log* N ) ^d at any fixed positive time ( where log* is the inverse tower function ) .
In our setup , a B0 star irradiates an overdensity which is at a distance of 10 pc and modelled as a supercritical 100 M_sol Bonnor-Ebert sphere .	The radiation from the star heats up the gas and creates a shock front that expands into the interstellar medium .
We report about a 230 GHz very long baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) fringe finder observation of blazar 3C 279 with the APEX telescope in Chile , the phased submillimeter array ( SMA ) , and the SMT of the Arizona Radio Observatory ( ARO ) .	We installed VLBI equipment and measured the APEX station position to 1 cm accuracy ( 1 sigma ) .
In June 2014 , the pressurized gas target of the FAMU experiment was exposed to the low energy pulsed muon beam at the RIKEN RAL muon facility .	The objectives of the test were the characterization of the target , the hodoscope and the X-ray detectors .
The WC7 + O4-5 spectroscopic binary WR 140 is the prototype of colliding-wind , episodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet systems which also show strong variations in radio and X-ray emission .	The JHK spectra showed changes in continuum and in the equivalent widths of the WC emission lines , consistent with formation of dust starting between 2001 January 3 and March 26 ( orbital phases 0.989 and 0.017 ) and its subsequent fading and cooling .
Here , we challenge this conventional approach by demonstrating the photo-generation of plasmonic materials ( THz plasmonic antennas ) on a flat semiconductor layer by the structured optical illumination through a spatial light modulator .	Free charge carriers are photo-excited only on selected areas , which enables the definition of different plasmonic antennas on the same sample by simply changing the illumination pattern , thus without the need of physically structuring the sample .
For the electroweak penguin decays , the lepton-invariant mass spectrum and forward-backward asymmetry is also included .	Radiative and electroweak penguin transitions in b- & gt ; d are mainly interesting in the search for new flavour-changing neutral current interactions , but in addition the B- & gt ; rho gamma decays provide constraints on the CKM parameters ( \bar\rho , \bar\eta ) .
The method involves the compatibility of the given equations with a differential constraint , which is automorphic under a specific symmetry subgroup , the latter acting transitively on the submanifold of the common solutions .	By studying the integrability of the resulting conditions , one can provide an explicit foliation of the entire solution manifold of the considered equations .
The un-doped SmFeAsO is charge neutral SDW ( Spin Density Wave ) compound with magnetic ordering below 150 K. The Superconducting FeAs layers are doped with Co and Ni at Fe site , whereas REO layers are doped with F at O site .	The electron doping in SmFeAsO through Co results in superconductivity with transition temperature ( Tc ) maximum up to 15 K , whereas F doping results in Tc upto 47 K in SmFeAsO .
We prove , that for a linear PDE with constant coefficients these three approaches are equivalent and discuss the applicability of them to nonlinear PDE 's as well as to the case of variable coefficients .	Moreover , we systematically use another symbolic technique , namely the cylindrical algebraic decomposition , in order to derive the conditions on the von Neumann stability of a difference s cheme for a linear PDE with constant coefficients .
After removing the contribution from X-ray binaries and hot gas to the stacked X-ray emission , we still find an X-ray excess in the five redshift bins that can be explained by nuclear accreting BHs .	This X-ray excess is more significant for $ z & lt ; 0.5 $ .
A new definition for the minimality of genus one equations of degree n is introduced .	The advantage of this definition is that it does not depend on invariant theory of genus one curves .
High resolution spectra observed in the J and H bands exhibit narrow 1.083-micron He I line and the H I Pa Beta and the Brackett series lines in emission superposed on the broad emission line spectrum of the Wolf-Rayet star , giving strong indications of the presence of a companion .	From the narrow emission lines observed , the companion is identified to be an early-type Be star .
We offer a detailed interplay between geometric configurations of unions of intervals and a spectral theory for the corresponding selfadjoint extensions of $ \Ds $ and for the associated unitary groups of local translations .	While motivated by scattering theory and quantum graphs , our present focus is on the Fuglede-spectral pair problem .
The former can large range of WIMP parameter space using well tested technology while the latter may be necessary if one is to disentangle particle physics parameters from astrophysical halo parameters .	Because directional detectors will be quite difficult to construct it is worthwhile exploring in advance generally which experimental features will yield the greatest benefits at the lowest costs .
We obtained spectra for seven new objects among them , including one AGN , and an emission line above 3 sigma is detected from all of them .	We have estimated star formation rates ( SFR ) and stellar masses ( M_star ) for individual galaxies .
It is governed by a two-fermion excitation continuum .	We analyze the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the two-fermion excitation continuum .
N\'eel walls in soft magnetic NiFe/NiFeGa hybrid stripe structures surrounded by a NiFe film are investigated by high resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopic imaging .	An anti-parallel orientation of magnetization in 1000 nm wide neighboring unirradiated-irradiated stripes is observed by forming high angle domain walls during magnetization reversal .
We find that the nuclear free induction decay and different solid echoes in hyperpolarized solid xenon all exhibit sinusoidally modulated exponential long-time behavior characterized by identical time constants .	This universality was previously predicted on the basis of analogy with resonances in classical chaotic systems .
The primordial lithium abundance inferred from observations of metal-poor stars is ~3 times smaller than the theoretical value in standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( BBN ) model .	We assume a simple model including a sterile neutrino nu_H with mass of O ( 10 ) MeV which decays long after BBN .
Truncation of the series and consideration in this way of the approximate characteristic equation gives us a simple and efficient numerical method for solving the problem .	Comparison with the results obtained by other available techniques reveals clear advantages of the SPPS approach , in particular , with regards to accuracy .
Unlike the case for other disk galaxies with detected X-ray halos , the halo emission around NGC 5746 is not accompanied by extraplanar H-alpha or radio emission , and there is no evidence for significant nuclear or starburst activity in the disk .	In contrast to these other cases , the emission around NGC 5746 therefore appears to arise from the cooling of externally accreted material rather than from disk outflows .
} \ { \bf 309 } ( 2009 ) , 4835 -- 4842 ] .	In this paper , we define a related class of combinatorial designs which simultaneously generalize packing designs and packing arrays .
For instance , even a small amount of the Higgs-singlet mixing can lead to a significant enhancement of the apparent diphoton rate .	Alternatively , the Higgs may decay into the nearby singlet , along with a very light , very soft mediator particle , in which case there can be O ( 1 ) enhancement to the apparent diphoton rate even for ~ TeV-scale charged vector-like matter .
Using DM displacement ripples to create a series of probe and anti-halo speckles in the focal plane has been proposed for space-based coronagraphs and successfully demonstrated in the lab .	We present the theory and first on-sky demonstration of a technique to measure the complex halo using the rapidly-changing residual atmospheric speckles at the 6.5m MMT telescope using the Clio mid-IR camera .
We also report the first detection of C II 1037 emission in a supernova remnant .	The spectra show the presence of two kinematic components along the line of sight - one with both low and high excitation emission centered at a velocity of -50 km/s and another with only low excitation emission centered at a velocity of +100 km/s .
% It is well suited to discover relations that may exist between categories of different variables .	The graphical representation of MCA results in so-called biplots makes it easy to interpret the most important associations .
For expansion from a harmonic trap , and in the limits of very weak and very strong interactions , we recover the self-similar scaling solutions known from the hydrodynamic approach .	For all other power-law traps and arbitrary interaction strengths , the expansion is not self-similar and shows strong dependence of the density profile evolution on the trap anharmonicity .
In particular , ZEBRA uses the template-fitting approach to produce Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian redshift estimates based on : ( 1 . )	An automatic iterative technique to correct the original set of galaxy templates to best represent the SEDs of real galaxies at different redshifts ; ( 2 . )
The realization of this mechanism supposes the asymmetric fission channel as the first stage of sequential mechanism .	It is shown that only the use of the driving potential calculated by the binding energies with the shell correction allows us to explain the yield of the true ternary fission products .
We present elemental abundance measurements for 9 damped Ly-alpha systems ( DLAs ) and 1 sub-DLA at 0.1 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.5 from recent observations with the Multiple Mirror Telescope .	Most of these absorbers are found to be metal-poor , while 2 are found to have ~ 30-50 solar metallicities .
We show that the latter are conveniently parametrized as deformed Lorentzian shape lines , functions of an external applied magnetic field and the Fermi energy .	We find that the charge current fluctuations show quite unique statistical features at the symplectic-unitary crossover regime .
A limit theorem for $ p_ { N , k } $ is proved , and the scaled form of $ \rho_ { ( k_1 , k_2 ) } $ is shown to be identical to the analogous limit for the correlations of the eigenvalues of real Gaussian matrices .	We show that these correlations satisfy sum rules characteristic of the underlying two-component Coulomb gas .
The cation as well as the anion surface vacancy show a pronounced inward relaxation of the three nearest neighbor atoms towards the vacancy while the surface point-group symmetry is maintained .	For both types of vacancies we find a singly occupied level at mid gap .
The interplay among charge , spin and lattice degrees of freedom in solids gives rise to intriguing macroscopic quantum phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance , multiferroicity and high-temperature superconductivity .	Strong coupling or competition between various orders in these systems presents the key to manipulate their functional properties by means of external perturbations such as electric and magnetic fields or pressure .
On one hand , due to fascinating accuracy of atomic clocks , the traditional macroscopic standards of metrology ( second , metre , kilogram ) are giving way to standards based on fundamental units of nature : velocity of light $ c $ and quantum of action $ h $ .	On the other hand , the poor precision of gravitational constant $ G $ , which is widely believed to define the `` cube of theories '' and the units of the future `` theory of everything '' , does not allow to use $ G $ as a fundamental dimensional constant in metrology .
In application to the space-time geometry the asymmetry of world function means that the past and the future are not equivalent geometrically .	T-geometry is described in terms of finite point subspaces and world function between pairs of points of these subsets , i.e.in the language which is immanent to geometry and free of external means of description ( coordinates , curves ) .
The resulting minimum mass of the planet ( m2 sin i ) is only 0.052 Mjup = 0.97 Mnep = 16.6 Mearth making Gl 581b one of the lightest extra-solar planet known to date .	The Gl 581 planetary system is only the third centered on an M dwarf , joining the Gl 876 three-planet system and the lone planet around Gl 436 .
Its empirical version is well known as a generalised likelihood ratio test and that it may be represented as a difference in entropy .	We consider the forward difference expansion of the entropy function defined on all subsets of the variables under study .
High-dimensional data common in genomics , proteomics , and chemometrics often contains complicated correlation structures .	Recently , partial least squares ( PLS ) and Sparse PLS methods have gained attention in these areas as dimension reduction techniques in the context of supervised data analysis .
Unstructured environments such as homes have a large variety of object types as well as of placing areas .	Therefore our algorithms should be able to handle placing new object types and new placing areas .
We show that the divergences result from the interaction of fermions with the zero-sound collective mode .	By re-summing the most divergent diagrams , we obtain a closed form of the self-energy near the mass shell .
We present observations of high-amplitude rapid ( 2 s ) variability toward two bright , compact extragalactic radio sources out of several hundred of the brightest radio sources in one of the 30x30 deg MWA Epoch of Reionization fields using the Murchison Widefield Array ( MWA ) at 155 MHz .	After rejecting intrinsic , instrumental , and ionospheric origins we consider the most likely explanation for this variability to be interplanetary scintillation ( IPS ) , likely the result of a large coronal mass ejection propagating from the Sun .
An enhancement in photon emission rate is obtained when we use the in-medium masses of vector mesons in our calculations .	It is observed that the effect of $ \rho $ decay width on the photon spectra is negligible .
Based on these two topological impurities , the operation is robust against local disorder .	Furthermore , we find that the soliton may carry decimal electric charge instead of fractional charge $ 1/2 $ , because of the breaking of gauge invariance induced by superconducting proximity .
In Catuogno , da Silva and Ruffino ( Stoch.Dyn .	2013 ) , it is shown that , up to a stopping time $ \tau $ , a stochastic flow of local diffeomorphisms $ \varphi_t $ in $ M $ can be decomposed in diffeomorphisms that preserves this foliations .
In the present contribution , using molecular-dynamics simulation and the Green-Kubo formulation , we study systematically the thermal conductivity of layered phononic materials ( superlattices ) , by tuning different parameters that can characterize such structures .	We discover that the key to reach a lower-than-amorphous thermal conductivity is to block almost completely the propagation of the heat carriers , the superlattice phonons .
For this purpose , we perform systematic simulations of two-flavor QCD with an improved Wilson quark action to investigate the equation of state .	We report the current status of our project and show the preliminary results of the Taylor expansion coefficients of the thermodynamic grand partition function in terms of chemical potential .
In this paper , an object-oriented ( OO ) DRM system , called `` Imaging System with Watermarking and Attack Resilience '' ( ISWAR ) , is presented that generates and authenticates color images with embedded mechanisms for protection against infringement of ownership rights as well as security attacks .	In addition to the methods , in the object-oriented sense , for performing traditional encryption and decryption , the system implements methods for visible and invisible watermarking .
We present a feasibility study of observing $ HH\rightarrow b\bar b\gamma\gamma $ at the future hadron colliders with $ \sqrt { s } = $ 14 , 33 , and 100 TeV .	The measured cross section then can be used to constrain the Higgs self-coupling directly in the standard model .
Different from other controlled remote state preparation schemes which also utilize partially entangled channels , neither auxiliary qubits nor two-qubit unitary transformations are required in our schemes and the success probabilities are independent of the coefficients of the quantum channel .	The success probabilities are 50 % and 25 % for arbitrary single-qubit states and two-qubit states , respectively .
We obtain a Fokker-Planck equation describing experimental data on the collective motion of locusts .	The noise is of internal origin and due to the discrete character and finite number of constituents of the swarm .
Given a map $ \zeta $ from a space $ X $ to $ BGL_1R $ , one can construct a Thom spectrum , $ X^\zeta $ , which generalises the classical notion of Thom spectrum for spherical fibrations in the case $ R=S^0 $ , the sphere spectrum .	If $ X $ is a loop space ( $ \simeq \Omega Y $ ) and $ \zeta $ is homotopy equivalent to $ \Omega f $ for a map $ f $ from $ Y $ to $ B^2GL_1R $ , then the Thom spectrum has an $ A_\infty $ -ring structure .
Even with additional windows that might be needed for safety reasons , the channel performance is comparable to that of the original , all-vacuum Feasibility Study 2a channel on which our design is based .	If tests demonstrate that the gas-filled RF cavities can operate effectively with an intense beam of ionizing particles passing through them , our approach would be an attractive way of avoiding possible breakdown problems with a vacuum RF channel .
The derived symmetries are used to generate new exact solutions of the rotating shallow equations .	In particular , a new class of time-periodic solutions with quasi-closed particle trajectories is constructed and studied .
However , there is ongoing controversy over whether Zipf 's law is a good indicator of complexity .	Here we present an alternative approach that puts Zipf 's law in the context of critical phenomena ( the cornerstone of complexity in physics ) and establishes the presence of a large scale `` attraction '' between successive repetitions of words .
Spontaneous synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon , important in many theoretical studies and applications .	Recently this effect has been analyzed and observed in a number of physical systems close to the quantum mechanical regime .
Thus one can use the new operator for the analysis of total variation and higher order functionals like total-generalized-variation ( TGV ) .	Having a semi-inner-product , an angle between functions can be defined in a straightforward manner .
( Abridged ) We attempt to infer the accretion mechanism and radiative processes giving rise to the SEDs of a well-defined optically-selected sample of LINERs showing a definite detection of broad Halpha emission ( LINER 1s ) .	We construct SEDs for six LINER~1s with simultaneous UV and X-ray fluxes , and we looked for multiwavelength , radio to X-ray and UV to X-ray , correlations .

Here we present an analysis of the persistent radiative evolution and a statistical study of the burst properties during the 2009 outburst using the { \em Swift } X-ray Telescope ( XRT ) .	We find that the 1 -- 10 keV flux increased by a factor of $ \sim500 $ and hardened significantly , peaking $ \sim6 $ hours after the onset of the outburst .
Remarkably , we find that the size of herding-related avalanches in the community can be strongly reduced by the presence of a relatively small percentage of traders , randomly distributed inside the network , who adopt a random investment strategy .	Our findings suggest a promising strategy to limit the size of financial bubbles and crashes .
However , its optical emission requires a much larger radius and thus most of the stellar surface must be cold and undetectable in X-rays .	In the case the star is a neutron star such a surface temperature distribution can be explained by the presence of a strong toroidal field in the crust ( Perez-Azorin et al .
We evaluate all the low-energy terms in the spectral action and determine the dilaton couplings .	These results are applied to the spectral action of the noncommutative space defined by the standard model .
It is important to select among all stable schemes such a scheme that is optimal in terms of certain additional criteria .	In this study , we use a simple boundary value problem for a one-dimensional parabolic equation to discuss the selection of an approximation with respect to time .

Using a method called momentum polarization , we study the quasiparticle topological spin and edge-state chiral central charge of non-Abelian topological ordered states described by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions .	Our results verify that the fractional Chern insulator state obtained by Gutzwiller projection of two partons in bands of Chern number 2 is described by $ SU ( 2 ) _2 $ Chern-Simons theory coupled to fermions , rather than the pure $ SU ( 2 ) _2 $ Chern-Simons theory .
The lens caustics , critical curves , image locations and magnification ratios are calculated by ray-shooting on an adaptive grid .	When the source is near a cusp in a smooth lens ' caustic the sum of the magnifications of the three closest images should be close to zero .
We study the Allen-Cahn equation with a cubic-quintic nonlinear term and a stochastic $ Q $ -trace-class stochastic forcing in two spatial dimensions .	This stochastic partial differential equation ( SPDE ) is used as a test case to understand , how numerical continuation methods can be carried over to the SPDE setting .
Recently , some mainstream e-commerce web sites have apparently achieved the same end on a much broader scale , by using `` pay-per-bid '' auctions to sell items , from video games to bars of gold .	In these auctions , bidders incur a cost for placing each bid in addition to ( or sometimes in lieu of ) the winner 's final purchase cost .
The presence of a bar has no influence on the AGN strength , with barred and unbarred active galaxies showing equivalent X-ray luminosity distributions .	From our results , we conclude that the occurrence and the efficiency of the fueling process is independent of the large scale structure of a galaxy .
The list was cross-correlated with the ROSAT Position Sensitive Propotional Counter ( PSPC ) source catalogue presented by Haberl & amp ; Pietsch ( 1999 ) , the SIMBAD data base , and the TYCHO catalogue .	138 HRI sources are contained in the PSPC catalogue .
To study the properties of such galaxies further , we have photometrically selected a similar sample ( V ( AB ) & gt ; 28 , i ( AB ) & lt ; 26.3 , i ( AB ) -z ( AB ) & gt ; 0 ) from the HST ACS images of the Chandra Deep Field South .	This selection results in a sample of 44 sources from ~150 sq.arcmin .
This system is studied numerically , with a particular focus on the transition from the classical to the quantum regime .	In the quantum regime several new features are found .
The $ \eta N $ attraction generated in these models is too weak to generate a two-body bound state .	No $ \eta NN $ bound-state solution was found in our calculations in models where Re $ a_ { \eta N } \lesssim 1 $ fm , with $ a_ { \eta N } $ the $ \eta N $ scattering length , covering thereby the majority of $ N^ { \ast } ( 1535 ) $ resonance models .
We investigate here the connection between the general solvable IRF models and the fusion ones .	To this end , we introduce an associative algebra associated to any graph , as the algebra of products of the eigenvalues of the incidence matrix .
The LISA Parameter Estimation ( LISAPE ) Taskforce was formed in September 2007 to provide the LISA Project with vetted codes , source distribution models , and results related to parameter estimation .	The Taskforce 's goal is to be able to quickly calculate the impact of any mission design changes on LISA 's science capabilities , based on reasonable estimates of the distribution of astrophysical sources in the universe .
This would lead to a concentration of small solid particles close to the snow- line .	In view of this model we carried out laboratory experiments where we observed freely levitating ice aggregates sublimating .
NGC 6809 is a luminous metal-poor halo globular cluster that is relatively easy to study due to its proximity and low concentration .	Because of its high Galactic latitude ( b = -23deg ) , interstellar reddening and contamination is not very high .
The Coulomb branch of an Abelian three node quiver is obtained by integrating out the massive strings connecting the D-particles .	It allows for a scaling regime corresponding to a deep AdS $ _2 $ throat on the gravity side .
As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve , the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves , but by the manner , standard , and uniformity with which time itself is referenced .	While some areas of astronomy ( most notably pulsar studies ) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades , recently new areas have crossed into this regime .
The bounds can alternatively be viewed as localisation bounds on the real spectrum of the usual Wilson-Dirac operator .	They are needed for the rigorous evaluation of the classical continuum limit of the axial anomaly and index of the overlap Dirac operator at general values of m , and provide information on the topological phase structure of overlap fermions .
It is further surprising that the rate increases up to about twenty five percent , as the hopper empties and the granular pressure head decreases .	For deep filling , where the discharge rate is constant , we measure the behavior as a function of both grain and hole diameters .
By imposing $ n_ { _N } \le m \forall N\in \zN $ , Jarnik defined the corresponding sets $ E_m $ and gave a first estimate of $ d_H ( E_m ) $ , $ d_H $ the Hausdorff dimension .	Subsequent authors improved these estimates .
We explicitly calculate the contribution of each term in quantum master equation to the realization of the steady state density matrix , and make clear roles of each term .	By making use of the role of each term , the properties of the commonly used quantum master equation are examined .
Here we study the gravitational fields produced by such vacuumless defects in the cases of both global and gauge symmetry breaking .	We find that a global monopole has a strongly repulsive gravitational field , and its spacetime has an event horizon similar to that in de Sitter space .
Further observations of M82 spatially resolve the [ OIV ] emitting region .	Detection of this line in starbursts is surprising since it is not produced in measurable quantities in HII regions around hot main-sequence stars , the dominant energy source of starburst galaxies .
We give a derivation of this result in terms of the type II five-brane compactified on K3 , by assuming that its fluctuations are described by a closed string theory on its world-volume .	We find that the degeneracies are given in terms of the denominator of a generalized super Kac-Moody algebra .
Thus , the problem of the existence of a universal Banach space of density $ \cc $ is undecidable using the usual axioms of set-theory .	We also prove that it is consistent that there are universal Banach spaces of density $ \cc $ , but $ \ell_\infty/c_0 $ is not among them .
We investigated the archival ground-based VLBI images of the extragalactic radio sources included in both the { \it Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) } and the { \it Planck } catalogues , and selected 49 bright and compact sources as potential targets for space Very Long Baseline Interferometry ( VLBI ) observations at mm wavelengths .	These sources have a flat radio continuum spectrum between 33 and 94~GHz .
We present a detailed statistical treatment of the energy calibration of hybrid air-shower detectors , which combine a surface detector array and a fluorescence detector , to obtain an unbiased estimate of the calibration curve .	The special features of calibration data from air showers prevent unbiased results , if a standard least-squares fit is applied to the problem .
Averaging over the entire field galaxy population , this `` external '' component amounts to 64-85 % of the baryonic mass of the population itself .	These results are supported by the recent detection of very extended , soft X-ray emission from the halo of the quiescent , massive disk galaxy NGC 5746 .
From the RR Lyraes , we measure a distance modulus of ( m-M ) _0 = 24.51 +/- 0.12 , or 0.80 +/- 0.04 Mpc .	This discovery of RR Lyraes confirms , for the first time , the presence of an ancient ( & gt ; ~11 Gyr ) population in Leo A accounting for at least 0.1 % of the galaxy 's V luminosity .
The claim that an overdense ( positive curvature ) region in the early universe can not extend beyond some maximum scale and remain part of our universe , first made 40 years ago , has recently been questioned by Kopp et al .	Their analysis is elucidating and demonstrates that one can not constrain the form of primordial density perturbations using this argument .
Second , I present the status of results for the kaon $ B $ parameter relevant to CP violation .	I conclude the talk with a short outline of our experiences with optimizing QCD codes on the CM5 .
The decision is based on the available energy and the PU 's activity .	We investigate the problem of maximizing the SU 's success rate provided that the PU average quality of service ( QoS ) constraint is satisfied .
We solve the time dependent radiative transfer equation for the specific intensities to accurately calculate the angular distribution of the emitted radiation .	Turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability provides self-consistent angular momentum transfer .
Electron relaxation , induced by acoustic phonons , is studied for coupled quantum rings in the presence of external fields , both electric and magnetic .	We address the problem of a single electron in vertically coupled GaAs quantum rings .

We use state-of-the-art feature representations for ground-level images and introduce a cross-view training approach for learning a joint semantic feature representation for aerial images .	We also propose a network architecture that fuses features extracted from aerial images at multiple spatial scales .
A Green functions approach is used to study superconductivity in nanofilms and nanowires .	We show that the superconducting condensate results from the multimodal entanglement , or internal Josephson coupling , of the subcondensates associated with the manifold of Fermi surface subparts resulting from size-quantisation .
We show how analysis of a quasar high-magnification microlensing event may be used to construct a map of the frequency-dependent surface brightness of the quasar accretion disk .	The same procedure also allows determination of the disk inclination angle , the black hole mass ( modulo the caustic velocity ) , and possibly the black hole spin .
The processes of planet formation and migration depend intimately on the interaction between planetesimals and the gaseous disks in which they form .	The formation of gaps in the disk can severely limit the mass of the planet and its migration toward the protostar .
This is done with the line ratio technique applied to a wide range of observations of the quiet Sun , active regions and flares from 2006 until 2012 .	The best diagnostic lines and the relevant atomic data are discussed in detail .
We also derive a series of positive results .	We present exact pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for general trees , that become polynomial time in case the trees are unweighted .
Agent-based modeling and simulation is a useful method to study biological phenomena in a wide range of fields , from molecular biology to ecology .	Since there is currently no agreed-upon standard way to specify such models it is not always easy to use published models .
For complex values of the Immirzi parameter , the resulting effective field theory yields complex values for the torsion , and a non-unitary effective field theory that blows up for the special cases $ \gamma=\pm i $ where the gravitational kinetic term is the Ashtekar action .	We show that by restricting ourselves to real values for the torsion , there is a natural set of choice for the non-minimal coupling constant that yields real and unitary effective field theory that does not blow up for the special cases $ \gamma=\pm i $ .
Consequently , mathematics and the language of nature should be universal .	In this essay , we discuss the epistemological bases of the last assumptions .
We show that although the approximations are numerous , the Ramsauer analytical solutions describe fairly well the scattering phase function and the total cross section .	Then this model is applied to the Henyey-Greenstein parameterisation of scattering phase function to give a relation between its asymmetry parameter and the mean particle size .
We studied the dependence of the effect on quark mass and external magnetic field .	For axial charge generation , we calculated the mass diffusion rate , which characterizes the helicity flipping rate .
The phase of the induced i d_ { xy } component is determined by impurity spin and averages to zero at high temperatures .	It is suggested that at low temperature the well defined patches of d_ { xy } are formed and they can undergo a phase transition into phase locked state via Josephson effect .
For convex collections of cells it is shown that the attached ideal of 2-minors is a Cohen -- Macaulay prime ideal .	Primality is also shown for collections of cells whose connected components are row or column convex .
First we consider weak solutions to a parabolic operator with H\ '' ormander vector fields .	Adapting the iteration scheme of J\ '' urgen Moser for elliptic and parabolic equations in $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ we show a parabolic Harnack inequality .
Below 200 K a shoulder in the reflectance appears and signals the onset of scattering at 400 cm^-1 .	In this temperature range we also observe a peak in the optical conductivity at 177 cm^-1 .
At a level of 2.9sigma , however , there is a tentative emission feature shifted by about 100 km s^ { -1 } from the expected frequency of the HeH+ line .	This shift is well within the width of the line profiles for CO and C+ .
At high energy where the warping effect is large , an incident electron on a step defect running along $ \Gamma-\mathrm { M } $ direction may exhibit perfect transmission whereas on a defect running along $ \Gamma-\mathrm { K } $ direction has a finite probability to be reflected and may even exhibit resonant total reflection .	Transmission properties in the latter case are also very sensitive to whether there is particle-hole symmetry .
The coarsening instability typically disrupts steady-state cluster-size distributions .	We show that degradation coupled to the cluster size , such as arising from biological proteolysis , leads to a novel fixed-point cluster size .
The heavy-tailed distributions are heavily right skewed , with a minority of large values in the head and a majority of small values in the tail , commonly characterized by a power law , a lognormal or an exponential function .	For example , a country 's population is often distributed in such a heavy-tailed manner , with a minority of people ( e.g. , 20 percent ) in the countryside and the vast majority ( e.g. , 80 percent ) in urban areas .
Strangely , the largest degree of softening is found in the transverse elastic constant C_ { T } at around 0.5-0.6 GPa , presumably having relevancy to the competing and very different Gruneisen parameters \Omega of T_ { MI } and T_ { N } .	Interplay between the two phase transitions is also verified by the rapid increase of T_ { MI } under pressure with a considerably large \Omega of 9 .
We construct a low_2 degree bounding the Erd\H { o } s-Moser theorem ( EM ) , thereby showing that previous argument does not hold for EM .	Finally , we prove that the only Delta^0_2 degree bounding a stable version of the rainbow Ramsey theorem for pairs ( SRRT22 ) is 0 ' .
None of the analysis is heavily optimized for any specific model .	All signatures contain missing transverse energy in the final state and all , except for one , have at least one photon in the final state .
Moreover , systematic trends are revealed , e.g.an increase of the NI abundances from previous studies of BA-type supergiants by a factor of two is indicated .	The present work promises stringent observational constraints on chemical mixing in the course of massive star evolution .
An answer to this question will help shed light on the triggering process of quasar activity .	We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study the environment of quasars and compare it directly with the environment of galaxies .
Let $ u\in W^ { 2 , p } _0 $ , $ 1\le p\le \infty $ be a solution of the Poisson equation $ \Delta u = h $ , $ h\in L^p $ , in the unit disk .	It is proved that $ \|\nabla u\|_ { L^p } \le a_p\|h\|_ { L^p } $ with sharp constant $ a_p $ for $ p=1 $ and $ p=\infty $ and that $ \|\partial u\|_ { L^p } \le b_p\|h\|_ { L^p } $ with sharp constant $ b_p $ for $ p=1 $ , $ p=2 $ and $ p=\infty $ .
After reviewing the basic equations , we explain the significance of the quadratic terms , related to geodesics orthogonal to a given foliation .	We then study the problem of stabilization of the system to a given point , by means of oscillating controls .
An SL_2-tiling is a bi-infinite matrix of positive integers such that each adjacent 2 by 2 submatrix has determinant 1 .	Such tilings are infinite analogues of Conway-Coxeter friezes , and they have strong links to cluster algebras , combinatorics , mathematical physics , and representation theory .
In a TCS system , instead of using a random sensing matrix and a predefined dictionary , the average-case performance can be further improved by employing an optimized multidimensional sensing matrix and a learned multilinear sparsifying dictionary .	In this paper , we propose a joint optimization approach of the sensing matrix and dictionary for a TCS system .
It makes use of rather common ideas , as integral representations of the spectral sum , Mellin transforms , non-trivial commutation of series and integrals and skilful analytic continuation of zeta functions on the complex plane .	We apply our method to the case of the heat-kernel expansion of the Laplace operator on a $ D $ -dimensional ball with either Dirichlet , Neumann or , in general , Robin boundary conditions .
Quantum computing is a new way of data processing based on the concept of quantum mechanics .	Quantum circuit design is a process of converting a quantum gate to a series of basic gates and is divided into two general categories based on the decomposition and composition .
The $ \Xi $ single-particle potential energy is investigated with the G-matrix calculation in nuclear matter , which is sensitive to the hard-core radii in $ S $ -states .	The important constraint for the $ \Xi N $ interaction is obtained by combining the two analyses .
Single electron charging effects in a surface-gated InSb/AlInSb QW structure are reported .	This material , due to its large g-factor and light effective mass , offers considerable advantages over more commonly used materials , such as GaAs , for quantum information processing devices .
We show that the intersection of the Chern class with the $ \psi $ -classes in $ \bar { \mathcal { M } } _ { g , n } $ is computed by the topological recursion of \cite { EOFg } , for a local spectral curve that we describe .	In particular , we show how the Verlinde formula for the dimensions $ D_ { \vec { \lambda } } ( \mathbf { \Sigma } _ { g , n } ) = \dim \mathcal { V } _ { \vec { \lambda } } ( \mathbf { \Sigma } _ { g , n } ) $ is retrieved from the topological recursion .
Self-consistent solutions indicate the absence of a shock interaction between the stream of matter flowing from the inner Lagrange point and the accretion disk ( a `` hot spot '' ) .	At the same time , the interaction between the stream and the common envelope of the system forms an extended shock wave along the edge of the stream , whose observational properties are roughly equivalent to those of a hot spot in the disk .
Even if suggested formalism is , generally speaking , phenomenological and rough , obtained final results , unexpectedly , are non-trivial .	Concretely , given formalism reproduces exactly Bekenstein-Hawking entropy , Bekenstein quantization of the entropy or horizon area and Hawking temperature of a rotating , very thin black ring obtained earlier using more accurate analysis by Reall , Emparan , Elvang , Virmani etc .
By geometric invariant theory , we will construct a smooth coarse moduli space $ M_n^ { \balpha } ( \bt , \blambda , L ) $ of stable parabolic connection on $ \BP^1 $ with logarithmic poles at $ D ( \bt ) = t_1 + ... + t_n $ as well as its natural compactification .	Moreover the moduli space $ \cR ( \cP_ { n , \bt } ) _ { \ba } $ of Jordan equivalence classes of $ SL_2 ( \C ) $ -representations of the fundamental group $ \pi_1 ( \BP^1 \setminus D ( \bt ) , \ast ) $ are defined as the categorical quotient .
A unified approach to the calculation of dispersive forces on ground-state bodies and atoms is given .	It is based on the ground-state Lorentz force density acting on the charge and current densities attributed to the polarization and magnetization in linearly , locally , and causally responding media .
Suppose that the initial triangle formed by the three moving masses of the three-body problem is similar to the triangle formed at some later time .	We derive a simple integral formula for the overall rotation relating the two triangles .
Classical molecular dynamics can provide another approach that can be rigorously implemented .	It is therefore useful to compare the predictions from these two methods , particularly since the former is theoretically based and the latter numerically .
Namely , when reconstructing a target CS signal , we assume access to a similar signal .	This additional knowledge , the side information , is integrated into CS via L1-L1 and L1-L2 minimization .
Kv1.3 , a member of the voltage-gated potassium channels family originally discovered in the brain , is a key player in important biological processes including antigen-dependent activation of T-cells during the immune response .	We report that Kv1.3 expressed in CHO-K1 cells can be modulated in cell subpopulations by extremely low frequency and relatively low intensity electromagnetic fields .
To know the level of activity of this source , Tluczykont et al .	( 2007 ) calculated the fraction of time spent by Mrk 421 in flaring states with fluxes above 1 Crab at TeV energies ( i.e. , TeV - duty cycle ) .
The natural choice of scaling is $ \beta_n : =\beta n^ { -1/4 } $ .	We show that the polymer measure under this scaling has previously unseen behavior .
The numerical models cover a wide range of starburst ( from $ \sim10^2 $ to $ \sim10^7 $ M $ _\odot $ ) and galactic gas masses ( from $ \sim6\times10^6 $ to $ \sim10^ { 11 } $ M $ _\odot $ ) .	The concentrated central starburst regions are an efficient engine for producing of the mass and metal loss in galaxies , and also for driving the metal redistribution in the galaxies .
We relate the replica-symmetry breaking to ergodicity breaking and use the concept of real replicas to restore thermodynamic homogeneity of the equilibrium free energy in a replicated phase space .	Embedded replications of the spin variables result in a set of hierarchical free energies and overlap susceptibilities between replica hierarchies as order parameters .
The non-uniform longitudinal distribution of these reveals four longitudinal zones at the surface of the sun from which sunspots erupt preferentially over the 5-year observing interval ( 2006 January to 2011 April ) .	Spots in these zones ( or `` clusters '' ) have individual lifetimes short compared to the lifetimes of the coronal features which they sustain , and erupt at different times .
We find that trapezium-like systems are frequently formed in the first 2 Myr in initially cool and clumpy clusters and can survive for significant amounts of time in such clusters .	We also find that these systems are highly dynamical entities , constantly interacting with the surrounding cluster , changing their appearance and membership regularly .
With a magnitude of $ V\sim10 $ , a planetary radius of $ 1.699_ { -0.045 } ^ { +0.046 } \ { \rm R_J } $ , and a mass of $ 0.902_ { -0.059 } ^ { +0.060 } \ { \rm M_J } $ , it is the brightest host among the population of inflated Hot Jupiters ( $ R_P & gt ; 1.5R_J $ ) , making it a valuable discovery for probing the nature of inflated planets .	In addition , its existence within a hierarchical triple and its proximity to Earth ( $ 210 $ pc ) provides a unique opportunity for dynamical studies with continued monitoring with high resolution imaging and precision radial velocities .
Next the general nonlinear source field is introduced and is utilized to study an incompressible spherical star .	It is shown that although the interior Schwarzschild space-time is an exact solution , it ca n't be physically understood within the framework of this theory .
Simultaneously CePd_2Ge_2 has been examined by $ \rho ( T ) $ down to 40 mK .	In CePd_ { 2.02 } Ge_ { 1.98 } and CePd_2Ge_2 the magnetic order is suppressed at a critical pressure p_c=11.0 GPa and p_c=13.8 GPa , respectively .
I present a new algorithm , CALCLENS , for efficiently computing weak gravitational lensing shear signals from large N-body light cone simulations over a curved sky .	This new algorithm properly accounts for the sky curvature and boundary conditions , is able to produce redshift-dependent shear signals including corrections to the Born approximation by using multiple-plane ray tracing , and properly computes the lensed images of source galaxies in the light cone .
However , a one-electron self-interaction-free energy does not necessarily lead to the correct long-range potential .	This is here shown explicitly for local hybrid functionals .
In the second case , we use also the simple but apparently previously unremarked observation that the Drury method is in fact ( neutrally ) stable when used to approximate an unstable subspace , so that continuous orthogonalization and the centered exterior product method are roughly equally well-conditioned as methods for Evans function approximation .	The latter observation makes possible an extremely simple nonlinear boundary-value method for possible use in large-scale systems , extending ideas suggested by Sandstede .
First , a Pomeron Structure Function ( PSF ) model , in which the Pomeron is considered as an object with parton distribution functions .	Then , the Bartels Ellis Kowalski Wusthoff ( BEKW ) approach is discussed , assuming the simplest perturbative description of the Pomeron using a two-gluon ladder .
The latter is known to happen for mu_B substantially below the baryon mass , indicating strong nuclear interactions in QCD at infinite gauge coupling .	This leads us to studying the properties of nuclear matter from first principles .
However , DCs are generally not provided with statistical uncertainties , since the standard approach is to perform Monte Carlo bootstrap simulations to evaluate them , which can be quite time consuming for a large sample of sources .	As an alternative , considerably less time-consuming approach , we derived the theoretical expectation value for the DC and its error for sources whose state is one of two possible , mutually exclusive states , inactive ( off ) or flaring ( on ) , as based on a finite set of independent observational data points .
The quenched simulation shows large zero mode effects in correlators containing the scalar and pseudoscalar diquark .	The two scalar diquarks created by gamma_5 and gamma_0gamma_5 lead to different behavior in baryon correlators , showing that the interaction of diquarks with the third light quark matters : we do not see an isolated diquark .
We find that the extent of the UV emission , in both targets , is greater than the extent of the observed HII regions and diffuse ionized gas .	We determine the ultraviolet diffuse fraction in M33 using our FUV observations and compare it to the H-alpha diffuse fraction obtained from wide-field narrow-band imaging .
We present a new catalogue of blazars based on multi-frequency surveys and on an extensive review of the literature .	Blazars are classified as BL Lacertae objects , as flat spectrum radio quasars or as blazars of uncertain/transitional type .
In the presence of the trapping harmonic-oscillator ( HO ) potential , we report the existence of even , odd , and asymmetric spatial modes .	They feature alternating domains with opposite directions of the pseudo-spin , i.e. , anti-ferromagnetic structures , which is explained by the interplay of the linear couplings , HO confinement , and repulsive self-interaction .
In this short note we have produced different kind of magic squares using digital letter having only the algorisms : 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 , and 8 .	The interesting fact in considering these five digits is that the day 8th May 2010 also have these ones ( 08.05.2010 ) .
In this paper we analyze and extend the neural network based associative memory proposed by Gripon and Berrou .	This associative memory resembles the celebrated Willshaw model with an added partite cluster structure .
The spatial distribution follows a Sersic-like profile detectably to a projected radius of at least $ R_ { gc } = 250 $ kpc .	To that radius , the total number of clusters in the system is N_ { GC } = 39000 +- 2000 , the global specific frequency is S_N = 11.2 +- 0.6 , and 57\ % of the total are blue , metal-poor clusters .
The positive false discovery rate ( pFDR ) is a useful overall measure of errors for multiple hypothesis testing , especially when the underlying goal is to attain one or more discoveries .	Control of pFDR critically depends on how much evidence is available from data to distinguish between false and true nulls .
The superconductor Sr_2RuO_4 is widely believed to be a spin triplet system with a chiral order parameter analogous to the A phase of superfluid helium-3 .	The best evidence for this pairing state is that the Knight shift or spin susceptibility measured in neutron scattering is constant below T_c , unlike in a spin-singlet superconductor .
The radio-through-microwave spectral energy distributions were compiled to determine the emission mechanism for microwave emission .	In only one case , IC 443 , is there high-frequency emission clearly from dust associated with the supernova remnant.In all cases , the low-frequency emission is from synchrotron radiation .
In a binary mixture the gap is only present for low concentrations of one of the two species .	At intermediate concentrations sound modes are always propagating .
We present a concept of a ( 3+1 ) -D segmentation algorithm capable of recognising individual supergranules in a sequence of helioseismic 3-D flow maps .	As an example , we applied this method to the state-of-the-art data and derived descriptive statistical properties of segmented supergranules -- typical size of 20 -- 30 Mm , characteristic lifetime of 18.7 hours , and estimated depth of 15 -- 20 Mm .
With observations of the newly launched Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph ( IRIS ) , we report the detection of greatly redshifted ( $ \sim $ 125 km s $ ^ { -1 } $ along line of sight ) Fe { \sc { xxi } } 1354.08\AA { } emission line with a $ \sim $ 100 km s $ ^ { -1 } $ nonthermal width at the reconnection site of a flare .	The redshifted Fe { \sc { xxi } } feature coincides spatially with the loop-top X-Ray source observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager ( RHESSI ) .
Due to the inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes and the small number of molecules involved , the stochastic approach should be more correct in describing the real system : we study the agreement between the two approaches by exploring the system parameter space .	We address the problem by proposing a simplified version of the model that allows analytical treatment , and by performing numerical simulations for the full model .
Similarly , if superstring theory is related to a non-perturbative 11D M-theory , then an 11D supermultiplet structure is expected , even though the multiplet may contain states of different masses .	We analyse the consistency between these two multiplet schemes at the higher excited string levels for various compactifications of the type IIA superstring .
The calculation of this bound ( which is mostly close to the exact value of the QFI ) requires only the matrix representation of the parameter encoding map .	This property allows us to use the bound in open quantum systems which are governed by general ( semigroup and non-semigroup ) dynamical maps .
We show how to encode and decode each character in constant worst-case time while producing an encoding whose length is worst-case optimal .	In another chapter we consider one-pass compression with memory bounded in terms of the alphabet size and context length , and prove a nearly tight tradeoff between the amount of memory we can use and the quality of the compression we can achieve .
To study the spectral properties of galaxies as a function of their local environment , two fields were selected for spectroscopic observations to cover both the core ( Coma1 ) and outskirts ( ie .	south-west of the core and centered on NGC4839 ) - ( Coma3 ) of the cluster .
We consider cases in which the full pseudo-normal likelihood can not be used , for example , in highly unbalanced data where the participating individuals do not appear in consecutive years .	The model is estimated by a partial likelihood that would be the full and correct likelihood for independent and normal samples .
No such lines were detected , and we therefore use photoionisation models to derive upper limits of 9x10^-6 Msun/yr and 5x10^-5 Msun/yr for the mass loss rate from the progenitor system assuming velocities of 10 km/s and 50 km/s , respectively , for a wind extending to outside at least a few x 10^15 cm away from the SN explosion site .	These limits exclude a symbiotic star in the upper mass loss rate regime from being the progenitor of SN 2001el .
CTCP is designed to incorporate TCP 's good features , such as congestion control and reliability , while improving on TCP 's performance in lossy and/or dynamic networks .	CTCP builds upon the ideas of TCP/NC introduced by Sundararajan et al .
The method is not based on magnetic resonance and thus does not require delivering radiofrequency ( RF ) radiation to the trap .	Instead , stimulated Raman spectroscopy is used , and only an easily generated optical sideband of the laser cooling wave is required .
The baryon sector of QCD has a light quark spin-flavor symmetry at leading order in 1/N .	The formalism of induced representations for contracted Lie algebras is introduced to explain the consequences of this symmetry .
We study and quantify gravitational redshift by means of relativistic ray tracing simulations of emission lines .	The emitter model is based on thin , Keplerian rotating rings in the equatorial plane of a rotating black hole .
The observations have been conducted with Subaru/MOIRCS , and have resulted in absorption lines and/or continuum detection for 18 out of 34 objects .	This allows us to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a sample almost complete to K ( AB ) =21 .
In this paper we present a neural network performing such a task .	State estimation is performed by using optimization , which tries to reconcile all the available information .
We prove that for any $ r\geq 2 $ there is a unique minimal Markov basis of $ \mathcal { A } ^ { ( r ) } $ .	Moreover , we prove that for any integer $ l $ there exist integers $ n_1 , n_2 , n_3 $ such that the Graver complexity of $ \mathcal { A } $ is greater than $ l $ .
To cope with such increased constraints , the ATLAS High-Level Trigger , placed after a first hardware-based Level~1 trigger , has been redesigned by merging two previously separated software-based processing levels .	In the new joint processing level , the algorithms run in the same computing nodes , thus sharing resources , minimizing the data transfer from the detector buffers and increasing the algorithm flexibility .
An exact algorithm is used to investigate the distributions of the degeneracies of low-energy excited states for the bimodal Ising spin glass on the brickwork lattice .	Since the distributions are extreme and do not self-average , we base our conclusions on the most likely values of the degeneracies .
Instead of being fundamentally predictable , the universe is fundamentally unpredictable .	However , this does n't seem to make sense .
These intervals are deduced from the parent distribution of the estimation of { \Delta } m^2_ { 32 } based on experimental data .	Due to existing experimental constraints on | { \Delta } m^2_ { 32 } | , the estimation of { \Delta } m^2_ { 32 } is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution ( a Binomial distribution with 1 trial ) rather than a Gaussian distribution .
We show that a fixed point with Diophantine frequency vector $ \o_0 $ is always accumulated by invariant complex analytic KAM-tori .	Indeed , the following alternative holds : If the Birkhoff normal form of the Hamiltonian at the invariant point satisfies a R\ '' ussmann transversality condition , the fixed point is accumulated by real analytic KAM-tori which cover positive Lebesgue measure in the phase space ( in this part it suffices to assume that $ \o_0 $ has rationally independent coordinates ) .
This is due to the unavoidable near-degeneracy of surface electromagnetic modes in the deep sub-wavelength region .	By means of a mechanical analog , it is shown that an intrinsic time scale ( missed in stationary studies ) has to be associated with any desired lateral resolution .
The present work introduces a new class of congruence for multiple harmonic sums , which we call weighted congruences .	These congruences can hold modulo arbitrarily large powers of $ p $ .
We can determine magnetic field at the surface by the conservation of the magnetic flux through the area bounded by open magnetic field lines .	Then the value of the surface magnetic field can be estimated as of the order of $ 10^ { 14 } $ G. On the other hand observations show that the temperature of the hot spot is about a few million Kelvins .
However , the computational demand for these algorithms is too high to work in real time , without specialized hardware or software solutions .	In this paper , we propose a framework for augmenting recurrent processing capabilities into a feedforward network without sacrificing much from computational efficiency .
The model is approximately commuting at large couplings and we find the joint eigenvalue distribution of the two matrices .	We also study a related three matrix model finding the corresponding three dimensional eigenvalue distribution there also .
Such emission results from electrons/positrons accelerated well above TeV energies in the spectral cut-off regime .	In the case of diffusive shock acceleration , which is the most promising acceleration mechanism in SNRs , very strong magnetic fluctuations with amplitudes well above the mean magnetic field must be present .
In this work , we identify 63 bona fide new candidates to T Tauri stars ( TTSs ) in the Taurus-Auriga region using as baseline its ultraviolet excess .	The initial data set has been defined from the GALEX all sky survey ( AIS ) .
The PLK relation has been calibrated and compared with the previous empirical and theoretical determinations in literature .	The zero point of the absolute calibration has been obtained from the K magnitude of RR Lyr whose distance modulus has been measured via trigonometric parallax with HST .
There , it was also shown that there exist infinitely many connected graphs of maximal degree $ \Delta= 5 $ that are neither regular nor biregular of class 1 which satisfy the Zagreb indices equality .	Here , we generalize that result by showing that there exist infinitely many connected graphs of maximal degree $ \Delta \geq 5 $ that are neither regular nor biregular graphs of class 1 which satisfy the Zagreb indices equality .
Exact , degenerate two-forms on time-extended space R X M which are invariant under the unsteady , incompressible fluid motion on 3D region M are introduced .	The equivalence class up to exact one-forms of each potential one-form is splitted by the velocity field .
However , here we find that , because of the non-linear nature of the metallicity-to-color transformation , a coeval group of old clusters with a unimodal metallicity spread can exhibit color bimodality .	The models of cluster colors indicate that the horizontal-branch stars are the main drivers behind the empirical non-linearity .
This is because many important quantities ( e.g. , free energy differences ) depend on the relative populations of different conformers ; insufficient convergence translates into systematic errors .	Here we present a simple method to self-consistently assess the convergence of a simulation .
We first assess the relative bias between these prescriptions when constraining \sigma_8 by sampling the ESP mass function to generate mock catalogs and using the T08 fit to analyse them , for various choices of survey selection threshold , mass definition and statistical priors .	To assess the level of absolute bias in each prescription , we then repeat the analysis on dark matter halo catalogs in N-body simulations designed to mimic the mass distribution in the current data release of Planck SZ clusters .
However , at optical frequencies previously demonstrated zero- or negative-refractive index metamaterials require the use of metallic inclusions , leading to large ohmic loss , a serious impediment to device applications .	Here , we experimentally demonstrate an impedance matched zero-index metamaterial at optical frequencies based on purely dielectric constituents .
Considering the plausible magnetic energy dissipation in both the acceleration and prompt emission phases of the Gamma-ray Burst ( GRB ) outflow , the afterglow data of GRB 120308A provides us the compelling evidence that at least for some GRBs a non-ignorable fraction of the energy was released in the form of Poynting-flux , confirming the finding firstly made in the reverse-forward shock emission modeling of the optical afterglow of GRB 990123 ( Fan et al .	2002 ; Zhang et al.2003 ) .
73 , 826 ( 1994 ) , we expect a QVL above a melting density of 0.0065 vortices per lattice site .	We also compute the Hall conductivity using adiabatic curvatures .
We show that they often obey a surprisingly simple , though non-trivial behavior .	Within a model where coexistence is neutrally stable , we demonstrate a robust zero-one law : When the interactions between the three species are ( generically ) asymmetric , the `weakest ' species survives at a probability that tends to one for large population sizes , while the other two are guaranteed to extinct .
We also perform the ANN based segregation scheme using the full length spectral features ( which will also be useful for the ASTROSAT mission ) .	Our results suggest that , in the case of the non-availability of full spectral features , the limited band integrated features can be used to segregate the two classes of objects ; although the band data classification is less accurate than the full spectral data classification .
We aim to construct a general framework for portfolio management in continuous time , encompassing both stocks and bonds .	In these lecture notes we give an overview of the state of the art of optimal bond portfolios and we re-visit main results and mathematical constructions introduced in our previous publications ( Ann.Appl.Probab .
In order to reduce the time to fix user 's position , we propose the Instant-On GPS receiver system which is implemented on an ARM based FPGA board , and operates under a very low power mode .	We 've developed a repeated sleep mode by periods to control the GPS receiver 's main power in order to achieve reduced power consumption .
The optical conductivity of graphene is computed by using the Kubo formula , within the framework of a full \pi-band tight-binding model .	Different types of non-correlated and correlated disorders are considered , such as random or Gaussian potentials , random or Gaussian nearest-neighbor hopping parameters , randomly distributed vacancies or their clusters , and random adsorbed hydrogen atoms or their clusters .
We present a measurement of the lifetime of ground state atomic carbon , C ( ^3P ) , against ionization processes in interplanetary space and compare it to the lifetime expected from the dominant physical processes likely to occur in this medium .	Our measurement is based on analysis of a far ultraviolet ( FUV ) image of comet C/2004 Q2 ( Machholz ) recorded by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) on 2005 March 1 .
We investigate dispersive optical nonlinearities that arise from Rydberg excitation blockade in cold Rydberg gases .	We consider a two-photon transition scheme and study the non-linear response to a weak optical probe in presence of a strong control beam .
The thermodynamic behavior of the star-forming gas plays a crucial role in fragmentation and determines the stellar mass function as well as the dynamic properties of the nascent stellar cluster .	This holds for star formation in molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood as well as for the formation of the very first stars in the early universe .
In this work , we report results for the effects of fluctuations on the nuclear modification factor R_AA in both central and noncentral sqrt ( s_NN ) = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC .	Two different types of energy-loss models , a radiative and an elastic , are considered .
The objects I considered are quartic polynomial maps of the interval that are compositions of two logistic maps .	In the parameter space $ P^ { Q } $ of such maps , I considered the algebraic curves corresponding to the parameters for which critical orbits are periodic , and I called such curves left and right bones .
Linear perturbation results suggest that the ground state along with the first three excited state boson stars are stable .	We evolve some of these solutions and study their nonlinear stability in light of recent work \cite { Bizon:2011gg } arguing that a weakly turbulent instability drives scalar perturbations of AdS to black hole formation .
We present a model of performance bound calculus on feedforward networks where data packets are routed under wormhole routing discipline .	We are interested in determining maximum end-to-end delays and backlogs of messages or packets going from a source node to a destination node , through a given virtual path in the network .
Given a dynamical assumption on the expectation value of particle number density , we prove that small subsystems reach equilibrium at the level of quantum wave-function , and with respect to all observables .	The picture that emerges is that at higher energies , larger subsystems can reach equilibrium .
The associated gas of weakly interacting pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons ( PNGB ) undergoes Bose-Einstein ( BE ) condensation well before the end of inflation .	This causes the occurence of condensed light scalar fields effectively acting as a curvaton .
A key challenge for epithelial tissues undergoing spreading is to increase their surface area without disrupting epithelial integrity .	Here we show that orienting cell divisions by tension constitutes an efficient mechanism by which the Enveloping Cell Layer ( EVL ) releases anisotropic tension while undergoing spreading during zebrafish epiboly .
Universal scaling relationships between the changes in permittivity and conductivity are observed in a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields .	Similar scaling is also seen in La_ { 1-x } Sr_xMnO_3 for different doping levels .
The set $ X_+ $ of dominant weights is a union of closed alcoves $ \oC_w $ numbered by the elements $ w\in W^f $ of a certain subset of affine Weyl group $ W $ .	G.Lusztig and N.Xi defined a partition of $ W^f $ into canonical right cells and the right order $ \le_R $ on the set of cells .
We report on the experimental generation of two-mode squeezed vacuum on non-orthogonal quadratures depending on the plate angle .	After a simple operation , the entanglement is maximized and put into standard form , \textit { i.e . }
The main idea of this approach is to represent orbits in this manifold as the solutions of an appropriate boundary value problem .	The boundary value problem is under determined and a one parameter family of solutions can be found by means of arclength continuation .
The walkers ' ( diffusing particles ' ) friction constants xi_n , where n labels different bouncy walkers , are drawn from a distribution rho ( xi_n ) .	We provide an approximate analytic solution to this recent single-file problem by combining harmonization and effective medium techniques .
Each manifold is a projective bundle over the previous .	Moreover , each level is a fiber compactified jet bundle equipped with an action of finite jets of the diffeomorphism group .
The history of this question is reviewed .	Nonlinear generalizations of quantum mechanics have been proposed .
In this letter we demonstrate that cosmic ray protons in the energy range 10^18 to 10^19 eV , if accelerated near the center of the Galaxy , can probe the large scale structure of the Galactic Magnetic Field .	In particular if the field is of even parity , and the spiral field reverses direction from arm to arm , i.e.if it is bi-symmetric ( BSS ) , ultra high energy protons will predominantly come from the Southern Galactic hemisphere , and predominantly from the Northern Galactic hemisphere if the field is of even parity and axi-symmetric ( ASS ) .
The main concept used is a specific definition of { \em general elements } of an ideal in the local ring of the surface .	We make explicit the connection between this notion and the elementary notion of general element of a linear pencil , through the use of { \em reduction } .
This constant looks to be due mostly to a new , small MR in thin Py layers .	The constant complicates isolating the spin-diffusion length , lsf ( IrMn ) , in bulk IrMn , but lsf ( IrMn ) is probably short , less than or equal to 1 nm .
The collapse of flexible polyelectrolytes in a solution of multivalent counterions is studied by means of a two state model .	The states correspond to rod-like and spherically collapsed conformations respectively .
Indeed , the common perception is that X-ray emission from FRI 's is synchrotron emission whereas that from FRII 's may be IC/CMB and/or synchrotron .	Now that we have a sizable collection of sources with detected X-ray emission from jets and hotspots , it seems that a more unbiased study of these objects could yield additional insights on jets and their X-ray emission .
For a suitable choice of the relative strength of these interactions , we find that the three-helix-bundle protein undergoes an abrupt folding transition from an expanded state to the native state .	Also shown is that the corresponding one- and two-helix segments are less stable than the three-helix sequence .
Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that the switching behavior of magnetic nanoparticles can be well controlled by external time-dependent magnetic fields .	In this work , we inspect theoretically the influence of the temperature and the magnetic anisotropy on the spin-dynamics and the switching properties of single domain magnetic nanoparticles ( Stoner-particles ) .
We give various applications of essential circles ( introduced in an earlier paper by the authors ) in a compact geodesic space X .	Essential circles completely determine the homotopy critical spectrum of X , which we show is precisely 2/3 the covering spectrum of Sormani-Wei .
The rising and falling paths of the index peaks can be described by the Mittag-Leffler function superposed with various types of oscillations .	The latter is a solution of our model of index dynamics defined by the nonhomogeneous fractional relaxation equation .
Moreover , there is a correspondence between these solutions and certain solutions of 2-dimensional BF theory on Sigma .	Our construction works in any signature and with any value of the cosmological constant .
The correctness of the algorithm is proved , and possibilities of a parallel implementation are discussed .	The operation of the method is shown on two illustrative examples .
Tc-rich S stars are , as expected , identified with thermally-pulsing AGB stars of low and intermediate masses , whereas Tc-poor S stars comprise mostly low-mass stars ( with the exception of 57 Peg ) located either on the red giant branch or on the early AGB .	Like barium stars , Tc-poor S stars are known to belong exclusively to binary systems , and their location in the HR diagram is consistent with the average mass of 1.6 +- 0.2 Msun derived from their orbital mass-function distribution .
When restricted to the single-agent decision-theoretic setting , inverse optimal control techniques assume that observed behavior is an approximately optimal solution to an unknown decision problem .	These techniques learn a utility function that explains the example behavior and can then be used to accurately predict or imitate future behavior in similar observed or unobserved situations .
One planet is likely a rocky `super-Earth ' , whereas the other is more akin to Neptune .	These planets are thirty times more closely spaced -- and have a larger density contrast -- than any adjacent pair of planets in the Solar system .
Several convergence results in Hilbert scales under different source conditions are proved and orders of convergence and optimal orders of convergence are derived .	Also , relations between those source conditions are proved .
When the noncommutativity is induced by the Moyal product we can use the Seiberg-Witten map in order to deal with ordinary fields .	We then show that the effect of the noncommutativity is the same as a field dependent gravitational background .
the usual basis of $ \mathcal { H } _0 $ .	Imposing further conditions on the operator $ A $ , we also consider another reproducing kernel Hilbert space $ \mathcal { H } _- $ with a kernel function $ B ( x , y ) $ , which is the representation of the inverse of $ A $ in a sense , so that $ \mathcal { H } _-\supset\mathcal { H } _0\supset\mathcal { H } _+ $ becomes a rigged Hilbert space .
The modification of the collective coordinate method allows us to write down the action , free from infra-red divergencies .	The behaviour of the density-type correlation functions is non-trivial and we demonstrate the existence of leading and sub-leading asymptotes .
We present a formal logic for quantitative reasoning about security properties of network protocols .	The system allows us to derive concrete security bounds that can be used to choose key lengths and other security parameters .
Furthermore , we extend these results on the automorphisms to the case where $ X = C_1\times ... \times C_r $ is a product of curves of genus $ g ( C_i ) \geq 2 $ .	Finally , using the techniques developed to deal with Fulton-MacPherson spaces , we study the automorphism groups of some Kontsevich moduli spaces $ \overline { M } _ { 0 , n } ( \mathbb { P } ^N , d ) $ .
In this work , we reduce this question to the case $ K $ is a torus and $ G $ is simply-connected by successively replacing members of the pair $ ( G , K ) $ with simpler groups .	The results , combined , essentially reduce equivariant formality of isotropy actions to the study of embeddings of tori in simply-connected groups .
This article approaches deterministic filtering via an application of the min-plus linearity of the corresponding dynamic programming operator .	This filter design method yields a set-valued state estimator for discrete-time nonlinear systems ( nonlinear dynamics and output functions ) .
We find that the transient ( NGC300 OT2008-1 ) has a peak absolute magnitude of M_bol~-11.8 mag , intermediate between novae and supernovae , and similar to the recent events M85 OT2006-1 and SN2008S .	Our high-resolution spectra , the first for this event , are dominated by intermediate velocity ( ~200-1000 km/s ) hydrogen Balmer lines and CaII emission and absorption lines that point to a complex circumstellar environment , reminiscent of the yellow hypergiant IRC+10420 .
An extension of quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel theory to higher spatial dimensions than one is crucial in order to describe physical phenomena like charge/spin Hall effects and topological excitations like vortices and skyrmions , none of which are captured in one-dimensional models .	We here present a numerical finite element method which solves the non-linearized 2D and 3D quasiclassical Usadel equation relevant for the diffusive regime .
Here we present an analysis of these two outbursts using a set of cometary observations .	The outbursts took place between 2014 Dec. 15.4 -- 16.0 UT and 2015 Jan. 15.5 -- 16.0 UT as constrained by ground-based and spacecraft observations .
This paper investigates cooperative environmental monitoring for Pan-Tilt-Zoom ( PTZ ) visual sensor networks .	We first present a novel formulation of the optimal environmental monitoring problem , whose objective function is intertwined with the uncertain state of the environment .
We find that the Coulomb scattering can not cause the spin dephasing , and that the electron-hole spin exchange is the main mechanism of the spin decoherence .	Moreover the beat frequency in the Faraday rotation angle is determined mainly by the Zeeman splitting , red shifted by the Coulomb scattering and the electron hole spin exchange .
Three dimensional ( 3D ) Dirac semimetals are 3D analogue of graphene , which display Dirac points with linear dispersion in k-space , stabilized by crystal symmetry .	Cd3As2 and Na3Bi were predicted to be 3D Dirac semimetals and were subsequently demonstrated by photoemission experiments .
The role of intermediaries in the synchronization of small groups of light controlled oscillators ( LCO ) is addressed .	A single LCO is a two-time-scale phase oscillator .
It is well known that worldline path integrals in curved space require regularization : we present here the mode-regularization for these models , finding in particular the corresponding counterterms , both in the case of flat and curved indices for worldline fermions .	For N=1 , using curved indices we find a contribution to the counterterm from the fermions that cancels the contribution of the bosons , leading to a vanishing total counterterm and thus preserving the covariance and supersymmetry of the classical action .
Thus , the temporal behavior of each leptohadronic scenario can be used to probe the particle population responsible for the high-energy emission as it can give extra information not available by spectral fits .	In the present work we apply these ideas to the non-thermal emission of Mrk 421 .
There are $ \sim 600 $ and $ \sim 6,300 $ such stars in the two data sets , respectively .	The local red clump luminosity function is well represented by a Gaussian with the peak at $ M_ { I , m } =-0.23 $ , and the dispersion $ \sigma_ { RC } \approx0.2 $ mag .
Despite many ARPES investigations of iron pnictides , the structure of the electron pockets is still poorly understood .	By combining ARPES measurements in different experimental configurations , we clearly resolve their elliptic shape .
In the weak disorder limit we obtain explicit nonperturbative analytical results for the density of states and the two-level correlation function by mapping the chRBM onto a nonlinear sigma model .	We also put forward , by exploiting the relation between the chRBM at $ \alpha=1 $ and a generalized chiral random matrix model , an exact expression for the above correlation functions .
We investigate observations of the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 with unusually high hardness and low flux .	In particular , we study the characteristic frequencies seen in the PDS and the hardness-flux correlation within and between these observations.Methods .
This paper discusses the multi-wavelength scanning Raman lidar being built at Lidar Division , CEILAP ( CITEDEF-CONICET ) in the frame of the Argentinean Cherenkov Telescope Array ( CTA ) collaboration to measure the spectral characteristics of the atmospheric aerosol extinction profiles to provide better transmission calculations at the future CTA site .	This lidar emits short laser pulses of 7-9 ns at 355 , 532 and 1064 nm at 50 Hz with nominal energy of 125 mJ at 1064 nm .
We investigate the role of higher order couplings , along with the condensation of antikaons ( $ K^- $ and $ \bar K^0 $ ) , on the properties of neutron star ( NS ) .	We employ extended versions of the relativistic mean-field model , in which kaon-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon interactions are taken on the same footing .
Let D be a masa in B ( H ) where H is a separable Hilbert space .	We find real numbers \eta_0 & lt ; \eta_1 & lt ; \eta_2 & lt ; ... & lt ; \eta_6 so that for every bounded , normal D-bimodule map { \Phi } on B ( H ) either ||\Phi|| & gt ; \eta_6 , or ||\Phi|| = \eta_k for some k & lt ; = 6 .
The analytic solution of the path equation under the Kepler potential is presented .	It is shown that except the Kepler potential , in contrast to ordinary space , all of the potentials for which all of the almost circular orbits are closed are non-power-law ones .
In the first part , starting from the Maxwell equations , a basic understanding of the processes is given and explained with examples of simple geometry and time behaviour .	Useful formulas are derived for an analytic estimate of the size of the effects .
The method has been implemented for a type-I downconversion source , pumped by ultrashort laser pulses .	The experimental results agree well with a theoretical model which takes into account the temporal as well as spatial effects in the source .
One result that emerged out of a previous study to investigate the application of search-based software testing ( SBST ) in an industrial setting was the development of the Interactive Search-Based Software Testing ( ISBST ) system .	ISBST allows users to interact with the underlying SBST system , guiding the search and assessing the results .
Apply the T-duality and smeared twist to the D3-brane solution one can construct the supergravity backgrounds which may dual to supersymmetric or non-supersymmetric non-commutative dipole field theory .	We introduce D7-brane probe into the dual supergravity background to study the chiral dynamics and meson spectrum therein .
Many researchers have used these distributions of phylogenies for downstream evolutionary analyses that involve inferences on phenotypic evolution , geography , and community assembly .	I demonstrate that the use of phylogenies constructed in this fashion is inappropriate for many questions involving traits .
Beta-NMR has been used to study vortex lattice disorder near the surface of the high-Tc superconductor YBCO .	The magnetic field distribution from the vortex lattice was detected by implanting a low energy beam of highly polarized 8Li into a thin overlayer of silver on optimally doped , twinned and detwinned YBCO samples .
During the long intermediate period , it decelerates driven by radiation and subsequently by matter .	Emerged gravitational dark energy mimics quintessence and its density falls by 115 orders from its initial value $ 2.58\times 10^ { 68 } { \rm GeV } ^4 $ to its current value $ 2.19\times 10^ { -47 } { \rm GeV } ^4 $ .
Using this model it was shown that most of the SHE-nuclei lie in the region where the muonic fissility parameters attain their limiting value X=1 .	Hence , the SHE-region is characterized by the absence of a classical barrier toward spontaneous muon and pion emissions .
The complete set of harmonic potentials is considered , which includes the particle under a uniform force , as well as the harmonic and the inverse harmonic oscillators .	In addition , as an example of anharmonic system , the pure quartic oscillator is analyzed .
We compare our observations as well as archival IUE and RXTE data with models that predict ultraviolet and optical continuum emission from an X-ray heated disk and a Roche-lobe-filling star .	The model predictions are consistent with observed optical , ultraviolet , and X-ray variations over both orbital and long-term periods .
These are characterized by two constants only : the tension and spin magnitude .	By solving the world-sheet equations , we discover a similarity between such membranes in Riemann-Cartan backgrounds , and string theory membranes in low-energy string backgrounds .
Our native-centric approach neglects chemical details but incorporates the basic structural information to reproduce the protein functional dynamics as it couples to the binding .	We found that at physiological temperatures the unbinding of a peptide from the PDZ domain becomes increasingly diffusive rather than thermally activated , as a consequence of the significant reduction of the free energy barrier with temperature .
Using a labelled corpus of over 21,000 tweets , six of the basic emotion sets proposed in existing literature were analysed using Latent Semantic Clustering ( LSC ) , evaluating the distinctiveness of the semantic meaning attached to the emotional label .	We hypothesise that the more distinct the language is used to express a certain emotion , then the more distinct the perception ( including proprioception ) of that emotion is , and thus more 'basic ' .
Spasmodic bipolar ejections , in changing directions have occurred over thousands of years to create KjPn 8 .	The central star is finally revealed in these observations and its compact nebular core is resolved into a remarkably young , aprox .
We show that the set of product states is a very small subset of set of all possible states , while all unitary orbits contain classically correlated states .	Using this we give meaning to degeneration of quantum correlations due to a unitary interactions , which we call coherent correlations .
We calculate the effect of gravitational wave ( gw ) back-reaction on realistic neutron stars ( NS 's ) undergoing torque-free precession .	By `realistic ' we mean that the NS is treated as a mostly-fluid body with an elastic crust , as opposed to a rigid body .
We also evaluate the number of zeros utilizing the argument principle of complex analysis .	The actual number of zeros calculated numerically for systems of finite size agrees fairly well with the analytical results .
We introduce a linearized bi-metric theory of gravity with two metrics .	The metric g_ { ab } describes null hypersurfaces of the gravitational field while light moves on null hypersurfaces of the optical metric \bar { g } _ { ab } .
If such a flow were barely resolved , observation would suggest evolution from a somewhat oblique , to a more longitudinal , magnetic field structure with respect to the flow axis , while higher resolution observations would infer a component following a non-linear trajectory , and with a magnetic field orientation that rotates during evolution .	This result highlights the ambiguity in interpreting VLBP data , and illustrates the importance of simulations in providing a framework for proper interpretation of such data .
These expressions allow us to obtain some asymptotics in small time of the heat kernels and give us a way to compute the subriemannian distances .	Then , we establish some gradient estimates and some functional inequalities like a Li-Yau type estimate and a reverse Poincar\'e inequality that are valid for both heat kernels .
We analyse 20 star cluster candidates projected mostly in the bulge direction ( $ |\ell| & lt ; 60^\circ $ ) .	The sample contains all candidates in that sector classified by \citet { FSRcat } with quality flags denoting high probability of being star clusters .
Here we present a simple extension to this approach , termed integrated step-selection analysis ( iSSA ) , which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes ( i.e.velocities and their temporal autocorrelations ) are independent of resource selection .	Instead , iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource-selection parameters , thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model .
This paper involves one such process where the rating is given to the link that the user is clicking on .	Rather than avoiding the uninterested links both interested links and the uninterested links are listed .
It has been proposed more than two decades ago that there are two separate types of CMEs , fast ( impulsive ) CMEs and slow ( gradual ) CMEs .	However , this concept may not be valid , since the large data sets acquired in recent years do not show two distinct peaks in the CME velocity distribution and reveal that both fast and slow CMEs can be accompanied by both weak and strong flares .
We study the relation between theta-antieigenvalue and centre of mass of a bounded linear operator and compute antieigenvalue using the relation .	This follows the notion of symmetric antieigenvalues introduced by Hossein et al.in \cite { 19 } .
Some radio pulsars show clear drifting subpulses , in which subpulses are seen to drift in pulse longitude in a systematic pattern .	Here we examine how the drifting subpulses of PSR B0809+74 evolve with time and observing frequency .
We point out the key ingredients for a theory to possess an infinite number of local conservation laws , and discuss classes of models with such property .	We propose a 3+1-dimensional , relativistic invariant field theory possessing a toroidal soliton solution carrying a unit of topological charge given by the Hopf map .
We obtained deep optical imaging of the thermally emitting X-ray bright and radio-quiet isolated neutron star RX J1605.3+3249 with the Subaru telescope in 1999 and 2003 .	Together with archival HST images acquired in 2001 these data reveal a proper motion of mu = 144.5 +/- 13.2 mas/yr .
The positioner contains 2400 fibers and covers a 1.3~degree hexagonal field of view .	The spectrograph optical design consists of a Schmidt collimator , two dichroic beamsplitters to split the light into three channels , and for each channel a volume phase holographic ( VPH ) grating and a dual-corrector , modified Schmidt reimaging camera .
These inequalities can show violations that grow exponentially with $ N $ , but we prove this is not the typical case .	For many-qubit states the probability to violate any of these inequalities by an amount that grows linearly with $ N $ is vanishingly small .
A \pi-electron network in nanographite systems with zigzag edges exhibits strongly localized edge states , which are expected to have peculiar properties .	We study effects of electron-electron interactions on ground-state properties of the systems by means of the weak-coupling renormalization group and the density-matrix renormalization-group method .
In the crossover region , where the phase boundary ceases to be first order , the vortices are shown to still percolate .	In contrast to other observables , the percolation observables show finite-size scaling .
We perform a model-independent analysis of the spectrum and couplings of the MSSM Higgs fields , based on an effective theory of the MSSM degrees of freedom .	The tree-level mass of the lightest CP-even state can easily be above the LEP bound of 114 GeV , thus allowing for a relatively light spectrum of superpartners , restricted only by direct searches .
We state supporting evidence of the claim that 5 is a typical rank of $ 2\times2\times2\times2 $ real tensors .	Recall that Kong and Jiang show that the maximal rank of $ 2\times2\times2\times2 $ real tensors is less than or equal to 5 .
However , we point out that the previously observed increase with redshift of dN/dz for weak absorbers , pertains exclusively to very weak absorbers with W_0 & lt ; 0.1 \AA .	Instead , dN/dz for absorbers with W_0 in the range 0.1-0.3 \AA actually decreases with redshift , similarly to the case of strong absorbers .
We suggest a slight modification of the CPR approach in order to get more robust results .	We examine trends in CPR for an approximately 19-month window moved along the time series and compare them to { \rho } .
Such remarkably long lifetime arises from the coupling of long-lifetime h-BN transverse optical phonon with graphene plasmons , which uniquely exists in monolayer heterostructures .	Our findings and understanding of this unexploited hybrid mode offer a novel approach to tune the plasmon behaviours in the frequency , time and space domains .
A free fermion without doubler is formulated on 1+D dimensional discrete Minkowski space-time .	The action is not hermitian but causes no harm .
One factor will be the approximate polynomial relations satisfied by the matrices .	The other factor is what algebra the matrices are in , either the matrices over A for A the real numbers , A the complex numbers or A the algebra of quaternions .
Using this property , we introduce a coarse-graining length scale at which all stress ratios are below the packing yield threshold .	We show that this length increases with the slope angle and jumps to a length comparable to the depth of the granular bed at an angle below the angle of repose .
We exhibit one-to-one correspondences between three classes of objects : framed bundles on a noncommutative projective plane , certain complexes of sheaves on a noncommutative 3-dimensional projective space , and the modified ADHM data .	The modified ADHM construction itself is interpreted in terms of a noncommutative version of the twistor transform .
In the case of a finite size JJ placed in magnetic field , this problem is considerably more complex since , besides the phase , the potential itself , depends on space variables .	We find the general expressions both for the crossover temperature $ T_ { 0 } $ between thermally activated and macroscopic quantum tunneling regimes and the escape time $ \tau_ { \mathrm { esc } } $ .
By using $ Planck $ 2015 data only , we obtain the 95 % CL bound $ \gamma & lt ; 0.0017 $ for $ n=4 $ , which is further tightened to $ \gamma & lt ; 0.00075 $ by adding Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations ( BAO ) data .	This latter bound improves by $ \sim 30 $ % the limit obtained with the $ Planck $ 2013 data and the same compilation of BAO data .
We show that it exists and $ $ [ f ( B^H ) , B^H ] ^ { ( W ) } _t=-\int_ { \mathbb R } f ( x ) { \mathscr L } ^H ( dx , t ) , $ $ provided $ f $ is of bounded $ p $ -variation with $ 1\leq p & lt ; \frac { 2H } { 1-H } $ .	Moreover , we extend this result to the time-dependent case .
As one of the immediate consequences , we prove a nonrenormalization theorem implying the ultra-violet finiteness of the corresponding supergraph perturbation theory .	We also derive the general hypermultiplet and gauge superfield propagators in a Chern-Simons background .
We present the first spectroscopic study at high resolution , R~50,000 , of the potentially best solar twin , M67-1194 , identified among solar-like stars in M67 .	Based on a pre-selection of solar-twin candidates performed at medium resolution by Pasquini et al .
We show that Janak 's theorem means that this procedure is exact within the density functional formalism .	We demonstrate that the O ( 1 ) approach produces numerically accurate results by calculating the electron-phonon coupling constants for a series of molecules ranging in size from H_2 to C_60 .
The model is based on the equations of modified MHD , that describe the mean flow parameters in the wave MHD turbulence .	Diffusion of the magnetic field and radiative heating and cooling are taken into account .
The advantage of this result is that it holds in very general classes .	But the disadvantage is that we do not know where these examples locate and examples in this family might be far apart .
Fluctuations in the CMB have now been detected over a wide range of angular scales , and a consistent picture seems to be emerging .	The data can not currently constrain a large number of cosmological parameters , but it is clear that there is more information than just the normalization of the models .
Localized wrinkles of thin premixed flames subject to hydrodynamic instability and geometrical stretch of uniform intensity ( S ) are studied .	A stretch-affected nonlinear and nonlocal equation , derived from an inhomogeneous Michelson-Sivashinsky equation , is used as a starting point , and pole decompositions are used as a tool .
We determine the galaxy infrared ( IR ) luminosity function ( LF ) as a function of the environment in a supercluster at z=0.23 , using optical , near-IR , and mid- to far-IR photometry , as well as redshifts from optical spectroscopy .	We identify 467 supercluster members in a sample of 24-micron-selected galaxies , on the basis of their spectroscopic ( 153 ) and photometric ( 314 ) redshifts .
Alternatively , the SN shock might be expanding into a uniform medium with density $ n_CSM & lt ; 3 cm-3 .	These results rule out single-degenerate ( SD ) systems with steady mass-loss until the terminal explosion and constrain the fraction of transferred material lost at the outer Lagrangian point to be & lt ; 1 % .
When an entire population can not be immunized and the effect of immunization is not perfect , we need the targeted immunization with immunization rate .	Under such a circumstance we calculate epidemic thresholds for the SIR and SIS epidemic models .
We present first results from an extensive survey of Magellanic Clouds supernova remnants ( SNRs ) with the Spitzer Space Telescope .	We describe IRAC and MIPS imaging observations at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8 , 24 , and 70 microns of four Balmer-dominated Type Ia SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) : DEM L71 ( 0505-67.9 ) , 0509 -- 67.5 , 0519 -- 69.0 , and 0548-70.4 .
One way to decrease the effect of noise ( and hence , reduce the overhead of building fault tolerant quantum circuits ) is to reduce the latency of the quantum circuit that runs on a quantum circuit .	In this paper , a novel algorithm is presented for scheduling , placement , and routing of a quantum algorithm , which is to be realized on a target quantum circuit fabric technology .
We show that a number of bright solitons is produced and this can be interpreted in terms of the modulational instability of the time-dependent macroscopic wave function of the Bose condensate .	In particular , we derive a simple formula for the number of solitons that is in good agreement with the numerical results of 3D GPE .
Using the JVLA , we have mapped the hot and dense molecular gas in the hot core NGC7538 IRS1 , with 0.2 '' angular resolution , in seven metastable ( J=K ) inversion transitions of ammonia : ( J , K ) = ( 6,6 ) , ( 7,7 ) , ( 9,9 ) , ( 10,10 ) , ( 12,12 ) , ( 13,13 ) , and ( 14,14 ) .	These lines arise from energy levels between ~400 K and ~1950 K above the ground state , and are observed in absorption against the HC-HII region associated with NGC7538 IRS1 .
The generalized extreme value distribution and its particular case , the Gumbel extreme value distribution , are widely applied for extreme value analysis .	The Gumbel distribution has certain drawbacks because it is a non-heavy-tailed distribution and is characterized by constant skewness and kurtosis .
We consider several statistical models defined on the Farey fractions .	Two of these models may be regarded as `` spin chains '' , with long-range interactions , while another arises in the study of multifractals associated with chaotic maps exhibiting intermittency .
We found that the mass loss timescale due to escape of stars , $ t_ { mloss } $ , and its dependence on the two-body relaxation timescale , $ t_ { rh , i } $ , are determined by the strength of the tidal field .	The logarithmic slope [ $ = dln ( t_ { mloss } ) /dln ( t_ { rh , i } ) $ ] approaches to near unity for the cluster models in weaker tidal field .
Scientific analyses commonly compose multiple single-process programs into a dataflow .	An end-to-end dataflow of single-process programs is known as a many-task application .
We study structure and dynamics of the turbulent photospheric magnetic field in the active region NOAA 11158 by characterizing the spatial and temporal scaling properties of the line-of-sight ( LOS ) component .	Using high-resolution high-cadence LOS magnetograms from SDO/HMI , we measured power-law exponents $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ describing wavenumber- ( $ k $ ) and frequency-domain ( $ f $ ) Fourier power spectra , respectively , and investigated their evolution during the passage of the active region through the field of view of HMI .
We provide numerical evidence that the multipartite entanglement generation leads to a linear increase of entropy until saturation in both integrable and chaotic regimes , so that in both cases the number of harmonics of the Wigner function grows exponentially with time .	The entropy growth rate can be used to detect quantum phase transitions .
However , wind turbine towers are sure to be threatened by hurricanes .	In this paper , method to estimate the number of wind turbine towers that would be buckled by hurricanes is discussed .
Deep J , H and Ks photometry of the low Galactic latitude Norma cluster has been obtained with the 1.4-m Infrared Survey Facility ( IRSF ) and with SOFI on the NTT .	Together with spectroscopy taken at the Anglo-Australian Observatory using 2dF , the near-infrared Fundamental Plane of the Norma cluster will be used to determine the distance to this cluster and to assess its location within the Great Attractor overdensity .
We measure the stellar mass surface densities of early type galaxies by observing the micro-lensing of macro-lensed quasars caused by individual stars , including stellar remnants , brown dwarfs and red dwarfs too faint to produce photometric or spectroscopic signatures .	Instead of observing multiple micro-lensing events in a single system , we combine single epoch X-ray snapshots of ten quadruple systems , and compare the measured relative magnifications for the images with those computed from macro-models .
In this work we consider the changes of the SZ cluster brightness , flux and number counts induced by the motion of the Solar System with respect to the frame defined by the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) .	These changes are connected with the Doppler effect and aberration and exhibit a strong spectral and spatial dependence .
These include the unitarity method and on-shell recursion .	The other ingredients are compact analytic formulae for tree amplitudes for four-dimensional helicity states .
Motivated by these results , we carry out simulations of hard inelastic spheres forced by homogenous white noise .	We find a transition to an ordered state of the same symmetry as that seen in the experiments , but the clear phase separation observed in the vibrated system is absent .
This paper shows that the file safety is an un-decidable property for whilef .	The file safety becomes a decidable property in a special case shown in this paper .
It is therefore , important to understand their evolution and their modifications with respect to the physics and to the underlying cosmology .	In this spirit , we investigate the effect of dark energy on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations .
Cross sections with pions , rho mesons , kaons and nucleons having magnitudes 4 -- 8 mb are found , and with steep thresholds .	This , folded with thermal momentum distributions for the scattering partners , suggests a mean dissociation lifetime $ \simeq $ 20 fm/c .
For systems of up to 14 particles most of the MS packings were generated .	We find that the packings are not equally probable as has been assumed in recent thermodynamic descriptions of granular systems .
This experiment was done in the context of the upcoming SMOS mission in order to improve our understanding of the behaviour of the L-band signal above forested areas .	Very little information exists on this subject at the moment , especially for varying hydrological conditions .
The precise study of the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons is of particular importance and requires as much information as possible .	In this view this paper provides the next-to-leading order ( NLO ) QCD corrections to the production cross sections and differential distributions of a SM Higgs boson in association with a pair of weak bosons $ W^+W^- $ , $ W^\pm Z $ and $ ZZ $ , matched with parton shower ( PS ) in the POWHEG-BOX framework .
This process interpolates between known statistical physical models : The case $ \omega=-1 $ corresponds to the strong disorder renormalisation group transformation of certain disordered quantum spin chains whereas $ \omega=1 $ describes coarsening in the one-dimensional Glauber-Ising model .	The case $ \omega=0 $ is related to the renormalisation group transformation of a recently introduced graph with a fat-tail edge-length distribution .
We reconfirm the matching between the gauge theories and the dual geometries by comparing the chiral ring structure .	As a more refined test of the flows , we compute the three-sphere partition function of the gauge theories .
The parameters of these two components change in correlation with the position of the source in the color-color diagram .	Based on the pattern that the source shows in the color-color diagram and its aperiodic variability we conclude that Aquila X-1 is an atoll source .
This model is based on the formalism of nested ordered sets which uses inclusion relation to produce hierarchical structure of sets and ordering relation to produce multi-dimensional structure among its elements .	Nested ordered set is defined as an ordered set where an each element can be itself an ordered set .
We refer to the resulting convective instability as the magnetothermal instability ( MTI ) .	We present fully three-dimensional simulations of the MTI and show that saturation results in an atmosphere with different vertical structure , dependent upon the boundary conditions .
We identify the limiting equation and , in particular , the additional drift term that appears in the limit is expressed in terms of the solution to a Lyapunov matrix equation .	The proof uses a theory of convergence of stochastic integrals developed by Kurtz and Protter .
This new regime of matter light interaction in a circuit can be exploited for quantum information processing and quantum communication .	It may also lead to new approaches for single photon generation and detection .
The dielectric in the transistors had a permittivity of up to 200 which led to low driving voltages of 3 V. The field effect transistors were p-type and reached mobilities of about $ \mu = 1.5\times 10^ { -3 } $ cm $ ^2 $ /Vs and an on/off ratio of $ 10^3 $ .	These properties are compared to devices based on other dielectric materials .
We use the 2011 Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) proportional counter array ( PCA ) data of the 401 Hz accreting pulsar and burster IGR J17498-2921 to perform timing analysis and time-resolved spectroscopy of 12 thermonuclear X-ray bursts .	We confirm previously reported burst oscillations from this source with a much higher significance ( 8.8\sigma ) .
A manually time-measuring tool in mass sporting competitions can not be imagined nowadays because many modern disciplines , such as IronMan , take a long time and , therefore , demand additional reliability .	Moreover , automatic timing devices , based on RFID technology , have become cheaper .
The general procedure for obtaining explicit expressions for all cohomologies of N.Berkovits 's operator is suggested .	It is demonstrated that calculation of BV integral for the classical Chern-Simons-like theory ( Witten 's OSFT-like theory ) reproduces BV version of two dimensional gauge model at the level of effective action .
XIM introduces a conceptual cross-link between hitherto separate domains of machine learning , namely topographic vector quantization and divergence-based neighbor embedding approaches .	There are three ways to conceptualize XIM , namely ( i ) as the inversion of the Exploratory Observation Machine ( XOM ) and its variants , such as Neighbor Embedding XOM ( NE-XOM ) , ( ii ) as a powerful optimization scheme for divergence-based neighbor embedding cost functions inspired by Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ( SNE ) and its variants , such as t-distributed SNE ( t-SNE ) , and ( iii ) as an extension of topographic vector quantization methods , such as the Self-Organizing Map ( SOM ) .
We show that topological states are often developed in two dimensional semimetals with quadratic band crossing points ( BCPs ) by electron-electron interactions .	To illustrate this , we construct a concrete model with the BCP on an extended Lieb lattice and investigate the interaction-driven topological instabilities .
We construct a general mean field theory for random networks and show this predicts that the dynamics on the network are a smoothed version of the average response function dynamics .	Thus , the behavior of the system can range from steady state to chaotic depending on the response functions , network connectivity , and update synchronicity .
The current status of leptonic jet models for gamma-ray blazars is reviewed .	Differences between the quasar and BL-Lac subclasses of blazars may be understood in terms of the dominance of different radiation mechanisms in the gamma-ray regime .
A variety of high precision null experiments verify the weak equivalence principle and local Lorentz invariance , while gravitational redshift and other clock experiments support local position invariance .	Together these results confirm the Einstein Equivalence Principle which underlies the concept that gravitation is synonymous with spacetime geometry , and must be described by a metric theory .
A twisted virtual link is a link in a trivial I-bundle over a not-necessarily orientable compact surface .	A twisted virtual birack is an algebraic structure with axioms derived from the twisted virtual Reidemeister moves .
In multi-label learning , each sample is associated with several labels .	Existing works indicate that exploring correlations between labels improve the prediction performance .
We further derive explicit analytic expressions for the momentum dependence of the single particle distribution function as well as for the spatial dependence of its moments .	We find that this dissipative system has the ability to flow as a perfect fluid even though its entropy density does not match the equilibrium form .
Finding frequent item sets in databases is a crucial in data mining process of extracting association rules .	Many algorithms were developed to find the frequent item sets .
In this work we show how to use linear operations along with successive interference cancellation in order to reduce the problem to that of designing optimal codes for the single-antenna additive-noise Gaussian wiretap channel .	Much like popular communication techniques in the absence of an eavesdropper , the data is carried over parallel streams .
For Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry , the phase shift can change smoothly but non-monotonically from $ \pm 1/8 $ near the Weyl nodes to $ \pm 5/8 $ at higher Fermi energies .	For Dirac semimetal or Weyl semimetal with time-reversal symmetry , a combination effect of a pair of Weyl nodes and its time-reversal counterpart leads to a discrete value of phase shift of $ \pm 1/8 $ or $ \pm 5/8 $ .
Poly ( allylamine hydrochloride ) ( PAH ) was used as polycation and Sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) was used as anionic surfactant .	UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic characterization reveals the formation of only H-type aggregates of R6G in their aqueous solution and both H and J-type aggregates in PAH/SDS/R6G complex LbL films as well as the kinetics of adsorption of R6G onto the complex films .
As a result , we provide guidelines for the target-oriented design of yet unconsidered transforms that fulfill requirements in a specific application context .	Furthermore , the standard theorems do not need to be shown in a slightly different form every time a new geometric Fourier transform is developed since they are proved here once and for all .
We investigate whether two Higgs doublet models with the most general allowed couplings to quarks , and a large coupling to $ \tau $ leptons , can explain these anomalies while respecting other flavor constraints and technical naturalness .	Fits to $ B\to D^ { ( * ) } \tau\nu $ data require couplings of the new Higgs doublet to down-type quarks , opening the door to many highly constrained flavor-changing neutral current ( FCNC ) processes .
This dilemma can be resolved by assuming an extra , extended , diffusely distributed component of dust which is not detectable in optical data .	Bona-fide global correlations among ISM components -- -and between ionized gas , dust , and global ( stellar ) properties of ellipticals -- - are hard to find , which most probably reflects an external origin of dust and ionized gas in ellipticals .
At higher density the instability criterion becomes independent of $ k_F $ and the system may become unstable in a broad momentum range .	Finally , upon filling the upper spin-orbit split band , finite momentum instabilities disappear in favor of phase separation alone .
We use the results of a new , multi-epoch , multi-wavelength , near-infrared census of the Trapezium Cluster in Orion to construct and to analyze the structure of its infrared ( K band ) luminosity function .	Specifically , we employ an improved set of model luminosity functions to derive this cluster 's underlying Initial Mass Function ( IMF ) across the entire range of mass from OB stars to sub-stellar objects down to near the deuterium burning limit .
For any configuration of pebbles on the nodes of a graph , a pebbling move replaces two pebbles on one node by one pebble on an adjacent node .	A cover pebbling is a move sequence ending with no empty nodes .
One of the goals when developing this instrument is to build in the latest algorithms for detection of spectrally compelling targets on the surface of the Red Planet , so they may be available to the Planetary Science community without cost and with a minimal learning barrier to cross .	This will allow the Astrobiology community to look for targets of interest such as hydrothermal minerals , sulfate minerals and hydrous minerals and be able to map the extent of these minerals using the most up-to-date and effective algorithms .
Our new survey , HeCS-SZ ( Hectospec Cluster Survey of SZ-selected clusters ) , includes 7,721 new or remeasured redshifts from MMT/Hectospec observations of 24 SZ-selected clusters at redshifts $ z $ =0.05-0.20 and not in previous surveys .	We supplement the Hectospec data with spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) and cluster data from the Cluster Infall Regions in SDSS ( CIRS ) project and the Hectospec Cluster Survey ( HeCS ) , our Hectospec survey of clusters selected by X-ray flux .
We present the results of extinction measurements toward the main ejecta shell of the Cassiopeia A supernova ( SN ) remnant using the flux ratios between the two near-infrared ( NIR ) [ Fe II ] lines at 1.26 and 1.64 $ \mu { \rm m } $ .	We find a clear correlation between the NIR extinction ( $ E ( J-H ) $ ) and the radial velocity of ejecta knots , showing that redshifted knots are systematically more obscured than blueshifted ones .
GRB 030501 was discovered by the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System in the ISGRI field of view .	Although the burst was fairly weak ( fluence F = 3.5 * 10^-6 erg cm^-2 in the 20-200 keV energy band ) it was possible to perform time resolved spectroscopy with a resolution of a few seconds .
As such , they may be suitable for realization in different physical systems , and also offer different perspectives on open questions such as the precise origin of the quantum speedup .

We present near-IR photometry and imaging observations of a small sample of sources identified in the BeppoSAX 5-10 keV survey ( HELLAS ) which resolves ~ 20-30 % of the X-ray background at these energies .	The near-IR data are combined with optical spectra and photometry .
( ii ) the strong mass loss of helium stars , which causes their evolution to differ from that of the helium core of a massive star .	( iii ) The direct formation of low-mass black holes ( $ M\sim2\msun $ ) from single stars , a consequence of a significant strange-matter content of the nuclear-matter equation of state at high density .
Quantum bits or qubits are at the heart of quantum information processing schemes .	At the moment , solid-state qubits , and in particular the superconducting ones , seem to satisfy the requirements for being the building blocks of viable quantum computers , since they exhibit relatively high coherence times , extremely low dissipation , and scalability .
We apply Bayesian methods to carry out a rigorous test of the texture hypothesis , using full-sky data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe .	We conclude that current data do not warrant augmenting the standard cosmological model with textures .
One can , therefore , make use of the lower energy part of the laser-generated deuterons , which includes the majority of the accelerated deuterons .	The $ ^ { 11 } $ C produced from the reaction $ ^ { 10 } $ B ( $ d , n $ ) $ ^ { 11 } $ C is estimated to be 7.4 $ \times $ 10 $ ^ { 9 } $ per laser-shot at the Titan laser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
Here we present a unified mathematical model which models motor torque generation based on experimental torque-speed curves and torque-dependent switching based on the conformational spread model .	The model successfully reproduces the observed switching rate as a function of the rotation speed , and provides a generic physical explanation independent of most details .
As a consequence we obtain a criterion for the real locus of the Wilson 's adelic Grassmannian of rank one bispectral solutions of the KP hierarchy .	Using Wilson 's first parametrisation of the adelic Grassmannian , we give a new proof of a result of [ MTV2 ] on real bases of spaces of quasi polynomials .
However , the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects such as Klein 's paradox and Zitterbewegung , an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle first examined by Schr\ '' odinger .	These and other predictions would be difficult to observe in real particles , while constituting key fundamental examples to understand relativistic quantum effects .
The goal is to find the ground state of the diagonal part of the Hamiltonian with high accuracy as quickly as possible .	We have solved the time-dependent Schr\ '' odinger equation numerically for small size systems with various exchange interactions .
At the static level of theory , in which proton zero-point energy is ignored , the LDA , PBE and BLYP functionals give very different structural transition and metallization pressures , with the BLYP phase diagram in better agreement with experiment .	Nevertheless , all three functionals provide qualitatively the same information about the band gaps of the four structures and the phase transitions between them .
The distance between the 2 , measured in the HST/ACS image , is 0.495 '' that , at the redshift of the source , corresponds to a projected separation of 2.46 kpc .

Application of the adiabatic model of quantum computation requires efficient encoding of the solution to computational problems into the lowest eigenstate of a Hamiltonian that supports universal adiabatic quantum computation .	Experimental systems are typically limited to restricted forms of 2-body interactions .
With uncertainties of $ \sigma_ { [ X/ { \rm Fe } ] } $ and $ \sigma_ { \rm [ Fe/H ] } \simeq 0.05 $ for 10 elements measured for $ & gt ; 10^4 $ stars , the APOGEE DR12 spectra may be the first well-suited data set to put this idea into practice .	We find that even APOGEE data offer only $ \sim 500 $ independent volume elements in the 10-dimensional abundance space , when we focus on the $ \alpha $ -enhanced Galactic disk .
A general framework based on linear algebra and linear estimation is employed to introduce the reader to the fundamentals of reduced-rank signal processing and to describe how dimensionality reduction is performed on an observed discrete-time signal .	A unified treatment of dimensionality reduction algorithms is presented with the aid of least squares optimization techniques , in which several techniques for designing the transformation matrix that performs dimensionality reduction are reviewed .
We have placed limits on the cosmological significance of gas-rich low surface-brightness ( LSB ) galaxies as a proportion of the total population of gas-rich galaxies by carrying out a very deep survey ( HIDEEP ) for neutral hydrogen ( HI ) with the Parkes multibeam system .	Such a survey avoids the surface-brightness selection effects that limit the usefulness of optical surveys for finding LSB galaxies .
The first model studies edge states in FQHE using supersymmetric domain walls in N=6 Chern-Simons theory .	We show that D4-branes wrapped on CP^1 or D8-branes wrapped on CP^3 create edge states that shift the rank or the level of the gauge group , respectively .
Our implementation of this algorithm is more than 3.5 times faster than the previously fastest generator for fullerenes -- fullgen -- and the first program since fullgen to be useful for more than 100 vertices .	We also note a programming error in fullgen that caused problems for 136 or more vertices .
In fact , as it generically dominates the gamma-ray spectrum expected from DM annihilations , at high energies , it may well turn out to be more important for indirect DM searches than the traditionally looked-for line signals .	As illustrated in some detail , the observation of IB signatures would even allow to distinguish between different DM candidates or to constrain significantly the parameter space of , e.g. , neutralino DM .
We introduce a new class of solutions for Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraphs ( APLC ) with segmented aperture telescopes to remove broadband diffracted light from a star with a contrast level of $ 10^ { 10 } $ .

The Co3O4 ( 111 ) grows single crystalline with the epitaxial relation Co3O4 ( 111 ) [ -12-1 ] ||a-Al2O3 ( 0001 ) [ 10-10 ] , as determined from in situ electron diffraction .	Film stoichiometry is confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy , while ex situ x-ray diffraction measurements show that the Co3O4 films are fully relaxed .
In the present study , we have investigated the effect of pressure and temperature on relative phase stability of the polymorphs using planewave pseudopotential approaches based on Density Functional Theory ( DFT ) .	van der Waals interactions play a significant role in predicting the phase stability and they can be effectively captured by semiempirical dispersion correction methods incontrast to standard DFT functionals .
Cyclic lattices are sublattices of $ \mathbb Z^N $ that are preserved under the rotational shift operator .	Cyclic lattices were introduced by D.~Micciancio and their properties were studied in the recent years by several authors due to their importance in cryptography .
We have shown that for strong disorder the quenching of the impurity moments is absent .	For weak disorder the screening persists , but with the critical non-Fermi-liquid behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat .
Anti-de Sitter ( AdS ) is conjectured to be nonlinear unstable to a weakly turbulent mechanism that develops a cascade towards high frequencies , leading to black hole formation [ 1,2 ] .	We give evidence that the gravitational sector of perturbations behaves differently from the scalar one studied in [ 2 ] .
Despite the number of optimization techniques available nowadays the author of this paper thinks that Genetic Algorithms still play a central role for their versatility , robustness , theoretical framework and simplicity of use .	The paper can be considered a `` collection of tips '' ( from literature and personal experience ) for the non-computer-scientist that has to deal with optimization problems both in the science and engineering practice .
It is capable of resolving sharp Kondo resonances , as well as peaks within the Hubbard bands when employed as an impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory ( DMFT ) .	Our method works at zero temperature and allows for arbitrary discretization of the bath spectrum .
Using Monte Carlo simulations we study the dynamics of three-dimensional Ising models with nearest- , next-nearest- , and four-spin ( plaquette ) interactions .	During coarsening , such models develop growing energy barriers , which leads to very slow dynamics at low temperature .

We study the polarisation dependence of the homogeneously broadened nuclear spin resonance in a crystal .	We employ a combinatorial method to restrict the nuclear states to a fixed polarisation and show that the centre of the resonance is shifted linearly with the nuclear polarisation by up to the zero polarisation line width .
From the perspective of the knot group , G , these invariants reflect the structure of G^ ( 1 ) /G^ ( 2 ) as a module over G/G^ ( 1 ) ( here G^ ( n ) is the n-th term of the derived series of G ) .	Hence any phenomenon associated to G^ ( 2 ) is invisible to abelian invariants .
We find the induced Yukawa-type potentials for which we calculate the strength \alpha and range .	In general the range of the Yukawa correction is given by the wavelength of the lightest Kaluza-Klein state and its strength , relative to the standard gravitational potential , by the corresponding degeneracy .
There are some implications for the continuing discussion of quantum realism and entanglement .	A principle of relative realism is advocated .
The tree-level relation $ m_b/m_ { \tau } =1 $ predicted by such models can receive large radiative corrections up to about $ 50\ % $ due to threshold effects at the mass unification scale .	These corrections are thus of about the same importance as those that give rise to renormalisation group running .
The IIA solution is known to be unique ; in this paper , we use the pure spinor approach to give a classification for IIB supergravity .	We reduce the problem to two PDEs on a two-dimensional space Sigma .
As $ D/H $ increases , there is a transition from stable flow to oscillations transverse to the walls and then to a fluttering motion with oscillations of the angle of the axis with respect to the horizontal .	The two types of oscillations may be superimposed in the transition domain .
Namely , let $ a\in R $ , then $ a $ is EP if and only if there exists $ x\in R $ such that $ ( xa ) ^ { \ast } =xa $ , $ xa^ { 2 } =a $ and $ ax^ { 2 } =x. $ It is well known that all EP elements in $ R $ are core invertible and Moore-Penrose invertible .	We give more equivalent conditions for a core ( Moore-Penrose ) invertible element to be an EP element .
In principle , both classical and quantum protocols can be used for this processing .	It is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful .
For two posets $ P $ and $ Q $ , we say $ Q $ is $ P $ -free if there does not exist any order-preserving injection from $ P $ to $ Q $ .	The speical case for $ Q $ being the Boolean lattice $ B_n $ is well-studied , and the optiamal value is denoted as $ \lanp $ .

The high resolution image of 12CO ( J=3-2 ) has revealed the detailed distribution of the high excitation gas including U shapes , the outer boundary of which shows sharp intensity jumps accompanying strong velocity gradients .
This paper describes TARDIS ( Traffic Assignment and Retiming Dynamics with Inherent Stability ) which is an algorithmic procedure designed to reallocate traffic within Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) networks .

The method is extended to infinite dimensional Holstein-Hubbard model using dynamical mean field theory .
We test power law expansion against the standard flat $ \Lambda $ CDM cosmology using goodness-of-fit and model comparison criteria .	We consider Type Ia supernova ( SN Ia ) data from two current compilations ( JLA and Union2.1 ) along with a current set of baryon acoustic oscillation ( BAO ) measurements that includes the high-redshift Lyman- $ \alpha $ forest measurements from BOSS quasars .
We find that in magnitude , condensates for the sextet and octet loops are approximately the square of the triplet loop .	This agrees with a large $ N $ expansion , where factorization implies that the expectation values of loops in adjoint and higher representations are just powers of fundamental and anti-fundamental loops .
Soft Gamma Repeaters and the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars are believed to contain slowly spinning `` magnetars '' .	The enormous energy liberated in the 2004 Dece 27 giant flare from SGR 1806-20 , together with the likely recurrence time of such events , points to an internal magnetic field strength ~ 10^ { 16 } G. Such strong fields are expected to be generated by a coherent alpha-Omega dynamo in the early seconds after the Neutron Star formation , if its spin period is of a few milliseconds at most .
In both models we constrain the MgII halo sizes of field and cluster galaxies using observational results on the observed MgII statistics .	Our results for the field are in good agreement with previous works , indicating a typical \mgii\ halo size of $ r_MgII ~ 50h_71^-1kpc in the semi-analytic model , and slightly lower in the halo occupation number approach .
For a Killing symmetry of the background , first order Taub numbers give the contribution of the linearized perturbation to the associated backgound quantity , such as the perturbing mass .	Second order Taub numbers give the contribution of second order perturbations to the background quantity .
While the smoothly curved continuum emission and the overall spectral energy distribution indicate a non-thermal emission , other features such as the iron line emission and the low variability appear to be rather of Seyfert type , i.e.created in the accretion disk and corona around the central black hole .	We investigate several prominent cases using combined X-ray and gamma-ray data in order to constrain the possible contributions of the jet and the accretion disk to the overall spectral energy distribution in radio galaxies .

We include also the one-loop hard matching coefficients as well as Coulomb corrections to second order , using Mellin-moment methods .	We study the characteristics of this resummation in detail for a centre-of-mass ( CM ) energy of 8 TeV at the LHC , and for squark and gluino masses up to 2.5 TeV .
We find that the GMC population in NGC4526 is gravitationally bound , with a virial parameter $ \alpha \sim 1 $ .	The mass distribution , $ dN/dM \propto M^ { -2.39 \pm 0.03 } $ , is steeper than that for GMCs in the inner Milky Way , but comparable to that found in some late-type galaxies .
Since their discovery at radio wavelengths pulsars have been persistent targets for widespread multi-wave observations throughout optics , radio , X-rays , and high-energy gamma-rays .

The first source is significantly detected at the ~11 sigma level , while the second source is tentatively detected at the ~4 sigma level , leading to a positional accuracy of ~0.2-0.3 '' .	MM100015+021549 is identified with a faint radio and K-band source .
This property is closely connected to the orbit closure of permutation groups .	Since relation groups are orbit closed the results here imply that many classes of imprimitive permutation groups are orbit closed .
In this paper , we provide a statistical solution that could decouple this environmental dependence .	After deriving the probability distribution evolution equation of the matter field , our method produces a set of closed ordinary differential equations whose solution is uniquely determined by the initial condition of the fluid element .
Surprisingly , the order- $ k $ Voronoi diagram of line segments had received no attention in the computational-geometry literature .	It illustrates properties surprisingly different from its counterpart for points ; for example , a single order- $ k $ Voronoi region may consist of $ \Omega ( n ) $ disjoint faces .
We prove that the slope of an exceptional truly cosmetic surgery on a hyperbolic knot in $ S^3 $ must be $ \pm 1 $ and the surgery must be toroidal but not Seifert fibred .	As consequence we show that there are no exceptional truly cosmetic surgeries on certain types of hyperbolic knot in $ S^3 $ .

This application corresponds to parametrically different intra-chain hopping integrals ( a `` fast '' chain coupled to a `` slow '' chain ) .	We show that the canonical Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar ( DMPK ) equation is insufficient for this problem .
Recently , attention has turned to the rather rigorous power-law behaviour exhibited by the `pseudo phase-space density ' of the dark matter halo , which is defined dimensionally in terms of the local density and velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles .	The non-power-law behaviour of the density profile is generally taken to exclude simple scale-free , in-fall models ; however the power-law behaviour of the `pseudo-density ' is a counter indication .
At the same time , stabilization mechanisms of such a state are poorly understood .	We present a general overview of the problem , together with a more detailed discussion of the prototype example , namely , Guinier-Preston zones in Al-based alloys .

A recently developed microeconomic model for the personal income distribution and its evolution and a simple functional relationship between the rate of the per capita GDP growth and the attained level of the per capita GDP are used to describe the transition process .	The developed transition model contains only three defining parameters and describes the process of real GDP per capita evolution during the last 15 years .
To that purpose we consider a nonlinear system whose steady-state response is very sensitive to the periodic or quasiperiodic character of the input signal .	In the infinite time limit , an input signal consisting of two incommensurate frequencies will be recognised by the system as quasiperiodic .
While optimal complementation techniques for finite automata are simple - it suffices to determinize them using a simple subset construction and to dualize the acceptance condition of the resulting automaton - B\ '' uchi complementation is more involved .	Indeed , the construction of an EXPTIME complementation procedure took a quarter of a century from the introduction of B\ '' uchi automata in the early 60s , and stepwise narrowing the gap between the upper and lower bound to a simple exponent ( of ( 6e ) n for B\ '' uchi automata with n states ) took four decades .
In the maximally non-hermitean limit , we give a simple `` one-line '' proof of this feature .	We then study the spectral curves for various distributions of the random site energies .
We discuss the relationships between Andean shortening , plate velocities at the trench , and slab geometry beneath South America .	Although some correlation exists between the convergence velocity and the westward motion of South America on the one hand , and the shortening of the continental plate on the other hand , plate kinematics neither gives a satisfactory explanation to the Andean segmentation in general , nor explains the development of the Bolivian orocline in Paleogene times .
We find that for Egghe 's g-index and Hirsch 's h-index the log-normal form $ P ( x ) \sim \exp [ -a\ln x -b ( \ln x ) ^2 ] $ applies best , with $ a $ and $ b $ depending moderately on the underlying set of researchers .	In special cases , particularly for institutions with a strongly hierarchical constitution and research fields with high self-citation rates , exponential distributions can be observed as well .
Here we consider such pulses for selective measurements on a single system .	Each probe pulse will cause a burst of fluorescence or no fluorescence .
Because of their high stellar masses and small host halos , their feedback ionizes the surrounding 3 kpc of intergalactic medium and drives the majority of the gas from the potential well .	The next generation of stars then must form in this gas-poor environment , creating the first galaxies that produce the majority of ionizing radiation during cosmic reionization .
We revisit and generalize , to the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system , previous results of D. Christodoulou and D. Chae concerning global solutions for the Einstein-scalar field and the Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs equations .	The novelty of the present work is twofold .
However , the use of bit-plane coding and channel coding in many DSC approaches leads to complex coding and decoding .	In this paper , we propose an alternative approach for merging multiple SI frames , using a piecewise constant ( PWC ) function as the merge operator .
In this paper , using this foundation , the duality of tropical polynomials is constructed to introduce the duality of Non-Archimedean curves .	Using the development of `` mechanism '' which is based on `` distortion '' values and their matrices , we discuss some aspects refereing to quadrics with respect to their dual objects .
In particular , the propagation equations allow for a derivation of the equations of motion of test particles in this generalized gravity theory , and allow for direct identification of the couplings between the matter currents and the gauge gravitational field strengths of the theory , namely , the curvature , the torsion , and the nonmetricity .	We demonstrate that the possible non-Riemannian spacetime geometry can only be detected with the help of the test bodies that are formed of matter with microstructure .
The gravity of the stars and the surrounding gas are coupled self consistently to allow the realistic dynamical evolution of the cluster .	While the equations of motion are solved , a stellar evolution code keeps track of the changes in stellar mass , luminosity and radius .
Due to the several improvements including the introduction of vector-meson exchange potentials , fss2 has achieved very accurate description of the NN and YN interactions , comparable to various one-boson exchange potentials .	We review the essential features of fss2 and our previous model FSS , and their predictions to few-body systems in confrontation with the available experimental data .
These observations raise new questions about the formation and evolution of these sources .	The number of detected sources is now high enough to allow us to carry out a statistical analysis of the distribution of HMXBs in the Milky Way .
Geometric aspects of the filtration on classical links by k-quasi-isotopy are discussed , including the effect of Whitehead doubling , relations with Smythe 's n-splitting and Kobayashi 's k-contractibility .

A numerical method is here introduced for simulating the dynamics of diffusive heavy inertial particles in turbulent flows .	The approach is based on the position/velocity phase-space particle distribution .
What is the simplest Hamiltonian which can implement quantum computation without requiring any control operations during the computation process ?	In a previous paper we have constructed a 10-local finite-range interaction among qubits on a 2D lattice having this property .
We first consider an `` ad hoc '' extension with a single sterile fermion state , and investigate its impact on the above observables .	Two well motivated mechanisms of neutrino mass generation are then considered : the Inverse Seesaw embedded into the Standard Model , and the $ \nu $ MSM .
In this paper we show that an appropriate setting for $ \Gamma $ -convergence in the considered parameter regime is via weak convergence of the suitably normalized charge density in the sense of measures .	We prove that , after a suitable rescaling , the Ohta-Kawasaki energy functional $ \Gamma $ -converges to a quadratic energy functional of the limit charge density generated by the screened Coulomb kernel .
Our basic strategy for reducing the number of features is to employ the idea of recently proposed safe feature screening ( SFS ) rule .	An SFS rule has a property that , if a feature satisfies the rule , then the feature is guaranteed to be non-active in the LASSO solution , meaning that it can be safely screened-out prior to the LASSO training process .
The proposal is conveniently formulated in a democratic basis , with Yukawas and soft terms of the form const .	x ( 1+eps+i zeta ) where eps & lt ; & lt ; 1 , zeta & lt ; ~10^ ( -3 ) , motivated by approximate permutation x CP symmetry .
The Fermi/LAT instrument has detected about two thousands Extragalactic High Energy ( E & gt ; 100 MeV ) gamma-ray sources .	One of the brightest is 3FGL 1603.9-4903 , associated to the radio source PMN J1603-4904 .
Direct signature of enhanced ionization being `` switched off '' in the ultrashort domain is also obtained .	Consequently , dissociation becomes an almost non-existent channel when few-cycle pulses are used , with only long-lived singly- , doubly- , and triply-charged molecular ions dominating the mass spectrum .
We present a Ramsey-type atom interferometer operating with an optically trapped sample of 10^6 Bose-condensed Rb-87 atoms .	The optical trap allows us to couple the |F =1 , mF =0 & gt ; \rightarrow |F =2 , mF =0 & gt ; clock states using a single photon 6.8GHz microwave transition , while state selective readout is achieved with absorption imaging .
Here , we investigate this transition in a class of models with arbitrary number of opinions .	In contrast to previous work we do not assume that opinions are equidistant or arranged on a one-dimensional conceptual axis .
Groups of central type play a fundamental role in the classification of semisimple triangular complex Hopf algebras and can be determined by their representation theoretical properties .	Suppose that a finite group $ Q $ acts on an abelian group $ A $ so that there exists a bijective 1-cocycle $ \pi\in Z^1 ( Q , \ach ) $ , where $ \ach=\rm { Hom } ( A , \C^* ) $ is endowed with the diagonal $ Q $ -action .

Analogous phase transitions with respect to the microcanonical ensemble are also studied via a combination of rigorous analysis and numerical calculations .	Finally , probabilistic limit theorems for appropriately scaled values of the total spin are proved with respect to the canonical ensemble .
The goal of this program was to detect and characterize the magnetic fields of objects cooler than spectral type L3.5 , the coolest brown dwarf detected prior to our survey .	We have also attempted to detect flaring radio emission from the HR 8799 planetary system , guided by theoretical work indicating that hot , massive exoplanets may have strong magnetic fields capable of generating radio emission at GHz frequencies .
Specifically , we use query feedback from a workload as training data to estimate a histogram with a small memory footprint that minimizes the expected error on future queries .	Our formulation provides a framework in which different approaches can be studied and developed .
We study theoretically magnetically induced Feshbach resonances and near-threshold bound states in isotopic NaK pairs .	Our calculations accurately reproduce Feshbach spectroscopy data on Na $ ^ { 40 } $ K and explain the origin of the observed multiplets in the p-wave [ Phys.Rev .
The resulting protection for the Z- & gt ; b_L b_L and Z- & gt ; \tau_R \tau_R decays allows for potentially interesting signals in Higgs physics , while maintaining the good agreement of the Standard Model with precision tests .	The setups can be motivated as the low energy effective theories of the composite Higgs models MCHM_5 and MCHM_10 , where the spectra can be identified with the light custodians present in these theories .
The electric field of the order of 10 V/cm affects the energy levels and leads to the redistribution of intensity between peaks .	The small value of the electric field indicates participation of the collective state in formation of the energy levels inside the Peierls gap .
These measurements are marginally consistent with biases derived from galaxy-galaxy auto-correlations : $ b=1.15^ { +0.02 } _ { -0.01 } , 1.08^ { +0.01 } _ { -0.01 } $ and $ 0.96^ { +0.01 } _ { -0.01 } $ respectively .	Using the 2013 Planck release , we obtain biases of $ b=1.33^ { +0.29 } _ { -0.28 } , 1.19^ { +0.23 } _ { -0.23 } , 1.16^ { +0.19 } _ { -0.18 } $ , showing significant differences between the releases .
Theoretical calculations were carried out using the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method within the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation for exchange and correlation effects .	The calculated ground state properties -- the equilibrium lattice constant , bulk modulus and elastic constants -- are in good agreement with experimental results .
In this Letter , we incorporate these BCD SEDs as templates for two samples of high-redshift galaxy populations selected at submm wavelengths .	Because of the severe absorption of the optical light , the featureless mid-infrared spectrum , and the relatively flat radio continuum , the dusty star-cluster SEDs are good approximations to most of the submm sources in our samples .
The coupling is extracted from the force between two static quarks in the framework of the valence quark approximation .	A value of the Lambda-parameter for zero quark flavours is determined : Lambda_msbar=0.630 ( 38 ) \sqrt { \sigma } =293 ( 18 ) ^ { +25 } _ { -63 } MeV .
We also obtain the solutions of the field equation inside a spherically symmetric body and show how they can be connected to exterior solutions that accommodate the Vainshtein mechanism .	We apply our general results to a number of concrete models such as the covariant/extended Galileons and the DBI Galileons with Gauss-Bonnet and other terms .
P-wave interaction in cold atoms may give rise to exotic topological superfluids .	However , the realization of p-wave interaction in cold atom system is experimentally challenging .
Namely , we have argued that , given a constant probability $ p $ , an $ n $ -node random graph $ G $ from $ { \bbbg ( n , p ) } $ and for $ r= c \log_ { 1/p } n $ with $ 1 \leq c \leq 2 $ , it holds : ( 1 ) if $ p & gt ; 1/2 $ then an $ r $ -node clique is dominating in $ G $ almost surely and , ( 2 ) if $ p \leq ( 3 - \sqrt { 5 } ) /2 $ then an $ r $ -node clique is not dominating in $ G $ almost surely .	The remaining range of probability $ p $ is discussed with more attention .
Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial prerequisite for fast App launching , intelligent user experience , and power management of smartphones .	By analyzing real App usage log data , we discover two kinds of features : The Explicit Feature ( EF ) from sensing readings of built-in sensors , and the Implicit Feature ( IF ) from App usage relations .
In the scaling limit we keep track of features seen on the macroscopic scale , in situations where the short -- distance scale at which the system 's basic variables are defined is taken to zero .	Among the challenging questions are the construction of the limit , and the explanation of some of the emergent properties , in particular the behavior under conformal maps as discussed in [ LPS 94 ] .
Such particles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model .	In this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $ W ' $ coupling helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $ \ell +E_T^ { miss } $ discovery channel .
Let X be a resolution of C^m/G , and g a Kahler metric on X .	We say that g is Asymptotically Locally Euclidean ( ALE ) if it is asymptotic in a certain way to the Euclidean metric on C^m/G .

We propose a hypothesis that all gauge theories are equivalent to a certain non-standard string theory .	Different gauge groups are accounted for by weights ascribed to the world sheets of different topologies .
The intermittent transition between slow growth and rapid shrinkage in polymeric assemblies is termed dynamic instability , a feature observed in a variety of biochemically distinct assemblies including microtubules , actin and their bacterial analogs .	The existence of this labile phase of a polymer has many functional consequences in cytoskeletal dynamics , and its repeated appearance suggests that it is relatively easy to evolve .
In fact , the notion of strong non-linear coupling of compressible and incompressible motions is not tenable .	Alfven , slow and fast modes of MHD turbulence follow their own cascades and exhibit degrees of anisotropy consistent with theoretical expectations .
This fixed-point becomes unstable due to discretization effects , a scenario similar to quantum phase transitions .	As a result , the long-time asymptotic behavior of the system changes and the dynamics flows into a limit cycle .
Doing so either requires an infinite number of states of different charges to satisfy the WGC in the original theory or a restriction on allowed compactification radii .	These subtleties suggest that if the Weak Gravity Conjecture is true , we must seek a stronger form of the conjecture that is robust under compactification .
We explore the quantum phase transitions between two ordered states in the infinite dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model at half filling .	Our study is based on the dynamical mean field theory ( DMFT ) combined with the numerical renormalization group ( NRG ) , which allows us to handle both strong electron-electron and strong electron-phonon interactions .

We present Suzaku results of the two Galactic supernova remnants ( SNRs ) , G350.1-0.3 and G349.7+0.2 .	We find Al and Ni K alpha lines from both the SNRs for the first time , in addition to previously detected K-shell lines of Mg , Si , S , Ar , Ca and Fe .
According to both the Adam-Gibbs and the Random First Order theory the correlation length grows as $ \xi \sim ( T-T_k ) ^ { -1/ ( d-\theta ) } $ , even though the two theories disagree on the value of $ \theta $ .	Therefore , the super-Arrhenius growth of the relaxation time with the temperature is regulated by the two exponents $ \psi $ and $ \theta $ through the relationship $ T\log\tau \sim ( T-T_k ) ^ { -\psi/ ( d-\theta ) } $ .
In particular , I analyze the multiplicity distribution in a rapidity interval between two jets , using the HERWIG QCD simulation with some necessary modifications .	The distribution is not of the negative binomial form , and displays an anomalous enhancement at zero multiplicity .
The method enables to find nontrivial fixed points in quantum field theoretic models which make them free from divergences and leads to the concept of asymptotic safety .	It can be considered as a generalization of the asymptotic freedom which plays a key role in the perturbative renormalization .
Our results indicate that the disappearance of the AF state occurs near x_c ~ 0.7 , although already at x ~ 0.4 significant modifications of the magnetic ground state are observed .	Between these concentrations , clear NFL signatures are observed , such as \rho ( T ) \approx \rho_0 + A T^n ( with n & lt ; 1.5 ) and C_P ( T ) \propto -T ln ( T ) dependencies .
In a fascinating thermal transport experiment on a high- $ T_c $ superconductor , Krishana et al \cite { Krishana } have reported mysterious magnetic field induced first order transitions from a superconducting state with gap nodes to a state without gap nodes .	We show here that this is an experimental manifestation of a novel { \it macroscopic } quantum phenomenon induced by the magnetic field , qualitatively different from the usual quantum Hall effects .
We obtain the mean velocity profile .	The radius scales with the Kolmogorov length .
Understanding and control of spin degrees of freedom on the surfaces of topological materials are key to future applications as well as for realizing novel physics such as the axion electrodynamics associated with time-reversal ( TR ) symmetry breaking on the surface .

We investigate the thermodynamics and signatures of a polariton condensate over a range of densities , using a model of microcavity polaritons with internal structure .	We determine a phase diagram for this system including fluctuation corrections to the mean-field theory .
We conclude that either the scatter of the v_c-sigma_c relation is a function of v_c ( and hence galaxy mass ) or that the character of the v_c-sigma_c relation changes at v_c ~ 80 km/s .	Some inplications of our findings are discussed .
Density functional calculations are employed to study the molecular dissociation of hydrogen on graphene , the diffusion of chemisorbed atomic species , and the electronic properties of the resulting hydrogen on graphene system .	Our results show that applying stress to the graphene substrate can lower the barrier to dissociation of molecular hydrogen by a factor of six , and change the process from endothermic to exothermic .

We study representations related to the conjugacy action of the symmetric group .	These arise as sums of submodules induced from centraliser subgroups , and their Frobenius characteristics have elegant descriptions , often as a multiplicity-free sum of power-sum symmetric functions .
Consequently , the position of the instability domain in the HR diagram strongly depends on the metal abundance ( Pamyatnykh 1999 ) .	We derive stellar parameters ( metallicity , [ m/H ] , effective temperature , $ T_ { \rm eff } $ , stellar diameter , $ \theta $ ) and interstellar extinction , $ E ( B-V ) $ , for all $ \beta $ Cep stars observed by { \it International Ultraviolet Explorer } satellite .
Our method consists of using numerical homotopy continuation and a monodromy action on the total critical space to compute all of the complex critical points of an objective function .	To illustrate the relevance of our method , we apply it to the Euclidean distance function to compute ED-degrees and the likelihood function to compute maximum likelihood degrees .
We also provide the corresponding angular-moment versions of this generalized equation set .	Our goal is to make it easier for astrophysicists to address oscillation phenomena in a language with which they are familiar .
We consider learning on graphs , guided by kernels that encode similarity between vertices .	Our focus is on random walk kernels , the analogues of squared exponential kernels in Euclidean spaces .
Over the past decade , various matrix completion algorithms have been developed .	Thresholded singular value decomposition ( SVD ) is a popular technique in implementing many of them .
Based on this model we derive a single ordinary differential equation for the thickness of the condensate film as function of the tube axis .	Our model agrees well with commonly used models from existing literature .
We consider a gravity dual description of time dependent , strongly interacting large-Nc N=4 SYM .	We regard the gauge theory system as a fluid with shear viscosity .
These commensurabilities define characteristic patterns that can be used to trace the source of the observed resonant behaviour .	Here , we explore systematically the existence of commensurabilities between the known ETNOs using their heliocentric and barycentric semimajor axes , their uncertainties , and Monte Carlo techniques .
We derive exact solutions for the Galileon , which reproduce correctly the shape of the throats at large distances , but fail to do so for their central part .	We also determine the parameter range for which the Vainshtein mechanism is reproduced within the brane theory .
Atomic scale computer simulations using density functional theory were used to investigate the behaviour of tin in the tetragonal phase oxide layer on Zr-based alloys .	The $ Sn_ { Zr } ^ { \times } $ site defect was shown to be dominant across most oxygen partial pressures , with $ Sn_ { Zr } ^ { `` } $ charge compensated by fully charged oxygen vacancies occurring at partial pressures below $ 10^ { -31 } $ atm .
We find that halos formed in simulations with gas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed in adiabatic simulations .	Gas cooling results in an average increase of the principle axis ratios of halos by ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions .
If we trivialize P over a finite number of points on the boundary of \Sigma , then the moduli space carries a quasi-Poisson structure instead .	Our first result is to describe this quasi-Poisson structure in terms of an intersection form on the fundamental groupoid of the surface , generalizing results of Massuyeau and Turaev .
N-body simulations are used to model the tidal disruption of the Sagittarius ( Sgr ) dwarf galaxy with constraints set by the positions and velocities of M giants in the Sgr tidal arms recently revealed by the Two Micron All-Sky Survey ( 2MASS ) .	The simulated Sgr dwarf is placed on a variety of orbits within a Milky Way potential parameterized by variable circular velocities , halo flattenings and radial profiles .

Deep SCUBA surveys have uncovered a large population of massive submm galaxies ( SMGs ) at z & gt ; ~1 .	Although it is generally believed that these galaxies host intense star-formation activity , there is growing evidence that a substantial fraction also harbor an AGN .
We approximate the protoplanet as a spherically symmetric , isothermal , self-gravitating classical ideal gas envelope in equilibrium , around a rigid body of given mass and density , with the gaseous envelope required to fill the Hill-sphere .	Starting only with a core of given mass and an envelope gas density at the core surface , the equilibria are calculated without prescribing the total protoplanetary mass or nebula density .
Nanoparticles of Ce1-xNixO2 ( 0.0 \leq x \leq 0.10 ) were prepared by using a co-precipitation method .	XRD measurements indicate that all samples exhibit single phase nature with cubic structure and ruled out the presence of any secondary phase .
The effects of biaxial tensile strain on the structure , electronic states , and mechanical properties of silicene are studied by ab-initio calculations .	Our results show that up to 5 % strain the Dirac cone remains essentially at the Fermi level , while higher strain induces hole doping because of weakening of the Si $ - $ Si bonds .
We investigate the semantics and properties of data cleaning through the enforcement of matching dependencies for the pure case .	We characterize the intended clean instances and also the `` clean answers '' to queries as those that are invariant under the cleaning process .
We conjecture that combination therapy is able to delay drug resistance for a longer time than sequential monotherapy .	To study the action of these two therapeutic approaches in the event of unknown mutations and to explain the emergence of drug resistance , we propose a stochastic model for the infection within a patient which is treated with two drugs , either sequentially or contemporaneously , and develops a two-step mutation which is resistant to both drugs .
One form of big data are signals - time series of consecutive values .	In physical experiments , billions of values can now be measured within a second .
Improvements of ALICE sub-detectors are envisaged for the upgrade plans of year 2017 .	The Muon Forward Tracker ( MFT ) is a proposal in view of this upgrade , motivated both by the possibility to increase the physics potential of the muon spectrometer and to allow new measurements of general interest for the whole ALICE physics .
On the other hand , for case of the non-starburst galaxies , the 13CO ( 1-0 ) emission was detected from all three galaxies , while the HCN ( 1-0 ) emission was weakly or not detected in past observations .	This result indicates that the HCN/13CO intensity ratios are significantly larger ( ~1.15+-0.32 ) in the starburst galaxy samples than the non-starburst galaxy samples ( & lt ; 0.31+-0.14 ) .
We give a perturbative quantization of space-time $ R^4 $ in the case where the commutators $ C^ { { \mu } { \nu } } = [ X^ { \mu } , X^ { \nu } ] $ of the underlying algebra generators are not central .	We argue that this kind of quantum space-times can be used as regulators for quantum field theories .

Faraday rotation , measured between 3.6 and 6.2 cm at a linear resolution of 0.7 kpc , shows more variation in the south than in the north of the galaxy .	About 10 % of the nonthermal emission from M33 at 3.6 cm is polarized .
Exploiting the formulation of the Self Dual Yang-Mills equations as a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem , we present a theory of pulling back soliton hierarchies to the Self Dual Yang-Mills equations .	We show that for each map $ \C^4 \to \C^ { \infty } $ satisfying a simple system of linear equations formulated below one can pull back the ( generalized ) Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies to the Self Dual Yang-Mills equations .
claim that the expansion of the Universe can be interpreted only as the expansion of space .	In fact , what they really prove is that the cosmological expansion can not be described in terms of real motions in Minkowski spacetime .
We perform a sterile neutrino analysis with published MINERvA data as an illustrative example .	We highlight the need for caution in interpreting sterile neutrino limits given the context of incomplete cross-section model information .
Here , including the full spectrum of atomic modes we find a finite lifetime for a roton-like mode in the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum that is strongly pump-dependent .	The corresponding decay rate and critical exponents for the phase-transition are calculated explaining the non-monotonic pump-dependent atomic damping rate observed in recent experiments .
The model is defined in a lattice whose sites represent the possible states of the metal ( bulk , reactive and passive ) and the solution ( neutral , acidic or basic ) .	Probabilistic rules describe passivation of the metal surface , dissolution of the passive layer , which is enhanced in acidic media , and spatially separated electrochemical reactions , which may create pH inhomogeneities in the solution .
We investigate `` the Wojcik model '' introduced and studied by Wojcik et al. , which is a one-defect quantum walk ( QW ) having a single phase at the origin .	They reported that giving a phase at one point causes an astonishing effect for localization .
We present a compelling response of a low-dimensional strongly correlated system to an external perturbation .	Using the time-dependent Lanczos method we investigate a nonequilibrium evolution of the half-filled one-dimensional extended Hubbard model , driven by a transient laser pulse .

We present a theoretical description of the influence of misfit strain on mobile defects dynamics in thin strained ferroelectric films .	Self-consistent solutions obtained by coupling the Poissons equation for electric potential with continuity equations for mobile donor and electron concentrations and time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire equations reveal that the Vegard mechanism ( chemical pressure ) leads to the redistribution of both charged and electro-neutral defects in order to decrease the effective stress in the film .
We carry out a systematic analysis of angular distribution measurements for selected ground-state to ground-state ( d , p ) and ( p , d ) neutron transfer reactions , including the calcium isotopes .	We propose a consistent three-body model reaction methodology in which we constrain the transferred-neutron bound state and nucleon-target optical potential geometries using modern Hartree-Fock calculations .
D \textbf { 70 } , 104011 ( 2004 ) ] .	The gravitational-wave ( GW ) polarizations $ h_ { + } $ and $ h_ { \times } $ with 3.5PN accurate phasing should be useful for the earth-based GW interferometers , current and advanced , if they plan to search for gravitational waves from inspiralling eccentric binaries .
The paper is organized as a sequence of questions .	Most of them , in particular the last one , deal with Fourier series of continuous functions of constant absolute value .
Given a sample of genome sequences from an asexual population , can one predict its evolutionary future ?	Here we demonstrate that the branching patterns of reconstructed genealogical trees contains information about the relative fitness of the sampled sequences and that this information can be used to predict successful strains .
M-theory is an eleven-dimensional quantum theory of gravity which is believed to underlie all superstring theories .	This is the only candidate at present for a theory of fundamental physics which reconciles gravity and quantum field theory in a potentially realistic fashion .
We consider the NP-hard problem of finding a spanning tree with a maximum number of internal vertices .	This problem is a generalization of the famous Hamiltonian Path problem .
As a first application of our result , we bring a new insight on the speed of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution for birth and death processes : we prove that these processes converge exponentially fast to a quasi-stationary distribution if and only if they have a unique quasi-stationary distribution .	Also , considering the lack of results on quasi-stationary distributions for non-irreducible processes on countable spaces , we show , as a second application of our result , the existence and uniqueness of a quasi-stationary distribution for a class of possibly non-irreducible processes .
Using bosonization and renormalization group theory , we find CSB for $ \alpha $ smaller than a critical exponent $ \alpha_c ( \le 3 ) $ depending on the microscopic parameters of the model .	Furthermore , the transition from the gapless XY phase to the gapless CSB phase is mediated by the breaking of conformal symmetry due to long-range interactions , and is described by a new universality class akin to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition .
That is , our entangler generates the output state which is as close as possible to the pure ( symmetrized ) state $ ( |\Psi & gt ; |0 & gt ; +|0 & gt ; |\Psi & gt ; ) $ .	The most attractive feature of this entangling machine , is that the fidelity of its performance ( i.e.the distance between the output and the ideally entangled -- symmetrized state ) does not depend on the input and takes the constant value $ F= ( 9+3\sqrt { 2 } ) /14\simeq 0.946 $ .
Our results indicate that values of the transport coefficient $ \hat q $ more than four times larger than perturbative estimates are preferred by experimental data .	This confirms previous calculations based on simpler implementations of the medium geometry or only the single-inclusive suppression .
Based on cosmological simulations , we model Lyman continuum emission from a sample of 11 high-redshift star forming galaxies spanning a mass range of a factor 20 .	Each of the 11 galaxies has been simulated both with a Salpeter and a Kroupa initial mass function ( IMF ) .
Our simulation extends a previous work by Casati and Prosen and it is aimed to test their surprising conclusion that the fringes disappear in the experiments with fully chaotic billiards .	According to the results found , we are led to reassess this remarkable effect of classical dynamics on quantum interference .
In the Weinberg construct , the boson and its antiboson carry { \it same } relative intrinsic parity , whereas in our construct the relative intrinsic parities of the boson and its antiboson are { \it opposite } .	These results originate from the commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation and Parity in Weinberg 's theory , and from the anti-commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation and Parity in our theory .
The invariance method of Lie-groups in the theory of turbulence carries the high expectation of being a first principle method for generating statistical scaling laws .	The purpose of this comment is to show that this expectation has not been met so far .
Recent planet searches leads to the discovery of many multiple-planet systems .	Any theoretical models of their origins must take into account dynamical interaction between emerging protoplanets .
We give algebraic equivalents for certain desirable properties of pullback functors on categories of coverings and group sets , namely nullity zero , essential injectivity , and essential surjectivity .	Nullity zero turns out to be equivalent to the notion of a contranormal subgroup .
We construct exactly solvable models of twisted carbon nanotubes via supersymmetry , by applying the matrix Darboux transformation .	We derive the Green 's function for these systems and compute the local density of states .
This work compares computational methods for laser pulse propagation in hollow waveguides filled with rare gases at high pressures , with applications in extreme nonlinear optics in the mid-infrared wavelength region .	As the wavelength of light \lambda=2\pi/k increases with respect to the transverse size R of a leaky waveguide , the loss of light out of the waveguide upon propagation , in general , increases .
The supercritical phase is the normal ( gapless ) phase with a nontrivial chiral structure : it is a Weyl semimetal with a pair of Weyl nodes for each of the original Dirac points .	The nodes are separated by a dynamically induced chiral shift .
We carry out a comprehensive Bayesian uncertainty analysis and obtain correlated uncertainties for the normalization and shape parameters of the form factor .	The $ z $ -series parametrization for $ f_ { B\pi } ^+ $ is employed to extrapolate our results to large momentum transfer , and to compare with the lattice QCD results .
However rare members of the class need not be near star -- forming regions , and could have any type of host galaxy .	Thus a long -- duration burst far from any star -- forming region would also be a signature of this class .
We present model predictions for the composition of Fe-peak elements in AGB stars .	These elements could be analysed in the near future thus providing further stringent constraints to our understanding of AGB stars .
In this context , the present work deals with distributed economic dispatch and demand response initiatives for grid-connected microgrids with high-penetration of wind power .	To cope with the challenge of the wind 's intrinsically stochastic availability , a novel energy planning approach involving the actual wind energy as well as the energy traded with the main grid , is introduced .
We show that every pair emerges from vacuum configurations which are torn apart so as to give rise to two semi-classical currents : that carried by the particle and that of its `partner ' .	The partner 's current lives behind the Hubble horizon centered around the particle .
They agree with each other except for Nf=2Nc-2 and 2Nc cases .	These differences come from possible ambiguities in the constructions of the exact solutions or the definitions of the operators in the microscopic theories .
Fuel cells offer an alternative to burning fossil fuels , but use platinum as a catalyst which is expensive and scarce .	Cheap , alternative catalysts could enable fuel cells to become serious contenders in the green energy sector .
By using the $ \chi^2 $ statistic and the Bayesian information criterion , we find that the current observational data are still too limited to distinguish which parametrization method is better , and a simple model has advantage in fitting observational data than a complicated model .	Moreover , it is found that all these parametrizations demonstrate that the Union2 dataset is still consistent with a cosmological constant at 1 $ \sigma $ confidence level .
We study the phase diagram in a two-dimensional Fermi gas with the synthetic spin-orbit coupling that has recently been realized experimentally .	In particular , we characterize in detail the properties and the stability region of the unconventional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov ( FFLO ) states in such a system , which are induced by spin-orbit coupling and Fermi surface asymmetry .
Such a space-time represents a black hole without an apparent horizon .	It is essential that the matter should be non-vacuum in the outer region but vacuumlike in the inner one .
We provide finite-key unconditional security bounds for two practical implementations of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 coding : prepare-and-measure implementations without decoy states , and entanglement-based implementations .	A finite-key bound for prepare-and-measure implementations with decoy states is also derived under a simplified treatment of the statistical fluctuations .
The clique number of an undirected graph $ G $ is the maximum order of a complete subgraph of $ G $ and is a well-known lower bound for the chromatic number of $ G $ .

Bandstructure effects in PMOS transport of strongly quantized silicon nanowire field-effect-transistors ( FET ) in various transport orientations are examined .	A 20-band sp3d5s* spin-orbit-coupled ( SO ) atomistic tight-binding model coupled to a self consistent Poisson solver is used for the valence band dispersion calculation .
The methods used are classical : a ground state calculation , by grand potential energy minimization , and the grand canonical Monte Carlo ( GCMC ) method of simulation .	Our results are similar to those found recently in a GCMC study of Ar and Kr .
The radio source is probably associated with the ionizing star of W3 ( OH ) , but an interpretation in terms of an ionized stellar wind fails because the detected flux densities are orders of magnitude larger than expected .	We discuss several scenarios and tentatively propose that the radio emission could arise in a static ionized atmosphere around a fossil photoevaporated disk .

The work Simple and Hierarchical method properties are considered , algorithms for variance are shown .
The galaxy has a very high neutral gas content , explaining large part of its total dynamic mass - suggesting small dark matter content .	As it is located at the tip of the gaseous tail , this strongly suggests its tidal origin .
The second , in contrast , is applicable at and in the vicinity of a N-photon resonance and it exploits quasi-degenerate perturbation theory for the nonlinear oscillator in Floquet space .	It is perturbative both in driving and nonlinearity .
In the absense of any additional mechanical dissipations , the system is often not even strongly stable unless restricted to the rotationally symmetric case , etc .	We present a well-posedness result for the linear problem under general mixed boundary conditions for the elastic and thermal parts .
Although V453 Oph is the first RV Tauri star showing a strong s-process signature , it is NOT accompanied by C enhancement , challenging our current nucleosynthetic models of post-AGB stars that predict a simultaneous enrichment in C and s-process elements .	The low N abundance excludes CN cycling as being responsible for the low C abundance .
We combine the theory of ion-dominated pulsar winds with hydrodynamic simulations of pulsar bow shocks to show that a bright elongated X-ray and radio feature extending 10 '' behind the pulsar represents the surface of the wind termination shock .	The X-ray and radio `` trails '' seen in other pulsar bow shocks may similarly represent the surface of the termination shock , rather than particles in the postshock flow as is usually argued .
We assume i.i.d .	data sampled from a mixture distribution with K components along fixed d-dimensional linear subspaces and an additional outlier component .
We compute continuum states with the correct asymptotic behavior through the R-matrix method .	For the n+ n potential , we use the Minnesota interaction .
We obtained 48 Magellan IMACS spectra of subgiants and fainter stars covering the spectral region between 3650-6750\AA , to derive C and N abundances from the spectral features at 4300\AA ( G-band ) and at ~ 3883\AA ( CN ) .	We added to our sample ~ 45 unvevolved stars previously observed with FORS2 at the VLT .
Not only do pulsar searches continue to improve statistical estimates of , for example , pulsar birthrates , lifetimes and the Galactic distribution , but they continue to turn up interesting and , in some cases , unique individual pulsars .	In the early days of pulsar astronomy , the Molonglo radio telescope led the world as a pulsar detection instrument .
Effects connected with the world globalization affect also the financial markets .	On a way towards quantifying the related characteristics we study the financial empirical correlation matrix of the 60 companies which both the Deutsche Aktienindex ( DAX ) and the Dow Jones ( DJ ) industrial average comprised during the years 1990-1999 .
A well-established and fundamental insight in database theory is that negation ( also known as complementation ) tends to make queries difficult to process and difficult to reason about .	Many basic problems are decidable and admit practical algorithms in the case of unions of conjunctive queries , but become difficult or even undecidable when queries are allowed to contain negation .
The dual representations are shown to be valid when the market model satisfies an appropriate generalization of the no-arbitrage condition and the agent 's utility function satisfies an appropriate generalization of asymptotic elasticity conditions .	When applied to classical liquid market models or models with bid-ask spreads , we recover well-known pricing formulas in terms of martingale measures and consistent price systems .
The question , whether B-splines lead to a reduction of spurious solutions is analyzed .	Numerical expenses , precision and behavior of convergence are compared for both methods in view of their use in large scale computation on FEM grids with more dimensions .
We examine , in addition , the effect of introducing smooth deformations of the detector energy scale , E - & gt ; E ' ( E ) , and of the reactor flux shape , Phi ( E ) - & gt ; Phi ' ( E ) , within reasonable error bands inspired by state-of-the-art estimates .	It turns out that energy-scale and flux-shape systematics can noticeably affect the performance of a JUNO-like experiment , both on the hierarchy discrimination and on precision oscillation physics .
We found the solution in the entire kinematic region to the non-linear evolution equation that governs the dynamics in the high parton density QCD .	The large impact parameter ( $ b_t $ ) behavior of the solution is discussed as well as the way how to include the non-perturbative QCD corrections in this region of $ b_t $ .

To be able to infer a model for this distribution from large-scale neural recordings , we introduce a stimulus-dependent maximum entropy ( SDME ) model -- -a minimal extension of the canonical linear-nonlinear model of a single neuron , to a pairwise-coupled neural population .	The model is able to capture the single-cell response properties as well as the correlations in neural spiking due to shared stimulus and due to effective neuron-to-neuron connections .
Excluding mass concentrations centered on visible galaxies , more than 98 % of the remaining mass is represented by a smooth concentration of dark matter centered near the brightest cluster galaxies , with a 35 h^ { -1 } kpc soft core .	The asymmetry in the mass distribution is & lt ; 3 % inside 107 ~h^ { -1 } kpc radius .
It is based on the tessellation of the three-dimensional manifold representing cold dark matter in six-dimensional phase space .	The density , velocity and other fields are computed by projecting the tessellation on configuration space .
Shape memory alloys are a class of ferroic materials which undergo a structural ( martensitic ) transition where the associated ferroic property is a lattice distortion ( strain ) .	The sensitiveness of the transition to the conjugated external field ( stress ) , together with the latent heat of the transition gives rise to giant mechanocaloric effects .
It is noted that such gauge-Higgs unification leads to a specific boundary condition on the Higgs mass parameters at the compactification scale , which is independent of the details of supersymmetry breaking mechanism .	With this boundary condition , phenomenologically viable parameter space of the model is severely constrained by the condition of electroweak symmetry breaking for supersymmetry breaking scenarios which can be realized naturally in orbifold field theories .
We have investigated the magnetoresistance of ferromagnet-semiconductor devices in an InAs two-dimensional electron gas system in which the magnetic field has a sinusoidal profile .	The magnetoresistance of our device is large .
Among the operators considered are `` filled Wilson loops '' which are the most reasonable counterparts of Wilson loops in the conventional Wilson formulation of lattice QCD .	The averages of interest are represented as partition functions of certain 2-dimensional statistical systems with nearest neighbor interactions .

Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes .	Albeit a crude measure , the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium therefore provides useful information on the overall shape of the molecule can provide insights into the interplay of its functional domains .
Investigations of stellar encounters in cluster environments have demonstrated their potential influence on the mass and angular momentum of protoplanetary discs around young stars .	In this study it is investigated in how far the initial surface density in the disc surrounding a young star influences the outcome of an encounter .
Topological phases in frustrated quantum spin systems have fascinated researchers for decades .	One of the earliest proposals for such a phase was the chiral spin liquid put forward by Kalmeyer and Laughlin in 1987 as the bosonic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect .
It is shown that $ w_ { de } $ beyond redshift $ z\sim0.5 $ is poorly constrained from current data , and the mock future $ \sim2300 $ supernovae data give poor constraints of $ w_ { de } $ beyond $ z\sim1 $ .	The fitting results also indicate that there might exist a rapid transition of $ w_ { de } $ around $ z\sim0.5 $ .
The observed resonance energies and widths of the negative-parity levels are all in fair agreement with those calculated from both the spin-dipole and electric-dipole strength functions as well as the energy eigenvalues of the complex scaled Hamiltonian .	Spin-dipole sum rules , both non energy-weighted and energy-weighted , are discussed in relation to tensor correlations in the ground state of $ ^4 $ He .
We examine both processes .	We show that the non-affine part is associated with diffusion , and also can be used to define a granular temperature .
We report the observation of resonance fingerprints in the state-to-state differential cross sections for inelastic NO-He collisions in the 13 to 19 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ energy range with 0.3 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ resolution .	The observed structures were in excellent agreement with quantum scattering calculations .
Armed with this , I move on to systematically analyze the properties of radiatively generated neutrino masses induced by nonrenormalizable lepton number violating effective operators of mass dimensions five through eleven .	By fitting these to the observed light mass scale , I extract predictions for neutrino mixing as well as neutrinoless double beta decay , rare meson/tau decays and collider phenomenology .
A particle acceleration mechanism by radiation pressure of precursor waves in a relativistic shock is studied .	For a relativistic , perpendicular shock with the upstream bulk Lorentz factor of $ \gamma_1 \gg 1 $ , large amplitude electromagnetic ( light ) waves are known to be excited in the shock front due to the synchrotron maser instability , and those waves can propagate towards upstream as precursor waves .
We consider a system of J number of coincident unstable non-BPS D0-branes of IIB theory in the light-cone gauge and on the plane-wave background with a compact null direction , the dynamics of which is described by the world-line U ( J ) gauge theory .	This configuration suffers from tachyonic instabilities .
For d=4 this generalises earlier work by K. Chinen and L. Murata .	The case d=3 was apparently not considered before .
Resonant Switch ( RS ) model of twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations ( HF QPOs ) assumes switch of twin oscillations at a resonant point where frequencies of the upper and lower oscillations become commensurable and the twin oscillations change from one pair of the oscillating modes ( corresponding to a specific model of HF QPOs ) to some other pair due to non-linear resonant phenomena .	The RS model is used to determine range of allowed values of spin and mass of the neutron star located at the atoll source 4U 1636-53 where two resonant points are observed at frequency ratios $ nu_ { U } $ : $ nu_ { L } $ = 3:2 , 5:4 .
In this study , we complete the unfinished picture initiated by these two works by solving both models with both approaches for both 3D honeycomb iridates .	Through comparisons between all combinations of models , techniques , and materials , we find that the bond-isotropic $ JK\Gamma $ model consistently predicts the experimental phase of $ \beta $ -Li $ _2 $ IrO $ _3 $ regardless of the method used , while the experimental phase of $ \gamma $ -Li $ _2 $ IrO $ _3 $ can be generated by the soft-spin approach with eigenmode mixing irrespective of the model used .
The mean probability distribution of a Markov chain on a hypercube is known to mix to a uniform distribution in time O ( n log n ) .	We show that the mean probability distribution of a discrete-time quantum walk on a hypercube mixes to a ( generally non-uniform ) distribution pi ( x ) in time O ( n ) and the stationary distribution is determined by the initial state of the walk .
We quantify the open cluster multiplicity using complete , volume-limited samples from WEBDA and NCOVOCC .	At the Solar Circle , at least 12 % of all open clusters appear to be experiencing some type of interaction with another cluster ; i.e. , are possible binaries .
As far as I can tell , these intuitions about time are something like this : 1 ) There is a physical world in which events occur , 2 ) These events are mirrored by our perceptual re-creation of them in essentially the same order in which they occur in the physical world , 3 ) This re-creation of events occurs in a linear order based on our conscious memory of them ( e.g. , event A is said to occur before event B if at some point we do remember event A but we don not yet remember event B , and at another point we remember both events ) , 4 ) Assuming we have good memories , what we remember has occurred in the past and what we don not remember but we can imagine might : a ) never occur , b ) occur when we are not conscious , or c ) occur in the future .	These intuitions are excellent ones for understanding our conscious conception of ordered events .
The $ \Bs $ oscillations have not yet been resolved , despite the progress recently achieved by SLD and ALEPH .	The world combination , including results from the LEP experiments , SLD and CDF , is presented , together with the expected and observed lower limit on the $ \Bs $ oscillation frequency .
We consider a two-dimensional ( 2D ) generalization of the standard kicked-rotor ( KR ) and show that it is an excellent model for the study of 2D quantum systems with underlying diffusive classical dynamics .	First we analyze the distribution of wavefunction intensities and compare them with the predictions derived in the framework of diffusive { \it disordered } samples .
We discuss here the role of injection in selecting the real solution , in the framework of a simple phenomenological recipe , which is a variation of what is sometimes referred to as thermal leakage .	In this context we show that multiple solutions basically disappear and when they are present they are limited to rather peculiar values of the parameters .
In particular , we implement in the context of probability measures the ideas of Maz'ja 's capacity theory , and present equivalent forms relating the capacity of sets to their measure .	Orlicz hypercontractivity efficiently describes the integrability improving properties of the Heat semigroup associated to the Boltzmann measures $ \mu_\alpha ( dx ) = ( Z_\alpha ) ^ { -1 } e^ { -2|x|^\alpha } dx $ , when $ \alpha\in ( 1,2 ) $ .
How to forecast next year 's portfolio-wide credit default rate based on last year 's default observations and the current score distribution ?	A classical approach to this problem consists of fitting a mixture of the conditional score distributions observed last year to the current score distribution .
We numerically study dynamical collapses of charged matter fields in an anti de Sitter background and note the formation of black holes using the double-null formalism .	Moreover , we include re-normalized energy-momentum tensors assuming the S-wave approximation to determine thermodynamical back-reactions to the internal structures .
As the packing fraction $ \phi $ is lowered towards the onset of unjamming at $ \phi_ { c } $ , the density of vibrational states approaches a non-zero value in the limit of zero frequency .	For $ \phi & gt ; \phi_ { c } $ , there is a crossover frequency , $ \omega^ { * } $ below which the density of states drops towards zero .
We use the recently found matrix description of noncritical superstring theory of Type 0A to compute tachyon scattering amplitudes in a background with a RR flux .	We find that after the string coupling is multiplicatively renormalized , the amplitudes in any genus become polynomial in the RR flux .
The second scheme relies on a metric called Extrinsic Message Degree ( EMD ) and the third scheme is a simulation-based exhaustive search to find the best puncturing pattern among several random ones .	In addition , we devise two layer-structured extension schemes based on a counting cycle algorithm and an EMD metric which are applied to design RC-LDPC codes .
Three billion years after the big bang ( at redshift z=2 ) , half of the most massive galaxies were already old , quiescent systems with little to no residual star formation and extremely compact with stellar mass densities at least an order of magnitude larger than in low redshift ellipticals , their descendants .	Little is known about how they formed , but their evolved , dense stellar populations suggest formation within intense , compact starbursts 1-2 Gyr earlier ( at 3 & lt ; z & lt ; 6 ) .
We then observe that , by using only the descritized even-numbered sites , we can set the commutation rules for second quantization without any contradiction .	In fact we can quantize the objects described by these even numbered images .

The set of all multiple harmonic sums up to weight five cover the sums needed in the calculation of the 3 -- loop anomalous dimensions .	The relations extend the set resulting from the quasi-shuffle product between harmonic sums studied earlier .
The result is based on two ideas .	The first is to re-run a static algorithm after a chosen number of updates to ensure approximation guarantees .
We present numerical results for total cross sections as well as for experimentally interesting distributions .	Applying typical LHC cuts , the electroweak corrections are of the order of -5 % for the total cross sections and exceed -20 % for observables dominated by high centre-of-mass energies of the partonic processes .
We focus on two aspects of the problem : ( i ) how to guess number of clusters required to proficiently consume available sources for a sensor network , and ( ii ) how to select number of cluster-heads to cover up sensor networks more proficiently .	A sensor in Wireless Sensor Networks ( WSNs ) can communicate directly only with other sensors that are within a radio range in a cluster .
The values of ion-atom ionization cross sections are frequently needed for many applications that utilize the propagation of fast ions through matter .	When experimental data and theoretical calculations are not available , approximate formulas are frequently used .
Moderately large cells with 8 formula units ( 56 atoms ) are studied for all dopings and large ones with 27 formula units ( 189 atoms ) for the case of La-doping .	The undoped system has a vanishing density-of-states ( DOS ) at the Fermi energy ( E $ _F $ ) , while the additional La-d band makes E $ _F $ to enter the bands above the gap .

The first , operative at weak coupling in the worldvolume gauge theory , is pair creation of W-bosons .	The second , operative at strong coupling , corresponds to formation of a large black hole in the dual supergravity .
Backward stochastic partial differential equations of parabolic type in bounded domains are studied in the setting where the coercivity condition is not necessary satisfied and the equation can be degenerate .	Some generalized solutions based on the representation theorem are suggested .
The partonic processes are dominated by the t-channel weak boson fusion ( WBF ) and gluon fusion ( GF ) contributions .	We derive the associated QCD resummation formalism for the correlation analysis where the total transverse momentum q_\perp of the Higgs boson and two jets is small .
Several illustrative simple test cases are given to show typical spurious effects that one can observes for poor settings .	We explain why Forward Semi-Lagrangian scheme bring us some benefits .
Now three neutrino mixing angles have been measured to a good degree of accuracy ( theta_12 ~ 34^\circ , theta_23 ~ 45^\circ and theta_13 ~ 9^\circ ) .	Motivated by these experimental results , we propose a novel lepton flavor mixing pattern , which predicts sin^2 theta_23 = 1/2 , sin^2 theta_12 = ( 2+\sqrt { 3 } ) / ( 10+\sqrt { 3 } ) ~ 0.318 and sin^2 theta_13 = ( 2-\sqrt { 3 } ) /12 ~ 0.022 , together with a maximal CP-violating phase delta = 90^\circ .
A consequence is that a crepant resolution of the quotient variety ( if any ) has topological Euler characteristic $ p $ like in the tame case .	Also , we link a crepant resolution with a count of Artin-Schreier extensions of the power series field with respect to weights determined by ramification jumps and the representation .

By introducing an anharmonic perturbation , we observe a gradual transition to the Poisson statistics .	We describe the level spectra in transition from harmonic to Poissonian statistics as a superposition of two independent sequences , one for each of the two extreme statistics .
Correlation between channel state and source symbol is under investigation for a joint source-channel coding problem .	We investigate simultaneously the lossless transmission of information and the empirical coordination of channel inputs with the symbols of source and states .
Mathematically speaking , our approach refines previous elaborations of this program - notably the one due to Farhi , Goldstone , and Gutmann ( 1989 ) as completed by Van Wesep ( 2006 ) - in replacing infinite tensor products of Hilbert spaces by continuous fields of C*-algebras .	In combination with our interpretational context , this technical improvement circumvents valid criticisms that earlier derivations of the Born rule have provoked , especially to the effect that such derivations were mathematically flawed as well as circular .
Mixed Integer Optimization has been a topic of active research in past decades .	It has been used to solve Statistical problems of classification and regression involving massive data .
We first generalize the method of Christensen and Fulling to charged black holes to derive fluxes of energy and charge .	These fluxes can be obtained by employing a conformal field theory technique .
However , the large thermal background may mask this edge at finite temperatures and instead the secondary absorption edges found at Delta_i+Delta_j may become most prominent .	At finite T , if certain interband matrix elements are large , there may also be absorption peaks at the gap difference frequencies | Delta_i-Delta_j | .
The dimension of Y is less than that of X , and A and B are known matrices .	This problem can be solved using standard compressive sensing ( CS ) theory after converting it to vector form using the Kronecker operation .
] , we highlight condition ( T ) as a source of new examples of 'ballistic ' diffusions in a random environment when d & gt ; 1 ( 'ballistic ' means that a strong law of large numbers with non-vanishing limiting velocity holds ) .	In particular we are able to treat the case of non-constant diffusion coefficients , a feature that causes problems .
The classical Kepler problem , as well as its quantum mechanical version , the Hydrogen atom , enjoy a well-known hidden symmetry , the conservation of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector , which makes these problems superintegrable .	Is there a relativistic quantum field theory extension that preserves this symmetry ?
Our aim is to determine the origin of this unique object by accurately determining its distance , metallicity , and age .	The best way to reach this goal is to combine spectroscopic and photometric methods .
Here we describe the technical details of our computations , and present the next step in a systematic development of the simulation code .	First , new sets of transport coefficients and reaction rates are obtained from particle swarm simulations in air , nitrogen , oxygen and argon .
The result can be seen as a non-self-dual illustration of Wilson 's fundamental idea [ Invent.Math .	133 ( 1998 ) , 1-41 ] for understanding the ( self-dual ) bispectral property of the rational solutions of the KP hierarchy .
Conventional Lagrangian approaches convert the lone rate constraint to a linear rate penalty scaled by a multiplier in the objective , resulting in a simpler unconstrained formulation .	However , the search for the `` optimal '' multiplier , one that results in a distortion-minimizing solution among all Lagrangian solutions that satisfy the original rate constraint , remains an elusive open problem in the general setting .
This enables design of coded caching-and-delivery schemes that equip APs with storage , and place content in them in a way that creates coded-multicast opportunities for combining with macro-cell broadcast to satisfy users even with different demands .	Such coded-caching schemes have been shown to be order-optimal with respect to the BS transmission rate , for a system with single-level content , i.e. , one where all content is uniformly popular .
Previously , we discovered a timing asynchronism of -25.6ms between the timestamps of the spacecraft attitude and radiometer output in the original raw WMAP time-ordered data ( TOD ) , which , if not corrected in following data processing , would generate an artificial quadrupole component ( l=2 ) in recovered CMB maps ( Liu , Xiong & amp ; Li 2010 ) .	Recently , Roukema ( 2010b ) proves that there does exist a timing-offset-induced error corresponding to about -25.6ms in the WMAP calibrated TOD by studying the fluctuation variance per pixel in the temperature map recovered from the TOD as a function of assumed timing-offset .
In our paper published earlier we discussed forecasts of earthquake focal mechanism and ways to test the forecast efficiency .	Several verification methods were proposed , but they were based on ad-hoc , empirical assumptions , thus their performance is questionable .
We have varied the star formation efficiency , gas expulsion timescale and strength of the external tidal field , obtaining a three-dimensional grid of models which can be used to predict the evolution of individual star clusters or whole star cluster systems by interpolating between our runs .	The complete data of these simulations is made available on the Internet .
There is a large consensus that in the thermodynamic limit $ N_a^2\rightarrow\infty $ long-range antiferromagnetic order occurs in the spin-density $ m=0 $ ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model on the square lattice .	Here we find that the corresponding spontaneous symmetry breaking lowers the symmetry of such a state from $ SO ( 3 ) \times SO ( 3 ) \times U ( 1 ) $ for $ N_a^2\gg 1 $ large but finite to $ [ U ( 2 ) \times U ( 1 ) ] /Z_2^2 \equiv [ SO ( 3 ) \times U ( 1 ) \times U ( 1 ) ] /Z_2 $ for $ N_a^2\rightarrow\infty $ .
The amplitude for the $ pd\to ^3 $ { He } $ \phi $ reaction varies little for excess energies below 22 MeV and the value is consistent with that obtained from a threshold measurement .	The angular distribution of the $ K^+K^- $ decay pair shows that near threshold the $ \phi $ -- mesons are dominantly produced with polarization $ m=0 $ along the initial proton direction .
The $ p $ +Pb collision centrality is characterised by the total transverse energy measured in the Pb-going direction of the forward calorimeter .	The charged-particle pseudorapidity distributions are found to vary strongly with centrality , with an increasing asymmetry between the proton-going and Pb-going directions as the collisions become more central .
We consider scenarios corresponding to experimentally realistic systems with gauge fields induced either by rotation or by appropriately designed laser fields .	Systems of this kind are adequate to simulate quantum Hall effects in ultracold atom setups .
We provide sufficient conditions for this to be the case .	As an application we show that when P is the minimal parabolic subgroup in one of the classical simple Lie groups of real rank one or the exceptional such group , then the Fourier algebra of P coincides with the subalgebra of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra of P consisting of functions vanishing at infinity .
We examine two cases for the black hole scalar hair : a ) an exponential decaying scalar field profile and b ) an inverse power scalar field profile .	The scalar black hole solutions we present in this paper , are characterized by four functions f ( r ) , a ( r ) , phi ( r ) and V ( phi ( r ) ) .
In view of the conjugate relation existing between holonomies and fluxes , the edge length and the area of surfaces in the fiducial metric satisfy a duality condition .	As a consequence , the area operator has a discrete spectrum also in Loop Quantum Cosmology .

These particles are assumed to constitute a tiny fraction \xi_X of CDM in the Universe , with \xi_X being the same in the halo of our Galaxy and in the intergalactic space .	The elementary-particle and cosmological scenarios for these particles are briefly outlined .
However , XML-native database systems currently suffer from limited performances , both in terms of manageable data volume and response time .	Fragmentation helps address both these issues .
Canonical quantization of electromagnetic field is traditionally done using plane waves .	It is possible to formulate the quantization using other complete set of basis functions .
It is likely that the energy flows electromagnetically , rather than via a particle beam flux .	The deduced electromagnetic fields may produce particles of energy as high as $ \sim 10^ { 20 } $ eV .
The paper considers pseudo-differential boundary value control systems .	The underlying operators form an algebra D with the help of which we are able to formulate typical boundary value control problems .
For the first time , we show that unipolar fatigue does occur in antiferroelectric capacitors , confirming the predictions of a previous work [ Appl.Phys .	Lett. , 94 , 072901 ( 2009 ) ] .
Due to some Tannaka-Krein type result , they are completely determined by the combinatorics of categories of ( set theoretical ) partitions .	So far , only orthogonal easy quantum groups have been considered in order to understand quantum subgroups of the free orthogonal quantum group $ O_n^+ $ .
In addition , the optimal time split is studied for different transmission modes .	Our results reveal that , when the time split is optimized , the full-duplex relaying could substantially boost the system throughput compared to the conventional half-duplex relaying architecture for all three transmission modes .
For integers $ d \geq 2 $ and $ \epsilon = 0 $ or 1 , let $ S^ { 1 , d - 1 } ( \epsilon ) $ denote the sphere product $ S^ { 1 } \times S^ { d - 1 } $ if $ \epsilon = 0 $ and the twisted $ S^ { d - 1 } $ bundle over $ S^ { 1 } $ if $ \epsilon = 1 $ .	The main results of this paper are : ( a ) if $ d \equiv \epsilon $ ( mod 2 ) then $ S^ { 1 , d - 1 } ( \epsilon ) $ has a unique minimal triangulation using $ 2d + 3 $ vertices , and ( b ) if $ d \equiv 1 - \epsilon $ ( mod 2 ) then $ S^ { 1 , d - 1 } ( \epsilon ) $ has minimal triangulations ( not unique ) using $ 2d + 4 $ vertices .
We introduce the spin-charge separation mechanism to the quark-lepton unification models which consider the lepton number as the fourth color .	In certain finite-density systems , quarks and leptons are decomposed into spinons and chargons , which carry the spin and charge degrees of freedom respectively .
Similar resonances in di-boson , di-lepton , di-jet and $ t\bar t $ final states are instead not detected .	After discussing the properties and the compatibility of the reported signals , we study the implications on the physics beyond the Standard Model with particular emphasis on possible scalar extensions of the theory such as singlet extensions and the two Higgs doublet models .
We find that halos with the lowest concentrations are presently more clustered than those of higher concentration , the size of the effect increasing with halo mass ; this agrees with trends found in studies of lower mass halos .	The clustering dependence on other characterizations of the full mass accretion history appears weaker than the effect with concentration .
The microstates are identified with those of left and right moving superconformal string oscillations in the four directions transverse to the five-brane .	Their statistical entropy reproduces precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the rotating black hole .
We compare $ \gamma $ = 5/3 and $ \gamma $ = 4/3 polytropes disrupted in both a Newtonian potential , and a generalized potential that reproduces most relativistic effects around a Schwarzschild black hole either exactly or to excellent precision .	For the Newtonian case , we confirm the results of previous studies that the kick velocity of the surviving core is virtually independent of the ratio of the black hole to stellar mass , and is a function of the impact parameter $ \beta $ alone , reaching at most the escape velocity of the original star .
This coherent domain wall supports gapless charged excitations , and has a power law tunneling $ I-V $ with a non-integral exponent .	In proximity to a bulk lead , the edge may undergo a quantum phase transition between the Luttinger liquid phase and a metallic state when the edge confinement is sufficiently strong relative to the interaction energy scale .
We present an improved limit of $ ( 1/2 ) \beta^2 & lt ; 2.6\times10^ { -39 } $ on the Pauli Exclusion Principle .	This limit is the best to date for interactions between a system of fermions and a fermion that has not previously interacted with that given system .
Stellar magnetic fields are commonly measured on the basis of circular spectropolarimetry at high/middle resolution across the profile of metal lines .	The present sensitivity of telescopes and spectrographs makes this still an almost prohibitive method for faint stars .
However , in many physical situations , such as higher densities , this approximation unlikely suffices hence one might need models which would account for long-range correlations and multi-body interactions .	We show that the Bose liquid described by the logarithmic wave equation has a number of drastic differences from the GP one .
The second one was that beam irradiated into eyes from the forward direction which may cause certain medical accident .	The calculated results are compared with other reports .
The models are compared to Balmer Hdelta absorption strengths , U-B color data , and the number density of red sequence galaxies from z=1 to z=0 .	We find that quenched models ( which consist of constant star formation histories truncated at regularly-spaced intervals ) average to an RSG population that matches the data well , showing slow evolution in color and Balmer line strength and a rise in number density by a factor of a few after z=1 .
In particular , we make use of a channel delivering burst of molecules , emitted by mobile transmitters , which diffuse in the blood towards fixed receivers , that are attached to the vessel walls .	This communication scheme has been inspired by the real signaling between platelets and endothelial cells , the behavior of which has been investigated experimentally .
A shower is simulated at fixed steps in altitude .	At each step , daughter particles below a specified energy threshold are siphoned off and tabulated for further simulation .
There is no agreement about the identity of the physical processes that energize non-Maxwellian protons in the solar wind , but a traditional favorite has been the dissipation of ion cyclotron resonant Alfven waves .	This paper presents kinetic models of how ion cyclotron waves heat protons on their journey from the corona to interplanetary space .
The error rate has the lowest value under an appropriate applied external field for the voltage pulse duration $ { \tau } _ { pulse } $ a little longer than the half precession period .	The calculated results show that ultra-low error rate down to the order of $ 10^ { -12 } $ can be achieved for thermal stability factor { \Delta } = 50 and low damping factor material should be used for free layer to improve the switching probability .
To handle this , we propose a novel multicell framework with dynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small set of base stations .	Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring terminals only , thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework scalable .
Energy gaps , including confinement , may be easily and accurately estimated using band energies and a simple effective mass approximation , yielding excellent agreement with experimental results .	By calculating all material combinations we have identified novel and interesting material combinations , such as artificial donors , that have not been experimentally realized .
Sensor nodes are highly energy constrained devices because they are battery operated devices and due to harsh environment deployment it is impossible to change or recharge their battery .	Energy conservation and prolonging the network life are two major challenges in a sensor network .
The total mass of the model varies from $ 10^8\Msun $ to $ 10^ { 10 } \Msun $ , representing the mass scale of dwarfs to medium-mass elliptical galaxies , respectively , from deep MOND to quasi-Newtonian gravity .	We build triaxial galaxy models using the Schwarzschild technique , and evolve the systems for 200 Keplerian dynamical times ( at the typical length scale of 1.0 kpc ) .
Self-gravitating systems such as elliptical galaxies appear to have a constant specific entropy and obey a scaling law relating their potential energy to their mass .	These properties can be interpreted as due to the physical processes involved in the formation of these structures .
Environments poor in heavy elements and dust such as the SMC are thought to be dominated by photodissociation regions .	This is the lowest metallicity source where submillimeter neutral carbon emission has been detected .
With a total optical power of 400\ , mW derived from a free running diode laser and a tapered amplifier to pump the four-wave-mixing process , we achieve 2.1\ , dB intensity difference squeezing of the twin beams below the standard quantum limit , without accounting for losses .	Squeezed twin beams generated by the type of source presented here could be used as reference for the precise calibration of photodetectors .

In total 29 Seyfert 1 's , 35 Seyfert 2 's and 12 starburst galaxies , about half of the 12 micron active galaxy sample , plus 14 normal galaxies for comparison .
We explore this `` missing gas problem '' by using X-ray and optical measurements in a sample of 29 z=0.7-6.3 GRBs from both spectroscopic data and the afterglow broadband spectral energy distributions .	The low ionisation species detected in the UV are associated with the neutral interstellar medium in the GRB host galaxy , while soft X-ray absorption , which is weakly dependent on the ionisation state of the gas , provides a probe of the total column of gas along the sight line .
The ion is placed in an ultracold cloud of neutral Rb atoms in which ionic micromotion induces atomic losses and heating .	Micromotion is minimized by applying static electric offset fields such that both loss and heating are minimized .
Our central result is a formula for the generating function for the Eulerian quasisymmetric functions , which specializes to a new and surprising $ q $ -analog of a classical formula for the exponential generating function of the Eulerian polynomials .	This $ q $ -analog computes the joint distribution of excedance number and major index , the only of the four important Euler-Mahonian distributions that had not yet been computed .
A neutrino mass-mixing scheme which explains qualitatively all present evidence for neutrino mass ( the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits , LSND , and hot dark matter ) , and also makes possible heavy-element nucleosynthesis by supernovae , requires at least one light sterile neutrino .	String-inspired models with sub-millimeter extra dimensions provide naturally light sterile neutrinos , as is needed to explain the solar nu_e deficit .
Such a system can be modelled as a channel with side information ( about energy in the energy buffer ) causally known at the transmitter .	The receiver may or may not have the side information .
We propose to resolve certain ambiguities by clarifying the geometrical picture of gauge transformations on the kappa-Minkowski space-time in the twist approach .	We construct the action for the noncommutative U ( 1 ) gauge fields in a geometric way , as an integral of a maximal form .
One model of Lorentz violation in the gravitational sector is Einstein-aether theory , in which Lorentz symmetry is broken by giving a vacuum expectation value to a dynamical vector field .	In this paper we analyse the effective theory for quantised gravitational and aether perturbations .

The `` advantages '' of higher-order methods are lost rapidly for typical chaotic Hamiltonians .	We illustrate these difficulties for a useful reproducible test case , the two-dimensional one-particle cell model with specially smooth forces .
One of the shortcomings of the Black and Scholes model on option pricing is the assumption that trading of the underlying asset does not affect the price of that asset .	This assumption can be fulfilled only in perfectly liquid markets .
This true vacuum is found via the minimization of the expectation value of the perturbing hamiltonian between different vacua as prescribed by Dashen .	The procedure of finding the correct vacuum of the theory may result in the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry even if one initially demands CP invariance on the perturbation .
A by-product of our study is a much simpler method for picking up the state at the destination as compared with the one proposed previously .	We also discuss entanglement distribution through such chains and show that the quality of entanglement transition increases with the number of levels $ d $ .
Since LIGO 's sensitivity to binary neutron stars is limited to the local Universe , the area on the sky that must be searched could be reduced by weighting positions by mass , luminosity , or star formation in nearby galaxies .	Since gravitational-wave observations provide information about luminosity distance , combining the reconstructed volume with positions and redshifts of galaxies could reduce the area even more dramatically .
An unusually high percentage of these 15 galaxies possess cold gas ( HI , CO ) and optical emission lines ( Halpha ) , supporting the presence of gas cooler than 10E4 K. The 60um to 100um flux ratios imply a median dust temperature for the sample of 30 K , with a range of 23-38 K. These detections define the upper envelope of the optical to far-infrared relationship , F_fir propto F_B^0.24+/-0.08 , showing that optically bright objects are also brighter in the infrared , although with considerable dispersion .	A luminosity correlation is present with L_fir propto L_B^1.65+/-0.28 , but the dust temperature is uncorrelated with luminosity .
We show that the collapse of any two classes in $ \ { \ACZm , \TCZ , \NCOne , \L , \NL\ } $ implies the collapse of their relativizations .	Next we exhibit an oracle $ \alpha $ that makes $ \ACk ( \alpha ) $ a proper hierarchy .
The spectral analysis of seven giants in NGC 2136 and four in NGC 2137 reveals that the two clusters share very similar systemic radial velocities , namely Vrad=271.5\pm0.4 km/s ( sigma=1.0 km/s ) and Vrad=270.6\pm0.5 km/s ( sigma=0.9 km/s ) for NGC 2136 and NGC 2137 , respectively , and they have also indistinguishable abundance patterns .	The iron content is [ Fe/H ] =-0.40\pm0.01 dex ( sigma=0.03 dex ) for NGC 2136 and -0.39\pm0.01 dex ( sigma=0.01 dex ) for NGC 2137 , while the [ alpha/Fe ] ratios are roughly solar in both clusters .
This kind of desire can be answered by quantum computing .	By adopting quantum mechanics theory , it can generate a very fast computation result .
The method constructs a convolutional neural network of facial beauty prediction using a new deep cascaded fine-turning scheme with various face inputting channels , such as the original RGB face image , the detail layer image , and the lighting layer image .	With a carefully designed CNN model of deep structure , large input size and small convolutional kernels , we have achieved a high prediction correlation of 0.88 .
For fragmenting discs of all masses , we also find that prograde discs fragment across a narrower radial region .	If the cooling is slow enough that the disc enters a self-regulating gravitoturbulent regime , we find that alignment between the disc and binary planes occurs on a timescale primarily dictated by the disc thickness .
Let $ X $ be a smooth projective connected curve of genus $ g\ge 2 $ defined over an algebraically closed field $ k $ of characteristic $ p & gt ; 0 $ .	Let $ G $ be a finite group , $ P $ a Sylow $ p $ -subgroup of $ G $ and $ N_G ( P ) $ its normalizer in $ G $ .
In a previous work , we found that the 2009 and 2012 versions of the unfiltered English data set as well as the 2009 version of the English Fiction data set are all heavily saturated with scientific and medical literature , rendering them unsuitable for rigorous analysis [ Pechenick , Danforth and Dodds , PLoS ONE , 10 , e0137041 , 2015 ] .	By contrast , the 2012 version of English Fiction appeared to be uncompromised , and we use this data set to explore language dynamics for English from 1820 -- 2000 .
We study some natural connections on spaces of conformal field theories using an analytical regularization method .	The connections are based on marginal conformal field theory deformations .
Epochal dynamics , in which long periods of stasis in an evolving population are punctuated by a sudden burst of change , is a common behavior in both natural and artificial evolutionary processes .	We analyze the population dynamics for a class of fitness functions that exhibit epochal behavior using a mathematical framework developed recently .
We explore whether this scenario is viable using cosmological magneto-hydrodynamics simulations modeling the formation of the first galaxies , which are expected to form in so-called atomic cooling halos with virial temperatures $ \rm T_ { vir } \geq 10^ { 4 } $ K. As previous calculations have shown that a high Jeans resolution is needed to resolve turbulent structures and dynamo effects , our calculations employ resolutions of up to 128 cells per Jeans length .	The presence of the dynamo can be clearly confirmed for resolutions of at least 64 cells per Jeans length , while saturation occurs at approximate equipartition with turbulent energy .
One byproduct of the annihilation , muon neutrinos , may be observed by the next generation of neutrino telescopes .	Previous estimates of the annihilation rate assumed that any WIMPs from the Galactic dark halo that are captured in the Sun by elastic scattering off solar nuclei quickly reach thermal equilibrium in the Sun .
The Galactic black hole X-ray binary XTE J1650-500 entered a quiescent regime following the decline from the 2001-2002 outburst that led to its discovery .	Here we report on the first detection of its quiescent counterpart in a 36 ks observation taken in 2007 July with the Chandra X-ray Observatory .
The entropy usually decreases with the bias and may jump up when a quasi-state in the chain aligns in energy with the band edges in the electrodes .	Odd-even effect is observed due to the symmetry of the chain .

We lay out all elements of a properly defined general mass variable flavor number scheme ( GM VFNS ) that are shared by all modern formulations of the problem .	We then explain the freedom in choosing specific implementations and spell out , in particular , the current formulations of the CTEQ and MSTW groups .
We also demonstrate that shift of the Kramers point at low temperature is caused by UV assisted absorption of molecular hydrogen .	Our findings pave the way for applications of these materials in devices and present an easy scheme to tune their properties .
We show the nuclear modification factor of very low- $ p_ { \rm T } $ J/ $ \psi $ as a function of centrality .	Then we measure the J/ $ \psi $ coherent photoproduction cross section in peripheral events assuming that it is the mechanism at the origin of the measured excess .
The argument adapts the two-scale approach of Grunewald , Villani , Westdickenberg and the second author from the quadratic to the general case .	Using an asymmetric Brascamp-Lieb-type inequality for covariances , we reduce the task of deriving a uniform LSI to the convexification of the coarse-grained Hamiltonian , which follows from a general local Cram\ ' { e } r theorem .
MAXIMA maps the CMB using 16 bolometric detectors observing in spectral bands centered at 150 GHz , 230 GHz , and 410 GHz , with 10 arcminute resolution at all frequencies .	The combined receiver sensitivity to CMB anisotropy is 40 micro-K* ( sec^0.5 ) .
This is the first paper of a series , which explore modelling multi-tracer galaxy clustering ( of WL , BAO and RSD ) , using only angular ( 2D ) cross-correlations in thin redshift bins .	This involves evaluating many thousands cross-correlations , each a multidimensional integral , which is computationally demanding .
We describe how radial quantization leads to a quasi-chiral factorization of the space of fields .	The conserved charges which generate the affine Lie algebra split into two independent affine algebras on this factorized space , each with level 1 in the anti-periodic sector .
The resulting coupled differential equations are studied in detail and exemplary RG trajectories are constructed numerically .	The beta functions possess a non-Gaussian fixed point and a one-parameter family of Gaussian fixed points .
To investigate the selectivity of the sensor towards the most common constituents in air , its signal response was characterized individually for water vapor ( H2O ) , nitrogen ( N2 ) , oxygen ( O2 ) , and argon ( Ar ) .	In order to assess the humidity sensing effect for a range from 1 % relative humidity ( RH ) to 96 % RH , devices were characterized both in a vacuum chamber and in a humidity chamber at atmospheric pressure .
It is shown that all basis Schrodinger 's and Dirac 's wave functions are finite , single-valued , and continuous everywhere in spherical space model S_ { 3 } .	The used coordinates ( \rho , \phi , z ) are simply referred to Eiler 's angle variables ( \alpha , \beta , \gamma ) , parameters on the unitary group SU ( 2 ) , which permits to express the constructed wave solutions \Psi ( \rho , phi , z ) in terms of Wigner 's functions $ D_ { mm ' } ^ { j } ( \alpha , \beta , \gamma ) $ .
Recently , there has been immense interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) for civilian operations such as package delivery , aerial surveillance , and disaster response .	As a result , UAV traffic management systems are needed to support potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the air space , in order to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met .
We address the problem of minimal actuator placement in a linear system subject to an average control energy bound .	First , following the recent work of Olshevsky , we prove that this is NP-hard .
CP stars are a slowly rotating subgroup of these stars .	It is possible that they possessed long-lived accretion disks in their T Tauri phase .
We find all the spectra well fitted by Comptonization of disc blackbody photons , with very strong evidence for the presence of a nonthermal electron component in the Comptonizing plasma .	Both the energy and the power spectra in the chi state are typical to the very high/intermediate state of black-hole binaries .
Annealing at higher current density reduces the NP inhomogeneity , but we still observe some asymmetry in the e-h conduction .	We attribute this to a hole doped domain close to one of the metal contacts combined with underlying striations in the local NP .
The linear stability of a shear layer in a highly diffusive stably stratified atmosphere has been investigated .	This study completes and extends previous works by Dudis ( 1974 ) and Jones ( 1977 ) .
When the state space of a system is finite , the ordinary notion of bisimilarity can be computed via the well-known partition refinement algorithm , but unfortunately , this algorithm does not work for ccp bisimilarity .	In this paper , we propose a variation of the partition refinement algorithm for verifying ccp bisimilarity .
It can be explained by a radius dependent decline in B-band luminosity with time .	Assuming a linear shift in M_B with z , we use a maximum likelihood method to quantify the evolution .

The analytic solution of the continuous model suggests important deficiencies in each .	The continuous model provides very valuable insights into how one might design such load control system and design the power markets they interact with .
The irregular stellar brightness variations are shown to be caused by extinction in a dusty disk wind at a distance of about 0.2 AU from the star .	We suppose , that variations of the circumstellar extinction results from cyclic rearrangements of the stellar magnetosphere and coronal mass ejections , which affect the dusty disk wind near the inner boundary of the circumstellar disk .
Clearwood specimens from 3 gymnosperms ( Pinus sylvestris L. , Pinus pinaster Ait. , Pinus insignis Dougl . )	and 4 angiosperms ( Populus spp. , Quercus pyrenaica Willd. , Entandrophragma cylindricum Sprague , Chlorophora excelsa Benth .

For cool main-sequence stars , gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellar ages from measured rotation pe- riods and HR Diagram positions .	These relations have few calibrators with known ages for old , long rotation period stars .
Beyond the high sensitivity images for all 13 radio galaxies , we present also a detailed spectral analysis for 7 of them .	We found a variety of morphologies and linear sizes , as typical for radio galaxies in the radio power range sampled here ( low to intermediate power radio galaxies ) .
As an illustration we present a new Lie-algebraic method to compute frequency-space two-point functions for charged scalar operators of CFT $ _ { 1 } $ dual to AdS $ _ { 2 } $ black hole with constant background electric field .	Our method is based on the real-time prescription of AdS/CFT correspondence , Euclideanization of AdS $ _ { 2 } $ black hole and projective unitary representations of the Lie algebra $ \mathfrak { sl } ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) \oplus \mathfrak { sl } ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) $ .

Inside the image it is difficult to distinguish shifts from horizontal structures but emission beyond the image edge can be unambiguously identified as a line shift in several lines separated from others on their blue or red side by more than the width of the spectrometer slit ( 40 pixels ) .	In the blue wing of He II , we find a large number of events with properties ( size and lifetime ) similar to the well-studied explosive events seen in the ultraviolet spectral range .
In this article , we focus on a very special class of foliations with complex leaves whose diffeomorphism type is fixed .	They have a unique compact leaf and the noncompact leaves all accumulate onto it .
To achieve this issue , this paper proposes an intelligent network selection strategy which combines two multi attribute decision making ( MADM ) methods such as analytic network process ( ANP ) and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution ( TOPSIS ) method .	The ANP method is used to find the differentiate weights of available networks by considering each criterion and the TOPSIS method is applied to rank the alternatives .
Easily computable , well-localized bases , with `` small-footprint '' basis elements - i.e. , elements using only a small number of kernels -- have been unavailable .	Working on $ \sphere $ , with focus on the restricted surface spline kernels ( e.g.the thin-plate splines restricted to the sphere ) , we construct easily computable , spatially well-localized , small-footprint , robust bases for the associated kernel spaces .
We investigate the impact of unparticle physics on the annihilation of relic neutrinos with the neutrinos identified as primary source of ultra high energy ( UHE ) cosmic ray events , producing a cascade of photons and charged particles .	We compute the contribution of the unparticle exchange to the cross-sections $ \nu \bar\nu\to\gamma \gamma $ and $ \nu \bar\nu\to f \bar f $ scattering .
In this paper , we consider the problem of synthesizing low-complexity controllers for incrementally stable switched systems .	For that purpose , we establish a new approximation result for the computation of symbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to a given switched system .
Analysing this light curve , we found the physical parameters of the components .	The light-curve analysis indicates that the possible mass ratio of the system is 0.35 .
For the first time an existence of high Q-factor trapped mode resonances are revealed in these structures .	The main difference of studied structure in contrast to the planar structure with a single dielectric bar in the unit cell is appearing of a great red shift of a trapped mode resonant wavelength .
We run 2.5D and 3D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the accretion of a fat disk .	We study how the accretion process changes by changing the values of the parameters of our model .
Now we need more tools to help to obtain physics results from the analysis of distributed simulated and experimental data .	Developments in Grid architectures gave many examples how distributed computing facilities can be organized to meet physics analysis needs .
We identify the Weyl-invariant extended configuration space of the spin dynamical model , which turns out to be the N-dimensional generalization of a rhombic dodecahedron .	This is in fact one of the reasons underlying the greater complexity of the models studied in this paper in comparison with both their rational and BC_N counterparts .
The domain $ | z| & lt ; ( e\tau ) ^ { -1 } $ of convergence of Mayer series is given by the envelop of characteristic intersections .	For non negative potentials we derive an explicit solution in terms of the Lambert $ W $ -- function which is related to the exponential generating function $ T $ of rooted trees as $ T ( x ) =-W ( -x ) $ .
Measurement of the gravitational distortion of images of distant galaxies is rapidly becoming established as a powerful probe of the dark mass distribution in clusters of galaxies .	With the advent of large mosaics of CCD 's these methods should provide a composite total mass profile for galaxy haloes and also measure the power spectrum of mass fluctuations on supercluster scales .
The monitor operates in the highly radioactive environment in proximity to the T2K target .	It uses optical transition radiation , the light emitted from a thin metallic foil when the charged beam passes through it , to form a 2D image of a 30 GeV proton beam .
Three types of closed classical orbits are identified for the photoelectron motion in a strong single-cycle terahertz pulse , and their connections with the oscillatory photodetachment rate are established quantitatively by generalizing the standard closed-orbit theory to a time-dependent form .	By comparing the negative hydrogen and fluorine ions , both the in-phase and antiphase oscillations can be observed , depending on a simple geometry of the contributed closed classical orbits .
It is then shown how Zadeh 's approximate reasoning theory provides a smart way to implement symbolic sensors .	Finally , since the symbolic sensor is a general component , a functional adaptation to the measurement context is proposed .
We consider the adiabatic demagnetization in the rotating reference frame ( ADRF ) of a system of dipolar coupled nuclear spins $ s=1/2 $ in the external magnetic field .	The demagnetization starts with the offset of the external magnetic field ( in frequency units ) from the Larmor frequency being several times greater than the local dipolar field .
The solution space is divided into four different regions by three critical surfaces .	For $ \Lambda & lt ; 0 $ , two surfaces separate regions of black hole solutions and solutions with naked singularities , while the other surface separates regions of open and closed spaces .
Nielsen and T. Osborne , Phys.Rev .	A 65 , 062312 ( 2002 ) ] is generalized to the case of mixed states , in a way that maintains its operational interpretation .
We report on the coherent quantum state transfer from a two-level atomic system to a single photon .	Entanglement between a single photon ( signal ) and a two-component ensemble of cold rubidium atoms is used to project the quantum memory element ( the atomic ensemble ) onto any desired state by measuring the signal in a suitable basis .
Fixing the charge density , possible phase transitions as level crossings detected in a value of the reduced density functional happen only at discrete points along the $ \lambda $ axis .	If the density is $ v $ -representable also for $ \lambda & lt ; 1 $ , accumulation of phase transition points is forbidden when $ \lambda\rightarrow 1 $ .
Next we estimate the branching ratios for transitions to accessible excited nuclear levels .	Finally we estimate the event rates leading to the atom ionization and subsequent detection of the outgoing electrons .
If the manifold is closed , then the signature $ ( - , + , + ) $ is not globally possible if it is of the form $ -\mu , f , f $ , with $ \mu $ a positive constant and $ f $ a smooth function that never takes the values $ 0 , -\mu $ ( hence this also applies to the signature $ ( - , - , - ) $ ) .	In the scalar flat and complete case , the signature $ ( 0 , + , - ) $ is not globally possible if the eigenvalues are constants and the zero eigenspace is spanned by a unit length vector field with geodesic flow ; if the manifold is closed and this vector field is also divergence-free , then $ ( 0 , + , - ) $ is not possible even if the nonzero eigenvalues are not constant .
We use the reduced density matrix approach together with a simple Born-Markov approximation to calculate the heat current in the steady state .	We consider different kinds of reservoirs and show that the nature of the reservoir plays a very important role in determining the thermal characteristics of the device .
A great challenge is to reach the required low entropy to observe antiferromagnetic spin correlations beyond nearest neighbors , for which quantum gas microscopes are ideal .	Here we report on the direct , single-site resolved detection of antiferromagnetic correlations extending up to three sites in spin-1/2 Hubbard chains , which requires an entropy well below s= ln ( 2 ) .
We consider n identically prepared qubits and study the asymptotic properties of the joint state \rho^ { \otimes n } .	We show that for all individual states \rho situated in a local neighborhood of size 1/\sqrt { n } of a fixed state \rho^0 , the joint state converges to a displaced thermal equilibrium state of a quantum harmonic oscillator .
In the past , the features of a user interface were limited by those available in the existing graphical widgets it used .	Now , improvements in processor speed have fostered the emergence of interpreted languages , in which the appropriate method to render a given data object can be loaded at runtime .
For a given graph $ F $ we consider the family of ( finite ) graphs $ G $ with the Ramsey property for $ F $ , that is the set of such graphs $ G $ with the property that every two-colouring of the edges of $ G $ yields a monochromatic copy of $ F $ .	For $ F $ being a triangle Friedgut , R\ '' odl , Ruci\'nski , and Tetali ( 2004 ) established the sharp threshold for the Ramsey property in random graphs .
In the case of a sharp vacuum-plasma boundary , the radiation is generated symmetrically at the plasma entrance and exit , and its properties are independent of plasma density when the density exceeds a characteristic value determined by the product of the plasma frequency and the laser pulse duration .	For a diffuse vacuum-plasma boundary , the emission from the plasma entrance and exit is asymmetric : increasing and decreasing density ramps enhance and diminish the radiated energy respectively .
With increasing Pt doping the critical temperature ( Tc ) monotonically decreases from 15.85K and saturates to a value ~13K for x & gt ; 0.14 .	However , unlike conventional s-wave superconductors , the upper critical field ( HC2 ) along both crystallographic directions a and c decreases with increasing Pt doping .
Unlike the traditional `` collapsar '' model , an evolved FeCO core with a companion neutron star ( NS ) in a tight binary system is considered as the progenitor .	This special class of sources , here named `` binary driven hypernovae '' ( BdHNe ) , presents a composite sequence composed of four different episodes [ ... ] .
The spatial awareness is established with a motion tracking system .	The information about position of tablets is received by a server .

Velocity oscillations in sunspot umbrae have been measured simultaneously in two spectral lines : the photospheric Silicon I 10827 A line and the chromospheric Helium I 10830 A multiplet .	From the full Stokes inversion of temporal series of spectropolarimetric observations we retrieved , among other parameters , the line of sight velocity temporal variations at photospheric and chromospheric heights .
The resulting frequency deviation is shown to be less than $ 5.7 $ MHz ( rms $ 1.6 $ MHz ) in the whole wavelength interval $ 750 - 795 $ nm .	Wide tuning of a stabilized laser at this exceptional precision is demonstrated .
This is achieved by extending a well-known stable-marriage problem ( SMP ) and demonstrating how matches between code fragments of different files can be expressed .	A prototype of the proposed approach is provided using a proper scenario , which shows a noticeable improvement in several features of clone detection such as scalability and accuracy .
The precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important , due to the precision that BOSS can now reach : even using as many as 600 mock catalogues to estimate covariance of 2-point clustering measurements can still lead to an increase in the errors of ~20 % , depending on how the cosmological parameters of interest are measured .	In this paper we extend previous work on this contribution to the error budget , deriving formulae for errors measured by integrating over the likelihood , and to the distribution of recovered best-fit parameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix .
Principal component analysis ( PCA ) is a key statistical technique for multivariate data analysis .	For large data sets the common approach to PCA computation is based on the standard NIPALS-PCA algorithm , which unfortunately suffers from loss of orthogonality , and therefore its applicability is usually limited to the estimation of the first few components .

An effective zero-thickness model is constructed based on a Robin-type boundary condition for the electric potential at the membrane , originally developed for electrochemical systems .	Within such a framework , corrections to the elastic moduli of the membrane are obtained , which arise from charge accumulation in the Debye layers due to capacitive effects and electric currents through the membrane and can lead to an undulation instability of the membrane .
The magnetic field gradient introduces spatially dependent qubit transition frequencies and a type of spin-spin interaction between qubits .	Single and multi-qubit manipulation is achieved via resonant microwave pulses as in liquid-NMR quantum computation while the qubit readout and reset is achieved through trapped-ion fluorescence shelving techniques .

Using the AMR code AstroBEAR , we have carried out high resolution 3D simulations that follow a stellar mass secondary in the co-rotating frame as it orbits a wind producing AGB primary .
The problem of sweeping points by orthogonal sweeps was first studied in [ 2 ] .	Here we consider the following \emph { slanted } variant of sweeping recently introduced in [ 1 ] : In a single sweep , the sweep-line is placed at a start position somewhere in the plane , then moved continuously according to a sweep vector $ \vec v $ ( not necessarily orthogonal to the sweep-line ) to another parallel end position , and then lifted from the plane .
We use the projection operator , the smoothing effect of the positive definite self-adjoint operator and linear functionals of the noise in Fourier space to obtain higher order approximations .	We consider noise that is white in time and either in $ H^1 $ or $ H^2 $ in space and give convergence proofs in the mean square $ L^ { 2 } $ norm for a diffusion reaction equation and in mean square $ H^ { 1 } $ norm in the presence of an advection term .
We report a numerical simulation for the phase diagram of a simple two dimensional model , similar to one proposed by Noro and Frenkel [ J. Chem.Phys .	\textbf { 114 } , 2477 ( 2001 ) ] for membrane proteins , but one that includes the role of the solvent .
These data provide evidence for dust grain growth to at least millimeter-sizes for the first time in a high-mass star forming region .	The obtained range in sub-mm/mm spectral index , namely 1.5-3.2 , indicates that for disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster ( projected distance from the cluster center between about 0.4 pc and 1.5 pc ) grain growth to mm sizes occurs in the same manner as disks in regions where only low-mass stars form .
The non-equilibrium dynamics shows several regimes : irreversible adsorption on short time scales , an intermediate plateau followed by a power-law regime and finally exponential relaxation towards equilibrium .	In all four regimes we give analytical solutions .
An external comparison of the Tycho-2 astrometry is presented here using the first U.S .	Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog ( UCAC1 ) .

We discuss methods currently in use for determining the significance of peaks in the periodograms of time series .	We discuss some general methods for constructing significance tests , false alarm probability functions , and the role played in these by independent random variables and by empirical and theoretical cumulative distribution functions .
In practice , the selection of the affinity matrix exhibits a tremendous impact on the unsupervised learning .	While much success of affinity learning has been achieved in recent years , some issues such as noise reduction remain to be addressed .
Although inverse limits with factor spaces indexed by the positive integers are most commonly studied , Ingram and Mahavier have defined inverse limits with set-valued functions broadly enough for any directed index set to be used .	In this paper , we investigate generalized inverse limits whose factor spaces are indexed by totally ordered sets .
However , little work has been done in the robust coding of encrypted images .	The existing results in these two individual research areas can not be combined directly for the robust coding of encrypted images .
In this case , our construction yields the usual generalized Segal -- Bargmann transform of Hall .	We show that the infinite-dimensional family of Hamiltonian flows can also be understood in terms of Thiemann 's `` complexifier '' method ( which generalizes the construction of adapted complex structures ) .
Simulations and models predict increased X-ray and radio variability resulting from increased accretion driven by drag on an atmosphere of hot , X-ray emitting gas surrounding Sgr A* .

Conventional quantum theory relies crucially on `` measurements '' to convert unrealized quantum potentialities into physical outcomes that can be assigned probabilities .	In the early universe and other physical contexts in which there are no observers or measuring apparatus ( or indeed , in any closed quantum system ) , what criteria determine which alternative outcomes may be realized and what their probabilities are ?
The concept of line tension is , however , of limited applicability , in view of a qualitatively different relaxation response of the contact line , compared to a two-dimensional curve .	Both the analogy and qualitative distinction extend to a non-equilibrium situation arising due to coupling with reversible substrate modification .
We then proceed to study when the induction functor $ -\otimes_A\cC $ is also the left adjoint of the forgetful functor .	This question is closely related to the problem when $ A\to { } _A { \rm Hom } ( \cC , A ) $ is a Frobenius extension .
In this paper we investigate the relation between the multiplicities of split abelian chief factors of finite-dimensional Lie algebras and first degree cohomology .	In particular , we obtain a characterization of modular solvable Lie algebras in terms of the vanishing of first degree cohomology or in terms of the multiplicities of split abelian chief factors .
We find that our model well reproduces distributions of fundamental properties of DLA galaxies such as luminosities , column densities , impact parameters obtained by optical and near-infrared imagings .	Our results suggest that DLA systems primarily consist of low luminosity galaxies with small impact parameters ( typical radius about 3 kpc , surface brightness from 22 to 27 mag arcsec^ { -2 } ) similar to low surface brightness ( LSB ) galaxies .
We show that the PHC problem is in P even when a closed walk is allowed to use an edge at most z=4 times , by considering a T-join , which is a generalization of matching .	On the other hand , the PHC problem is NP-complete when z=3 .
Another possible reason is the problem of the SPH method , which might give too much `` protection '' to cold clumps because of the unphysical surface tension induced at contact discontinuities .	In this paper , we apply the density independent formulation of SPH ( DISPH ) , which can handle contact discontinuities accurately , to simulations of a cluster of galaxies , and compare the results with those with the standard SPH .
The tree amplitudes are then used to build one-loop amplitudes using an integer dimension on-shell cut method .	As a first application we considered only three and four gluon vertices calculating the pure gluonic one-loop amplitudes for arbitrary external helicity or polarization states .
In [ arXiv:1501.01498 ] , we introduced a multitype version of this dynamics and proved that the associated empirical cumulative distribution functions converge to the viscosity solution , in the sense of Bianchini and Bres-san [ Ann.of Math .	( 2 ) , 2005 ] , of one-dimensional diagonal hyperbolic systems with monotonic initial data of arbitrary finite variation .
The MAGIC-I telescope started to follow-up GCN alerts in the beginning of 2005 .	Since then , more than 50 GRB candidates were observed .
Some of them are known for decades , some are more recent .	They relate to stability and to rare events .
In this study , we reported on a research on the background correction strategies within this technique , especially we introduced a new phase unwrapping solution for one conventional background correction method , the key point of this new solution is changing the initial phase of each pixel by a cyclic shift operation on the raw images collected in phase stepping scan .	Experimental result and numerical analysis showed that the new phase unwrapping algorithm could successfully subtract contribution of the system 's background without error .

Such a particle could make up all the dark matter , but it is not clear how it was produced in the early Universe .	In this letter we show that it is possible to discriminate between different production mechanisms with present-day astronomical data .
The solar irradiance in the Extreme Ultraviolet ( EUV ) spectral bands has been observed with a 15 sec cadence by the SOHO Solar EUV Monitor ( SEM ) since 1995 .	During remarkably intense solar flares the SEM EUV measurements are saturated in the central ( zero ) order channel ( 0.1 -- 50.0 nm ) by the flare soft X-ray and EUV flux .
The result allows one to construct renormalization group equations for the conductance as a function of voltage ( or temperature , wire length ) .	There are two fixed points at which the conductance follows a power law in terms of a scaling variable $ \Lambda $ , which equals the bias voltage $ V $ , if $ V $ is the largest energy scale compared to temperature $ T $ and inverse wire length $ L^ { -1 } $ , and interpolates between these quantities in the crossover regimes .
Human activities comprise several sub-activities performed in a sequence and involve interactions with various objects .	This makes reasoning about the object affordances a central task for activity recognition .
In Evans function computations of the spectra of asymptotically constant-coefficient linear operators , a basic issue is the efficient and numerically stable computation of subspaces evolving according to the associated eigenvalue ODE .	For small systems , a fast , shooting algorithm may be obtained by representing subspaces as single exterior products \cite { AS , Br.1 , Br.2 , BrZ , BDG } .
This leads to the absence of a Chern-Simons term in the effective theory of the CFL .	We argue here that instead a Berry curvature should be enclosed by the fermi surface of composite fermions , with the total Berry phase fixed by the filling fraction $ \phi_B=-2\pi\nu $ .

The preferential heating is more pronounced in short nanotubes ( 2 um ) than in long nanotubes ( 5 um ) .	These results are understood in terms of the decay and thermalization of non-equilibrium phonons , revealing the mechanism of thermal transport in these devices .
The mystery of dark energy suggests that there is new gravitational physics on long length scales .	Yet light degrees of freedom in gravity are strictly limited by Solar System observations .
Epitaxial thin films of Bi2FeCrO6 have been synthesized by pulsed laser deposition on SrRuO3 on ( 100 ) - and ( 111 ) -oriented SrTiO3 substrates .	Detailed X-ray diffraction and cross-section transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed a double perovskite crystal structure of the Bi2FeCrO6 epitaxial films very similar to that of BiFeO3 along with a particularly noteworthy Fe3+/Cr3+ cation ordering along the [ 111 ] direction .
In this paper we review the modeling of the Local Bubble ( LB ) with special emphasis on the progress we have made since the last major conference `` The Local Bubble and Beyond ( I ) '' held in Garching in 1997 .	Since then new insight was gained into the possible origin of the LB , with a moving group crossing its volume during the last 10 - 15 Myr being most likely responsible for creating a local cavity filled with hot recombining gas .
We show that boundary states in the generic on-shell background satisfy a universal nonlinear equation of closed string field theory .	It generalizes our previous claim for the flat background .
While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop , most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature .	To rectify this we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010 .
The sparsity pattern of the output matrix is automatically determined or can be given as input .	If the input matrix belongs to a common matrix subspace , we prove that the computed sparse matrix belongs to the same subspace .
We investigate the crystallization mechanism of a single , flexible homopolymer chain with short range attractions .	For a sufficiently narrow attractive well , the system undergoes a first-order like freezing transition from an expanded disordered coil to a compact crystalline state .
They are listed in order of importance in this abstract and discussed more in the text of the talk .	First , solar neutrinos have been detected in four experiments with approximately the energies and fluxes predicted by the standard solar model , confirming the hypothesis that the energy source for the solar luminosity is the fusion of light elements .
Results : It is shown that , in the presence of core-shifts , phase and group-delay astrometry measurements yield different positions .	For a core displacement from the jet base parametrized by Delta x ( lambda ) = k lambda^beta group delays measure a `` reduced '' core-shift of ( 1-beta ) Delta x ( lambda ) .

We present a new framework for allowing spinal cord injured persons to control powered wheelchairs through signals derived from their residual mobility .	The main novelty of this approach lies in substituting the more common joystick controllers of powered wheelchairs with a sensor shirt .
We propose a new model of permanent monogamous pair formation in zoological populations comprised of k types of females and males , which unifies and generalizes the encounter-mating models of Gimelfarb ( 1988 ) .	In our model , animals randomly encounter members of the opposite sex at their so-called firing times to form temporary pairs which then become permanent if mating happens .
Next , we go on to investigate whether the above restriction of `` rank two '' can be eliminated ; i.e. , is cyclic symmetry alone sufficient to guarantee the existence of a squash operator ?	The motivation behind this question is that , if this were true , it would imply that one could realize a device-independent and unconditionally secure quantum key distribution protocol .
After simulating the combined residual curve by calculating accurately the mismodeling of the more effective tidal perturbations , it has been found that , while the solid tides affect the recovery of mu at a level always well below 1 % , for the ocean tides and the other long-period signals Delta mu depends strongly on the observational period and the noise level : Delta mu ( tides ) amounts to almost 2 % after 7 years .	The aliasing effect of K1 l=3 p=1 tide and SRP ( 4241 ) solar radiation pressure harmonic , with periods longer than 4 years , on the perigee of LAGEOS II yield to a maximum systematic uncertainty on $ \m_ { LT } $ of less than 4 % over different observational periods .
We consider the Ginzburg-Landau functional defined over a bounded and smooth three dimensional domain .	Supposing that the magnetic field is comparable with the second critical field and that the Ginzburg-Landau parameter is large , we determine a sharp asymptotic estimate of the minimizing energy .

We present results from N-body simulations of multi-planetary systems that resemble those observed by Kepler .	We add both smooth ( Type I/II ) and stochastic migration forces .
This locality condition expresses the idea that what an experimenter freely chooses to measure in one spacetime region can have no effect of any kind in a second region situated spacelike relative to the first .	The experimental results conform closely to the predictions of quantum theory in such cases , but the most reasonable conclusion to draw is not that locality fails , but rather that the hidden-variable assumption is false .
Radio AGN in the nearby Universe are more likely to be found in galaxies with early-type morphology , the detection rate in spiral or late-type galaxies ( LTGs ) being around an order of magnitude lower .	We combine the mJy Imaging VLBA Exploration at 20cm ( mJIVE-20 ) survey with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) , to study the relatively rare population of AGN in LTGs that have nuclear radio luminosities similar to that in their early-type counterparts .
A significant reinforcement of the intermolecular hydrogen-bond ( H-bond ) , also supported by the observed frequency shifts of the vibration modes , is attributed to the polarization of the donor molecule when bonded to the Ru atoms in the substrate .	This result is further confirmed by our calculations for a water dimer interacting with a small Ru cluster , which clearly show that the observed effect does not depend critically on fine structural details and/or the presence of co-adsorbates .
All four systems were found from their helium emission lines in low-resolution spectra taken on the Hale telescope at Palomar , and the Nordic Optical Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma .

Below the critical pressure parallel to the c-axis , the metamagnetic field appears to hardly change .	We have also found that uniaxial pressures perpendicular to the c-axis , in contrast , do not induce ferromagnetism , but shift the metamagnetic field to higher fields .
Eleftheriou and Peterzil conjectured that every definably generated abelian connected group G in this category is a cover of a definable group .	We prove that this is the case under a natural convexity assumption inspired by the same authors , which in fact gives a necessary and sufficient condition .
We show an existence result for affine harmonic maps in a given homotopy class when the target has non positive sectional curvature and some global non triviality condition is met .	An example shows that such a condition is necessary .

For some viable $ f ( R ) $ models containing the Starobinsky , Hu-Sawicki , Exponential , Tsujikawa and AB models , we first explore numerically the evolution of some cosmological parameters like the Hubble parameter , the Ricci scalar , the deceleration parameter , the density parameters and the equation of state parameters .	Then , we examine the validity of GSL and obtain the growth factor of structure formation .
We show that the height , duration , area , and energy of peaks have power law distributions with exponents falling close to the corresponding values of pure ductile fracture .	For single peaks a power law correlation of the height and area with the width is evidenced , however , the mixed nature of fracture gives rise to a crossover between two regimes of different exponents .
However , misconceptions of students impede the learning process .	Research conducted by our research group shows that problematic perceptions regarding interference optics still exist with physics students at the intermediate level and on occasion are even sustained by illustrations in school books .
In their 'modern ' version , our results rely on new quantities , which we introduce and call the S and B 'modapprox ' density operators , which , we claim , will , with high probability , give a close approximation to the reduced density operator for the system and energy bath when the total state of system plus energy bath is a random pure state with energy in a narrow range .	In Part 2 we clarify the meaning of these modapprox density operators and give arguments for our claim .
The tetrahedral symmetry leads to the four-fold degeneracies in the nucleonic spectra ; it does not preserve the parity .	The octahedral symmetry leads to the four-fold degeneracies in the nucleonic spectra as well but it does preserve the parity .

Heating , Ventilation and Air Conditioning ( HVAC ) systems consume almost half of the total energy use of commercial buildings .	To optimize HVAC energy usage , it is important to understand the energy consumption of individual HVAC components at fine granularities .
We find that the near-neighbor atomic motions are strongly correlated , and that the extent of this correlation depends both on the interatomic interactions and crystal structure .	These results suggest that proper account of the lattice vibrational effects on the PDF peak width is important in extracting information on static disorder in a disordered system such as an alloy .
In construction of the weights , only an implicit dependence on topologically connected internal coordinates is present .	This new approach is competitive with the best internal coordinate geometry optimization algorithms in the literature and works well for large biological problems with complicated hydrogen bond networks and ligand binding motifs .

We probe the physical mechanism behind the known phenomenon of power synchronization of two diode lasers that are mutually coupled via their delayed optical fields .	In a diode laser , the amplitude and the phase of the optical field are coupled by the so-called linewidth enhancement factor , $ \alpha $ .
Motivated by recent proposals to realize Majorana bound states in chains and arrays of magnetic atoms deposited on top of a superconductor , we study the topological properties of various chain structures , ladders and two-dimensional arrangements exhibiting magnetic helices .	We show that magnetic domain walls where the chirality of a magnetic helix is inverted support two protected Majorana states giving rise to a tunneling conductance peak twice the height of a single Majorana state .
For the screening of the Coulomb interaction W we tested three different plasmon-pole dielectric function models , and showed that the accuracy of the quasiparticle energies is not sensitive to the the details of these models .	We have then applied this new method to compute the quasiparticle band structure of some small , medium and large-band-gap semiconductors : Si , GaAs , AlAs , InP , SiMg $ _2 $ , C and ( insulator ) LiCl .
The key theorem shows that the numerator of the sum of two rational tangles [ P/Q ] and [ R/S ] is unknotted if and only if PS + QR has absolute value equal to 1 .	The paper uses these results in studying processive DNA recombination , finding minimal size unknot diagrams , generalizing to collapses to knots as well as to unknots , and in finding unknots with arbirarily high complexity .
Recent estimates of cosmological parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) anisotropies are based on the assumption that we know the precise amount of energy density in relativistic particles in the universe , $ \omega_ { rel } $ , at all times .	There are , however , many possible mechanisms that can undermine this assumption .
A development period of almost 10 years has resulted in pixel detector modules which can stand the extreme rate and timing requirements as well as the very harsh radiation environment at the LHC for its full life time and without severe compromises in performance .	From these developments a number of different applications have spun off , most notably for biomedical imaging .
No linear polarization has been detected yet at other wavelengths .	Given that radiation from this source is produced on progressively smaller spatial scales with increasing frequency , the mm/Sub-mm bump apparently arises within a mere handful of Schwarzschild radii of the black hole .

Three-body systems with large scattering length display universal phenomena associated with a discrete scaling symmetry .	These phenomena include resonant enhancement of three-body loss rates when an Efimov three-body resonance is at the scattering threshold .
Inspired by work in quantum information theory , we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of question .	The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility of combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered commutative monoids .
We thus assume that the position of the gravitational-wave source in the sky is known , but we do not assume that the wave 's frequency and its derivatives are a priori known .	In the construction we employ simplified model of the signal with constant amplitude and phase which is a polynomial function of time .
It says that any program that is cleverer than a human being , is acknowledged as Artificial Intelligence .	The second definition is formal because it avoids reference to the concept of human being .

Define an exponentially weighted expectation by E^t ( f ) = E ( e^ { tX } f ) /E ( e^ { tX } ) for admissible values of the parameter t. Denote the weighted expectation of X itself by r ( t ) = E^t ( X ) , with inverse function t ( r ) .	We prove that for a convex function f the expectation E^ { t ( r ) } ( f ) is a convex function of the parameter r. Along the way we develop correlation inequalities for convex functions .
We investigate the violation of time reversal invariance in the decay of the free neutron in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ( MSSM ) .	The coefficient of the triple product of the neutron spin and the momenta of electron and neutrino , the so called D parameter , is computed at one loop order including all diagrams .
An enhanced near-side angular correlation across $ |\Delta\eta| & gt ; $ 2.75 is observed in $ d $ $ + $ Au collisions .	Using the event plane method applied to the Au-going energy distribution , we extract the anisotropy strength $ v_2 $ for inclusive charged hadrons at midrapidity up to $ p_T=4.5 $ GeV/ $ c $ .
In this approach , a complex environment described by a spectral function is mapped into a finite set of discretized states with an appropriate coupling to the system of interest .	The finite set of system plus environment degrees of freedom are then explicitly followed in time leading to a quasi-exact description .
Vacuum stability and metastability imply lower limits on the mass of the higgs boson in the Standard Model ( SM ) .	In contrast , we present an improved calculation of an upper limit on the lightest higgs mass in supersymmetric ( susy ) models , by summing to all orders in perturbation theory the leading and next -- to -- leading logarithms with a renormalization group equation technique , and by including finite two-loop QCD corrections.The improvement lowers the Minimal Susy Standard Model ( MSSM ) upper limit by about 10 GeV .
Models based on Huxley 1957 theory ascertain relations between chemical reactions rate constants and energies of crossbridge conformations .	Nevertheless , understand in the framework of thermodynamics how myosin motor works in principle is impossible : it is smoothly heated device cyclically producing mechanical work ( second law ) .
In particular we aim at clarifying whether and in which conditions the proposed algorithm , and more generally any FV algorithm , can be taken as the method of choice in fluid-dynamics LB simulations .	For this reason the comparative analysis is further extended to the case of realistic flows , in particular thermally driven flows in turbulent conditions .
One candidate from this category of waveforms is pulse shaped OFDM , which follows the idea of subcarrier filtering and fully maintain the compatibility of CP-OFDM .	Exploiting pulse shape as an additional degree of freedom in OFDM systems can be beneficially used to improve the systems robustness against time and frequency distortions and to efficiently facilitate spectrum sharing or fragmented spectrum access .
We propose a new algorithm that deals with outliers .	We handle aberrant functional values with a method inspired from the k-nearest neighbors regression and the local median filtering , while the geometric outliers are handled using the distance to a measure .
Most important , the unusually strong magnetic anisotropy of the singlet-triplet relaxation can be controlled by detuning switching the principal anisotropy axes : a protected state becomes unprotected upon detuning , and vice versa .	It is also established that nuclear spins can dominate spin relaxation for unpolarized triplets even at high magnetic fields , contrary to common belief .
We demonstrate that the 1D cylindrical version of the Grad-Shafranov equation is more rich than classical self-similar ones , and more suitable for the astrophysical jets we observe .	In particular , it allows us to describe the central ( and , hence , the most energetic ) part of the flow .
Strange stars are very likely to have atmospheres with typical mass of $ \sim 5\times 10^ { -15 } M_\odot $ but bare polar caps almost throughout their lifetimes , if they are produced during supernova explosions .	A direct consequence of the bare polar cap is that the binding energies of both positively and negatively charged particles at the bare quark surface are nearly infinity , so that the vacuum polar gap sparking scenario as proposed by Ruderman & amp ; Sutherland should operate above the cap , regardless of the sense of the magnetic pole with respect to the rotational pole .
At what moment the evolution becomes hydrodynamic and is there any universality in the hydrodynamic flow ?	To answer these questions we briefly discuss various versions of hydrodynamics and their applicability conditions .
In contrast to the similar representations in the literature terms of order $ ~O ( \alpha_ { s } ^ { 2 } ) ~ $ do not attend in our expressions for the nucleon structure functions taken in the next to leading logarithmic approximation .	This result is generelized for any order in $ ~\alpha_ { s } ~ $ beyond the LLA .

The data following the peak of GW150914 are consistent with the least-damped quasi-normal-mode inferred from the mass and spin of the remnant black hole .	By using waveform models that allow for parameterized general-relativity violations during the inspiral and merger phases , we perform quantitative tests on the gravitational-wave phase in the dynamical regime and , bound , for the first time several high-order post-Newtonian coefficients .
Firstly , for a groupoid it is shown that the notions of strength of convergence in the orbit space and measure-theoretic accumulation along the orbits are equivalent ways of realising multiplicity numbers associated to a sequence of induced representations of the groupoid C*-algebra .	Examples of directed graphs are given , showing how to determine the multiplicity numbers associated to various sequences of induced representations of the directed graph C*-algebras .
In this work , dispersion relations of $ \pi^0 $ and $ \pi^ { \pm } $ have been studied in vacuum in the limit of weak external magnetic field using a phenomenological pion-nucleon $ ( \pi N ) $ Lagrangian .	For our purpose , we have calculated the results up to one loop order in self energy diagrams with the pseudoscalar $ ( PS ) $ and pseudovector $ ( PV ) $ pion-nucleon interactions .
Businesses today are facing a lot of challenges in terms of competition and they have to be in the lead by strengthening their research and development strategies with the aid of cutting edge technologies .	Hence marketing intelligence is now a key to the success of any business in today 's rapidly changing business environment .
Secondly , we find evidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radio luminosity of AGN , but not with black-hole mass .	This is shown first by dividing the AGN into their classical AGN types , where we see more significant over-densities in the fields of the radio-loud AGN .
The main theorem in this paper states that if $ p ( x_1 , ... , x_n ) $ is a homogeneous { \bf H-Stable } polynomial of degree $ n $ with nonnegative coefficients ; $ deg_ { p } ( i ) $ is the maximum degree of the variable $ x_i $ , $ C_i = \min ( deg_ { p } ( i ) , i ) $ and $ $ Cap ( p ) = \inf_ { x_i & gt ; 0 , 1 \leq i \leq n } \frac { p ( x_1 , ... , x_n ) } { x_1 ... x_n } $ $ then the following inequality holds $ $ \frac { \partial^n } { \partial x_1 ... \partial x_n } p ( 0 , ... ,0 ) \geq Cap ( p ) \prod_ { 2 \leq i \leq n } ( \frac { C_i -1 } { C_i } ) ^ { C_ { i } -1 } .	$ $ This inequality is a vast ( and unifying ) generalization of the Van der Waerden conjecture on the permanents of doubly stochastic matrices as well as the Schrijver-Valiant conjecture on the number of perfect matchings in $ k $ -regular bipartite graphs .
N-d elastic scattering is studied at different energies using one of the modern NN interactions , the Argonne v_ { 18 } which explicitly includes the magnetic moment interaction between two nucleons .	This interaction , which has been often neglected in the description of the few-nucleon continuum , produces sizable modifications in some elastic observables .
The paper gives Lyapunov-type sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of nonlinear networked systems .	For linear systems , the paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for exponential mean square stability , based on linear matrix inequalities .
About a quarter of all post-asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) stars are hydrogen-deficient .	Stellar evolutionary models explain the carbon-dominated H-deficient stars by a ( very ) late thermal pulse scenario where the hydrogen-rich envelope is mixed with the helium-rich intershell layer .

We analyze the contributions of induced and initial 3N interactions and probe induced 4N terms through the sensitivity of the energies on the SRG flow parameter .	Unlike for light p-shell nuclei , SRG-induced 4N contributions originating from the long-range two-pion terms of the chiral 3N interaction are sizable in 12-C and 16-O .
Stochastic treatments of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy require evaluations of functions like & lt ; exp ( i int_0^t Q ( s ) ds ) & gt ; , where t is time , Q ( s ) is the value of a stochastic process at time s , and the angular brackets denote ensemble averaging .	This paper gives an exact evaluation of these functions for the case where Q is a continuous-time random walk process .

Recent Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) observations indicate that the temperature anisotropies arise from quantum fluctuations in the inflationary scenario .	In the simplest inflationary models , the distribution of CMB temperature fluctuations should be Gaussian .
Our results agree with N-body simulations at the percent level in the BAO range of scales , and at the few-percent level up to $ k ~ 1 $ h/Mpc at $ z & gt ; = 0.5 $ , thereby opening the possibility of applying this tool to scales interesting for weak lensing .	We clarify the approximations inherent to this approach as well as its relations to previous ones , such as the Time Renormalization Group , and the multi-point propagator expansion .
For a given homomorphism of quantum groups $ \Pi\colon\mathbb { H } \to\mathbb { G } $ we introduce quantum groups $ \mathbb { H } /\ ! \ker { \Pi } $ and $ \overline { \mathrm { im } \ , \Pi } $ corresponding to the classical quotient by kernel and closure of image .	We show that if the action of $ \mathbb { H } $ on $ \mathbb { G } $ associated to $ \Pi $ is integrable then $ \mathbb { H } /\ ! \ker\Pi\cong\overline { \mathrm { im } \ , \Pi } $ and characterize such $ \Pi $ .
Unlike conventional carpet cloaking , which screens all the incident electromagnetic waves , we break the cloak and allow incident light get into the carpet .	Hence outside information is detected inside the cloak .
We used the PdBI to map a sample of 15 SMGs in the COSMOS field at the wavelength of 1.3 mm .	The target SMGs were originally discovered in the JCMT/AzTEC 1.1 mm continuum survey at S/N=4-4.5 .
We prove that if E , F are $ C^* $ -algebras , of which at least one is exact , then every completely bounded $ T\colon E \to F^* $ can be factorized through the direct sum of the row and column Hilbert operator spaces .	Equivalently T can be decomposed as $ T=T_r+T_c $ where $ T_r $ ( resp .
High- $ T_c $ cuprates differ from conventional superconductors in three crucial aspects : the superconducting state descends from a strongly correlated Mott-Hubbard insulator , the order parameter exhibits d-wave symmetry and superconducting fluctuations play an all important role .	We formulate a theory of the pseudogap state in the cuprates by taking the advantage of these unusual features .
Within path sampling framework , we show that probability distribution divergences , such as the Chernoff information , can be estimated via thermodynamic integration .

The conversion efficiency strongly depends on material details , such as the electronic band structure and the nature of impurities .	Here we show an anomaly in the inverse spin Hall effect in weak ferromagnetic NiPd alloys near their Curie temperatures with a shape independent of material details , such as Ni concentrations .
We compute elastic and spin-state-changing inelastic rate constants for collisions of the prototype molecule $ ^ { 17 } $ O $ _2 $ with a $ ^3 $ He buffer gas as a function of the magnetic field and the translational collision energy .	We find that spin-state-changing collisions are suppressed by Wigner 's threshold laws as long as the asymptotic Zeeman splitting between incident and final states does not exceed the height of the centrifugal barrier in the exit channel .
We present the results of such an analysis up to height 120 in E11 which comprises representations on the first five levels .	The algorithms used are a combination of Weyl orbit methods and standard methods based on the Peterson and Freudenthal formulae .
The energy spectrum contains a single metastable 'ready'-state and macroscopically-distinct 'pointer ' states .	Measurements do not pose paradoxes or require interventions outside the field theory formalism .
A Drude-like peak centered at zero frequency dominates the optical conductivity below 150 K. At higher temperatures , it shifts to finite frequencies .	The detailed analysis of the low-frequency conductivity reveals that the Drude peak and a far-infrared ( FIR ) peak centered at about 300 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ persist at all temperatures .
It can also provide clear windows where primordial magnetic fields could be detected .	We want to obtain the regular ( large scale ) pattern of the magnetic field distribution of the Milky Way that better fits the polarized synchrotron emission as seen by the 5-year WMAP data at 22 GHz .
A GNS-like construction on a non-degenerate inner product space then gives local , covariant quantum fields with indefinite metric on a globally hyperbolic space-time .

We consider a family of integrable hard-core lattice anyon models that continuously interpolates between noninteracting spinless fermions and strongly interacting hard-core bosons .	A generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation maps the entire family to noninteracting fermions .
We discuss in more detail the case when $ f_k $ 's are powers of the same function $ f $ ( $ f_k=f^k $ ) ; for illustration , the simplest non trivial situation of $ s=2 $ and $ f $ having two branch points is analyzed in depth .	Under these conditions , the ratio or comparative asymptotics of these polynomials is also discussed .
The active region was on the southeast solar limb as seen from SDO/AIA , and on the disk as viewed from STEREO/EUVI-B .	The dual perspective allows us to study in detail behavior of the prominence/filament material entrained in the magnetic field of the repeatedly-erupting system .
While , in the perpendicular direction , the motion may be described as diffusion in an effective harmonic potential which is determined from the distribution function of the position of the C60 molecule .	We also examine the rotational diffusion of C60 and show that its motion over the graphene sheet is not a rolling motion .
The data warehouse ( DW ) technology was developed to integrate heterogeneous information sources for analysis purposes .	Information sources are more and more autonomous and they often change their content due to perpetual transactions ( data changes ) and may change their structure due to continual users ' requirements evolving ( schema changes ) .

Modding by the action of SL ( 8 , \IR ) conjugations that yield equivalent theories all continuous parameters are eliminated except for an overall coupling constant and we obtain a discrete set of orbits .	This set is in one -- to -- one correspondence with 36 Lie subalgebras of SL ( 8 , \IR ) , corresponding to all possible real forms of the SO ( 8 ) Lie algebra plus a set of contractions thereof .
We extend work of Davis and Januszkiewicz by considering { \it omnioriented } toric manifolds , whose canonical codimension-2 submanifolds are independently oriented .	We show that each omniorientation induces a canonical stably complex structure , which is respected by the torus action and so defines an element of an equivariant cobordism ring .
The pitch of the helix is tuned by modulating the Debye screening length over an experimentally accessible range .	The second design is based on building blocks composed of rigidly linked spheres with short-range anisotropic interactions , which are predicted to self-assemble into Bernal spirals .
Most current approaches to plagiarism detection are based on musical similarity measures , which typically ignore the issue of polyphony in music .	We present a novel feature space for audio derived from compositional modelling techniques , commonly used in signal separation , that provides a mechanism to account for polyphony without incurring an inordinate amount of computational overhead .
In particular , we verified that for large index $ n $ , the MI of a subsystem of size $ \ell $ in a periodic chain with $ L $ sites behaves as $ \frac { c } { 4 } \frac { n } { n-1 } \ln\Big { ( } \frac { L } { \pi } \sin ( \frac { \pi \ell } { L } ) \Big { ) } $ , when the ground-state wavefunction is expressed in these special conformal basis .	This is in agreement with recent predictions .

A number of proposals to secure ND have been published , but none have analyzed the problem formally .	In this paper , we contribute such an analysis : We build a formal model capturing salient characteristics of wireless systems , most notably obstacles and interference , and we provide a specification of a basic variant of the ND problem .
In contrast to the primary market , channels can be assigned to multiple bidders , provided that the corresponding devices are well separated such that the interference is sufficiently low .	Interference conflicts are described in terms of a conflict graph in which the nodes represent the bidders and the edges represent conflicts such that the feasible allocations for a channel correspond to the independent sets in the conflict graph .
We observe an enhancement of the Delta I=1/2 amplitude consistent with experiment , although the systematic errors are still large .	We also present a non-perturbative determination of Z_P , Z_S and the strange quark mass .
Previously , the computational complexity of this problem was investigated only for games with two participating teams per game .	In this paper we consider Debating Tournaments and Debating Leagues in the British Parliamentary format , where four teams are participating in each game .
We study the properties of such spin systems , and show that despite the distortion , the lattice retains a great deal of frustration .	Although sub-extensive , the classical ground state degeneracy remains very large , growing exponentially with the system perimeter .
Generalizing in another direction gives a characterization of local rings .	An analogous result for semilocal rings is also given -- interestingly , the semilocal case reduces to the case of matrices .
Observational studies have revealed a `` downsizing '' trend in black hole ( BH ) growth : the number densities of luminous AGN peak at higher redshifts than those of faint AGN .	This would seem to imply that massive black holes formed before low mass black holes , in apparent contradiction to hierarchical clustering scenarios .
These non-standard ingredients deeply modify the mass transfer stages of these binaries .	While models that neglect irradiation feedback undergo continuous , long standing mass transfer episodes , models including these effect suffer a number cycles of mass transfer and detachment .
The use of phasor angle measurements provided by phasor measurement units ( PMUs ) in fault detection is regarded as a promising method in identifying locations of power line outages .	However , communication errors or system malfunctions may introduce errors to the measurements and thus yield bad data .
Nevertheless , early-types of all luminosities form stars over the lifetime of the Universe , with most luminous ( -23 & lt ; M ( V ) & lt ; -21 ) systems forming 10-15 % of their stellar mass after z = 1 ( with a scatter to higher value ) , while their less luminous ( M ( V ) & gt ; -21 ) counterparts form 30-60 % of their mass in the same redshift range .	The large scatter in the ( rest-frame ) UV colours in the redshift range 0 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.7 indicates widespread low-level star formation in the early-type population over the last 8 billion years .
Interestingly , the phase transition belongs to different universality classes of percolation determined by the temptation to defect $ b $ .	Specifically , on square lattices , $ 1 & lt ; b & lt ; 4/3 $ leads to a phase transition pertaining to the class of regular site percolation , whereas $ 3/2 & lt ; b & lt ; 2 $ gives rise to a phase transition subject to invasion percolation with trapping .
80 , 2504 ( 1998 ) ] have proved rigorously that the commonly accepted leading order term of the ground state energy is correct in the zero-density-limit .	Here , strong indications are given that also the next to leading term is correct .
This Lagrangian can contain dimension-four gauge invariant Higgs interactions that violate supersymmetry ( SUSY ) .	The `` wrong-Higgs '' Yukawa couplings generated by one-loop radiative corrections are a well known example of this phenomenon .
The total conservative ( optimistic ) composition uncertainty in the predicted 8B neutrino flux is 11.6 % ( 5.0 % ) when sensitivities to individual element abundances are used .	The traditional method that lumps all abundances into a single quantity ( total heavy element to hydrogen ratio , Z/X ) yields a larger uncertainty , 20 % .
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) , to be installed on the International Space Station , will provide data on cosmic radiations in a large energy range .	The main physics goals in the astroparticle domain are the antimatter and the dark matter searches .
Thanks to the high quality of the Doppler-velocity signal measured by GOLF/SoHO , it has been possible to unveil the signature of the asymptotic properties of the solar g modes , thus obtaining a hint of the rotation rate in the core .	However , the quest for the detection of individual g modes is not yet over .
We focus on the phase structure in the chemical potential versus temperature plane .	We observe the existence of two universality classes for holographic gauge theories , which are identified by the order of the phase transition in the interior of the chemical potential/temperature plane .
Assuming the continuum emission at 850um is dominated by thermal radiation from dust heated by young , massive stars , the straightforward interpretation of these data implies that the host galaxies of powerful radio sources , presumably ellipticals or their progenitors , exhibit increased star formation activity with increasing redshift .	However a severe bias may distort the true picture since only a subset of 30 galaxies have been observed , which represent the most luminous radio sources ( P_ ( 151 MHz ) & gt ; 10^27.5 W Hz^-1 sr^-1 ) , whilst the complete sample covers ~4 decades in radio power ( 10^25 - 10^29 W Hz^-1 sr^-1 ) .
We find that , under mild acidic pH conditions , the A : T basepair shows excellent rectification behaviour which is , however , absent in the G : C basepair .	The mechanism of rectification has been discussed using a simple chemical potential model .
In addition , we make use of Gaussian process optimization to find the optimal input and to mitigate the problem of a large computational cost incurred by the particle filter , as the method reduces the number of functional evaluations .	Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the resulting algorithm .
For the case of a single fluctuator we evaluate explicitly an exact expression for the phase-memory decay in the echo experiment with a resonant ac excitation .	The echo signal as a function of time shows a sequence of plateaus .
We present the first special relativistic , axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of black hole-torus systems ( approximating general relativistic gravity ) as remnants of binary-neutron star ( NS-NS ) and neutron star-black hole ( NS-BH ) mergers , in which the viscously driven evolution of the accretion torus is followed with self-consistent energy-dependent neutrino transport and the interaction with the cloud of dynamical ejecta expelled during the NS-NS merging is taken into account .	The modeled torus masses , BH masses and spins , and the ejecta masses , velocities , and spatial distributions are adopted from relativistic merger simulations .
Even though it can not serve to signal information between remote parties , there are distributed tasks that can be performed without any need for communication , provided the parties share prior entanglement : this is the realm of pseudo-telepathy .	One of the earliest uses of multi-party entanglement was presented by Mermin in 1990 .
This greatly simplifies the analysis of semileptonic B decay .	We also investigate what the available semileptonic data can tell us about lattice QCD and Heavy Quark Effective Theory .
Lastly , we lay the foundation for future work placing phenomenological constraints on the parameters of the effective theory .	Although in this paper we focus on late time acceleration , our construction also generalizes the effective field theory of inflation to the scalar-tensor and multi-field case for perturbatively constructed backgrounds .
Cooperative behavior , where one individual incurs a cost to help another , is a wide spread phenomenon .	Here we study direct reciprocity in the context of the alternating Prisoner 's Dilemma .
The primary goal is to construct the alignment scheme ; i.e.each UE estimates the main and interfered channel coefficients , calculates the optimal interference free directions dropped by the interfering BS and feeds them back to the main BS which in turn applies a scheduling to select the best free inter-cell interference directions .	Once the scheme is build , we are able to measure the total capacity of the downlink interference channel .
For this model , we derive the equilibrium probability distribution of the energy of the sample system .	Equilibrium properties of the system magnetisation and stability of the solutions is discussed .
This phenomenon was investigated for biaxial HCMs arising from nondissipative isotropic dielectric component materials .	The biaxiality of these HCMs stems from the oriented spheroidal shapes of the particles which make up the component materials .

We study loci of arcs on a smooth variety defined by order of contact with a fixed subscheme .	Specifically , we establish a Nash-type correspondence showing that the irreducible components of these loci arise from ( intersections of ) exceptional divisors in a resolution of singularities .
By applying a magnetic field in the dot region we find two dips corresponding to a total suppression in the conductance of spins up and down separated by an energy of the order of the Coulomb interaction .	This provides a possibility of a perfect spin filter .
All cells interact with their environments and with other cells .	Communication among cells is a primary means for cells to interact with each other .
The nonsymmetric gravitational theory predicts an acceleration law that modifies the Newtonian law of attraction between particles .	For weak fields a fit to the flat rotation curves of galaxies is obtained in terms of the mass ( mass-to-light ratio M/L ) of galaxies .
We simulate Gaussian random three-dimensional magnetic field models with different power-law power spectra and we assume that the field strength decreases radially with the thermal gas density as n_e^ { \eta } .	By comparing the synthetic and the observed images with a Bayesian approach , we constrain the strength and structure of the magnetic field associated with the intracluster medium .
Magnetic materials without structural inversion symmetry can display the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction , which manifests itself as chiral magnetic ground states .	These chiral states can interact in complex ways with applied fields and boundary conditions provided by finite sample sizes that are of the order of the lengthscale of the chiral states .
From the 127 subdwarfs with substantial radial-velocity variations discovered in the initial survey , a number of interesting objects have been selected for extensive follow-up .	After an initial photometry run with BUSCA revealed that FBS 0117+396 is photometrically variable both on long and short timescales , we chose it as an auxiliary target during a 6-night multi-color photometry run with Ultracam .
We propose an extension of General Relativity with two different metrics .	To each metric we define a Levi-Cevita connection and a curvature tensor .
In this paper we study the global phase diagram of the infinite range Blume-Emery-Griffiths model both in the { \it canonical } and in the { \it microcanonical } ensembles .	The microcanonical solution is obtained both by direct state counting and by the application of large deviation theory .
Its essential limitations are the neglect of correlation effects and of fluid structure .	Recently , several theoretical insights have allowed the formulation of approaches that go beyond PB theory in a systematic way .
Next , we show how a specific composition of these mappings allows to connect , by means of a simple analytical expression , the law of the first passage time of a Brownian motion over a curve to a two-parameter family of curves .	We offer three different proofs of this fact which may be of independent interests .
An algorithm to generate the locus of a circle using the intersection points of straight lines is proposed .	The pixels on the circle are plotted independent of one another and the operations involved in finding the locus of the circle from the intersection of straight lines are parallelizable .

Both extremely flattened $ q \simeq 0.2 $ and spherical $ q \simeq 1 $ haloes have several difficulties , although not of equal severity .	Consequences of such flattening for the cosmological density fraction contained in MACHOs are considered and comparison with mass in low and intermediate-redshift Ly $ \alpha $ forest and other plausible reservoirs of gas is discussed in context of a unified description of the evolution of baryonic content of the universe .
We estimate the changes in lattice parameters due to iron isotope substitution in the iron-based high temperature superconductors using a variational calculation based on the anharmonicity of the Fe-As ( Se ) bond .	For BaFe2As2 and 57Fe to 54 $ Fe substitution we find a c-axis expansion of 1 10^ { -3 } { \AA } and in-plane a-axis contraction of 1 10^ { -5 } { \AA } at 250K in good agreement with experimental values on ( Ba , K ) Fe2As2 for which a negative isotope exponent \alpha=-\frac { d\ln T_c } { d\ln m } & lt ; 0 was found [ P.M. Shirage et al. , Phys.Rev.Lett .
We present a model which simultaneously generates thermal relic WIMP-like densities for both baryons and dark matter by modifying a large initial baryon asymmetry .	Production of unstable scalars carrying baryon number at the LHC would be a clear signature of the model .
Then , we consider the AQHE of \emph { BC } fermions for both regular $ \det \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } \neq 0 $ and singular $ \det F_ { \mu \nu } =0 $ cases .	We show , amongst others , that the exact solutions of the \emph { BC } fermions coupled to constant $ \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } $ have a 5D interpretation ; and the filling factor $ \nu_ { BC } $ of the \emph { BC } \ model coupled to constant $ \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } $ is given by $ 24 % \frac { ( 2N+1 ) ( 2M+1 ) } { 2 } $ with $ N , $ $ M $ positive integers .
With the aid of an idealised Gadget-2 simulation , we show that void asymmetries in the cosmic web can exacerbate local bulk flows of galaxies .	The Cosmicflows-2 survey , which has mapped in detail the 3D structure of the Local Universe , reveals that the Local Group resides in a `` local sheet '' of galaxies that borders a `` local void '' with a diameter of about 40 Mpc .
Dispersionless ( flat ) electronic bands are investigated regarding their conductance properties .	Due to `` caging '' of carriers these bands are usually insulating at partial filling , at least on the non-interacting level .
Since the neutron spectrum is steeply falling , the total neutron production rate is sensitive just to the relatively soft neutrons , and not to the fast-neutron component .	We show that the neutron spectrum in the range between 10 and 100 MeV can instead be probed by the ( n , p ) -induced isotope production rates 12C ( n , p ) 12B and 16O ( n , p ) 16N in oil- and water-based detectors .
We will construct quantum models on lattice to demonstrate that some quantum orders can give rise to light without breaking any symmetries and without any fine tuning .	Through our models , we show that the existence of light can simply be a phenomenon of quantum coherence in a system with many degrees of freedom .
We study this algorithm on composites of a monotone function with a convex quadratic function .	We prove that our algorithm adapts the covariance matrix so that it becomes proportional to the inverse of the Hessian of the original objective function .
It is shown that gravitational scattering of DM particles on bulge stars leads to diffusion of DM in phase space { m , m_z , I } ( 'm ' denotes the angular momentum and 'I ' is the radial action ) .	Appropriate diffusion coefficients are calculated for different bulge models , and it is argued that the diffusion along 'm ' axis is the most important effect .
It 's evolution is determined through the bundle ( analogue of the ) Schr\ '' odinger equation .	Now the dynamical variables and the density operator are described via bundle morphisms ( along paths ) .
From the UZC we can extract volume limited samples reaching a depth of 70 hMpc before sparse sampling dominates .	We quantify the shape of the large-scale galaxy distribution by deriving measures of planarity and filamentarity from the Minkowski functionals .
The data and various subsets of the data , selected on the basis of nitrogen and oxygen , are all consistent with $ Y_P = 0.232 \pm 0.003 $ .	For the 2 $ \sigma $ ( statistical ) upper bound we find $ Y_P^ { 2\sigma } \le 0.238 $ .
We present new Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) -NIC3 , near-infrared H-band photometry of globular clusters ( GC ) around NGC 4365 and NGC 1399 in combination with archival HST-WCPC2 and ACS optical data .	We find that NGC 4365 has a number of globular clusters with bluer optical colors than expected for their red optical to near-infrared colors and an old age .
It uses the MultiSOM clustering and mapping method .	The domain that has been chosen for this study is the domain of Computer Science in Germany .
Multi-tier cellular networks are considered as an effective solution to enhance the coverage and data rate offered by cellular systems .	In a multi-tier network , high power base stations ( BSs ) such as macro BSs are overlaid by lower power small cells such as femtocells and/or picocells .
The motility of certain gram-negative bacteria is mediated by retraction of type IV pili surface filaments , which are essential for infectivity .	The retraction is powered by a strong molecular motor protein , PilT , producing very high forces that can exceed 150 pN .
We propose a new measure of quantum entanglement .	Our measure is defined in terms of conditional information transmission for a Quantum Bayesian Net .
We consider stationary axisymmetric solutions of general relativity that asymptote to five dimensional Minkowski space .	It is known that this system has a hidden SL ( 3 , R ) symmetry .
We present an algebraical approach to Idempotent Functional Analysis .	Basic notions and results are formulated in algebraical terms ; the essential point is that the operation of idempotent addition can be defined for arbitrary infinite sets of summands .
The Friedberg-Lee model is studied at finite temperature and density .	By using the finite temperature field theory , the effective potential of the Friedberg-Lee model and the bag constant $ B ( T ) $ and $ B ( T , \mu ) $ have been calculated at different temperatures and densities .
We expand the perturbation in powers of the rotation parameter of the Kerr-Newman metric up to the second order .	It is found that with the present treatment , the stress tensor of the thin shell in general has anisotropic pressure , i.e. , the thin shell can not be composed of a dust if the rotational effects are taken into account .
We find that the maximum length for the string to be stable is comparable to the size of one skyrmion .	Beyond the length , it is unstable to decay .
Analytic conditions for existence and stability of synchronization regimes , and analytic expressions for their stable amplitudes and period corrections are derived using the Poincare theorem on existence of periodic solutions in autonomous quasi-linear systems .	The anti-phase regime always exists and is stable under variation of the system parameters .
The SEDs ( photometry and integrated H $ \alpha $ flux ) have been fitted with a modified version of the MAGPHYS code using stellar population synthesis models for the UV-near-IR range and thermal emission models for the IR emission taking into account the energy balance between the absorbed and re-emitted radiation .	From the SED fits we derive the star-formation histories ( SFH ) of these galaxies .

In particular , a low-dimensional global structure was identified in typical space-time distributions of topological charge defined via the overlap Dirac matrix .	The presence of the order has been concluded from the fact that the structure disappears after random permutation of position coordinates in measured densities .
In this paper , using present data , and including theoretical uncertainties due to SU ( 3 ) breaking , we perform such an analysis .	The experimental errors are still very large , but with improved measurements from Babar , Belle and CDF this will be a useful method to search for new physics .
We focus on a simple problem for which the optimal closure can be fully and exactly worked out : the relaxation arbitrarily far-from-equilibrium of a single energy shell towards Gibbs equilibrium in an inviscid shell model of 3D turbulence .	The predictions of the optimal closure are validated against DNS and contrasted with those derived from EDQNM closure .
We also exhibit and classify four-dimensional Lorentzian , CH_2 manifolds that are not homogeneous .	The resulting metrics belong to the class of null electromagnetic radiation , type N solutions on an anti-de Sitter background .
We show that it consists of smooth functions and obtain concrete results on its topology .	For $ \alpha=2 $ there is a complete and elementary description of this topological vector space in terms of the Schwartz functions .
We study the Bp star HD 64740 to investigate how its remarkable inhomogeneities in the surface distribution of helium and silicon , and the corresponding strong variability of many spectral lines , can result in one of the faintest photometric variabilities among the Bp stars .	We used model atmospheres and synthetic spectra calculated for the silicon and helium abundances from surface abundance maps to predict the ultraviolet and visual light and line variability of HD 64740 .
Our aim is to examine converse statements .	First we establish that $ C $ is strongly elliptic if and only if $ h $ is closable , the semigroup $ S $ is conservative and $ K $ satisfies Gaussian bounds .
Gas rich sub-galactic halos with mass Mt & lt ; = 10^7.5 Msun , while incapable of forming stars due to lack of adequate coolants , contain a large fraction of baryonic mass at cosmological reionization .	We show that the reionization of the universe at z=10-20 has an interesting physical effect on these halos .
By contrast , no magnetic insulators in more than one dimension are known whose excitations are not bosons but fermions .	Theoretically , some quantum spin liquids ( QSLs ) -- new topological phases which can occur when quantum fluctuations preclude an ordered state -- are known to exhibit Majorana fermions as quasiparticles arising from fractionalization of spins .
Almost all cosmologists accept nowadays that the redshift of the galaxies is due to the expansion of the Universe ( cosmological redshift ) , plus some Doppler effect of peculiar motions , but can we be sure of this fact by means of some other independent cosmological test ?	Here I will review some recent tests : CMBR temperature versus redshift , time dilation , the Hubble diagram , the Tolman or surface brightness test , the angular size test , the UV surface brightness limit and the Alcock -- Paczy\'nski test .
The prediction of static properties such as the baryon magnetic moments and the Cabibbo matrix elements for semi -- leptonic hyperon decays are explored with regard to the influence of flavor symmetry breaking .	In particular , the role of strange degrees of freedom in the nucleon is investigated for both the vector and axial -- vector current matrix elements .
In the first part of this paper , we have studied solely the spectrum sharing aspect of the above problem , and proposed algorithms for the CUs in the single AP network to efficiently share the spectrum .	In this second part of the paper , we build upon our previous understanding of the single AP network , and formulate the joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing problem in a multiple AP network into a non-cooperative game , in which the feasible strategy of a player contains a discrete variable ( the AP/spectrum decision ) and a continuous vector ( the power allocation among multiple channels ) .
We find a construction for states and measurements that satisfy these graphs and demonstrate both logical and inequality based contextuality for qudits .	Interestingly , the quantum violation of the inequality is constant as dimension increases .
We introduce the \emph { well distributed occurrences } ( WELLDOC ) combinatorial property for infinite words , which guarantees absence of the lattice structure defect in related pseudorandom number generators .	An infinite word $ u $ on a $ d $ -ary alphabet has the WELLDOC property if , for each factor $ w $ of $ u $ , positive integer $ m $ , and vector $ \mathbf v\in\mathbb Z_ { m } ^ { d } $ , there is an occurrence of $ w $ such that the Parikh vector of the prefix of $ u $ preceding such occurrence is congruent to $ \mathbf v $ modulo $ m $ .
We study a finite dimensional quadratic graded algebra R defined from a finite ranked poset .	This algebra has been central to the study of the splitting algebra of the poset , A , as introduced by Gelfand , Retakh , Serconek and Wilson .
This is the last article in a series of three initiated by the second author .	We elaborate on the concepts and theorems constructed in the previous articles .
Firstly , we assume that the value of the function itself can be computed without noise , in other words , that the function is deterministic .	Secondly , we use random models of higher quality than those produced by usual stochastic gradient methods .
We present new analytic methods for calculating the branch cut on a Schwarzschild black hole for arbitrary values of the frequency .	The branch cut yields a power-law tail decay for late times in the response of a black hole to an initial perturbation .
We address these problems by combining two ideas : first we approximate the kernel matrix using a cleverly sampled subset of its columns using the Nystr\ '' { o } m method ; secondly , as we wish to avoid using this matrix altogether , we decompose it by SVD to form new `` virtual samples , '' on which any linear dictionary learning can be employed .	Our method , termed `` Linearized Kernel Dictionary Learning '' ( LKDL ) can be seamlessly applied as a pre-processing stage on top of any efficient off-the-shelf dictionary learning scheme , effectively `` kernelizing '' it .
Utilizing multi-wavelength dust emission maps acquired with $ Herschel $ , we reconstruct local volume density and dust temperature profiles for the prestellar cores B68 and L1689B using inverse-Abel transform based technique .	We present intrinsic radial dust temperature profiles of starless cores directly from dust continuum emission maps disentangling the effect of temperature variations along the line of sight which was previously limited to the radiative transfer calculations .
With increasing beam energy we pass to a mid-rapidity fragment production .	In this way we predict a smooth transition from a deep-inelastic to a fragmentation reaction mechanism .
The gesture recognition using motion capture data and depth sensors has recently drawn more attention in vision recognition .	Currently most systems only classify dataset with a couple of dozens different actions .
Angular momentum is transported outwards through an accretion disc by magnetohydrodynamical ( MHD ) turbulence thus allowing material to accrete on to the central object .	The magneto-rotational instability ( MRI ) requires a minimum ionisation fraction to drive turbulence in a disc .
We investigate the vacancy effects on quasiparticle band structure of graphene near the Dirac point .	It is found that each Dirac nodal point splits into two new nodal points due to the coherent scattering among vacancies .
A phenomenological QCD evolution equation is suggested to calculate the basic characteristics of the large rapidity gap events .	The increase of parton densities at small $ x $ as well as new means to disentangle experimentally soft and hard physics are considered .
The bosons are identified in the $ W\rightarrow\mu\nu $ and $ Z\rightarrow\mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } $ decay channels .	The cross-sections are measured for muons in the pseudorapidity range $ 2.0 & lt ; \eta & lt ; 4.5 $ , with transverse momenta $ p_ { \rm T } & gt ; 20 { \mathrm { \ , Ge\kern -0.1em V\ ! / } c } $ and , in the case of the $ Z $ boson , a dimuon mass within $ 60 & lt ; M_ { \mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } } & lt ; 120 { \mathrm { \ , Ge\kern -0.1em V\ ! / } c^ { 2 } } $ .
Each portion of the model requires specification of a parameter that is not known a-priori .	For the wake model , the wake expansion coefficient is required , while the `` top-down '' model requires an effective spanwise turbine spacing within which the model 's momentum balance is relevant .
The two different types of structures ( of low and high richness ) were identified using two different algorithms : a modified version of the van Albada method for groups , and a peak finding algorithm for larger structures.In a 300 sq.deg .	area up to z & lt ; 0.2 , we find 2944 groups and 179 clusters .
The relative errors do not exceed about 2 % and 4 % , respectively .	The extent to which the interpolation curve , expressed by a single power-law , can be extrapolated towards both high-mass and low-mass stars , is also investigated .
The testbed was designed to enable a wide range of studies of the effects of such telescope geometries , with primary mirror segmentation , central obstruction , and spiders .	The associated diffraction features in the point spread function make high-contrast imaging more challenging .
We present optical spectroscopic follow-up of a sample of Distant Red Galaxies ( DRGs ) with K & lt ; 22.5 ( Vega ) , selected by J-K & gt ; 2.3 , in the Hubble Deep Field South , the MS 1054-03 field , and the Chandra Deep Field South .	Spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 15 DRGs .
The observed turnover in that diagram is predominantly due to the negative curvature in the Milne model , { \em not } the deceleration predicted by $ \Lambda $ CDM and relatives .	We show that there are several advantages in plotting distance residuals against a flat , non-accelerating model $ ( w = -1/3 ) $ , and also remapping the $ z- $ axis to $ u = \ln ( 1+z ) $ ; we outline a number of useful and intuitive properties of this presentation .
We confirmed that the fundamental cyclotron resonance energy changed from ~22 to ~27 keV in a clear anti-correlation to the source luminosity , and without any hysteresis effects between the rising and declining phases of the outburst .	In contrast , the second harmonic energy changed from ~49 to ~54 keV , implying a weaker fractional change as a function of the luminosity .
This generalized Wulff construction , and newly-derived exact expressions for the order parameter texture in a circular domain , lead to results for the shape of a large domain .	The most striking result is that under general conditions such domains will inevitably develop cusps .
We relax assumptions required to obtain such estimators .	Moreover , under a drift condition , nonasymptotic fixed-width results for MCMC estimators for a general state space setting ( not necessarily compact ) and not necessarily bounded target function $ f $ are obtained .
Exploring this phase , responsible of the asymmetry of the driven force , a number of interesting departures have been revealed .	Remarkably , it becomes possible to drive the system into one of the following regime : the state of zero transport , the state of directed transport and most importantly the state of reverse transport ( current reversal ) .
The chemical potential of the system , $ \mu_ { N } =E ( N ) -E ( N-1 ) $ , satisfies , $ ( \mu_ { N } +\mu_ { N_ { \ell } +2-N ) } /2 \approx V+2t ( N , N_ { \ell } , V , E ( N ) $ and $ t $ are the number of electrons , the number of dots , and the strength of nearest neighbor electron-electron interactions , the total groundstate energy and the hopping integral between two adjacent dots ) .	This property will be reflected in the spacing between the conductance peaks .
In fact , actively controlling the phase of individual photons has been identified as a powerful resource for quantum communication protocols .	Here we demonstrate the arbitrary phase control of a single photon .
Recent broad-band observations of prompt emission with Fermi sharpen the debates in these areas , which stimulated intense theoretical investigations invoking very different ideas .	I will review these debates , and argue that the current data suggest the following picture : A quasi-thermal spectral component originating from the photosphere of the relativistic ejecta has been detected in some GRBs .
Recent molecular dynamics simulation methods have enabled thermal conductivity of bulk materials to be estimated .	In these simulations , periodic boundary conditions are used to extend the system dimensions to the thermodynamic limit .
Turing , Church , and Kleene all developed formalisms that demonstrated what they held `` intuitively computable '' .	The times change however and today 's ( aspiring ) computer scientists are less proficient in building automata or composing functions and are much more native to the world of programming languages .
In particular , we develop a stochastic agent-based market model characterized by a certain herding behavior as well as allowing traders to be influenced by an external dynamic signal of information .	This signal can be interpreted as a time-varying advertising , public perception or rumor , in favor or against one of two possible trading behaviors , thus breaking the symmetry of the system and acting as a continuously varying exogenous shock .
We could identify these two distinct SC regions .	We found different thermodynamic properties of the SC phase in both regions , supporting the proposal that different mechanisms might be implied in the formation of superconductivity .
Our two main theorems establish that despite the computational speed-up , statistical optimality is retained : as long as m is not too large , the partition-based estimator achieves the statistical minimax rate over all estimators using the set of N samples .	As concrete examples , our theory guarantees that the number of processors m may grow nearly linearly for finite-rank kernels and Gaussian kernels and polynomially in N for Sobolev spaces , which in turn allows for substantial reductions in computational cost .
Above critical field , the ground state antiferromagnetic configuration of Eu $ ^ { 2+ } $ moments transforms into a ferromagnetic structure with moments along the applied field direction .	The magnetic phase diagram for Eu magnetic sublattice in EuFe2As2 is presented .
Heavy vector-like quarks of charge $ -1/3 $ , $ B $ , have been searched for at the LHC through the decays $ B\rightarrow bZ , \ , bh , \ , tW $ .	In models where the $ B $ quark also carries charge under a new gauge group , new decay channels may dominate .
Using the universal X superfield that measures in the UV the violation of conformal invariance we build up a model of multifield inflation .	The underlying dynamics is the one controlling the natural flow of this field in the IR to the Goldstino superfield once SUSY is broken .
Firstly , the flux of comets through the inner solar system is much lower than some previous estimates .	Secondly , the expected rise in comet numbers to larger perihelia is not seen .
In this paper we investigate the applicability of standard model checking approaches to verifying properties in probabilistic programming .	As the operational model for a standard probabilistic program is a potentially infinite parametric Markov decision process , no direct adaption of existing techniques is possible .
We updated the phase coherent timing solution for RX J0720.4-3125 by including the recent XMM-Newton EPIC-pn , MOS1 , MOS2 and Chandra ACIS data in the energy range 400-1000~eV .	Altogether these observations cover a time span of almost 10~yrs .
The disk inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position angle of 128+-4 deg .	The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7 mm ( beta=1 ) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane .
Evidence for a similar relationship between phage promoters and downstream coding regions is found and alternative reasons for links between AT richness and transcriptionally-significant sites are discussed .	Consideration of the soliton energy of translocation provides a novel dynamical picture of sliding : steep potential gradients correspond to deterministic motion , while `` flat '' regions , corresponding to homogeneous AT or GC content , are governed by random , thermal motion .
All-optical amplification of the light pulse in a weakly coupled two nonlinear photonic crystal waveguides ( PCWs ) is proposed .	We consider pillar-type PCWs , which consist of the periodically distributed circular rods made from a Kerr-type dielectric material .
The first is a combination of the annihilation and scattering processes 2A- & gt ; 0 , 2A- & gt ; 2B , 2B- & gt ; 2A , and 2B- & gt ; 0 .	We demonstrate ( to all orders in perturbation theory ) that this system belongs to the same universality class as the single species annihilation reaction 2A- & gt ; 0 .
Nowadays , engineers have to develop software often without even knowing which hardware it will eventually run on in numerous mobile phones , tablets , desktops , laptops , data centers , supercomputers and cloud services .	Unfortunately , optimizing compilers are not keeping pace with ever increasing complexity of computer systems anymore and may produce severely underperforming executable codes while wasting expensive resources and energy .
There , extensive studies have theoretically demonstrated the ability to encode information bits by using a chain of skyrmions in one-dimensional nanostripes .	Here , we report the first experimental observation of the skyrmion chain in FeGe nanostripes by using high resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy .
In this paper we study the properties of two-qubit gates .	We review the most common parameterizations for the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates and the connections between them .
The dynamic nature of the specifications for commercial systems further aggravates this problem in that models would need to be rechecked after every specification change .	In this paper , we propose an approach for converting specifications written in the commonly-used quasi-natural language Gherkin into models for use with a model-based testing tool .
We have calculated the energy deposition for each experiment by means of a detailed Monte Carlo simulation and the results have been compared with those assumed or calculated by the authors .	As a result , corrections to the reported fluorescence yields are proposed .
The self energy itself can then be iteratively expressed in terms of another higher order self energy , capturing the spirit of Mori 's formulation .	We further discuss alternative and more general forms of $ G ( k , z ) $ that are possible .
Results are also presented for the light quark mass and the chiral condensate .	The corresponding results are also given for r0=0.5fm .
Modifying the Kerr-Schild transformation used to generate black and white hole spacetimes , new dynamic black and white holes are obtained using a time-dependent Kerr-Schild scalar field .	Physical solutions are found for black holes that shrink with time and for white holes that expand with time .
While BH binaries coalescences constitute a natural outcome of the cosmological standard model and galaxy mergers , their dynamical evolution is still poorly understood and therefore their abundances at different stages .	We use a dynamical model for the decay of BH binaries coupled with a cosmological simulation and semi-empirical approaches to the occupation of haloes by galaxies and BHs , in order to follow the evolution of the properties distribution of galaxies hosting BH binaries candidates to decay due to GWs emission .

In 1918 , Hardy and Ramanujan published a seminal paper which included an asymptotic formula for the partition function .	In their paper , they also claim without proof an asymptotic equivalence for $ p^k ( n ) $ , the number of partitions of a number $ n $ into $ k $ -th powers .
This relation is better seen when using a group-based concept of moving frame introduced by Fels and Olver in [ Acta Appl.Math .	51 ( 1998 ) , 161-213 ; 55 ( 1999 ) , 127-208 ] .
We consider a bivariate Cramer-Lundberg-type risk reserve process with the special feature that each insurance company agrees to cover the deficit of the other .	It is assumed that the capital transfers between the companies are instantaneous and incur a certain proportional cost , and that ruin occurs when neither company can cover the deficit of the other .
Electric-magnetic duality ( $ S $ -duality ) is a well-known property of pure $ u ( 1 ) $ gauge theory in 3+1 dimensions .	In this paper , we investigate the compatibility of this duality with time-reversal symmetry .
Current data reveal that at least 25 % of these planets , including some with particularly high eccentricities , are orbiting a component of a binary star system .	The presence of a distant companion can cause significant secular perturbations in the orbit of a planet .
For algebraic K3 surfaces , we solve the equation in terms of the $ J $ -function .	By deriving explicit modular relations we prove that some K3 mirror maps are algebraic over the genus zero function field $ { \bf Q } ( J ) $ .
The $ \eta'N $ interaction in the linear sigma model comes from the scalar meson exchange with U $ _A $ ( 1 ) symmetry effect and is found to be fairly strong attraction .	Moreover , the $ \eta N $ transition is included in our calculation , and is important for the imaginary part of the $ \eta ' $ -optical potential .

By contrast , inter-module connectivity is taken to be incomplete .	Two different types of inter-module connectivity are considered , one where the number of intermodule connections per-node diverges , and one where this number remains finite in the infinite module-size limit .
The optimization problem is solved by the Mean-Field Annealing technique .	Synthetic experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .
The oscillation of carriers is strongly affected by the number of confined electrons and by the strength of the interdot correlations .	Single-frequency oscillations are found for either uncorrelated or highly correlated states , while multi-frequency oscillations take place in the intermediate regime .
During 2004 and 2005 RHIC data taking periods , the PHENIX collaboration has measured jpsi decay into lepton pairs both at mid and forward rapidity in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } $ =200 GeV .	We present the jpsi nuclear modification factor and the $ \jpsi $ mean square transverse momentum as a function of the collision centrality for both systems , as well as the rapidity dependence of the jpsi yield for different centrality classes .
If $ p $ is a polynomial and $ z_0 $ is a repelling fixed point , then there is an entire function $ L $ which conjugates $ p $ to the linear map $ z\mapsto p ' ( z_0 ) z $ .	This notion of linearization carries over into the quasiregular setting , in the context of repelling fixed points of uniformly quasiregular mappings .
Using \epsilon ( v_ { imp } ) we describe the time evolution of temperature and of the velocity distribution function of a granular gas in the homogeneous cooling regime , where the particles collide according to the viscoelastic law .	We show that for the studied systems the simple scaling hypothesis for the velocity distribution function is violated , i.e.that its evolution is not determined only by the time dependence of the thermal velocity .
We attempt to recover the mean vertical velocity and vertical velocity dispersion as a function of the Galactic height for a sample drawn from a realistic Galaxy distribution function by following the method presented in Moni Bidin et al . ( 2012 ) .	We find that , for the sample size used , the observational error in the velocities is much smaller than the Poisson noise which has not been accounted for by Moni Bidin et al .
We present a framework , named the Montagovian generative lexicon , for computing the semantics of natural language sentences , expressed in many sorted higher order logic .	Word meaning is depicted by lambda terms of second order lambda calculus ( Girard 's system F ) with base types including a type for propositions and many types for sorts of a many sorted logic .
By means of a lumped Markov chain model of a random walker , a quality measure called `` persistence probability '' is associated to a cluster .	Then the cluster is defined as an `` $ \alpha $ -community '' if such a probability is not smaller than $ \alpha $ .
Convergence is found to be more rapid for the spin asymmetries , which are in good agreement with experiment , than for the underlying cross sections .	Comparison with the recent measured and DS3C-calculated data of Streun et al ( 1999 ) is most intriguing .
The detection of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ( CMB ) was one of the most important cosmological discoveries of the last century .	With the development of interferometric gravitational wave detectors , we may be in a position to detect the gravitational equivalent of the CMB in this century .
In our experimental study the figure under recognition is the Schroeder stair which is shown with rotations for different angles .	Contexts are encoded by dynamics of rotations : clockwise , anticlockwise , and random .
This iteration essentially turns a semi-implicit method into a fully implicit method .	Accuracy , rather than stability , determines the timestep .
In the present paper we develop a new approach to differential geometry of so-called rank 1 curves in Lagrange Grassmannian , i.e. , the curves with velocities being rank one linear mappings ( under the standard identification of the tangent space to a point of the Lagrange Grassmannian with an appropriate space of linear mappings ) .	The curves of this class are associated with `` the Jacobi equations for extremals '' , corresponding to control systems with scalar control and to rank 2 vector distributions .
However , Graham , R\ '' odl and Ruci\'nski showed , by taking $ G $ to be a suitable expander graph , that necessarily $ r_\Delta & gt ; 2^ { c\Delta } $ for some constant $ c & gt ; 0 $ .	We show that the use of expanders is essential : if we impose the additional restriction that the bandwidth of $ G $ be at most some function $ \beta ( n ) = o ( n ) $ , then $ R ( G , G ) \le ( 2\chi ( G ) +4 ) n\leq ( 2\Delta+6 ) n $ , i.e. , $ r_\Delta = 2\Delta +6 $ suffices .
A detailed lifetime analysis shows that of the 156 particles with well-determined lifetimes , the 120 shortest lifetimes have a continuum of values , but the 36 longer lifetimes occur in alpha-spaced groups which are sorted into s , c , b quark flavors .	Guided by these lifetime results , we deduce an alpha-generated set of universal mass quanta , based on the electron ground state , which apply to both leptons and hadrons .
Which product becomes a monopoly depends on the initial conditions of the market .	These theoretical results are complemented by an agent-based simulation which indicates that convergence is fast when 0 & lt ; r & lt ; 1 and that the quality ranking dominates the well-known popularity ranking in terms of market efficiency .
These location-aware indoor services ( e.g. , path finding , internet of things , location based advertising ) demand real-time accurate indoor localization , which is a key issue to guarantee high quality of service in smart buildings .	This paper presents a new Wi-Fi based indoor localization technique that achieves significantly improvement of indoor positioning accuracy with the help of Li-Fi assisted coefficient calibration .
Our analysis is based on the spectral representations of the form factors within the constituent quark picture : we fix the soft meson wave functions and the constituent quark masses by fitting $ A_1 ( q^2 ) $ and $ T_2 ( q^2 ) $ to the lattice results at small recoils ( $ 17\lesssim q^2\lesssim 20 GeV^2 $ ) .	We then calculate the $ B\to\pi , \rho $ transition form factors down to $ q^2=0 $ .
We make use of this result in a realistic inert Higgs doublet model , where we have a pair of Higgs doublets conformally coupled to the gravity in the early universe .	The perturbation of the inert Higgs is shown to be the scale invariant .
We show that , as $ n $ tends to infinity , this metric space , with distances rescaled by the factor $ n^ { -1/4 } $ , converges in distribution , at least along some subsequence , toward a limiting random metric space .	This convergence holds in the sense of the Gromov-Hausdorff topology on compact metric spaces .

We present deep F606W , F814W ACS photometry of the recently discovered globular cluster B514 , the outermost known globular in the M31 galaxy .	The cluster appears quite extended and member stars are unequivocally identified out to ~200 pc from the center .
Below the lasing threshold , quality factor enhancement by optical gain allows resolving , in the wavelength-scanning transmission spectrum , the resonance dips of the split modes which otherwise would not be detected in a passive resonator .	In the lasing regime , mode splitting manifests itself as two lasing modes with extremely narrow linewidths .
We find that the K-N repulsion excludes the Theta+ as a K-N s-wave pentaquark .	We explore the Theta+ as heptaquark , equivalent to a N+pi+K borromean boundstate , with positive parity and total isospin I=0 .
$ 1. $ A deterministic $ ( 1+o ( 1 ) ) $ -approximation to APSP in $ \tilde { O } ( n ) $ rounds .	This improves over the best previously known algorithm , by both derandomizing it and by reducing the running time by a $ \Theta ( \log n ) $ factor .
We consider the case where the target particle can move according to any continuous function and can adapt its motion based on the location of the nodes .	We show that there exists a sufficiently large value of $ \lambda $ so that the target will eventually be detected almost surely .
The beta+ decay of very neutron deficient 43Cr has been studied by means of an imaging time projection chamber which allowed recording tracks of charged particles .	Events of beta-delayed emission of one- , two- , and three protons were clearly identified .
We consider odd Laplace operators acting on densities of various weight on an odd Poisson ( = Schouten ) manifold $ M $ .	We prove that the case of densities of weight 1/2 ( half-densities ) is distinguished by the existence of a unique odd Laplace operator depending only on a point of an `` orbit space '' of volume forms .
52 orders of the echelle spectra have been carefully fitted together to provide continuous , high-resolution spectra in the wavelength range 410 nm - 680 nm .	The archive provides a large coverage of the space of atmospheric parameters : Teff from 3700 K to 13600 K , logg from 0.03 to 5.86 and [ Fe/H ] from -2.8 to +0.7 .
Another solution away from those limits , namely two non-degenerate single particle states with different pairing strengths , was also given .	In this contribution these developments are summarized and difficulties with possible generalizations to more single particle states and d-wave pairing are discussed .
Characteristics of an ( 8,8 ) carbon nanotube with a single Fe @ C20 inside are studied in the framework of the semiempirical approach .	The scheme of a magnetic nanorelay based on cantilevered nanotubes filled with magnetic endofullerenes is elaborated .
The effect of pressure on the zone-center optical phonon modes of antimony in the A7 structure has been investigated by Raman spectroscopy .	The A_g and E_g frequencies exhibit a pronounced softening with increasing pressure , the effect being related to a gradual suppression of the Peierls-like distortion of the A7 phase relative to a cubic primitive lattice .
We discuss a novel mechanism to set up a gravity dual of FFLO states in strongly coupled superconductors .	The gravitational theory utilizes two U ( 1 ) gauge fields and a scalar field coupled to a charged AdS black hole .
Latent Markov ( LM ) models represent an important class of models for the analysis of longitudinal data ( Bartolucci et .	al. , 2013 ) , especially when response variables are categorical .
Regularized empirical risk minimization including support vector machines plays an important role in machine learning theory .	In this paper regularized pairwise learning ( RPL ) methods based on kernels will be investigated .
Most flares are seen early on in the afterglow decay , while some bursts exhibit flares at late times of 10^4 to 10^5 seconds , which may have implications for flare models.We investigate whether a sample of late time ( & gt ; 10^4s ) flares are different from previous samples of early time flares , or whether they are merely examples on the tail of the early flare distribution .	We examine the X-ray light curves of Swift bursts for late flares and compare the flare and underlying temporal power-law properties with those of early flares , and the values of these properties predicted by the blast wave model .
In this paper , we apply the concept of spatial coupling to CBs to improve their belief propagation ( BP ) threshold , and analyze the performance of the resulting spatially-coupled CBs ( SC-CBs ) .	We introduce an equivalent bipartite graph representation of CBs with identical iteration-by-iteration finite-length and asymptotic performance .
The two strands are complementary only on a finite sequence of consecutive base pairs .	We define an adjustment length ( a few base pairs ) : in the adjustment regions near both ends of the paired region , the tension is still mainly on one single strand .
Most of the techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental testing process .	Recently , there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of these formulas in terms of complex networks , with the long-term aim of explaining the success of these SAT solving techniques , and possibly improving them .
We analyse the effect of velocity and acceleration on the temperature felt by particles and strings in backgrounds relevant in holographic models .	First , we compare accelerated strings and strings at finite temperature .
The main result ( under more general conditions ) is that a flat family of reduced equidimensional projective complex varieties X_y with parameter y ranging over a normal space -- algebraic or analytic -- admits a simultaneous normalization if and only if the Hilbert polynomial of the integral closure of the structure sheaf O_ { X_y } is locally independent of y .	When the X_y are curves projectivity is not needed , and the statement reduces to the well known \delta-constant criterion of Teissier .
Moreover , we show that noise in market impact causes risk-neutral assessment to underestimate the impact cost .	We also study typical examples under a log-linear/quadratic market impact function with Gamma-distributed noise .
The analysis is made using two approaches , dispersion relations and unitary isobar model , which give consistent results .	It is found that the transverse helicity amplitude for the gamma* p -- & gt ; P11 ( 1440 ) transition , which is large and negative at Q2=0 , becomes large and positive at Q2 ~ 2 GeV2 , and then drops slowly with Q2 .
The generalization of the minimal supersymmetric standard model relation among R-parity , spin and matter parity is derived , and discrete symmetries for the proton stability in this model are imposed .	We show that in such a case it is able to give leptons masses at just the tree level .
A Lifshitz scalar with the dynamical critical exponent z = 3 obtains scale-invariant , super-horizon field fluctuations without the need of an inflationary era .	Since this mechanism is due to the special scaling of the Lifshitz scalar and persists in the presence of unsuppressed self-couplings , the resulting fluctuation spectrum can deviate from a Gaussian distribution .
It is found that there exists an empirical linear relation between the high frequency $ \nhigh $ and low frequency $ \nlow $ of quasi-periodic oscillations ( QPOs ) for black hole candidate ( BHC ) , neutron star ( NS ) and white dwarf ( WD ) in the binary systems , which spans five orders of magnitude in frequency .	For the NS Z ( Atoll ) sources , $ \nu_ { high } $ and $ \nu_ { low } $ are identified as the lower kHz QPO frequency and horizontal branch oscillations ( HBOs ) $ \nh $ ( broad noise components ) ; for the black hole candidates and low-luminosity neutron stars , they are the QPOs and broad noise components at frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz ; for WDs , they are the `` dwarf nova oscillations '' ( DNOs ) and QPOs of cataclysmic variables ( CVs ) .
The quantum phase transition from the Mott insulator state to the superfluid in the Bose-Hubbard model is investigated .	We research one , two and three dimensional lattices in the truncated Wigner approximation .
However , it is assumed that the local topological degree of the gradient of the Hamiltonian at the stationary point is nonzero .	It is shown that ( global ) bifurcation points of solutions with given periods can be identified with zeros of appropriate continuous functions on the space of parameters .
The foliated result is used in our proof of local rigidity for standard actions of higher rank semisimple Lie groups and their lattices in \cite { FM2 } .	One definition of property $ ( T ) $ is that a group $ \Gamma $ has property $ ( T ) $ if every isometric $ \Gamma $ action on a Hilbert space has a fixed point .
By properly biasing the gate electrode we can invert the sign of the photocurrent showing that the minority photocarriers are either electrons or holes .	Both in the electron- and the hole-doping regimes the photocurrent decays exponentially as a function of the distance between the illumination spot and the nearest contact , in agreement with a two-terminal Schottky-barrier device model .
Generalizing our previous work , we carry out the complete computation of this quantity which takes into account both the nature of the degeneracy of the fermions and the presence of the space time points belonging to the antisymmetric representation .	We find the singularities as those of the SU ( 2 ) Yang monopole connection as well as the pointlike singularities in 9+1 dimensions coming from its SU ( 8 ) generalization .
A mean field calculation of the Hubbard model finds a rich phase diagram .	The antiferromagnetic phase is generally unstable away from half filling , and there are several regions of phase separation .
This contribution extends QDP-JIT , the migration of SciDAC QDP++ to GPU-enabled parallel systems , to help to strong scale the whole Hybrid Monte-Carlo to this regime .	Initial results are shown for gauge field generation with Chroma simulating pure Wilson fermions on OLCF TitanDev .
Numerical models for simulation and prediction of atmospheric flows are subject to deterministic chaos and give unrealistic solutions .	Deterministic chaos is a direct consequence of round-off error growth in iterative computations .
In this paper we aim to address two questions faced by a long-term investor with a power-type utility at high levels of wealth : one is whether the turnpike property still holds for a general utility that is not necessarily differentiable or strictly concave , the other is whether the error and the convergence rate of the turnpike property can be estimated .	We give positive answers to both questions .
We also show how the affinity matrix can be learned from observed data with a simple convex optimization framework that is inspired by locally linear embedding .	We call this approach Linear Heterophily Estimation ( LHE ) .
Having dimension 5 , the chromomagnetic operator is characterized by a rich pattern of mixing with other operators of equal and lower dimensionality , including also non gauge invariant quantities ; it is thus quite a challenge to extract from lattice simulations a clear signal for the hadronic matrix elements of this operator .	We compute all relevant mixing coefficients to one loop in lattice perturbation theory ; this necessitates calculating both 2-point ( quark-antiquark ) and 3-point ( gluon-quark-antiquark ) Green 's functions at nonzero quark masses .
We present a new regularization method , for d dim ( Euclidean ) quantum field theories in the continuum formalism , based on the domain wall configuration in ( 1+d ) dim space-time .	It is inspired by the recent progress in the chiral fermions on the lattice .
In the high-conductivity limit the ratio of the helicity and the mean magnetic field equals the ratio of the magnetic eddy diffusivity and the ( known ) density scale height .	The result can be used to predict that the cross helicity at the solar surface exceeds the value of 1 Gauss km/s .
A variety of self organized mesophases including uniaxial and biaxial nematics , smectic , cubatic and columnar phases have been identified .	Our results demonstrate clearly that the molecular anisometry influences critically not only the structure and the symmetry of the mesophases but also , and perhaps more interestingly , the phase sequence among them .
19 ( 1991 ) 1347 -- 1369 ] to the context of log-intensity functions approximated by wavelet series with the use of the Kullback -- Leibler distance between two point processes , we also present an asymptotic analysis of convergence rates that justifies our approach .	In order to shed some light on the theoretical results obtained and to examine the accuracy of our estimates in finite samples , we illustrate our method by the analysis of some simulated examples .
We investigate ground-state properties of two correlated-hopping electron models , the Hirsch and the Bariev model .	Both models are of recent interest in the context of hole superconductivity .
The Calabi-Yau property of cocommutative Hopf algebras is discussed by using the homological integral , a recently introduced tool for studying infinite dimensional AS-Gorenstein Hopf algebras .	It is shown that the skew-group algebra of a universal enveloping algebra of a finite dimensional Lie algebra $ \g $ with a finite subgroup $ G $ of automorphisms of $ \g $ is Calabi-Yau if and only if the universal enveloping algebra itself is Calabi-Yau and $ G $ is a subgroup of the special linear group $ SL ( \g ) $ .
Paradoxically , strong QPO`s are present even in the cases where the thermal component is negligible .	We present a model which identifies the origin of the QPO 's and relates them directly to the properties of a compact coronal region which is bounded by the adjustment from Keplerian to sub-Keplerian inflow into the BH and which is primarily responsible for the observed power law spectrum .
A focused sequent calculus is defined relative to some non-focused sequent calculus ; focalization is the property that every non-focused derivation can be transformed into a focused derivation .	In this paper , we present a focused sequent calculus for propositional intuitionistic logic and prove the focalization property relative to a standard presentation of propositional intuitionistic logic .
The character change of a superfluid state due to the variation of the attractive force is investigated in the relativistic framework with a massive fermion .	Two crossovers are found .
In this way , a deformed soliton hierarchy can be extended to a bigger hierarchy by including the corresponding deformation equations .	We prove the extended hierarchy properties for the deformed AKNS hierarchy , and specialize to the cases of deformed NLS , KdV and mKdV hierarchies .
Our approach combines the Bohm hydrodynamical description of quantum mechanics with an information theoretical approach to determine an optimal quantum density function in terms of density approximates to a statistical sample .	The ideas of Bayesian statistical analysis and an expectation-maximization procedure are combined to develop approximations to the quantum density and thus find the approximate quantum force .
We find that the method is unstable and introduces artificial chaos into the computed trajectories , unless the step size is chosen small enough to resolve pericenter .	The origin of the instability is analyzed analytically using the Stark problem as a fiducial test case .
Examples of estimates of measured amplitudes of evaporation residues ( EVR ) are presented .	Some attention is paid to a new hard statistical criterion for detecting rare events .
These solutions correspond to an interaction Hamiltonian modeled as the sum of a linear scalar confining and a screened one-gluon exchange ( OGE ) interaction .	This interaction induces a two-quark contribution to the amplitude for two-pion decay , which is found to interfere destructively with the single quark amplitude .
Influences from the `outside world ' on an individual are captured by environmental variables .	These environmental variables are population level quantities .
The wide range of phenomena resulting from this energy loss include : glitches , timing noise , jets , bow shocks , bullets and plerions and are be reviewed from an observational perspective .	Past and proposed surveys for young radio pulsars are summarised along with pulsar birth velocities and associations with supernova remnants .
We study front propagation in the irreversible epidemic model $ A+B\to 2A $ in one dimension .	Here , we allow the particles $ A $ and $ B $ to diffuse with rates $ D_A $ and $ D_B $ , which , in general , may be different .
The idea is to run parallel simulations at different temperatures , and at a given swap rate exchange configurations between the parallel simulations .	From the perspective of large deviations it is optimal to let the swap rate tend to infinity and it is possible to construct a corresponding simulation scheme , known as infinite swapping .
We prove a gluing theorem which allows to construct an ample divisor on a rational surface from two given ample divisors on simpler surfaces .	This theorem combined with the Cremona action on the ample cone gives rise to an algorithm for constructing new ample divisors .
By combining first principles calculations and experimental XPS measurements , we investigate the electronic structure of potential Li-ion battery cathode materials LiMPO4 ( M=Mn , Fe , Co , Ni ) to uncover the underlying mechanisms that determine small hole polaron formation and migration .	We show that small hole polaron formation depends on features in the electronic structure near the valence-band maximum and that , calculationally , these features depend on the methodology chosen for dealing with the correlated nature of the transition-metal d-derived states in these systems .
On-axis spatial solitons obtained at threshold give way to off-axis extended lasing states beyond threshold .	The investigations focus on a self-imaging external cavity .
However , in this more general setting the initial segment complexity of sequences that are random with respect to different computable measures can vary widely .	In this paper , we study the various growth rates of proper sequences .
We study a quantum chain of spin-1/2 particles whose world lines form a loop gas .	In addition to the usual interaction that projects a pair of neighboring spins onto quantum-group spin 0 , we introduce a three-site interaction that projects onto spin 3/2 .
In spite of intense experimental efforts aimed at observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules , only recently have sufficiently high densities been achieved .	Here , we report the observation of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum degeneracy .
Comparison stars were observed and analysed with the same method .	The average value of [ Fe/H ] for the 37 stars of Group 1 is -0.20 +- 0.14 dex .
It turns out that the postulate needs to be slightly modified to take into account that no `` nilpotent subgroups '' exist in $ SL_q ( N ) $ for $ q\neq 1 $ .	This has some definite and simple implications for $ q $ -determinant-like representations of quantum $ \tau $ -functions .
Remarkably , the uncertainty concerning the unknown high-energy dynamics is accumulated into a single parameter \nu , such that the model has an essential predictive power .	Future Type Ia supernovae experiments ( like SNAP ) can verify whether this framework is correct .
We show how to convert a quantum stabilizer code to a one-way or two-way entanglement distillation protocol .	The proposed conversion method is a generalization of those of Shor-Preskill and Nielsen-Chuang .
We present here a supersymmetric ( SUSY ) approach for determining excitation energies within the context of a quantum Monte Carlo scheme .	By using the fact that SUSY quantum mechanics gives rises to a series of isospectral Hamiltonians , we show that Monte Carlo ground-state calculations in the SUSY partners can be used to reconstruct accurately both the spectrum and states of an arbitrary Schr\ '' odinger equation .
All INTEGRAL high-energy have only been able to provide upper limits to the expected emission due to the decay of $ ^ { 56 } $ Ni .	These bounds allow to reject explosions involving a massive white dwarf in the sub -- Chandrasekhar scenario .
We determine the $ \sigma_ { yy } $ component of the magnetoconductivity tensor for this system which is shown to exhibit Weiss oscillations.Asymptotic expressions for $ \sigma_ { yy } $ are also calculated to better illustrate the effects of in-phase and out-of-phase modulations.We find that the position of the oscillations in magnetoconductivity depends on the relative strength of the two modulations .	When the two modulations are out-of-phase there is complete suppression of Weiss oscillations for particular relative strength of the modulations .
We compute the decrease of polarization degree with increasing intensity for different viewing angles and frequencies , and we show that an outward increasing temperature gradient , as expected in starless cores heated by the external radiation field , enhances the decrease of polarization .	We compare our results with recent observations , and we conclude that this geometrical effect , together with other mechanisms of depolarization , may significantly contribute to the decrease of polarization degrees with intensity observed in the majority of molecular cloud cores .
Gravitational waves ( GWs ) are ripples in space-time that are known to exist but have not yet been detected directly .	Once they are , a key feature of any viable theory of gravity will be demonstrated and a new window on the Universe opened .
The prior not only favors a desirable global node degree distribution , but also takes into consideration the relative strength of all the possible edges adjacent to the same node and the estimated degree of each individual node .	To fulfill this , ranking is incorporated into the prior , which makes the problem challenging to solve .
Using Wilson 's Haar basis in $ \R^n $ , which is different than the usual tensor product Haar functions , we define its associated dyadic paraproduct in $ \R^n $ .	We can then extend `` trivially '' Beznosova 's Bellman function proof of the linear bound in $ L^2 ( w ) $ with respect to $ [ w ] _ { A_2 } $ for the 1-dimensional dyadic paraproduct .
The pulses had pulse-to-pulse intervals ( { \Delta } t ) between 200 ns and 40 ms. We imaged both discharges with two ICCD cameras and combined this to a compound image .	We observe for values of { \Delta } t below 0.5-15 { \mu } s ( at 133 mbar , depending on gas mixture ) that during the second pulse the streamers continue the paths of the first-pulse streamers .
The primary design concerns include the transmit power allocation and the rate parameters of the wiretap code .	We consider two scenarios with different complexity levels : i ) the design parameters are chosen to be fixed for all transmissions , ii ) they are adaptively adjusted based on the instantaneous channel feedback from the intended receiver .
We consider a number of different models ( including the holographic dark energy and dark energy in a fractal universe ) with interacting dark energy ( DE ) and dark matter ( DM ) , have done a thorough analysis of these models .	The main task of this review was not only to give an idea about the modern set of different models of dark energy , but to show how much can be diverse dynamics of the universe in these models .
We focus primarily on the globally particle-hole symmetric model which has been the subject of considerable controversy , and give evidence that a zero-energy delta function exists in the DOS .	The anomalous spectral weight at zero energy is seen to arise from resonant impurity states belonging to a particular sublattice , exactly as in the 2-impurity version of this model .
We present two concrete techniques that can be used by a DBMS to directly manage the energy consumption .	Both techniques trade energy consumption for performance .
We study exchange coupling in Si double quantum dots , which have been proposed as suitable candidates for spin qubits due to their long spin coherence times .	We discuss in detail two alternative schemes which have been proposed for implementing spin qubits in quantum dots .
Let $ D= { \mathbb H } \setminus \bigcup_ { j=1 } ^N C_j $ be a standard slit domain , where $ { \mathbb H } $ is the upper half plane and $ C_j,1\le j\le N , $ are mutually disjoint horizontal line segments in $ { \mathbb H } $ .	A stochastic Komatu-Loewner evolution denoted by $ { \rm SKLE } _ { \alpha , b } $ has been introduced in \cite { CF } as a family $ \ { F_t\ } $ of random growing hulls with $ F_t\subset D $ driven by a diffusion process $ \xi ( t ) $ on $ \partial { \mathbb H } $ that is determined by certain continuous homogeneous functions $ \alpha $ and $ b $ defined on the space $ { \cal S } $ of all labelled standard slit domains .
Classical mechanics and standard Copenhagen quantum mechanics respect subspace implications .	For example , if a particle is confined in a particular region $ R $ of space , then in these theories we can deduce that it is confined in regions containing $ R $ .
This representation can always be decomposed into direct integrals of irreducible representations and the different formulations differ only in how these irreducible representations are realized .	I discuss how these representations appear in different formulations of relativistic quantum mechanics and discuss some applications in each of these frameworks .
The conservation laws which follow from the invariance of the action under the general coordinate transformations are used as a starting point for the discussion of the dynamics of extended deformable test bodies .	By means of a covariant approach , based on Synge 's world function , we obtain the master equation of motion for an arbitrary system of coupled conserved currents .
The algorithm AMGKQ for adaptive multivariate Gauss-Kronrod quadrature over hyper-rectangular regions of arbitrary dimensionality is proposed and implemented in Octave/MATLAB .	It can approximate numerically any number of integrals over a common domain simultaneously .
The interaction is mediated by means of lasers that couple those levels .	By tuning the lasers parameters , it is possible to drive the system through different regimes , and observe phenomena like matter wave superradiance , non-Markovian atom emission , and the appearance of bound atomic states .
In this paper we present general arguments for the consistent resummation of angular dependent subleading ( SL ) logarithmic corrections to all orders in the regime where all invariants are still large compared to the gauge boson masses .	We discuss soft isospin correlations , fermion mass and gauge boson mass gap effects , the longitudinal and Higgs boson sector as well as mixing contributions including CKM effects for massive quarks .
Emission from the H-alpha line shows evidence of a spiral density wave in the nearly edge-on disk .	We find a best fit stellar effective temperature of 27500-30000 K and a log surface gravity of 3.75-4.0 , although our fits are somewhat ambiguous due to scattered light from the circumstellar disk .
We re-analyze the sample of 24,124 Kepler stars from Reinhold et al .	( 2013 ) using different approaches based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram .
However , today 's search engines are far from perfect .	Typical search queries are short , often one or two words , and can be ambiguous therefore returning inappropriate results .
It is found that in some particular parameter ranges such solutions can be obtained in analytical form , however , numerically they are computed as existing in a far wider parametric range .	Many features of the solutions under study , such as their analytical form without the trap or the stability/dynamical properties of one dark-bright soliton even in the presence of the trap are obtained analytically and corroborated numerically .
The discovery of an HI cloud with peculiar properties at equatorial coordinates ( J2000 ) ra=07h49m , dec=04d30m is presented .	The HI object was detected at 21cm using the 300-m NAIC Arecibo telescope .
This comparison is motivated by differences in results exhibited between multiple Herschel studies of early-type galaxies .	A comparison between consistent modified blackbody derived dust mass is carried out , revealing strong differences between the two samples in both dust mass and dust-to-stellar mass ratio .
For this model type we show that the mass bias due to spherically averaging X-ray observations is independent of the temperature profile , and for the special case of a scale-free logarithmic potential , there is exactly zero mass bias for any shape , orientation , and temperature profile .	The ratio of spherically averaged intracluster medium ( ICM ) pressures obtained from SZ and X-ray measurements depends only on the ICM intrinsic shape , projection orientation , and H_0 , which provides another illustration of how cluster geometry can be recovered through a combination of X-ray and SZ measurements .
We analysed 580 articles ( original articles only ) published in Medical Journal of Malaysia between 2004 and 2008 , the resources referenced by the articles and the citations and impact received .	Our aim was to examine article and author productivity , the age of references used and impact of the journal .
The method is a generalization of the so-called dynamic clustering method , that originally partitions a set of datapoints into clusters , using a global minimization criterion over the spatial inertia of those clusters .	The new method improves on it by taking into account the full spatial inertia tensor of each cluster , in order to partition the dataset into fault-like , anisotropic clusters .
We show that , in contrast to top quarks produced via the Standard Model processes , the average polarization of top quarks originating from these SUSY decays can obtain any value between +1 and -1 .	We further study the effect of this polarization on the top quark decay kinematics .
Translation is known to consume most of the cell 's energy .	Maximizing the protein production rate in mRNA translation , subject to the bounded biomolecullar budget , is thus an important problem in both biology and biotechnology .

The problem is closely related to the existence question for periodic orbits on energy levels of a proper Hamiltonian near a Morse-Bott non-degenerate minimum .	In this case , when some extra requirements are met , we also give a lower bound for the number of periodic orbits .
The subsystem compatibility problem , which concerns the question of whether a set of subsystem states are compatible with a state of the entire system , has received much study .	Here we attack the problem from a new angle , utilising the ideas of convexity that have been successfully employed against the separability problem .
The Advanced LIGO observatory recently reported the first direct detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein ( 1916 ) .	The detection of the event confirmed the main prediction of the pop- ulation synthesis performed with the Scenario Machine and formulated in the title of the paper by Lipunov , Postnov & amp ; Prokhorov ( 1997b ) : `` First LIGO events : binary black holes merging '' .
The magnesium abundance is determined ; it is found that log e ( Mg ) = 7.67 +- 0.21 on average .	It is shown that uncertainties in the microturbulent parameter Vt are the main source of errors in log e ( Mg ) .
To begin with , the equations of motion of such model are obtained and , within the realm of warped geometry , we show that the model is consistent if and only if $ \lambda $ takes its relativistic value 1 .	Furthermore , since the first derivative of the warp factor is discontinuous over the branes , we show that the elimination of problematic terms involving the square of the warp factor second order derivatives are eliminated by imposing detailed balance condition in the bulk .
Examples are given of unconventional pairing in hole- and electron-doped cuprates , organic and heavy fermion superconductors .	The ability to apply an external magnetic field adds a new dimension to penetration depth measurements .
Distance-regular graphs are a key concept in Algebraic Combinatorics and have given rise to several generalizations , such as association schemes .	Motivated by spectral and other algebraic characterizations of distance-regular graphs , we study `almost distance-regular graphs ' .
A MacWilliams Identity Conjecture , stating that the adjacency matrix of a code fully determines the adjacency matrix of the dual code , will be formulated , and an explicit formula for the transformation will be stated .	The formula involves the MacWilliams matrix known from complete weight enumerators of block codes .
The ratio of pulsation to radial velocity ( the projection factor ) is currently limiting the accuracy of the interferometric Baade-Wesselink method .	This work aims at establishing a link between the line asymmetry evolution over the Cepheids ' pulsation cycles and their projection factor , with the final objective to improve the accuracy of the Baade-Wesselink method for distance determinations .
The challenge is how the system can survive when the RES level is very high .	In this paper , RESs are considered as full-role market participants .
We study the rotational distortions of the vacuum dipole magnetic field in the context of geometrical models of the radio emission from pulsars .	We find that at low altitudes the rotation deflects the local direction of the magnetic field by at most an angle of the order of r_n^2 , where r_n = r/Rlc , r is the radial distance of the radio emission and Rlc is the light cylinder radius .
It is well-known that a permutation $ \sigma $ may have one , many , or no mth roots .	In this note we provide an explicit expression and a generating function for the number of mth roots of \sigma .
The value of the staggered magnetization at zero temperature is 0.6\mu_B , the maximum value allowed by spin quantum fluctuations .	The staggered magnetization is almost independent of doping .
The well-known period gap in the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variable systems indicates that magnetic braking must be significantly disrupted in secondaries that are fully convective .	However , activity studies show that fully convective stars are some of the most active stars observed in young open clusters .
The black-hole black-string transition is a prime realization of such a system and its phase diagram has been the subject of considerable study in the last few years .	The most surprising results seem to be the appearance of critical dimensions where the qualitative behavior of the system changes , and a novel kind of topology change .
The results were obtained in ( respectively based on ) joint work with M. Bordemann and E. Meinrenken .	( Talk at the XXI Int.Coll .
We investigate T-duality of a closed string moving in a weakly curved background of the second order .	A previously discussed weakly curved background consisted of a flat metric and a linearly coordinate dependent Kalb-Ramond field with an infinitesimal strength .
Our geometrical description of the renormalization flow is manifestly covariant under general reparametrization of the 2d coupling constants .	An explicit exact solution to the 2d renormalization flow , based on its dual holographic description in terms of the Zamolodchikov metric , is considered in the particular case of the four-dimensional NLSM target space described by the SU ( 2 ) -invariant ( Weyl ) anti-self-dual Einstein metrics .
Neutral Fe K $ \alpha $ emission , and ionized absorption from Fe XXV and Fe XXVI are resolved .	We limit our discussion to the Chandra results .
A comparison with the massless case is performed , and examples of non-trivial singular solutions are presented .	A generalization to Riemannian space-time and inclusion of interactions are briefly discussed .
We construct a model which illustrates the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity .	In the fuzzball paradigm , the black hole microstates have no interior , and radiate unitarily from their surface through quanta of energy $ E\sim T $ .
We report the results of an observation of the galactic black-hole binary 4U 1543-475 performed by XMM-Newton on 2002 August 18 , about two months after the start of an outburst detected by Rossi-XTE .	Despite the relatively low flux of the source , corresponding to a luminosity Lx ~ 4x10^34 erg/s ( i.e.about 10^ ( -5 ) times the Eddington luminosity ) , we could obtain a good quality spectrum thanks to the high throughput of the XMM-Newton EPIC instrument .
The observed branching fractions are $ { \mathcal B } ( B^0 \to D_s^+ D^ { *- } ) = ( 1.10 \pm 0.18 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.28 ) % $ , $ { \mathcal B } ( B^0 \to D_s^ { *+ } D^ { *- } ) = ( 1.82 \pm 0.37 \pm 0.24 \pm 0.46 ) % $ , and $ { \mathcal B } ( B^+ \to D_s^ { ( * ) + } \bar { D } ^ { **0 } ) = ( 2.73 \pm 0.78 \pm 0.48 \pm 0.68 ) % $ , where the first error is statistical , the second systematic , and the third is due to the uncertainty in the $ D_s^+ \to \phi \pi^+ $ branching fraction .	The measured $ D_s^ { *+ } $ longitudinal polarization , $ \Gamma_L/\Gamma = ( 50.6 \pm 13.9 \pm 3.6 ) % $ , is consistent with the factorization prediction of 54 % .

We prove that in a broadband limit the conditions for stable super-resolution are the { \em packing } condition that the spacing among the $ N $ transmitters and $ M $ receivers be more than the coherence length $ \ell_c $ and the consecutive symbols in the data-streams are separated by more than the inverse of the bandwidth $ B^ { -1 } $ and the { \em multiplexing } condition that the number of the degrees of freedom per unit time at the transmitters ( $ \sim NB $ ) be much larger than the number of the degrees of freedom ( $ \sim MC $ ) per unit time in the ensemble of intended messages .	Here $ C $ is the number of symbols per unit time in the data-streams intended for each receiver .

We use this model to study further the degree of unpredictability certified by different quantum phenomena , showing that quantum complementarity guarantees a form of relativised unpredictability that is weaker than that guaranteed by Kochen-Specker-type value indefiniteness .
Such unusual behavior can be analytically understood in terms of the competition between the decreasing compressibility and the increasing effective mass due to the increasing superlattice strength .

Intensity of the first- and the second-order Raman spectra are calculated as a function of the Fermi energy .	We show that the Kohn anomaly effect , i.e. , phonon frequency renormalization , in the first-order Raman spectra originates from the phonon renormalization by the interband electron-hole excitation , whereas in the second-order Raman spectra , a competition between the interband and intraband electron-hole excitations takes place .

The specific heat , resistivity and expansivity curves are deconvolved to yield approximations of the phonon density of states , the spectral electron-phonon scattering function and the phonon density of states weighted by the frequency-dependent Grueneisen parameter respectively .	Lattice vibrations extend to high frequencies & gt ; 100 meV , but a dominant Einstein-like mode at ~8 meV , associated with the vibrations of yttrium ions in oversized boron cages , appears to provide most of the superconducting coupling and gives rise to an unusual temperature behavior of several observable quantities .
These inequalities are generalizations of the known results for the homogeneous case on C^ { 1,1 } open sets .	We also prove the boundary Harnack inequality for regional fractional Laplacian on Lipschitz domain .
This paper is a generalization of earlier papers [ Nucl.Phys .	B 884 , 344 ( 2014 ) ( arXiv:1312.2759 ) and JHEP 6 , 63 ( 2015 ) ( arXiv:1401.2488 ) ] .
Several papers studied the problem .	They decided qubits were entangled if multiple qubits unitary gates are applied to them , and some refined this reasoning using information about the state of each separated qubit .
On the other hand , as an extension the notion of Pr\ '' ufer domain ( and of Pr\ '' { u } fer $ v $ -- multiplication domain ) , we say that $ D $ is a Pr\ '' ufer $ \star $ -- multiplication domain ( P $ \star $ MD , for short ) if $ D_M $ is a valuation domain , for each quasi -- $ \star_ { _ { f } } $ -- maximal ideal $ M $ of $ D $ .	Finally , recalling that a Dedekind domain is a Noetherian Pr\ '' { u } fer domain , we define a $ \star $ -- Dedekind domain to be an integral domain which is $ \star $ -- Noetherian and a P $ \star $ MD .
We prove this remains true for nearly Gorenstein curves and for all integral nonhyperelliptic curves whose non-Gorenstein points are unibranch .	The results are independent and have different proofs .
We model the X-ray emission from the SNR-stellar wind collision region and we compare it with recent results from X-ray observations carried out with the Chandra satellite of the SMC supernova remnant SNR 0057-7226 which could be interacting with the wind of the Wolf-Rayet system HD 5980 .	The simulations predict the presence of shell-like regions of enhanced X-ray emission which are consistent with the presence of X-ray emitting arcs in the Chandra image .
This is also true if $ \mathbb R^d $ is replaced by an appropriate `` Diophantine space '' , such as a nonsingular rational quadratic hypersurface which contains rational points .	Finally , in the case $ d = 1 $ we describe the set of exceptions in terms of classical Diophantine conditions .
We study the robustness properties of multiplex networks consisting of multiple layers of distinct types of links , focusing on the role of correlations between degrees of a node in different layers .	We use generating function formalism to address various notions of the network robustness relevant to multiplex networks such as the resilience of ordinary- and mutual connectivity under random or targeted node removals as well as the biconnectivity .
Our first-principle calculations of the electronic structure reveal that the Zn 3d orbitals are far below the Fermi level and chemically inactive , while the Zn 4s-orbital is partially occupied and its wave function overlapping with those 3d-orbitals of neighboring Fe-ions .	This suggests that the impurity effect is originating in the Zn 4s-orbital , not its 3d-orbitals .
In a honeycomb lattice the symmetry has been broken by adding an ionic potential and a single-particle gap was generated in the spectrum .	We have employed the iterative perturbation theory ( IPT ) in dynamical mean field approximation method to study the effects of competition between $ U $ and $ \Delta $ on energy gap and renormalized Fermi velocity .
It is shown that there is a far-reaching correspondence between the detectable ( in W ) spectral entities of the two operators .	Twin observables are state-dependently quantum-logically equivalent , and direct subsystem measurement of one of them ipso facto gives rise to the indirect ( i.e.distant ) measurement of the other .
In other words , the median is the deepest point in the sample space according to that definition .	In this paper , we investigate the deepest point for probability distributions in infinite dimensional spaces .
Depending on the form of the stellar mass-halo mass relation and the underlying star formation histories of low mass dwarfs , the expected nova rates will be a few to $ \sim100 $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ and the expected SN rates ( including both type Ia and core-collapse ) will be $ \sim10^2-10^4 $ within the observable ( $ 4\pi $ sr ) volume .	The transient rate associated with intrahalo stars will be comparably large , but these transients will be located close to bright galaxies , in contrast to the dwarfs , which should trace the underlying large scale structure of the cosmic web .
Cloud and shadow curves , which determine the onset of phase coexistence , are found exactly by the moment free energy method , but we also compute the complete phase diagram , taking full account of fractionation effects .	In contrast to earlier , simplified treatments we find no point of equal concentration between fluid and solid or re-entrant melting at higher densities .
Assuming M ( H_2 ) /L'_CO = 0.8 M_Sun/ ( K km^-1 pc^2 ) , we estimate M ( H_2 ) = ( 5.4-9.1 ) x10^9 M_Sun for the two galaxies .	We estimate the galaxies ' dynamical masses from their CO line-widths , M_dyn~1-3x10^10 M_Sun , implying large cold gas fractions in the galaxies ' central regions .
These yield in the linear approximation the reflection and transmission coefficients .	The polarization of the reflected wave is independent of the frequency of the incident wave and of its polarization ; it is defined only by the orientation of the split-ring .
As a direct application , we investigate the dynamic behavior of the parallel channels associated with multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) systems in the presence of Rayleigh fading .	Studying the complex random matrix that defines the MIMO channel , we characterize the second-order joint cdf of the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) for the best and worst channels .
Accurately measuring the travel times of these wave packets is crucial for inferring the sub-surface properties in the Sun .	The observed signal is quite noisy , and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and make the cross-correlation more robust , the temporal oscillation signal is phase-speed filtered at the two points in order to select waves that travel a fixed horizontal distance .
We find that the correlation length and time can be described by power-law dependences on the reduced Rayleigh number $ { \epsilon } $ .	These power laws have as yet no theoretical explanation .
Wiener processes ( the formalization of Brownian Motion random walk ) provide a basis for a model of discrete , mobile elements ( Dx , Dy , Dz , Dt ) that 'tile ' space-time .	The possible migrations of these elements are shown graphically via computer simulation .

We also characterize the so called \QTR { em } { cleft } $ C $ \QTR { em } { -Galois extensions } over commutative rings .	Our approach is similar to that of Y. Doi and A. Masuoka in their work on ( cleft ) $ H $ -Galois extensions .
We show mean effect for galaxies with different redshifts .	Two effects can explain observational data - these are lensing by globular clusters and lensing by dwarf galaxies .
We discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) observables , of a class of pre-inflationary dynamics suggested by string models where SUSY is broken due to the presence of D-branes and orientifolds preserving incompatible portions of it .	In these models the would-be inflaton is forced to emerge from the initial singularity climbing up a mild exponential potential , until it bounces against a steep exponential potential of `` brane SUSY breaking '' scenarios , and as a result the ensuing descent gives rise to an inflationary epoch that begins when the system is still well off its eventual attractor .
One of the planets has a mass of 5 M_Earth and resides at the `` warm '' edge of the habitable zone of the star .	It is thus the known exoplanet which most resembles our own Earth .
2014 , 2730 -- 2745 ) T. Orponen and the authors proved that the Fourier dimension of the graph of any real-valued function on $ \mathbb { R } $ is bounded above by $ 1 $ .	This partially answered a question of Kahane ( '93 ) by showing that the graph of the Wiener process $ W_t $ ( Brownian motion ) is almost surely not a Salem set .
In this paper we prove that if a certain condition on the average of the Ricci scalar holds , then the Finsler manifold M is compact if the Ricci scalar is bounded above by the same positive number .	An upper bound of the diameter is also found .
To circumvent the energetic difficulties , Loeb , Shvartzvald , & amp ; Maoz ( 2014 ) propose that the bursts are produced by flares near the surfaces of M stars or contact binaries within a local volume of the galaxy .	Most of the dispersion would then occur in the overlying stellar coronae .
In this study I present results of self-consistent cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxy formation that reproduce the Schmidt law naturally , without assuming it , and provide some clues to this puzzle .	The simulations incorporate the main physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation and have a dynamic range high enough to identify individual star forming regions .
We present a multi 8-brane solution of these equations that generalizes the 8-brane of Polchinski and Witten .	We show that this solution is T-dual to a new multi 7-brane solution of $ S^1 $ compactified IIB supergravity , and that the latter is T-dual to the IIA 6-brane .
We first give an overview of the field by presenting the main models introduced until now , then we discuss some remarks on some complex networks which lead us to the definition of our model .	We then show that the model has the expected properties and that it can actually be seen as a general model for complex networks .
In addition , we prove several conditions under which ergodicity can be promoted to the stronger property of mixing .	Finally , exploiting a suitable correspondence between quantum channels and generators of quantum dynamical semigroups , we extend our results to the realm of continuous-time quantum evolutions , providing a characterization of ergodic Lindblad generators and showing that they are dense in the set of all possible generators .
In addition , efforts are underway to improve compiler tools for automatic parallelization and optimization of affine loop nests for GPUs and for automatic translation of OpenMP parallelized codes to CUDA .	In this paper we present an alternative approach : a new computational framework for the development of massively data parallel scientific codes applications suitable for use on such petascale/exascale hybrid systems built upon the highly scalable Cactus framework .
Let $ G $ be a finite group written multiplicatively .	By a sequence over $ G $ , we mean a finite sequence of terms from $ G $ which is unordered , repetition of terms allowed , and we say that it is a product-one sequence if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity element of $ G $ .
This study analyses , through cross-section estimation methods , the influence of spatial effects and human capital in the conditional productivity convergence ( product per worker ) in the economic sectors of NUTs III of mainland Portugal between 1995 and 2002 .	To analyse the data , Moran 's I statistics is considered , and it is stated that productivity is subject to positive spatial autocorrelation ( productivity develops in a similar manner to productivity in neighbouring regions ) , above all , in agriculture and services .
A physically transparent representation of a RVB state can be obtained in fermionic representation with a standard BCS-type pairing wave function , working in the subspace with fixed number of electrons and no double occupancies .	In this work , we show that , using this variational wave function with a careful parameterization of the pairing function , it is possible to obtain an extremely accurate { \em ansatz } for the ground state of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbors interactions ( $ J_ { 1 } { - } J_ { 2 } $ model ) in the regime of strong frustration .
We follow the framework given in \cite { Ji } to study the problem of combinatorially characterizing an entire map $ P e^ { Q } $ , where $ P $ is a polynomial of degree $ p $ and $ Q $ is a polynomial of degree $ q $ using an { \em iteration scheme defined by Thurston } and a { \em bounded geometry condition } .	We first show that an element $ f \in { \TE } _ { p , q } $ with finite post-singular set is combinatorially equivalent to an entire map $ P e^ { Q } $ if and only if it has bounded geometry with compactness .
We set plasma parameters as in the chromosphere ( density 10^14 cm^-3 , temperature 5-10 eV , i.e . ( 5-10 ) x10^4 K , and reconnection magnetic field 200 G ) using argon plasma .	Our experiment shows bi-directional outflows with the speed of 5 km/s at maximum , ion heating in the downstream area over 30 eV and magnetic fluctuations mainly at 5-10 us period .
We consider the problem of simultaneous on-demand streaming of stored video to multiple users in a multi-cell wireless network where multiple unicast streaming sessions are run in parallel and share the same frequency band .	Each streaming session is formed by the sequential transmission of video `` chunks , '' such that each chunk arrives into the corresponding user playback buffer within its playback deadline .
Empirical likelihood approach is one of non-parametric statistical methods , which is applied to the hypothesis testing or construction of confidence regions for pivotal unknown quantities .	This method has been applied to the case of independent identically distributed random variables and second order stationary processes .
For strong interactions , the spectra reveal multiplon physics , i.e. , relevant final states are characterized by two ( doublon ) , three ( triplon ) , four ( quadruplon ) and more holes , potentially forming stable compound objects or resonances with finite lifetime .	These give rise to several satellites in the spectra with largely different spectral weights as well as to different continua .
The [ S IV ] and [ { Ne II ] emission line distributions have a high degree of azimuthal symmetry , indicating a spherically symmetric outflow .	A model wind with a modest degree of clumping ( clumping factor f \sim 10 ) provides a better match to the observations than an unclumped model .
Shape matching is a useful technique for meshless deformation , which can be easily combined with multiple techniques in real-time dynamics .	Nevertheless , it has been rarely applied in scenarios where implicit integrators are required , and hence strong viscous damping effect , though popular in simulation systems nowadays , is forbidden for shape matching .
According to the thermodynamic formalism , to each regular function ( `potential ' ) $ \psi : A^ { \mathbb N } \to { \mathbb R } $ , we can associate a unique Gibbs measure $ \mu_\psi $ .	In this article , we prove that , for a large class of potentials , the pushforward measure $ \mu_\psi\circ\pi^ { -1 } $ is still Gibbsian for a potential $ \phi : B^ { \mathbb N } \to { \mathbb R } $ having a `bit less ' regularity than $ \psi $ .
We find that the data are consistent with the SM .	While the Run 1 data are statistically limited , we have shown that the systematic uncertainties are under control and thus have layed the groundwork for higher precision tests of the SM in Run 2 .
While the theory of diffusion of a single Brownian particle in confined geometries is well-established by now , we discuss here the theoretical framework necessary to generalize the theory of diffusion to dense suspensions of strongly interacting Brownian particles .	Dynamical density functional theory ( DDFT ) for classical Brownian particles represents an ideal tool for this purpose .
Specifically , utilizing a local reformulation of the electrostatic and kernel terms , we develop a generalized framework for performing OF-DFT simulations with different variants of the electronic kinetic energy .	In particular , we propose a self-consistent field ( SCF ) type fixed-point method for calculations involving linear-response kinetic energy functionals .
We call this ability `` remembrance '' and posit that it empowers significant leaps in the security , availability , and general operational dimensions of systems .	With the explosion in cheap , fast memories and storage , large-scale remembrance will soon become practical .
We present a method for reducing the treewidth of a graph while preserving all of its minimal $ s-t $ separators up to a certain fixed size $ k $ .	This technique allows us to solve $ s-t $ Cut and Multicut problems with various additional restrictions ( e.g. , the vertices being removed from the graph form an independent set or induce a connected graph ) in linear time for every fixed number $ k $ of removed vertices .
Calculations show that the PtN2 simple tetragonal structures at this pressure are thermodynamically stable also with respect to phase separation .	The fact that the local density and generalized gradient approximations predict different values of the absolute formation enthalpies as well different relative stabilities between simple tetragonal and the pyrite or marcasite structures are further discussed .
RTEC can update already recognised events and recognise new events when data arrive with a delay or following data revision .	Our evaluation shows that RTEC can support real-time event recognition and is capable of meeting the performance requirements identified in a recent survey of event processing use cases .
Another observable might be morphological changes or systematic leave movements .	However a big problem for such kind of experiment would be the availability of a known , controllable and calibrated DM source .
We show that in this scenario the mirror SM can either have sizeable couplings with the ordinary one , or , conversely , can interact with it with a negligible strength .	The overall cutoff allowed by such a construction can reach $ 10^9 $ GeV .
In the nonrelativistic limit we compare our results with the situation of the usual two-dimensional electron gas ( 2DEG ) .	We find that the orbital magnetic susceptibility ( OMS ) in gapped graphene is smeared out on an energy scale given by the inverse mass .
Define $ q_0 ( n ) $ to be the minimum of $ D_0 ( G ) $ over all graphs $ G $ of order $ n $ .	We prove that for all $ n $ we have $ \log^*n-\log^*\log^*n-1\le q_0 ( n ) \le \log^*n+22 $ , where $ \log^*n $ is equal to the minimum number of iterations of the binary logarithm needed to bring $ n $ to 1 or below .
In this paper , we consider a similar class of binary codes which are based on a { \em symmetric disjunctive sum } ( SDS ) of binary symbols .	By definition , the symmetric disjunctive sum ( SDS ) takes values from the ternary alphabet $ \ { 0 , 1 , *\ } $ , where the symbol~ $ * $ denotes `` erasure '' .
We use a bond-operator formulation to obtain a continuous description of all disordered and ordered phases , and thus of the transitions separating these .	Both pressure- and field-induced transitions may be considered as the Bose-Einstein condensation of triplet magnon excitations , and the respective phases of staggered magnetic order as linear combinations of dimer singlet and triplet modes .
There is general agreement that the universe began with an `` explosion '' of matter and energy at a `` singularity '' , the `` Big Bang '' .	This paper analyses the mechanics of that beginning and two alternative theories related to it : - The Hubble-Einstein theory that that beginning created space itself , expanding and carrying the universe 's matter and energy with it , and - The Universal Decay theory that the length , ( L ) , dimensional aspect of all quantities in the universe is exponentially decaying while the material universe is expanding outward within passive , static `` space '' .
In particular , the spectral function $ A ( \omega , \vec { k } ) $ is analyzed varying the filling , the local Coulomb interaction and the $ d-p $ hybridization .	It should be remarked that the original n-pole approximation ( Phys.Rev .
In this study , the phase-field equation is used as a mathematical tool to deduce the minimum free-energy path ( MFEP ) of homogeneous nucleation .	We use a simple square-gradient free-energy functional with a quartic local free-energy function as an example and study the time evolution of a single nucleus placed within a metastable environment .
For the first time we use chi^2 comparison fits to the first derivative profiles to determine the best-fitting model atmosphere .	We show the wavelength dependence of the limb darkening and that the first derivative profile is sensitive to the limb-darkening profile very close to the limb of the primary star .
The formalism of classical particle dynamics is reinvestigated according to the basic requirement of causal consistency , and a new equation of particle dynamics , which is more general and more in line with classical mechanics experiments than Newton 's second law , is obtained .	More importantly , the inertial frame of reference is no longer required and the inertial force is no longer introduced by hand .
In the light of recent discovery of a very heavy top quark , we reexamine the top quark condensate model proposed by Miransky , Tanabashi and Yamawaki ( MTY ) and by Nambu .	We first review the original MTY formulation based on the ladder Schwinger-Dyson equation and the Pagels-Stokar formula .
In contradiction to the simple pinning effect of disorder , this result shows the suppression of the vortex pinning force by introducing more ethylene-disorders .	The ethylene-disorder domain model is proposed for explaining the observed result .
Moreover , in contrast to the latter method .	no gradients of the matter variables appear .
We present a measurement of the correlated $ b\bar { b } $ production cross section .	The data used in this analysis were taken with the upgraded CDF detector ( CDF II ) at the Fermilab Tevatron collider , and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 742 pb $ ^ { -1 } $ .
We find that the RR0 Lyrae stars that belong to the Galactic Bulge have average metallicities [ Fe/H ] = -1.25 , with a broad metallicity range from [ Fe/H ] = -2.26 to -0.15 .	The RR0 stars from Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have lower average metallicity of [ Fe/H ] = -1.55 \pm 0.02 , with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.25 dex , similar to that in the bulge .
We identify parameter regimes in gas density , temperature and spatial scale within which a given instability will dominate .	We find that dynamical instabilities disrupt large-scale coherent flows via generation of turbulence , while strong thermal fragmentation amplifies the resulting low-amplitude density perturbations , thus leading to small-scale , high-density fragments as seeds for { \em local } gravity to act upon .
Here , the light emission has been observed from the sliding contact between two disks under dry condition .	The effects of the sliding speed on the intensity of TL have been experimentally investigated .

The relaxation rates ( related to the Ruelle resonances ) to the invariant equilibrium density are calculated analytically within an approximation that improves with increasing stochasticity .	The results are tested numerically .
Besides building a framework compatible with alternative theories of gravity and the pursuit of higher order post-Newtonian approximation , it will also be necessary to make the first order post-Newtonian multipole moments of celestial bodies be explicitly expressed in the astronomical relativistic reference systems .	This will bring some convenience into modeling the observations and experiments and make it easier to distinguish different contributions in measurements .
In this paper we address the problem of estimating the ratio $ \frac { q } { p } $ where $ p $ is a density function and $ q $ is another density , or , more generally an arbitrary function .	Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various problems of inference and integration , in particular , when one needs to average a function with respect to one probability distribution , given a sample from another .
Such topological states show the properties of the quantized electric conductivity and the quantized spin Hall conductivity characterized by the spin Chern number $ \mathbb { Z } $ .	The quantization of the two conductivities are robust under various perturbations such as the potential disorder , the Zeeman field , and the spin-orbit scatterings .

Our solution extends previous work , which with few exceptions has been restricted to a one-dimensional treatment of the radiation field .	We show that our analytic results compare favorably to exact numerical calculations in the one-dimensional limit .
The basic metaphor of decision theory is the maximization of a gambler 's expected fortune , according to his own subjective utility , prior beliefs an learned experiences .	This metaphor has proven to be very useful , leading the development of Bayesian statistics since its XX-th century revival , rooted on the work of de Finetti , Savage and others .
In particular , Kanekar & amp ; Chengaulr ( 2003 ) have attributed the mix of 21-cm detections and non-detections in low redshift ( z & lt ; 2.04 ) DLAs to a mix of spin temperatures , while the non-detections at high redshift were attributed to high spin temperatures .	Below z=0.9 , where some of the DLA host galaxy morphologies are known , we find that 21-cm absorption is normally detected towards large radio sources when the absorber is known to be associated with a large intermediate ( spiral ) galaxy .
This generalizes the work of Burton and Weldon for the generator polynomial of a cyclic product code ( where l\_a =l\_b=1 ) .	Furthermore , we derive the generator matrix in Pre-RGB/POT form of an l\_a l\_b-quasi-cyclic product code for two special cases : ( i ) for l\_a=2 and l\_b=1 , and ( ii ) if the row-code is a 1-level l\_a-quasi-cyclic code ( for arbitrary l\_a ) and l\_b=1.For arbitrary l\_a and l\_b , the Pre-RGB/POT form of the generator matrix of an l\_a l\_b-quasi-cyclic product code is conjectured.The spectral analysis is applied to the generator matrix of the product of an l-quasi-cyclic and a cyclic code , and we propose a new lower bound on the minimum Hamming distance of a given l-quasi-cyclic code .
Some incorrect solutions in the literature are corrected here .	A simple yet accurate extrapolation scheme is then proposed to obtain solutions in curved or $ \Lambda\neq 0 $ cosmologies .
We show that quantum uniform mixing on the hypercube is robust under the addition of perfect matchings but not much else .	Our specific results include : ( 1 ) The graph obtained by augmenting the hypercube with an additive matching is instantaneous uniform mixing whenever the parity of the matching is even , but with a slower mixing time .
[ Nature 386 , 379 ( 1997 ) ] when a mixture of grains differing in size and shape is poured in a quasi-two-dimensional heap .	We study this phenomenon using two different approaches .
Finally , we find that any wave solution in pure k-essence is also a solution for a galileon theory with the same k-essence term .	Thus in the Horndeski theory with a k-essence term formation of caustics is generic .
At this point it is still unclear whether pentaquarks exist .	While they have be seen in some experiments there are many experiments in which they are not found .
The star is encircled and enshrouded by a nearly edge-on , dust circumstellar disk , and displays an extensive jet system similar to those associated with pre-main sequence ( pre-MS ) stars .

The first approach considers the tri-boson $ WW\gamma $ coupling as being uniquely fixed by tree level unitarity at high energies to its Standard Model form and , consequently , suppresses the non-Standard Model contributions with form factors .	The second approach is to ignore such considerations and calculate the contributions to non-Standard Model tri-boson gauge couplings without such suppressions .
We conjecture this holds in general .	This is an algebro-geometric analogue of Matsushima 's theorem regarding the existence of constant scalar curvature K\ '' ahler metrics .
Their existence provides a new test-bed for weak cosmic censorship in higher-dimensional gravity .	In addition , we point out that a similar attempt of embedding Christodoulou 's well-known solutions for massless scalar fields fails to capture formation of naked singularities in 4+1 dimensions , due to a diverging Kretschmann scalar in the initial data .

Utilizing a full microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes ( BdG ) approach , we study the equilibrium charge and spin currents in ballistic $ SFSFS $ Josephson systems , where $ F $ is a uniformly magnetized ferromagnet and $ S $ is a conventional $ s $ -wave superconductor .	From the spatially varying spin currents , we also calculate the associated equilibrium spin transfer torques .
Growing evidence indicate supermassive black holes ( SMBHs ) in the mass range of $ M_ { \rm BH } $ $ \sim 10^6-10^ { 10 } M_ { \odot } $ lurking in central bulges of many galaxies .

Using Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph data we detect the 10 micron silicate absorption feature with a detection significance of 10.7-sigma .	We fit laboratory-derived silicate dust profile templates obtained from literature to the observed 10 micron absorption feature , and find that the best single-mineral fit is obtained using an amorphous olivine template with a measured peak optical depth of tau_10=0.49+/-0.02 , which rises to tau_10~0.67+/-0.04 if the covering factor is taken into account .
The structure constants f^ { ABCD } can be used to write down a maximally superconformal 3d theory that incorporates the expected degrees of freedom of multiple M2 branes , including the `` center-of-mass '' mode described by free scalar and fermion fields .	The gauge field sector reduces to a three dimensional BF term , which underlies the gauge symmetry of the theory .
This means that a large fraction of initially-single stars will undergo close encounters with other stars and/or exchange into binaries .	We describe how such close encounters and exchange encounters can affect the properties of a planetary system around a single star .
At low temperatures , the many-body system condenses into these minima generating a new type of entangled Bose-Einstein condensate .	We show that in the presence of weak density-density interactions the many-body ground state is characterized by a twofold degeneracy .
The strands were heat treated for times ranging from 5 to 30 minutes at temperatures from 675 to 900 .	Strands with 200 nm size SiC additions had Hirr and Bc2 which maximized at 25.4 T and 29.7 T after heating at 800C for 30 minutes .

The blazars under study have an often dominant high energy component , which , if interpreted as due to inverse Compton radiation , limits the value of the magnetic field within the emission region .	As a consequence , the corresponding Poynting flux can not be energetically dominant .
One of the most striking discoveries of the INTEGRAL observatory is the existence of a previously unknown population of X-ray sources in the inner arms of the Galaxy .	The investigations of the optical/NIR counterparts of some of them have provided evidence that they are highly absorbed high mass X-ray binaries hosting supergiants.Aims .
Applications include the search of eigeninformation , the acceleration of numerical algorithms , the study of Google 's PageRank .	The shift strategy arises from the concept investigated by Brauer [ 1 ] for changing the value of an eigenvalue of a matrix to the desired one , while keeping the remaining eigenvalues and the original eigenvectors unchanged .

Destressing energy which originates from the long-range magnetoelastic forces is analogous to demagnetization energy in ferromagnetic materials and is responsible for the formation of equilibrium domain structure and anisotropy of macroscopic magnetic properties .	In particular , crystal shape may be a source of additional uniaxial magnetic anisotropy which removes degeneracy of antiferromagnetic vector or artificial 4th order anisotropy in the case of a square cross-section sample .

An explicit description of the $ n=6 $ surface lets us find several infinite families of quadratic endomorphisms $ f : \mathbb { P } ^1 \to \mathbb { P } ^1 $ defined over $ \mathbb { Q } $ with a rational periodic point of order $ 6 $ .	In one of these families , $ f $ also has a rational fixed point , for a total of at least $ 7 $ periodic and $ 7 $ preperiodic points .
Up to date , deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacrificial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent .	Here , we develop an all-dry transfer method that relies on viscoelastic stamps and does not employ any wet chemistry step .
We find that the power spectra of the voltage fluctuations , and the noise power , are related to the large scale morphology of the plastic flux flow .	At currents corresponding to the peak in differential resistance , the flux flow forms a braided river , the noise power is maximal , and the power spectra has a 1/f^ { \alpha } form with \alpha \approx 1.8 over a wide frequency range .
When translational symmetry is broken by an external perturbation we find an abrupt increase of the conductance through those channels .	Previous studies concentrated on the effect at the Fermi energy , where this effect is very small .

Let us consider the superelliptic curve $ C : y^q=f ( x ) $ and its jacobian $ J ( C ) $ .	We study the endomorphism algebra $ End^0 ( J ( C ) ) $ of all $ K_a $ -endomorphisms of $ J ( C ) $ .
We show that , for a stationary version of Hammersley 's process , with Poisson `` sources '' on the positive x-axis , and Poisson `` sinks '' on the positive y-axis , an isolated second-class particle , located at the origin at time zero , moves asymptotically , with probability 1 , along the characteristic of a conservation equation for Hammersley 's process .	This allows us to show that Hammersley 's process without sinks or sources , as defined by Aldous and Diaconis [ Probab .
The fact that most of HESE are downward going suggests a possible Galactic component .	This could be originated either by a single point-like source or to a directional excess from an extended Galactic region .
Then we show that the coefficients in the expansion of these toric Schur polynomials , in terms of the regular Schur polynomials , are exactly the 3-point Gromov-Witten invariants ; which are the structure constants of the quantum cohomology ring .	This construction implies that the Gromov-Witten invariants of the Grassmannian are invariant with respect to the action of a twisted product of the groups S_3 , ( Z/nZ ) ^2 , and Z/2Z .
In this paper we consider tandem error control coding and cryptography in the setting of the { \em wiretap channel } due to Wyner .	In a typical communications system a cryptographic application is run at a layer above the physical layer and assumes the channel is error free .
The basic principle is to ignite a plasma using argon , and then to introduce a small additional nitrogen flow to achieve the nitridation of a Nb target .	Subsequent sputtering leads to the deposition of NbN onto the host substrate .

We first relate sprawl to curvature and show that nonelementary hyperbolic groups are statistically hyperbolic , then give some results for products , for Diestel-Leader graphs and lamplighter groups .	In free abelian groups , the word metrics asymptotically approach norms induced by convex polytopes , causing the study of sprawl to reduce to a problem in convex geometry .
By maximizing a randomly perturbed potential function , MAP perturbations generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution .	Unfortunately , the computational cost of generating so many high-dimensional random variables can be prohibitive .
We investigate a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ( FRW ) universe where dark matter exchanges energy with a self-interacting holographic dark energy ( SIHDE ) .

It is well known that the moduli space of flat connections on a trivial principal bundle MxG , where G is a connected Lie group , is isomorphic to the representation variety Hom ( \pi_1 ( M ) , G ) /G .	For a tiling T , viewed as a marked copy of R^d , we define a new kind of bundle called pattern equivariant bundle over T and consider the set of all such bundles .
We have extended and improved the statistical test recently developed by Rauzy for assessing the completeness in apparent magnitude of magnitude-redshift surveys .	Our improved test statistic retains the robust properties -- specifically independence of the spatial distribution of galaxies within a survey -- of the $ T_c $ statistic introduced in Rauzy 's seminal paper , but now accounts for the presence of both a faint and bright apparent magnitude limit .
A class of robust estimators of scatter applied to information-plus-impulsive noise samples is studied , where the sample information matrix is assumed of low rank ; this generalizes the study of ( Couillet et al. , 2013b ) to spiked random matrix models .	It is precisely shown that , as opposed to sample covariance matrices which may have asymptotically unbounded ( eigen- ) spectrum due to the sample impulsiveness , the robust estimator of scatter has bounded spectrum and may contain isolated eigenvalues which we fully characterize .
The fluctuations are calculated with the assumption of unlimited resources , where the calculation is incorporated into the calculation of the average loads without adding to the time complexity .	Simulation results show that the fluctuation-integrated strategy provides shorter average travel time than a previous distribution strategy while keeping similar robustness .
The framework is based on radial basis functions ( RBFs ) to smoothly represent data around the nodes We demonstrate the performance of Gaussian RBF-based , mesh-free interpolation and differentiation , which reaches the sub-percent level in both cases .

The available X-ray spectral domain is only limited by the Quantum Efficiency of scientific-grade X-ray CCD cameras , thus extending from a few keV up to a few tens of keV .	Spectral 2D images of the emitting plasma can be obtained at any X-ray photon energy provided that a sufficient number of photons had been collected at the desired energy .
More specifically , assuming that the ultimate source of flare energy is mechanical energy in the convection zone , how is this translated into energy dissipated or stored in the corona ?	This question appears to have been given relatively little thought , as attention has been focussed predominantly on mechanisms for the rapid dissipation of coronal magnetic energy by way of MHD instabilities and plasma micro instabilities .
The renormalization method which is a type of perturbation method is extended to a tool to study weakly nonlinear time-delay systems .	For systems with order-one delay , we show that the renormalization method leads to reduced systems without delay .
Our calculations show that the classical relation between energy injection and dissipation scale is not valid in quantum turbulence , but we have been able to derive a temperature -- dependent superfluid analogous relation .	Finally , we discuss our DNS results in terms of the current understanding of quantum turbulence , including the value of the effective kinematic viscosity .
Given two open books with equal pages we show the existence of an exact symplectic cobordism whose negative end equals the disjoint union of the contact manifolds associated to the given open books , and whose positive end induces the contact manifold associated to the open book with the same page and concatenated monodromy .	Using similar methods we show the existence of strong fillings for contact manifolds associated with doubled open books , a certain class of fiber bundles over the circle obtained by performing the binding sum of two open books with equal pages and inverse monodromies .
We use an analytic approximation for particle trajectories of a self-gravitating dust continuum and apply a local dynamical biasing of volume elements to identify luminous matter in the model .	Using this method , we are able to resolve formally a simulation box of 1200h^-1 Mpc ( e.g.for HDM initial conditions ) down to the scale of galactic halos using $ 2160^3 $ particles .
In combination with already published data , this provides one of the most complete studies of optical and NIR data for any type IIP SN from just after explosion to +500 days .	The contribution of the NIR flux to the bolometric light curve is estimated to increase from 15 % at explosion to around 50 % at the end of the plateau and then declines to 40 % at 300 days .
With [ Fe/H ] = -3.7 , this the most metal-poor star yet identified in an ultra-faint dSph .	Comparison of relative abundances , [ X/Fe ] , for some 15 elements with those of the extremely metal-poor giants of the Galactic halo shows Boo-1137 is `` normal '' with respect to C and N , the odd-Z elements Na and Al , the Fe-peak elements , and the n-capture elements Sr and Ba , in comparison with the bulk of the halo with [ Fe/H ] & lt ; -3.0 .
However , all these analyses had to assume $ w & gt ; -1 $ and $ \beta & gt ; 0 $ due to the existence of the large-scale instability in the IDE scenario .	In our recent work [ Phys.Rev .
It is first shown that a uniform maximally aligned completely separable eigenstate can exist just for fields $ { h } _s $ parallel to a principal plane and forming four straight lines in field space , with the alignment direction different from that of $ { h } _s $ and determined by the anisotropy .	Such state always becomes a non-degenerate ground state ( GS ) for sufficiently strong ( yet finite ) fields along these lines , in both ferromagnetic ( FM ) and antiferromagnetic ( AFM ) type systems .
These structural variants ( SV ) have been shown to have significant impact on the phenotype , but their study has been held back by the combinatorial complexity of the underlying models .	We describe here a general model of structural variation that encompasses both balanced rearrangements and arbitrary copy-numbers variants ( CNV ) .
We study the period 2005-2008 , which includes the recent credit and liquidity crisis .	Using dynamical community detection , we find that exchange rates that are strongly attached to their community are persistently grouped with the same set of rates , whereas exchange rates that are important for the transfer of information tend to be positioned on the edges of communities .
Interference between the modes in the waveguide forms a wavelength-dependent speckle pattern which can be used as a fingerprint to identify the input wavelength after calibration .	Evanescent coupling between neighboring arms of the spiral enhances the temporal spread of light propagating through the spiral , leading to a dramatic increase in the spectral resolution .
Moreover , we show that the abrupt change observed in the pump dependence of the steady-state population is directly connected with the transition to the lasing regime .	The condition for a sharp transition to Poissonian statistics is expressed as a scaling limit of vanishing cavity loss and light-matter coupling , $ \kappa \to 0 $ , $ g \to 0 $ , such that $ g^2/\kappa $ stays finite and $ g^2/\kappa & gt ; 2 \gamma $ , where $ \gamma $ is the rate of atomic losses .
We say that two graphs are similar if their adjacency matrices are similar matrices .	We show that the square grid $ G_n $ of order $ n $ is similar to the disjoint union of two copies of the quartered Aztec diamond $ QAD_ { n-1 } $ of order $ n-1 $ with the path $ P_n^ { ( 2 ) } $ on $ n $ vertices having edge weights equal to~2 .
Gravitational lensing causes background galaxy images to become aligned , and the statistical characteristics of the image alignments can then be used to constrain the power spectrum of mass fluctuations .	Analyses of gravitational lensing assume that intrinsic galaxy alignments are negligible , but if this assumption does not hold , then the interpretation of image alignments will be in error .
The latter are critical to enable continuous adaptation and learning .	The work establishes three key results .
This entropy choice is confronted with another option , employing the conditional Kullback-Leibler entropy .	Both entropies discriminate among various probability distributions , either statically or in the time domain .
Conclusions : The evolution of smaller brains in many recent human populations must have resulted from selection upon brain size itself or on other features more highly correlated with brain size than are gross body dimensions .	This selection may have resulted from energetic or nutritional demands in Holocene populations , or to life history constraints on brain development .
A weakly dispersive sub-range ( WDR ) of kinetic Alfv\'en turbulence is distinguished and investigated for the first time in the context of MHD/kinetic turbulence transition .	We found perpendicular wavenumber spectra ~ k^ { -3 } and ~ k^ { -4 } formed in WDR by strong and weak turbulence of kinetic Alfv\'en waves ( KAWs ) , respectively .

We experimentally study spin dynamics in a sodium antiferromagnetic spinor condensate with off-resonant microwave pulses .	In contrast to a magnetic field , a microwave dressing field enables us to explore rich spin dynamics under the influence of a negative net quadratic Zeeman shift $ q_ { \rm net } $ .
Our definition is conservative ; access to a computable oracle does not increase the computational power .	Other models of real hypercomputation such as Ziegler 's ( finitely ) revising computation or Type-2-Nondeterminism are shown to be special cases of Oracle-Type-2-Machines .

Any knot in a solid torus , called a pattern or satellite operator , acts on knots in the 3-sphere via the satellite construction .	We introduce a generalization of satellite operators which form a group ( unlike traditional satellite operators ) , modulo a generalization of concordance .
The paper argues that the stock objections against these theories do not withstand scrutiny .	Its focus then is on their explanatory value : they pursue different strategies to ground the textbook formalism of quantum mechanics , and they develop different explanations of quantum non-locality .
The second version , established far more recently by Cappelletti-Montano , De Nicola , and Yudin , holds for the De Rham cohomology of a compact Sasakian manifold .	In the current paper , using the formalism of odd dimensional symplectic geometry , we prove a Hard Lefschetz theorem for a compact $ K $ -contact manifold , which implies immediately that the two existing versions of Hard Lefschetz theorems are mathematically equivalent to each other .

Progress in the derivation of effective models for the conjectured spin liquid state has been hindered , by the difficulties involved in solving the strong coupling low energy Hamiltonian .	We tackle the problem by introducing an orthogonal wave packet basis , the so-called Wilson-Wannier ( WW ) basis , that can be used to interpolate between the momentum space and the real space descriptions .
The distribution is strongly , and asymmetrically , peaked at a value less than the expected value in a homogeneous Robertson-Walker universe .	Therefore , given any small sample of observations in an inhomogeneous universe , the most likely observed luminosity is at flux values less than the Robertson-Walker value .

( 1992 ) , which yields harder spectra , would operate at lower energies and may explain the flat radio spectral indices of plerions .	This scenario implies wind parameters in the Crab compatible with the pulsar wind acceleration model of Lyubarsky & amp ; Kirk ( 2001 ) .
In the context of quantum gravity for spacetimes of dimension 2+1 , we describe progress in the construction of a quantum Goldman bracket for intersecting loops on surfaces .	Using piecewise linear paths in R^2 ( representing loops on the spatial manifold , i.e.the torus ) and a quantum connection with noncommuting components , we review how holonomies and Wilson loops for two homotopic paths are related by phases in terms of the signed area between them .
After detecting an error in the reduction procedure of the published Konkoly data , corrected photometric data are presented with additional , previously unpublished measurements .	The reanalysis of the combination of the corrected Konkoly data supplemented with Preston & amp ; Spinrad 's ( 1967 ) observations has led to the discovery that the adequate mathematical model of the light curve is , in fact , a quintuplet , instead of a triplet frequency solution .
Our atomistic calculations show that such condensed multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( CMWNTs ) can greatly enhance intershell shear strengths by several orders , and can simultaneously generate higher tensile strengths and moduli respectively than those of ordinary CNTs .	It has further shown that CMWNTs can maintain thermally stable up to 2,000 K. By taking advantage of the primary enhancement mechanism of CMWNTs , a method of producing CMWNTs is therefore proposed tentatively .
All theoretical calculations are carried out without any adjustable parameter .	We also show that the present results satisfy the Callan-Treiman low-energy theorem as well as the Ademollo-Gatto theorem .
Here , $ L $ is a nonlocal elliptic operator of order $ 2s $ , with $ s\in ( 0,1 ) $ .	First , in $ C^ { 1 , \alpha } $ domains we show that all solutions $ u $ are $ C^s $ up to the boundary and that $ u/d^s\in C^\alpha ( \bar\Omega ) $ , where $ d $ is the distance to $ \partial\Omega $ .

We define `` rational payoff irrational equilibria games '' to be the games with all rational payoffs and all irrational equilibria .	We present a purely algebraic method for computing all Nash equilibria of these games that uses knowledge of Galois groups .
Then , the quantum mechanics as it is usually taught is demoted to a mere part of the theory called phenomenology of observations , and the common impression about its contradiction to realism is explained .	The main idea of the paper , the physical notion of intrinsic properties , is introduced and many examples thereof are given .
We develop a Lagrangian approach based on the influence functional method so as to derive self-consistently the Langevin equation for the inflaton field in the presence of trapping points along the inflaton trajectory .	The Langevin equation exhibits the backreaction and the fluctuation-dissipation relation of the trapping .
In this paper we construct high moment partial sum processes based on residuals of a GARCH model when the mean is known to be 0 .	We consider partial sums of $ k $ th powers of residuals , CUSUM processes and self-normalized partial sum processes .
The gravitino may well play an important role in cosmology , not only because its interactions are Planck-suppressed and therefore long-lived , but also because it is copiously produced via various processes such as particle scatterings in thermal plasma , and ( pseudo ) modulus and inflaton decays .	We study a possibility that the early Universe was gravitino-rich from various aspects .
Two different numerical analyses are performed , using either the experimental or the theoretical value for epsilon , with compatible results .	We obtain Re ( epsilon'/epsilon ) = ( 1.7 +- 0.9 ) *10^ { -3 } .

Further we find a necessary condition of 3-ribbon infinitesimal flexibility .	For an arbitrary $ n\ge 3 $ we prove that every generic $ n $ -ribbon surface has at most one degree of finite/infinitesimal flexibility .
In high bias above the superconducting gap voltage , however , we also observed an anomalous jump of the differential conductance , the voltage position of which is sensitive to the backgate voltage Vg .	Our extensive study with varying Vg , temperature , and H reveals that the above-gap structure takes place at a characteristic power P* , which is irrespective of Vg for a given junction .
This allows one to re-express the potentials for arbitrary N as a unique effective scalar potential containing the Coulomb potential and the complete Darwin one , whose 1/c^2 component agrees for with the known expression .	The effective potential gives the classical analogue of all static and non-static effects of the one-photon exchange Feynman diagram of scalar electrodynamics .

We study the question of lithium diffusion after the cosmological recombination in sub-Jeans dark matter haloes , taking into account that more than 95 % of lithium remains in the singly-ionized state at all times .	Large scattering cross sections on the rest of the ionized gas leads to strong coupling of lithium to protons and its initial direction of diffusion coincides with that of H $ ^+ $ .
For generation and parsing of word forms , I propose a novel off-line technique to eliminate run-time optimization .	It produces a finite-state oracle that efficiently restricts the constraint interpreter 's search space .

All spin logic-styles may offer high area-density due to small form-factor of nano-magnetic devices .	However , circuit and system-level design techniques need to be explored that leverage the specific spin-device characteristics to achieve energy-efficiency , performance and reliability comparable to those of CMOS .
We apply the transformation of mixing azimuthal and internal coordinate or mixing time and internal coordinate to the 11D M-theory with a stack of M2-branes $ \bot $ M2-branes , then , through the mechanism of Kaluza-Klein reduction and a series of the T duality we obtain the corresponding background of a stack of D1-branes $ \bot $ D5-branes which , in the near-horizon limit , becomes the magnetic or electric Melvin field deformed $ AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4 $ .	We find the giant graviton solution in the deformed spacetime and see that the configuration whose angular momentum is within a finite region could has a fixed size and become more stable than the point-like graviton , in contrast to the undeformed giant graviton which only exists when its angular momentum is a specific value and could have arbitrary size .
In this paper we characterize the hyperbolic product graphs for graph join $ G_1\uplus G_2 $ and the corona $ G_1\diamond G_2 $ : $ G_1\uplus G_2 $ is always hyperbolic , and $ G_1\diamond G_2 $ is hyperbolic if and only if $ G_1 $ is hyperbolic .	Furthermore , we obtain simple formulae for the hyperbolicity constant of the graph join $ G_1\uplus G_2 $ and the corona $ G_1\diamond G_2 $ .
Numerous studies in the past 40 years have established that turbulent flow fields are populated by transient coherent structures that represent patches of fluids moving cohesively for significant distances before they are worn out by momentum exchange with the surrounding fluid .	Two particular well-documented structures are the hairpin vortices that move longitudinally above the wall and ejections inclined with respect to the wall that bring the fluid from the transient viscous layers underneath these vortices into the outer region of the boundary layer .
The algebraic and combinatorial properties of switching classes have been studied in depth ; however , they have not been studied as thoroughly from an algorithmic point of view .	The intent of this work is to further investigate the algorithmic properties of switching classes .

The thermohydrolysis chemistry at the core of the primary competition is described .	Essentially , the competition is between two nucleophiles , a molecule of water and an -OH group on C_6 of an end glucosyl cation , to form either a reducing chain fragment with the propensity to undergo the bond-forming reactions that ultimately form char or a levoglucosan-end-fragment that depolymerizes to volatile products .
The lattice dynamics of Ba1-xKxFe2As2 ( x = 0.00 , 0.27 ) have been studied by inelastic X-ray scattering measurement at room temperature .	K doping induces the softening and broadening of phonon modes in the energy range E = 10-15 meV .
We argue that this approach should be sufficient for the mean signature on the scales of interest .	Our results indicate that Lyman alpha flux provides a good tracer of the underlying dark matter field on large scales and that redshift space distortions are well described by a simple linear theory prescription .

We denote by $ \ell $ the length of the chromosomes , by $ m $ the population size , by $ p_C $ the crossover probability and by $ p_M $ the mutation probability .	We introduce a parameter $ \sigma $ , called the selection drift , which measures the selection intensity of the fittest chromosome .
In particular , we give explicit analytic expressions for the field perturbations ( for a specific multipole ) of general spin up to the first four orders at late times .	These expressions are valid at arbitrary radius and include , apart from the well-known power-law tail decay at leading order ( $ \sim t^ { -2\ell-3 } $ ) , a new logarithmic behaviour at third leading order ( $ \sim t^ { -2\ell-5 } \ln t $ ) .
A periodic pressure drop boundary condition is used to mimic the pressure driven flow through the simple sphere pack in a periodic domain .	The evaluation of the method is done in the Darcy regime and the results are compared to a semi-analytic solution .
In this paper , I argue that light is a continuous classical electromagnetic wave , while the observed so-called quantum nature of the interaction of light with matter is connected to the discrete ( atomic ) structure of matter and to the specific nature of the light-atom interaction .	From this point of view , the Born rule for light is derived , and the double-slit experiment is analysed in detail .
In AP , each cluster is identified by a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to , and exemplars have to refer to themselves .	Albeit its proved power , AP in its present form suffers from a number of drawbacks .

Tentative explanations for this unusual effect are proposed , including an interference process between two channels contributing to $ G $ , with one more and one less particle than the exactly-solved cluster ground-state .	The Hubbard interaction and fermionic statistics of electrons also appear to be important to understand this phenomenon .
More precisely , under a coprimality condition on the sides of the rectangle , the number of independent sets of even and odd cardinality always differ by 1 .	In physics terms , this means looking at the hard-particle model on these grids at activity -1 .

Here we explore the orbital phase space distribution of the B-stars throughout the central pc expected from the various suggested models for the origin of the B-stars .	We find that most of these models have difficulties in explaining , by themselves , both the population of the S-stars ( & lt ; 0.05 pc ) , and the population of the young B-stars further away ( up to 0.5 pc ) .
Unfolding rational polygon billiards ( RPB ) into corresponding Riemann surfaces ( RS ) periodic structures of the latter are demonstrated with 2g independent periods on the respective multitori with g as their genuses .	However it is the two dimensional real space of the real linear combinations of these periods which is used for quantizing RPB .
At high collisionality it finds a more gradual transition to resistive ballooning .	At moderate beta and collisionality it retains drift wave character , qualitatively identical to simple two dimensional slab models .
We report preliminary results on time-dependent CP asymmetries in $ B \to D^ { *\mp } \pi^ { \pm } $ decays .	The CP asymmetry in these decays is proportional to $ 2R_ { D^ { * } \pi } \sin ( 2\phi_1 + \phi_3 \pm \delta_ { D^ { * } \pi } ) $ , where $ R_ { D^ { * } \pi } $ is the ratio of the magnitudes of the doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed and Cabibbo-favoured amplitudes , $ \delta_ { D^ { * } \pi } $ is the strong phase difference between them , and $ \phi_1 $ and $ \phi_3 $ are two angles of the CKM Unitarity Triangle .

This method focuses on the initial phase where establishing and handling the information takes place and creates a foundation that precedes its systematization and computation .	The aim is to give designers a comfortable design tool that firmly aids the design without interfering with creativity , and at the same time aids the construction of interplay between narration , spatiality and interactivity .
Starting kinks cause stationary parts of the boundary to move .	We study the interaction of these kinks with disorder that arises from the spatial variations of the friction constant or fracture energy .
A B , V color-magnitude diagram ( CMD ) for ~28,000 stars is presented and discussed .	The most prominent feature of the CMD , identified for the first time in this paper , is the extended horizontal branch blue tail ( EBT ) with a clear double-peaked distribution and a significant gap .

Furthermore we present data for a third quasar , CTCV J0322-4653 , which has also been found in our study , but which has already been included in the list of Maza et al .	( 1996 ) as CTS 0639 .
In moment space this formula can resum all contributions to $ F_L $ that are of order $ \ln^k N/N $ .	This is achieved by defining a new jet function which probes the transverse momentum of the struck parton in the target at leading twist .
We study a system coupled to external degrees of freedom , called bath , where we assume that the total system , consisting of system and bath is in equilibrium .	An expansion in the coupling between system and bath leads to a general form of the reduced density matrix of the system as a function of the bath selfenergy .

Our formalisation models the exact details of the core functionality of AODV , such as route discovery , route maintenance and error handling .	We demonstrate how AWN can be used to reason about critical protocol correctness properties by providing a detailed proof of loop freedom .
In the paper , we present a new kind of function photonic crystals , which refractive index is a function of space position .	Unlike conventional PCs , which structure grow from two materials , A and B , with different dielectric constants $ \epsilon_ { A } $ and $ \epsilon_ { B } $ .
This is done in a fairly general setting , which however does not include the important special case of an external field given by the real part of a polynomial of degree greater than or equal to 2 .	In this paper we give a detailed proof of the existence of a curve with the S-property in the external field given by the real part of a polynomial V , within the collection of all curves that connect two or more pre-assigned directions at infinity in which the real part of V grows .

The analysis of the phenomenon shows that the effect is related to combinatorics in relation with the existence of the two independent species cations and anions .	This simple and basic feature is related to the quantum mechanical properties of the system .
Particular emphasis is put on the topological properties of algebraic maps .	The latter is to prove a motivic version of the decomposition theorem for the resolution of a threefold Y .

The growth rate of the fastest growing mode drops rapidly with current sheet thickness but increases slowly with the strength of the guide field .	The fastest growing mode is tearing type only for thin current sheets ( half thickness $ \approx d_e $ , where $ d_e=c/\omega_ { pe } $ is electron inertial length ) and zero guide field .
We find that this scenario predicts a large , gravitational wave background that should be resolved into individual sources with space interferometers such as the proposed Laser Interferometric Space Antenna ( LISA ) .	The number of inspiral , merger and ringdown events above a signal to noise ratio of 5 that result from massive black hole seeds is of order 10^3 .
Examining the star-counts profile of the stream plus contaminating populations , we find no evidence for significant under-densities , and find only a single significant over-density .	This is at odds with earlier studies based on matched-filter maps derived from shallower SDSS data if the contaminating population possesses plausible spatial properties .
This implies that the presence or lack of star formation in group-scale centrals can not be a stochastic process .	By z=0 , the offset reverses , probably as a result of the different growth rates of these objects .
Here , we address the instability of the flow inside a precessing cylinder in the general case .	We first show that the base flow forced by the cylinder precession is a superposition of a vertical or horizontal shear flow and an infinite sum of forced modes .
The spiral shocks also produce structure in the spiral arms , provided the gas is cold ( & lt ; 1000 K ) .	When both hot and cold components of the ISM are modeled , this structure is enhanced .
The presence of degenerated discrete minima in the effective potential leads to the solutions of the effective Euclidean equations of motion in the form of the kink-like gauge field configurations interpolating between different minima .

We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to ~10,000 deg^2 of SDSS DR8 data , and present the resulting catalog of ~25,000 clusters over the redshift range 0.08 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.55 .	The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian , with a scatter \sigma_z ~ 0.006 at z~0.1 , increasing to \sigma_z~0.02 at z~0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit .
Calculations based on statistical equilibrium can be implemented in microcanonical ensemble ( energy and number of particles in the system are kept fixed ) , canonical ensemble ( temperature and number of particles are kept fixed ) or grand canonical ensemble ( fixed temperature and a variable number of particles but with an assigned average ) .	This paper deals with calculations with canonical ensembles .
Our studies indicate that metallic screening from the electrodes is affected by the difference in work functions at oxide surfaces .	We demonstrate this effect in ferroelectric PbTiO $ _3 $ and BaTiO $ _3 $ films .
This sensitivity to dark photon dark matter exceeds the indirect bounds derived from stellar energy loss considerations over a significant fraction of the available mass range .

A well-studied special case is cut sparsification in graphs , which has found various applications .	We show that a VCSP instance consisting of a single boolean predicate $ P ( x , y ) $ ( e.g. , for cut , $ P=\mbox { XOR } $ ) can be sparsified into $ O ( |V|/\epsilon^2 ) $ constraints if and only if the number of inputs that satisfy $ P $ is anything but one ( i.e. , $ |P^ { -1 } ( 1 ) | \neq 1 $ ) .
We establish a quantum measure of classicality in the form of the occupation number , $ N $ , of gravitons in a gravitational field .	This allows us to view classical background geometries as quantum Bose-condensates with large occupation numbers of soft gravitons .
Several tests have been performed under realistic beam conditions to test the feasibility of the measurement and the proof of principle of the trigger system .	The positive results of such measurements are shown in this contribution together with the expected rates extracted from simulations .
They may be depicted as `` SUSY quivers '' in which the nodes represent a gauge group with extended e.g. , N=4 SUSY whereas links represent bifundamental matter fields which transform as chiral multiplets with respect to different N=1 subgroups .	One can obtain this type of field theories from simple D6-brane configurations on Type IIA string theory compactified on a six-torus .
There are four categories of magneto-electronic energy spectra , namely monolayer-like , bilayer-like , coexistent , and highly distorted quasi-Landau-level spectra .	They are mainly characterized by unusual spatial distributions of wave functions , and their density of states shows many prominent symmetric and weakly asymmetric peaks .
We present the discovery of a companion near the deuterium burning mass limit located at a very wide distance , at an angular separation of 4.6+/-0.1 arcsec ( projected distance of ~ 670 AU ) from UScoCTIO108 , a brown dwarf of the very young Upper Scorpius association .	Optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy confirm the cool nature of both objects , with spectral types of M7 and M9.5 , respectively , and that they are bona fide members of the association , showing low gravity and features of youth .
We investigate the statistical properties of the polarized emission of extragalactic radio sources and estimate their contribution to the power spectrum of polarization fluctuations in the microwave region .

For the Yarkovsky effect we perform a Monte Carlo simulation that fully accounts for the uncertainty in the physical characterization , especially for the unknown spin orientation .	By mapping the uncertainty information onto the 2029 b-plane and identifying the keyholes corresponding to subsequent impacts we assess the impact risk for future encounters .
We consider the inelastic Maxwell model , which consists of a collection of particles that are characterized by only their velocities , and evolving through binary collisions and external driving .	At any instant , a particle is equally likely to collide with any of the remaining particles .
In particular the sequence will determine the possible secondary structures that the ssRNA will take in solution .	In this work , we use a mean field theory to investigate how the secondary structure of the RNA combined with electrostatic interactions affects the efficiency of assembly and stability of the assembled virions .
The linear operator of the model is shown to be non-normal and the results suggest that the nonnormality of a collisionless plasma is intrinsically related to its kinetic nature , with the transient growth being more accentuated for smaller scales and higher plasma beta .	The results based on linear spectral theory have been confirmed with nonlinear simulations .
We introduce the class of Interrupt Timed Automata ( ITA ) , a subclass of hybrid automata well suited to the description of timed multi-task systems with interruptions in a single processor environment .	While the reachability problem is undecidable for hybrid automata we show that it is decidable for ITA .
Although most studies in optics have focussed on how nonlinearity can drive rogue wave emergence , purely linear effects have also been shown to induce extreme wave amplitudes .	In this paper , we report a detailed experimental study of linear rogue waves in an optical system , using a spatial light modulator to impose random phase structure on a coherent optical field .
We present in this paper a perturbative theory for the structure functions and the response functions of the hydrodynamic velocity field in real space and time .

The proof is computer assisted .	Starting from an explicit approximate solution , we show that nearby there is a true solution .
And yet , from a rational point of view , this type of support and belief is not justifiable at all .	The best we can hope when describing the real world , as far as we know , is to have probabilistic knowledge , to have probabilities associated to each statement .
Solar magnetism is measured with different indexes : for instance the MPSI and the MWSI , number of sunspots , radio flux at 10.7 cm , Ca II K , Mg II K , EUV , He I or L_alpha .	Bachmann & amp ; White ( 1994 ) had compared these indicators of the solar activity showing a hysteresis of the solar cycle variations and a time lag between these indices not related to instrumental effects .
As a result , methods from our earlier work can be applied to show that this extension satisfies various derived rules , such as a derived compactness rule for Cantor space and a derived continuity rule for Baire space .	Finally , we show that this extension is robust in the sense that it is also reflected by the model constructions from algebraic set theory just mentioned .
Sets of lengths and sets of catenary degrees are well studied invariants describing the arithmetic of $ H $ in the non-factorial case .	In this note we focus on the set $ Ca ( H ) $ of catenary degrees of $ H $ and on the set $ \mathcal R ( H ) $ of distances in minimal relations .

In each case , we directly resolve a dust-depleted disk cavity around the central star .	Using radiative transfer calculations , we interpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous , parametric model framework by reproducing their SMA visibilities and SEDs .
Here , using a prototypical example of a bistable self-regulating gene model , we develop a theoretical framework describing the combined effect of intrinsic and extrinsic noise on the dynamics of stochastic genetic switches .	Employing our theory and Monte Carlo simulations , we show that extrinsic noise not only significantly alters the lifetimes of the phenotypic states , but can induce bistability in unexpected regions of parameter space , and may fundamentally change the escape mechanism .
Previous works in this direction , however , mainly focus on the single-node case without considering strict resource constraints .	In this paper , a game-theoretic model for protecting a system of multiple nodes against stealthy attacks is proposed .
We find that if the inhomogeneous terms break the SU ( 2 ) spin symmetry the binding between holes is tremendously enhanced in the thermodynamic limit .	In any other model ( including homogeneous models ) the binding in the thermodynamic limit is small or neglible .
Such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function .	We propose a preheating model where the medium around low-mass haloes is preheated by gravitational pancaking .

Limits are placed on thirteen antiproton decay modes .	The results include the first explicit experimental limits on the muonic decay modes of the antiproton , and the first limits on the decay modes e- gamma gamma , and e- omega .
We show that the absence of observed stable luminous LMBHB implies that upon RLOF by the low-mass donor angular momentum losses are substantially reduced with respect to the Verbunt and Zwaan `` standard '' prescription for magnetic braking .	Under this assumption masses and effective temperatures of the model secondaries of LMBHB are in a satisfactory agreement with the masses and effective temperatures ( as inferred from their spectra ) of the observed donors in LMBHB .
Though the statistical analysis of ranking data has been a subject of interest over the past centuries , especially in economics , psychology or social choice theory , it has been revitalized in the past 15 years by recent applications such as recommender or search engines and is receiving now increasing interest in the machine learning literature .	Numerous modern systems indeed generate ranking data , representing for instance ordered results to a query or user preferences .
The right-handed neutrinos are also assigned 2 for the first and second generations and $ 1_1 $ for the third generation , respectively .	Taking vacuum alignments of relevant gauge singlet scalars , we predict the quark mixing as well as the tri-bimaximal mixing of neutrino flavors .
A famous folk theorem says that the only homogeneous , quasi-a\-rith\-me\-tic means are power means .	We prove that , upon replacing the homogeneity requirement by an invariant-type axiom , one gets a family of quasi-arithmetic means building up a scale , too .
We present a comparative study of the circumstellar disks in Be/X-ray binaries and isolated Be stars based upon the H-alpha emission line .

We have extended a sense of a Hurst factor by consideration of a phase diffusion power law .	It was shown that pre-catastrophic stabilization as an indicator of bifurcation leads to a new minimum of momentary phase diffusion , while bifurcation causes an increase of the momentary transport .
They do too little to address the problems raised by today 's increasingly distributed projects ; neither do they facilitate collaborative and interactive development practices .	A consequence is the continued reliance of today 's IDEs on paradigms such as traditional configuration management , which were developed for earlier modes of operation and hamper collaborative projects .
During repeated measurements the noise peak reduces and the RTN becomes difficult to resolve , suggesting defects being annealed .	The Lorentzian shape noise spectra can be fitted with bias-dependent activation of RTN , with the attempt frequency in the MHz range , consistent with magnon dynamics .
The rate of decrease is the highest for large ions , lowest for small ions and in between the two for intermediate ions .	Total aerosol number concentration decreases in the 4.4 to 163 nm size range but increases in 0.5 to 20 micrmetr size range with wind speed .
We present images and spectra of SBW1 obtained with HST , Spitzer , and Gemini South .	HST images of SBW1 do not exhibit long Rayleigh-Taylor fingers , which are presumed to cause the hotspots in the SN1987A ring , but instead show a geometrically thin clumpy ring .
This is demonstrated with results obtained for the bcc alloy system Fe $ _x $ Co $ _ { 1-x } $ as well as for a series of alloys of permalloy with 5d transition metals .	To account for the thermal displacements of atoms as a scattering mechanism , an alloy-analogy model is introduced .

About 20 % of the type 1 AGN reside within the `Composite ' and `SF ' regions of the BPT diagrams .	These objects also show excess narrow Ha and UV luminosities , for their L_bHa , consistent with contribution from star formation which dominates the narrow lines emission , as expected from their positions in the BPT diagrams.3 .
We also observe in several objects the existence of long-term variability , which seems decoupled from the short-term one .	We interpret the existence of a maximum variability time scale as a possible evidence that the light curves of Type 1 AGN are the result of the superimposition of independent events .
The family of molecular conductors TMTTF/TMTSF-X demonstrates almost all known electronic phases in parallel with a set of weak structural modifications of anion ordering and mysterious structureless transitions .	Only in early 2000 's their nature became elucidated by discoveries of a huge anomaly in the dielectric permittivity and by the NMR evidences for the charge ordering ( disproportionation ) .
Fixed points are found in both models .	The distributions of relaxation time of the mixed model are disperse and become loser to log-normal as the initial concentration of down spins approaches 0.5 , whereas for pure antiferromagnetic spins they are collapsed into one master curve which is roughly lognormal .

Axisymmetric magnetic lines of nanometer sizes ( chiral vortices or skyrmions ) have been predicted to exist in a large group of noncentrosymmetric crystals more than two decades ago .	Recently these magnetic textures have been directly observed in nanolayers of cubic helimagnets and monolayers of magnetic metals .
In contrast to the previously known results , the particular torus knot corresponds not to the partition function of the gauge theory but to the particular instanton contribution and summation over the knots has to be performed in order to obtain the complete answer .	The instantons are sitting almost at the top of each other and the physics of the `` fat point '' where the UV degrees of freedom are slaved with point-like instantons turns out to be quite rich .
This property may lead to interesting low-energy effects such as electric charge non-conservation on the brane ( decay of electron to nothing ) .	One may worry that light charged Kaluza -- Klein modes would lead to unacceptable phenomenology due to their copious production in , e.g. , electron-positron annihilation and/or their contribution to QED observables like anomalous magnetic moments .
We have numerically calculated the frequency-dependent magneto-optical and zero-field conductivity of this material using the Kane model .	The calculations show good agreement with recent experimental measurements .
It is shown by Connes , Douglas and Schwarz that gauge theory on noncommutative torus describes compactifications of M-theory to tori with constant background three-form field .	This indicates that noncommutative gauge theories on more general manifolds also can be useful in string theory .
Binding of 57Fe atoms in a metallic chromium was investigated in a Cr-Fe alloy , containing less than 0.1 at % Fe enriched to ~95 % in 57Fe isotope , using 57Fe-site Mossbauer spectroscopy .	The binding force was derived from the Debye temperature , T_D , that , in turn , was calculated from the temperature dependence of the central shift of the Mossbauer spectra recorded in the range of 80 to 330 K. Following a temperature dependence of the line width that shows a minimum at ~155 K , two temperature intervals were considered : a low temperature one ( LT ) ranging from 80 to 155 K , and the T_D - value of 292 ( 12 ) K or 279 ( 34 ) K , and a high temperature one ( HT ) ranging from 155 to 330 K with the T_D - value of 399 ( 15 ) or 399 ( 25 ) K , depending on the fitting procedure .
We report simulations to gain an understanding of the sources of error and their dependence on parameters the experimenter can control .	We suggest an algorithm , and we find optimal parameters an experimenter can use to minimize total error and pixel locking .
The dwarf ellipticals of the present sample have constant velocity dispersion profiles within their effective radii and do not show significant rotation , hence are clearly anisotropic .	The dwarf lenticulars , instead , rotate faster and are , at least partially , supported by rotation .
We analyze the gapped phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model perturbatively in the isolated-dimer limit .	Our analysis is based on the continuous unitary transformations method which allows one to compute the spectrum as well as matrix elements of operators between eigenstates , at high order .

In this work , utilizing the unitarized chiral perturbation theory , we explore the consequences of these symmetries in the description of the interactions between the ground-state singly charmed ( bottom ) baryons and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons .	In particular , at leading order in the chiral expansion , by fixing the only parameter in the theory to reproduce the $ \Lambda_b ( 5912 ) $ [ $ \Lambda_b^* ( 5920 ) $ ] or the $ \Lambda_c ( 2595 ) $ [ $ \Lambda_c^* ( 2625 ) $ ] , we predict a number of dynamically generated states , which are contrasted with those of other approaches and available experimental data .

Together with providing constraints on emission models , this information has yielded a means by which potential sources of TeV emission may be identified and predictions made as to their possible gamma-ray flux .	We have used the Whipple telescope to search for TeV gamma-ray emission from eight objects selected from a list of such candidates .
We study spatial correlations in the transport of energy between two baths at different temperatures .	To do this , we introduce a minimal model in which energy flows from one bath to another through two subsystems .
We construct a simple , observationally viable model with a slightly red scalar power-spectrum and suppressed gravitational waves ; we comment on the presence of additional observational signatures originating from IR-cascading and individual massive particles .	We also show that moduli-trapping at an ESL is suppressed for D & gt ; & gt ; d , hindering dynamical selection of high-symmetry vacua on the landscape based on this mechanism .
We present a phenomenological fluid dynamics model for a dilatant fluid , i.e.a severe shear thickening fluid , by introducing a state variable .	The Navier-Stokes equation is coupled with the state variable field , which evolves in response to the local shear stress as the fluid is sheared .
The shapes of these reflexes in the time-energy plane depict the variation of the group velocity induced by excitonic resonances .	Modeling of the shapes , as well as other spectra , shows that a homogeneous width of the order of 10 \mu eV characterizes the exciton-polariton resonances within the crystal .
This allowed us to investigate the thermodynamic limit as well as the finite size properties of the corresponding spin chain in the massless regime .	The leading behaviour of the finite size corrections to the spectrum is conjectured for arbitrary $ m $ .
Three specific derivatives are described : convective , corotational , and directional .	The covariance is made explicit by working in arbitrary time-dependent coordinates , instead of restricting to Eulerian ( fixed ) or Lagrangian ( material ) coordinates .
It is found that the linear generalized uncertainty principle ( GUP ) approach gives a non-physical result .	Based on large scale Schwarzshild solution , the quadratic GUP approach is utilized .
Although these models can reproduce most of the observed features , some remain unexplained .	Two possible causes for the discrepancies between observations and model predictions are discussed in this paper : ( a ) the models are not realistic enough ; ( b ) an additional energy source is needed .
The high spectral resolution of our Fabry-Perot system allows us to separate the Galactic signal from the much larger local sources of H alpha emission , such as the Earth 's geocorona .	For the two bands ( at declination -62 and -63 degrees ) , we find a total mean emission of about 1 Rayleigh with variations of about 0.3 R. The variations are within the estimated uncertainty of our total intensity determinations .
The integration of the cumulative flux per unit area leads to f = 2.6E-10 ergs/cm**2/sec/sr , which is about 1 % of the known 20 - 40 keV X-ray background .	We present the first luminosity function of AGNs in the 20-40 keV energy range , based on 38 extragalactic objects detected by the imager IBIS/ISGRI on-board INTEGRAL .

In our model , agents who do not adopt the product spread negative word of mouth to their neighbors , and so their neighborhood becomes less susceptible to the product .	The result is a dramatic increase in the percolation threshold .
Particular attention is given to a hybrid approach , which reproduces the Debye-H $ \ddot { \text { u } } $ ckel asymptote in the limit of weak coupling , the ion sphere ( 3D ) and ion disc ( 2D ) asymptotes in the limit of strong coupling , and provides reasonable interpolation between these two limits .	More accurate ways to estimate the internal energy of 2D and 3D OCP are also discussed .
We find that discs are generally young , with stars spanning a wide range in stellar age : the youngest stars define thin discs and have near-circular orbits , while the oldest stars form thicker discs which rotate ~2 times slower than the thin components , and have 2-3 times larger velocity dispersions .	Unlike the discs , spheroids form early and on short time-scales , and are dominated by velocity dispersion .
The scattering matrix is given by the virtual electronic excitations from Mn $ 1s $ level to unoccupied Mn $ 4p $ level .	We find that orbital dependence of the Coulomb interaction between Mn $ 3d $ and Mn $ 4p $ electrons is essential to bring about the anisotropy of the scattering factor near the K edge .
The algorithm moves between models with different numbers of arrival groups as well as between models with different numbers of behavioural groups .	The approach is shown to provide new ecological insights about the stopover behaviour of semipalmated sandpipers but is generally applicable to any population in which animals arrive in groups and potentially exhibit heterogeneity in terms of one or more other processes .

It has been conjectured that these tachyonic instabilities correspond to decays of the orbifolds into flat space or into orbifolds with smaller deficit angles .	We examine this conjecture using closed string field theory , with the string field truncated to low-level tachyons .
The clusters consisted of around 60 hollow glass spheres with a diameter of 22 microns that were suspended in a plasma of rf discharge in argon .	The particles were confined in a glass box with conductive yet transparent coating on its four side walls , this allowed to manipulate the particle cluster by biasing the confining walls in a certain sequence .
The resulting equation is then effectively linearized into three self-consistent , time-reversal invariant , cranking-type equations using a variational method .	The relation of the equations to the phenomenological hydrodynamic collective Bohr-Davydov-Faessler-Greiner model is discussed .
We find that the major axes of galaxies in filaments tend to be preferentially aligned with the directions of the filaments , while galaxies in sheets have their major axes preferentially aligned parallel to the plane of the sheets .	The strength of this alignment signal is strongest for red , central galaxies , and in good agreement with that of dark matter halos in N-body simulations .
The challenge arises as traffic flows have sharp nonlinearities resulting from transitions from free flow to breakdown and then to congested flow .	Our methodology uses a deep learning architecture to capture nonlinear spatio-temporal flow effects .
When a rotating neutron star loses angular momentum , the reduction of the centrifugal force makes it contract .	This perturbs each fluid element , raising the local pressure and originating deviations from beta equilibrium , inducing reactions that release heat ( rotochemical heating ) .
A \emph { $ K_4 $ -minor rooted } at $ a , b , c , d $ consists of four pairwise-disjoint pairwise-adjacent connected subgraphs of $ G $ , respectively containing $ a , b , c , d $ .	We characterise precisely when $ G $ contains a $ K_4 $ -minor rooted at $ a , b , c , d $ by describing six classes of obstructions , which are the edge-maximal graphs containing no $ K_4 $ -minor rooted at $ a , b , c , d $ .
Novelty search is a recent artificial evolution technique that challenges traditional evolutionary approaches .	In novelty search , solutions are rewarded based on their novelty , rather than their quality with respect to a predefined objective .
2003 , A & amp ; A , v.399 , p.421 ) .	This robust and manifold nonmodal effect was found to involve regimes of transient algebraic growth ( for purely ejectional flows ) , and exponential instabilities of both usual and parametric nature .
In this paper , we study eigenvalues of the operator $ \mathcal { L } _r $ on $ M $ , where $ \mathcal { L } _r $ is defined by $ $ \mathcal { L } _r=e^ { \frac { |x|^2 } { 2 } } { \rm div } ( e^ { -\frac { |x|^2 } { 2 } } T^r\nabla\cdot ) $ $ with $ T^r $ denoting a positive definite ( 0,2 ) -tensor field on $ M $ .	We obtain `` universal '' inequalities for eigenvalues of the operator $ \mathcal { L } _r $ .

Here our result fully covers the previous case for $ n=1 $ in `` M.W .
The HDs obtained for all investigated models are very well fitted by the theoretically predicted Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble ( GOE ) distribution .	The first cumulant has a shift that vanishes as $ t^ { -1/3 } $ , while the cumulants of order $ 2\le n\le 4 $ converge to GOE as $ t^ { -2/3 } $ or faster , behaviors previously observed in other KPZ systems .
In this case , the magnetization $ m ( t ) $ of the system oscillates around $ m ( t ) =0 $ .	Implications for social systems are discussed .
In particular , the catenary degree and delta set invariants are both eventually periodic , and the omega-primality invariant is eventually quasilinear .	In this paper , we demonstrate how each of these invariants is determined by Hilbert functions of graded modules .
Modified shocks with Lorentz factors less than about 3 can have compression ratios considerably greater than 3 and the momentum distribution of energetic particles no longer follows a power law relation .	These results may be important for the interpretation of gamma-ray bursts if mildly relativistic internal and/or afterglow shocks play an important role accelerating particles that produce the observed radiation .
Evaluating the spreading of a droplet on a completely wetting surface , the Voinov-Tanner-Cox law ( $ \theta \propto \text { Ca } ^ { 1/3 } $ ) can be observed .	At later times scaling follows $ r \propto t^ { 1/2 } $ , suggesting spreading is limited by inertia .

This article exemplifies how SPOT can be used for automatic and interactive tuning .
As in many previous studies , in our N-body collisionless simulation , the B/PS is due to the classical break in the z mirror symmetry lasting roughly 200 Myr .	When a gaseous component and star formation recipes are added to the simulation , the bulge-growing mechanism is quite different .
Some of the observed phonon modes show anomalous softening below the magnetic transition temperature T $ _N $ ( ~ 46K ) .	We attribute this anomalous softening to the spin-phonon coupling caused by phonon modulation of the super-exchange integral between the Mn $ ^ { 3+ } $ spins .
We present a new supervised architecture termed Mediated Mixture-of-Experts ( MMoE ) that allows us to improve classification accuracy of Deep Convolutional Networks ( DCN ) .	Our architecture achieves this with the help of expert networks : A network is trained on a disjoint subset of a given dataset and then run in parallel to other experts during deployment .

In contrast to most of the previous works , this analysis shows that for masses below ~1 TeV resonant New Physics could accommodate the experimental data .	In general , we find that axial-like couplings are preferred for light and top quark couplings , and that only top quark couples strongly to New Physics .
Even in their simplest 1D architectures , they display complex topological phenomena , which can be employed in the systematic study of topological quantum phase transitions [ 1 ] .	Due to the exponential scaling in the number of resources required , most experimental realizations of QWs up to date have been limited to single particles , with only a few implementations involving correlated quantum pairs .

The theory is applied to ferromagnetic manganites with a full discussion of magnetic , transport and spectroscopic data .	It is found that many manganites are in the critical regime on the verge of small-polaron formation , which explains their sensitivity to parameters such as applied magnetic field and pressure .
The Weakly Interacting Massive Particle ( WIMP ) is one of the main candidates for the relic dark matter ( DM ) .In the effective low-energy minimal supersymmetric standard model ( effMSSM ) the neutralino-nucleon spin and scalar cross sections in the low-mass regime were calculated .	The calculated cross sections are compared with almost all experimental currently available exclusion curves for spin-dependent WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron cross sections .

Here , the nonuniqueness of C is demonstrated at a more fundamental level : It is shown that the perturbation expansion for Q actually has the more general form $ Q=Q_0+\epsilon Q_1+\epsilon^2 Q_2+\ldots $ in which { \it all } powers and not just odd powers of $ \epsilon $ appear .	For the case in which $ H_0 $ is the harmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian , $ Q_0 $ is calculated exactly and in closed form and it is shown explicitly to be nonunique .

The resolution attained by such observations ( best than 1 mas ) is a powerful tool to probe the interaction that takes place after a supernova goes off .	The direct imaging of a supernova permits , in principle , to estimate the deceleration of its expansion , and to obtain information on the eject and circumstellar density profiles , as well as estimates of the magnetic field intensity and relativistic particle energy density in the supernova .
We present the results of study of a possible relationship between the space weather and terrestrial markets of agricultural products .	It is shown that to implement the possible effect of space weather on the terrestrial harvests and prices , a simultaneous fulfillment of three conditions is required : 1 ) sensitivity of local weather ( cloud cover , atmospheric circulation ) to the state of space weather ; 2 ) sensitivity of the area of specific agricultural crops to the weather anomalies ( belonging to the area of risk farming ) ; 3 ) relative isolation of the market , making it difficult to damp the price hikes by the external food supplies .
We also calculate the overlap between the exact numerical ground state and the analytical Laughlin state as well as the excitation gap as a function of density .	For the three physical systems we consider the calculated overlap is found to be large in the experimental electron density range .

In this paper we present a Fuzzy Logic control approach designed to stabilize a multi-input multi-output magnetic suspension system .	The system has four cubic floaters and four actuators that apply magnetic forces on the floaters , the suspension is performed by changing the voltages applied on the actuators , hence changing their currents , producing vertical magnetic forces that balance with the gravitational force .
We have modeled observations on a 2.5-meter class telescope to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the two techniques .	While the differences are relatively minor , we find that Speckle Stabilization is a viable competitor to current Lucky Imaging systems .

Thus , such games are r-SM-determined .
The remarkable discrepancy between theory and data on the p_t distribution of J/psi polarization in the process pp - & gt ; J/psi+X has been standing as a puzzle for a long time .	Our early work indicates that if only considering the color-singlet state , NLO corrections may drastically change the distribution , but are not sufficient to accommodate the data .

Taking stock of this diagnostic , we conclude that many of the interventions to address the so-called liquidity crisis and to encourage more consumption are ill-advised and even dangerous , given that precautionary reserves were not accumulated in the `` good times '' but that huge liabilities were .	The most `` interesting '' present times constitute unique opportunities but also great challenges , for which we offer a few recommendations .
The intelligent relays are able to gather channel state information , perform linear processing and forward signals whereas the dumb relays is only able to serve as amplifiers .	As the dumb relays are oblivious to the source and destination nodes , the wireless network can be modeled as a relay network with *smart instantaneous relay* only : the signals of source-destination arrive at the same time as source-relay-destination .
In this paper , we consider weights of product type , and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the Lorentz spaces , defined with respect to the two-dimensional decreasing rearrangement , to be normable .	To this end , it is also useful to study the mixed norm Lorentz spaces .

The considerable scatter of the s- and r-process elements observed in low-metallicity stars , compared to the small star to star scatter observed for the alpha elements , is an open question for the chemical evolution studies .	We have developed a stochastic chemical evolution model , in which the main assumption is a random formation of new stars , subject to the condition that the cumulative mass distribution follows a given initial mass function .
Internal 'gauge ' degrees of freedom are made explicit in the frequency domain by introducing the complex nodal S-matrix as a function of operators that act on external or internal fields or virtually couple the two .	As a main benefit , many techniques and results gained in the time domain thus generalize straight away .
Images that are highly magnified are often part of multiply-imaged systems , but we consider the possibility of having large magnifications without additional detectable images .	In rare but non-negligible situations , lensing can produce a singly highly magnified image ; this phenomenon is mainly associated with massive cluster-scale halos ( & gt ; ~1e13.5 Msun ) .
We examine the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle on the scattering properties of composite bosons ( cobosons ) made of two fermions , such as the exciton quasiparticle .	The scattering process incorporates boson-phonon interactions that arise due to lattice vibrations .
Then we derived the response function of individual ants to pheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and changes in speed or direction of the ants .	Ants were found to turn in response to local pheromone concentrations , while their speed was largely unaffected by these concentrations .
However , the method suffers from numerous shortcomings , such as being subjective as well as time and labour intensive .	Computer Aided Diagnostic ( CAD ) systems have been developed to address these problems , which automatically classify a HEp-2 cell image into one of its known patterns ( eg. , speckled , homogeneous ) .
The projector-augmented wave ( PAW ) and gauge-including projector-augmented wave ( GIPAW ) models in the periodic plane-wave density functional theory are used .	The crystal data from X-ray measurements , as well as the structures where either all atomic , or only hydrogen atom positions are optimized in the density functional theory are analyzed .
The effects of including higher ( electric and magnetic ) multipoles upon the emitted photon pairs beyond the electric-dipole approximation are also discussed .	Calculations of the coefficients are performed for the transitions $ 2s_ { 1/2 } \rightarrow1s_ { 1/2 } $ , $ 3d_ { 3/2 } \rightarrow1s_ { 1/2 } $ and $ 3d_ { 5/2 } \rightarrow1s_ { 1/2 } $ , along the entire hydrogen isoelectronic sequence ( $ 1\le Z \le 100 $ ) .

We show that the low-excitation objects in our samples \redit { show signs } of radiatively inefficient accretion .	We study the effect of the jet-related emission on the various luminosities , confirming that it is the main source of soft X-ray emission for our sources .
Remarkably , this is so not only at the larger values of l , where the gap between the ground state energy and the low-lying excitations becomes small compared to the mass gap , but also down to much shorter lengths where these excitation energies become large compared to sqrt ( K ) , the flux-tube no longer `looks ' anything like a thin string , and an expansion of the effective string action in powers of 1/l no longer converges .	All this is for flux in the fundamental representation .
We respond to the issues discussed by Farmer and Lillo ( FL ) related to our proposed approach to understanding the origin of power-law distributions in stock price fluctuations .	First , we extend our previous analysis to 1000 US stocks and perform a new estimation of market impact that accounts for splitting of large orders and potential autocorrelations in the trade flow .
The EB phenomenon is evident of an interface exchange coupling between coexisting antiferromagnetic ( AFM ) and ferromagnetic ( FM ) phases and confirms the phase separated state of the compound at low temperatures .	The EB effect is found to be strongly dependent on the cooling magnetic field and the temperature , which is associated with the evolution of spontaneous AFM - FM phase separated state of the compound .
Particles are accelerated up to relativistic energies in a compact region located near the base of the jet , where most of the emission is produced .	We calculate the production spectrum due to proton and electron synchrotron radiation and photohadronic interactions .

Instead in the IR , due to the rich dynamics , it safely flows to a non-cascading theory .	We engineer the field theory through intersecting D7-branes with world-volume gauge flux on a conifold with 3-form fluxes , and we find new fully backreacted solutions of Type IIB Supergravity plus branes .
This approach allows decomposing Poisson cohomology into , basically , a Koszul cohomology and a relative cohomology .	Moreover , we investigate this associated Koszul cohomology , highlight its tight connections with Spectral Theory , and reduce the computation of this main building block of Poisson cohomology to a problem of linear algebra .
As a first step , a sufficiently large sample of pulsating PMS stars has to be established , which allows to select candidates optimally suited for a detailed asteroseismological analysis based on photometry from space or ground based network data .	A search for pulsating PMS members in the young open clusters IC 4996 and NGC 6530 has been performed to improve the sample of known PMS pulsators .
Recent proposals for resolving the noted inconsistency seem unsatisfactory in that they ignore the crucial role of gravity in the saturation of Lorentz boosts .	Furthermore , an invariant length at he Planck scale amounts to a universal quantum of resolution in the fabric of spacetime .
The measurement of the hadron excitation spectra therefore gives valuable input for theory and phenomenology to quantitatively understand this phenomenon .	One simple model to describe hadrons is the Constituent Quark Model ( CQM ) , which knows two types of hadrons : mesons , consisting of a quark and an antiquark , and baryons , which are made out of three quarks .
The $ SL ( 2 , \R ) $ -action in the Hennings construction comes from the natural action on $ \cal N $ and in the case of the Frohman-Nicas theory from the Hard-Lefschetz decomposition of the U ( 1 ) -moduli spaces given that they are naturally K\ '' ahler .	The irreducible components of this TQFT , corresponding to simple representations of $ SL ( 2 , \Z ) $ and $ Sp ( 2g , \Z ) $ , thus yield a large family of homological TQFT 's by taking sums and products .
Two familiar notions of correlation are rediscovered as the extreme operating points for distributed synthesis of a discrete memoryless channel , in which a stochastic channel output is generated based on a compressed description of the channel input .	Wyner 's common information is the minimum description rate needed .

A total of 56 bona-fide Cepheids were discovered , with periods ranging from 5 to ~50 days ; five of these are likely Population II Cepheids of the W Virginis class , associated with the bulge or halo of NGC 5128 .	Based on the period and V and I-band luminosities of a sub-sample of 42 classical ( Pop I ) Cepheids , and adopting a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus and extinction of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and E ( B-V ) =0.10 mag , respectively , the true reddening-corrected distance modulus to NGC 5128 is mu_0 = 27.67 +/- 0.12 ( random ) +/- 0.16 ( systematic ) mag , corresponding to a distance of 3.42 +/- 0.18 ( random ) +/- 0.25 ( systematic ) Mpc .
The quark loops are calculated with $ Z_2 $ noise vectors and unbiased subtractions , and multiple nucleon sources are employed to reduce the statistical errors .	We obtain 5 $ \sigma $ signals for $ & lt ; x & gt ; $ for the $ u , d , $ and $ s $ quarks , but $ & lt ; x^2 & gt ; $ is consistent with zero within errors .
The data show that magnetic flux density contains a significant amount of intrinsically weak fields that contribute little to brightness .	We show that with data of high spatial resolution a calibration of magnetic flux density as a proxy for brightness excess is possible .
We show that all such realizations have a common underlying feature , namely a dimensional truncation of the charge lattice , and we identify such dimensional truncations with certain irregular embeddings of higher-level and non-simply laced gauge groups within level-one simply-laced gauge groups .	This identification allows us to formulate a direct mapping between a given subgroup embedding , and the sorts of GSO constraints that are necessary in order to realize the embedding in string theory .
We investigate dynamics of semi-quantal spin systems in which quantum bits are attached to classically and possibly stochastically moving classical particles .	The interaction between the quantum bits takes place when the respective classical particles get close to each other in space .
The average access time decays with the distance in hierarchy $ \Delta q $ as a power $ & lt ; t_ { aw } & gt ; \sim ( \Delta q ) ^ { -\theta } $ .	The access to highly connected nodes is orders of magnitude shorter compared to the standard random walk , suggesting the adaptive walk as an efficient message-passing algorithm on this class of graphs .
Let $ t $ be random and uniformly distributed in the interval $ [ T,2T ] $ , and consider the quantity $ N ( t+1/\log T ) - N ( t ) $ , a count of zeros of the Riemann zeta function in a box of height $ 1/\log T $ .	Conditioned on the Riemann hypothesis , we show that the probability this count is greater than $ x $ decays at least as quickly as $ e^ { -Cx\log x } $ , uniformly in $ T $ .
Two separated levels of functionality are identified in the nanostructure which covers the wings of the grey cicada $ \textit { Cicada orni } $ ( Hemiptera ) .	The upper level is responsible for superhydrophobic character of the wing while the lower level enhances its anti-reflective behavior .
The first step to building merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to identify these structures in each of the time outputs ( snapshots ) produced by the simulation .	Even though we discuss a particular implementation of such an algorithm ( called AdaptaHOP ) in this paper , we believe that our results do not depend on the exact details of the implementation but extend to most if not all ( sub ) structure finders .
The gas consists of neutrons , protons , alpha particles , and 8980 species of nuclei with $ A \ge 12 $ and masses from the finite-range droplet model ( FRDM ) .	At very low density , the Virial expansion reduces to nuclear statistical equilibrium .
This analysis is conducted with the software package GINS which has the capability to process data from all five techniques together .	Such a combination at the observation level should ultimately facilitate fine geophysical studies of the global Earth system .
We obtain expressions for the current operator in the lowest Landau level ( L.L.L . )	field theory , where higher Landau level mixing due to various external and interparticle interactions is sytematically taken into account .
We compare the experimental dipolar relaxation rate with a calculation based on a multiple Fermi Golden Rule approach , when the lattice sites are symmetric , and the magnetic field is parallel to the lattice axis .	We also show that an almost complete suppression of dipolar relaxation is obtained below a magnetic field threshold set by the depth of the lattice : 1D quantum gases in an excited Zeeman state then become metastable .
In particular , we investigate the role of chain stiffness on the free energy profile and folding routes .	We evaluate the applicability of simpler approximations in which the conformations of the protein molecule along the folding route are restricted to have residues that are either entirely folded or unfolded in contiguous stretches .
In addition to a quadratic decay in time upon triggering the excitation , we identify non-analytic terms in the time expansion similar to those found in the Fermi edge singularity phenomenon .	We also demonstrate that the exponential decay in time in the long-time limit is inconsistent with the GW approximation for the self-energy .
We describe how our MN lexicon was semi-automatically produced and we demonstrate that a structure-based MN tagger results in precision around 86 % ( depending on genre ) for tagging of a standard LDC data set .	We apply our MN annotation scheme to statistical machine translation using a syntactic framework that supports the inclusion of semantic annotations .
Under applied magnetic fields , T_c is suppressed anisotropically for fields perpendicular and parallel to the ab-plane , suggesting that the crystalline anisotropy strongly influences the superconducting state .	Preliminary high-pressure measurements show that T_c passes through a maximum of nearly 14 K at ~ 110 kbar , demonstrating that significantly higher T_c values may be achieved in the phosphorus-based oxypnictides .
Enhancement of the diffraction peaks due to ferromagnetic or cluster glass ordering is observed below $ T_C=55 $ K. The moments evolve at first on Co sites , and ordering of Ising-type Tb $ ^ { 3+ } $ moments is induced at lower temperatures by a molecular field due to Co ions .	The final magnetic configuration is collinear F $ _x $ for cobalt subsystem , while it is canted F $ _x $ C $ _y $ for terbium ions .
If the overall cost exceeds the node capacity , the node fails and all subtransaction incident to the node , and their parent distributed transactions , are aborted .	A TON resilience can be measured in terms of either external workloads or intrinsic node fault rates that cause the TON to partially or fully choke .
We adapt White 's density matrix renormalisation group ( DMRG ) to the direct study of critical phenomena .	We use the DMRG to generate transformations in the space of coupling constants .
These give rise to number fields of degree n , signature ( r , s ) , Galois group S_n , and squarefree discriminant ; we may also force the discriminant to be coprime to any given integer .	The number of fields produced with discriminant in the range [ -N , N ] is at least c N^ ( 1/ ( n-1 ) ) .
A central question for this model is whether the critical density $ \mu_c $ for sustained activity is strictly between $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ .	It was known that $ \mu_c & gt ; 0 $ on $ \mathbb { Z } ^d $ , $ d \geq 1 $ , and that $ \mu_c & lt ; 1 $ on $ \mathbb { Z } $ for small enough sleeping rate .
In the currently accepted models of the nonlinear optics , the nonlinear radiation was treated as the result of an infinitesimally thin polarization sheet layer , and a three layer model was generally employed .	The direct consequence of this approach is that an apriori dielectric constant , which still does not have a clear definition , has to be assigned to this polarization layer .
The photo-z error behaviour was analysed to select cleaner subsamples with more secure photo-z estimates .	We consider Hyperz , BPZ , and the code used in the CADIS , COMBO-17 , and HIROCS surveys.Results .
It is consistent with the statement omega = & lt ; ( gamma-1 ) /nu , as well as with the value omega = 1/8 of the GFD theory .	We reconsider the MC estimation of omega from smaller lattice sizes to show that it does not lead to conclusive results , since the obtained values of omega depend on the particular method chosen .
We have carried out a series of simulations of disc-star interactions using an SPH code which treats self-gravity , hydrodynamic and viscous forces .	We find that interactions between discs and stars provide a mechanism for removing energy from , or adding energy to , the orbits of the stars , and for truncating the discs .
We reconstruct \gamma-ray opacity of the Universe out to z & lt ; 3-4 using an extensive library of 342 observed galaxy luminosity function surveys extending to high redshifts .	We cover the whole range from UV to mid-IR ( 0.15-25mic ) providing for the first time a robust empirical calculation of the \gamma\gamma-optical depth out to several TeV .
Discontinuous transitions into absorbing states require an effective mechanism that prevents the stabilization of low density states .	They can be found in different systems , such as lattice models or stochastic differential equations ( e.g.Langevin equations ) .
TranSteg ( Trancoding Steganography ) is a fairly new IP telephony steganographic method that functions by compressing overt ( voice ) data to make space for the steganogram by means of transcoding .	It offers high steganographic bandwidth , retains good voice quality and is generally harder to detect than other existing VoIP steganographic methods .
We show that the scattering of a general ( n , n ' ) -system occurs at right angles in the case of zero impact parameter .	We also derive an exact Kahler potential and the metric of the moduli space of the ( n,1 ) -system .
We have conducted an automated search for galaxy clusters within a contiguous 16 square degree I-band survey in the north Galactic hemisphere .	A matched filter detection algorithm identifies 444 cluster candidates in the range 0.2 & lt ; = z & lt ; = 1.2 .
Furthermore , for embedded systems , low power consumption should be generally considered together with high computing performance .	FPGAs , as programmable logic devices able to support different types of fine-grained parallelisms , their power and performance advantages were recognized widely .
We propose a new formulation of logistic PCA which extends Pearson 's formulation of a low dimensional data representation with minimum error to binary data .	Our formulation does not require a matrix factorization , as previous methods do , but instead looks for projections of the natural parameters from the saturated model .
The main focus is the sufficient and necessary conditions on the number of measurements for support recovery to be reliable .	By drawing an analogy between the problem of support recovery and the problem of channel coding over the Gaussian multiple access channel , and exploiting mathematical tools developed for the latter problem , we obtain an information theoretic framework for analyzing the performance limits of support recovery .
This publication provides a coherent treatment for the reactor neutrino flux uncertainties suppression , specially focussed on the latest $ \theta_ { 13 } $ measurement .	The treatment starts with single detector in single reactor site , most relevant for all reactor experiments beyond $ \theta_ { 13 } $ .
The focus is on small scales $ L \sim 10^8-10^ { 10 } $ cm where the Kinetic Alfv\'en wave ( KAW ) regime is active in the interstellar medium .	MHD turbulence converts to a KAW cascade , starting at 10 times the ion gyroradius and continuing to smaller scales .
Quantum effects of the first kind correspond to a dispersive term , similar to the Bohm potential in the quantum hydrodynamic equations for plasmas .	Effects of the second kind are due to the Fermi statistics of the charge carriers and can become the dominant influence for strong degeneracy .
At the prolate minimum , alignment of the low-K states causes the observed first backbending in moment of inertia and we predict a second backbending that has not yet been reported .	At the oblate minimum , quasi-particles having high-K can form long-lived isomeric states .
We herein show that local observation is useful to define the phase of such a system in association with the well-defined phase of the system on the Bethe lattice , that is , an infinite regular tree without boundary .	Above the percolation threshold , the PDFs of the vertex at the center of the CT ( the origin ) and of the vertices near the boundary of the CT ( the leaves ) have different forms , which are also dissimilar to the PDF observed in the ordinary percolating phase of a Euclidean lattice .
Our work takes the view of parameterizing elliptic curves given by their j-invariant , a problematic that arises from using curves with complex multiplication , for instance .	We add to the catalogue the links with Kubert parameterizations of X0 ( 2 ) and X0 ( 4 ) .
For each of these ( 2k ) !	words we define a real valued function on F_k , which is shown to be a quasi-character with small relative defect and which is used as a weight function to define the corresponding order ( the elements of F_k which evaluate to positive real numbers are declared positive in the group ) .
Recent work has demonstrated that the short-timescale brightness variations ( `` flicker '' ) of stars can be used to measure logg to a high accuracy of ~0.1-0.2 dex ( Bastien et al.2013 ) .	Here , we use flicker measurements of 289 bright ( Kepmag & lt ; 13 ) candidate planet-hosting stars with Teff=4500-6650 K to re-assess the stellar parameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties .
Given a set of ranked results for a set of objects ( e.g.web documents , facilities , etc . )	with a distance between any pair , the goal is to select a subset $ S $ satisfying the following three criteria : ( a ) the subset $ S $ satisfies some constraint ( e.g.bounded cardinality ) ; ( b ) the subset contains results of high `` quality '' ; and ( c ) the subset contains results that are `` diverse '' relative to the distance measure .
Newtonian extrudate swell arises when viscous liquids exit long die slits .	The problem is characterised by a stress singularity at the end of the slit which is inherently difficult to capture and strongly influences the predicted swelling of the fluid .
The energy and spectral shape of this cutoff can be calculated with the aid of a numerical code tracing charged particles in the Earth 's magnetic field .	By comparing the cutoff value with that measured by the LAT in different geomagnetic positions , we have obtained several calibration points between ~6 and ~13 GeV with an estimated uncertainty of ~2 % .
However , the slopes of $ dv_1/dy $ at mid-rapidity are calculated to be positive at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } =11.7 $ and 19.6 GeV , and becomes negative above 27 GeV .	Thus the result from the JAM hadronic transport model with nuclear mean-field approach is incompatible with the data .
We study Bayesian optimal control of a general class of smoothly parameterized Markov decision problems .	Since computing the optimal control is computationally expensive , we design an algorithm that trades off performance for computational efficiency .
The matching factor is calculated non-perturbatively with the so-called RI/MOM scheme .	We find that the lattice data are well described by the next-to-leading order ( NLO ) partially quenched chiral perturbation theory ( PQChPT ) up to around a half of the strange quark mass ( $ m_s^ { \rm phys } /2 $ ) .
Tunneling between the two edges of the line junction then leads to a microscopic understanding of a phenomenological description of line junctions introduced some time ago .	The effect of density-density interactions between the two edges is considered , and renormalization group ideas are used to study how the tunneling parameter changes with the length scale .
We argue that the internal part of this shock plane contains the `` black '' disk of radius R ( E ) ~ E^ { 1/2 } filled by such hard partons with the Planck density .	When two fast particles collide the hard graviton production comes from the region of intersection of their black disks .
The observation of neutrino masses leads to the possibility of leptonic mixing and CP violation .	One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model giving rise to neutrino masses consists of the introduction of one righthanded neutrino field per generation , singlet of SU ( 2 ) .
We present and discuss simulations on isotropic $ N_\sigma^3\times 16 $ lattices with $ N_\sigma=32,48,64,128 $ and $ 128^3 \times N_\tau $ lattices with $ N_\tau=16,24,32,48 $ corresponding to lattice spacings in the range of $ 0.01 fm \lsim a \lsim\ 0.031 fm $ at $ T\simeq1.45T_c $ .	Continuum limit extrapolations of vector meson and pseudo scalar correlators are performed and their large distance expansion in terms of thermal moments is introduced .
To characterize the collective behavior , we introduce scaling transformation of parameter , and detect the tongue-like structure of collective motions in parameter space .	Such collective motion is supported by the separation of time scale , given by the self-consistent relationship between the collective motion and chaotic dynamics of each element .
Numerous studies have shown that different modified theories of gravity can modify the bulk properties ( such as mass and radius ) of neutron stars for given assumptions on the microphysics .	What is not usually stressed though is the strong degeneracy in the predictions of these theories for the stellar mass and radius .
A runner is said to be lonely if she is at distance at least $ 1/ ( k+1 ) $ along the track to every other runner .	The lonely runner conjecture states that every runner gets lonely .
Type Ia supernovae are thought to occur as a white dwarf made of carbon and oxygen accretes sufficient mass to trigger a thermonuclear explosion $ ^ { 1 } $ .	The accretion could occur slowly from an unevolved ( main-sequence ) or evolved ( subgiant or giant ) star $ ^ { 2,3 } $ , that being dubbed the single-degenerate channel , or rapidly as it breaks up a smaller orbiting white dwarf ( the double- degenerate channel ) $ ^ { 3,4 } $ .
The notion of nonpositive curvature in Alexandrov 's sense is extended to include p-uniformly convex Banach spaces .	Infinite dimensional manifolds of semi-negative curvature with a p-uniformly convex tangent norm fall in this class on nonpositively curved spaces , and several well-known results , such as existence and uniqueness of best approximations from convex closed sets , or the Bruhat-Tits fixed point theorem , are shown to hold in this setting , without dimension restrictions .
We assume that the random walk is determined by a probability measure whose support is finite and generates a non-elementary subgroup $ H $ .	We further assume that $ H $ is not consisting only of lifts with respect to any one covering .
This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet population synthesis calculations.Aims .	Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of important disk properties , namely disk metallicity , mass and lifetime on fundamental planetary properties.Methods .
We present the design of two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities in thin diamond membranes well suited for coupling of color centers in diamond .	By comparing simulated and ideal field distributions in Fourier and real space and by according modification of air hole positions and size , we optimize the cavity structure yielding high quality factors up to Q = 320000 with a modal volume of V = 0.35 ( lambda/n ) ^3 .
In this paper , we propose a universal physical mechanism via \textit { vortex-line condensation } { from } a 3d superfluid to achieve all { three } root states .	It naturally produces bulk topological quantum field theory ( TQFT ) description for each root state .
The electrical conductivity and the halfwidth of the surface plasmon resonance are studied in detail for a spherical MN .	Depending on the size of MN , the efficiencies of light absorption and scattering with the temperature change are investigated .
We show that the ferromagnetism in GaMnAs films , known to be hole-mediated , can be modified by He ion irradiation .	The coercivity can be increased by more than three times .
In this paper we define weak entropy solutions for this class of equations and prove well-posedness under weak regularity assumptions on the solutions , e.g.uniqueness is obtained in the class of bounded integrable functions .	Then we introduce a monotone conservative numerical scheme and prove convergence toward an Entropy solution in the class of bounded integrable functions of bounded variation .
Nevertheless , it was called in question recently whether all two-ribbon flares are eruptive .	In this paper , we investigate a two ribbon-like white-light ( WL ) flare that is associated with a failed magnetic flux rope ( MFR ) eruption on 2015 January 13 , which has no accompanying CME in the WL coronagraph .
Aims and Methods : We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum ( GPS ) radio sources at 1.6 GHz .	Of them , 15 sources are selected from the Parkes Half Jansky ( PHJ ) sample ( Snellen 2002 ) , 4 others are from our previous observation list .
We provide a necessary condition for a graph to have an independent $ [ 1,2 ] $ -set , in terms of spanning trees and we prove that this condition is also sufficient for cactus graphs .	We follow the concept of excellent tree and characterize the family of trees such that any vertex belong to some independent $ [ 1,2 ] $ -set .
We compute the canonical partition for quantum black holes in the approach of Loop Quantum Gravity ( LQG ) .	We argue that any quantum theory of gravity in which the horizon area is built of non-interacting constituents can not yield qualitative corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking ( B-H ) area law , but corrections to the area law can arise as a consequence additional constraints inducing interactions between the constituents .
Fitting analytical models for the radial variation in gas density and temperature to X-ray spectral images from the ROSAT PSPC and ASCA GIS , we derive gas entropy profiles for 20 galaxy clusters and groups .	Scaling these profiles to coincide in the self-similar case , the lowest mass systems are found to have higher scaled entropy profiles than more massive systems .
We investigate the action of the magnetorotational instability ( MRI ) in the context of iron-core collapse .	Exponential growth of the field on the rotation time scale by the MRI will dominate the linear growth process of field line `` wrapping '' with the same characteristic time .
It is found that a spectral line may have multiple absorption and emission components depending on how far the region of interaction is from the compact object and what is the distribution of velocity and opacity .	Profiles of spectral lines produced near a neutron star or a black hole can be strongly distorted by Doppler blue- , or red-shifting , and gravitational red-shifting .
With a focus on computational efficiency , however , forsaking solutions quality and accuracy becomes the trade-off .	In this paper , we investigate compressed least-squares problems and propose new models and algorithms that address the issue of error and noise introduced by compression .
We consider spaces of trial wavefunctions for ground states and edge excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect that can be obtained in various ways .	In one way , functions are obtained by analyzing the entanglement of the ground state wavefunction , partitioned into two parts .
In a series of papers we have recently studied the clustering of LRG galaxies in the latest spectroscopic SDSS data release , which has 75000 LRG galaxies sampling 1.1 Gpc^3/h^3 to z=0.47 .	Here we focus on detecting a local maxima shaped as a circular ring in the bidimensional galaxy correlation function \xi ( pi , sigma ) , separated in perpendicular \sigma and line-of-sight \pi distances .
It appears that the Adaptive-Multilevel BDDC algorithm is able to effectively detect troublesome parts on each decomposition level and improve convergence of the method .	The developed open-source parallel implementation shows a good scalability as well as applicability to very large problems and core counts .
In 2008 kaon production off a liquid hydrogen target was measured at & lt ; Q^2 & gt ; = 0.050 ( GeV/c ) ^2 and 0.036 ( GeV/c ) ^2 .	Associated Lambda and Sigma hyperons were identified in the missing mass spectra .
Here these results are applied in certain Laguerre settings .	The procedure is fairly direct for Laguerre function expansions of Hermite type , due to some monotonicity properties of the kernels involved .
We estimate by Monte Carlo simulations the configurational entropy of $ N $ -steps polygons in the cubic lattice with fixed knot type .	By collecting a rich statistics of configurations with very large values of $ N $ we are able to analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the partition function of the problem for different knot types .
On a global scale , these effects and the preferential tidal stripping of single stars tend to roughly balance , leading to overall cluster binary fractions that are roughly constant with time .	Our findings suggest that the current hard binary fraction near the half-mass radius is a good indicator of the hard primordial binary fraction .
An important question concerning the QAH state is whether it is simply a zero-magnetic-field version of the quantum Hall ( QH ) effect , or if there is new physics beyond the conventional paradigm .	Here we report experimental investigations on the quantum phase transition between the two opposite Hall plateaus of a QAH insulator caused by magnetization reversal .
The self consistency is effected by updates of the Poisson equation and the exchange correlation potential at the end of each eigenfunction correction cycle .	The algorithm leads to highly efficient solution of the equations , whereby the ground state electron distribution is obtained in only two or three self consistency iterations on the finest scale .
The resultant formula is simpler and more compact than the traditional description of matrix elements of general many-body operators .	In addition , through the derivation of our new formula , we found that the Pfaffian version of the Lewis Carroll formula corresponds to the relation conjectrured by Balian and Brezin for the HFB theory in 1969 .
This paper presents a brand new methodology to deal with isotopic fine structure calculations .	By using the Poisson approximation in an entirely novel way , we introduce mathematical elegance into the discussion on the trade-off between resolution and tractability .
We calculate the power spectrum of the primordial perturbation , and finally go to second order to find the non-linearity parameter , fNL .	Not surprisingly , we find large positive values of fNL if the energy densities of the curvatons are sub-dominant when they decay , as in the single curvaton case .
The most prevalent explanation to date is the puffed-up inner disk rim model , where the disk exhibits an optically thin cavity around the star up to the distance of dust sublimation .	The critical parameter in this model is the inner disk rim height $ z_ { \rm max } $ relative to the rim distance from the star $ R_ { \rm in } $ .
The methods use quiet-Sun observations at 214 nm and 525 nm images taken by Sunrise on 9 June 2009 .	The function of region growing and mean shift procedure are applied to segment the bright points ( BPs ) and granules , respectively .
We present an angular basis for the DM VDF which can be used to parametrise the distribution in order to mitigate astrophysical uncertainties in future directional experiments and extract information about the DM halo .	This basis consists of discretising the VDF in a series of angular bins , with the VDF being only a function of the DM speed $ v $ within each bin .
Highly-collimated gas ejections are among the most dramatic structures in the Universe , observed to emerge from very different astrophysical systems - from active galactic nuclei down to young brown dwarf stars .	Even with the huge span in spatial scales , there is convincing evidence that the physics at the origin of the phenomenon , namely the acceleration and collimation mechanisms , is the same in all classes of jets .
Its sequence , however , had never been encountered in experimental studies , but was constructed empirically so as to maximize the magnitude of bending in specific computational conditions .	Here we report the results of a similar investigation of another 25-mer B-DNA fragment now with a natural base pair sequence found in a bent locus of a minicircle DNA .
2014 , and the main result by T. Tian and W. Qi , IEEE Transactions on Information Theory , vol.56 , no.1 , pp .	450-454 , Jan. 2010 .
We prove the existence of the solution to this equation and give important properties of the optimal control functional .	Finally we show how the algorithm works for selected models from the literature and compare it with the gradient algorithm .
Their pulsational behaviour is very diversified .	Multiperiodic variability with at least part of the excited modes being nonradial is most common but there are also many cases of high amplitude , presumably radial mode , pulsators .
The latter then translates to the fact that the corresponding 2-cocycle allows a minimal ( none ! )	number of ray classes and this forces a decomposition of $ G $ in cyclic components in a suitable way , cf .
When the coupling is strong the chain is synchronized and demonstrates hyperbolic chaos so that there is one positive Lyapunov exponent .	With the decay of the coupling the second and the third Lyapunov exponents approach zero simultaneously .
For the infinite-range Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model we present a detailed derivation of the density rho ( Delta M ) of the magnetization jumps Delta M. It is obtained by introducing a multi-component generalization of the Parisi-Duplantier equation , which allows us to compute all cumulants of the magnetization .	We find that rho ( Delta M ) ~ ( Delta M ) ^ ( -tau ) with an avalanche exponent tau=1 for the SK model , originating from the marginal stability ( criticality ) of the model .
A coloring of a graph $ G= ( V , E ) $ is a partition $ \ { V_1 , V_2 , \ldots , V_k\ } $ of $ V $ into independent sets or color classes .	A vertex $ v\in V_i $ is a Grundy vertex if it is adjacent to at least one vertex in each color class $ V_j $ for every $ j & lt ; i $ .
Which dictates General Relativity should be reformulated to confer to a `Einstein-Cartan-Weyl ' geometry .	Where it is seen that the Gravitational Constant is the inverse of the Compton wavelength shown through a Weyl gauge potential of form [ F_ { \alpha\beta } +A_ { a\beta } ^\alpha ] _ { ; \beta } .
This Letter demonstrates that a universal entangler always exists except for a degenerated case .	Nevertheless , the problem how to find a universal entangler remains open .
$ \lambda\_1 ( \tilde { g } ) $ ) the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian ( resp .	the Dirac operator ) with respect to the metric $ \tilde { g } $ .
We show that , despite a wide-spread impression , the two theories are complementary rather than antagonist .	Indeed , although Chirikov 's 1979 review has thousands of citations , almost all of them refer to topics such as the resonance overlap criterion , fast diffusion , the Standard or Whisker Map , and not to the constructive theory providing a formula to measure diffusion along a single resonance .
However , in many applications , for example modeling an electron ( which has spin-1/2 ) on a network of thin wires , it is necessary to consider operators which allow spin-orbit interaction .	The article presents a review of quantization schemes for graphs with three such Hamiltonian operators , the Dirac , Pauli and Rashba Hamiltonians .
Furthermore , we show that the opposite holds in repulsive force fields : the small particle statistically gains energy .	This effect is small and is mainly due to asymmetric energy exchange of the transverse ( i.e. , perpendicular ) collisions .
In the heavy-quark limit , the hadronic matrix elements entering nonleptonic $ B $ -meson decays into two light mesons can be calculated from first principles including `` nonfactorizable '' strong-interaction corrections .	The $ B\to\pi K , \pi\pi $ decay amplitudes are computed including electroweak penguin contributions , SU ( 3 ) violation in the light-cone distribution amplitudes , and an estimate of power corrections from chirally-enhanced terms and annihilation graphs .
Our mass resolution limit for sources is M~ 4.0 x 10^7 h^-1 M_sol , which is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than in previous studies of this kind .	Our calculations reveal that the reionisation process is sensitive to the inclusion of dim sources with masses below ~10^9 h^-1 M_sol .
These multi-photon states are two-mode squeezed by 6.0 dB with a variable orientation of squeezing and displaced by a few vacuum units .	This range encompasses typical input alphabets for a continuous variable quantum information protocol .
It is found that there is a possibility for the formation of metastable strangelets of large mass .	The model predicts low charge to mass ratio as the characteristic signature of strange matter in agreement with the relativistic studies .
The incipient magnetic properties are studied by means of fixed-spin moment method of alloy theory , together in conjunction with the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau equation for magnetic phase transition .	The first-principles calculations reveal that due to the breaking of the $ C $ - $ Ni $ bonds , some of the $ Ni $ 3d states , which were lowered in energy due to strong hybridization , are transfered back to higher energies thereby increasing the itinerant character in the material .
The quantum gauge theory of gravity which is proposed in the references hep-th/0109145 and hep-th/0112062 is formulated completely in the framework of traditional quantum field theory .	In order to study the relationship between quantum gauge theory of gravity and traditional quantum gravity which is formulated in curved space , it is important to find the differential geometric formulation of quantum gauge theory of gravity .
We show that the $ p $ -rank is constant on a KR stratum , generalizing a result of Ng\^o and Genestier .	We prove an abstract , uniform formula for the $ p $ -rank on a KR stratum .
The T_ { 13 } group is isomorphic to Z_ { 13 } \rtimes Z_3 , and it is the minimal group having two complex triplets as the irreducible representations .	We show that the T_ { 13 } symmetry can derive lepton masses and mixings consistently .
This contribution investigates the implication of a high BD multiplicity on the appearance of the IMF for the Orion Nebula Cluster , Taurus-Auriga , IC 348 and the Pleiades .	We show that the discontinuity remains pronounced even if the observed MF appears to be continuous , even for a BD binary fraction as high as 60 % .
We construct T^2-symmetric charged AdS black holes in conformal gravity .	The most general solution up to an overall conformal factor contains three non-trivial parameters : the mass , electric charge and a quantity that can be identified as the massive spin-2 hair .
In the course of our analysis , we identify five new high-quality INS candidates for targeted follow-up observations .	A future all-sky X-ray survey with eROSITA , or another mission with similar capabilities , can be expected to increase the detected population of X-ray-discovered INSs from the 8 to 50 in the BSC , to ( for a disk population ) 240 to 1500 , which will enable a more detailed study of neutron star population models .
The X-ray binary nature is further confirmed by the report of a detection of a faint point source at the position of the XRT counterpart of the burst in archival XMM-Newton data approximately 6 years before the burst and in more recent XMM-Newton data obtained at the end of September 2006 ( nearly 4 months after the burst ) .	Since the source is very likely not a gamma-ray burst , we rename the source Swift J1749.4-2807 , based on the Swift/BAT discovery coordinates .
Introducing independently switchable interactions , one observes revivals of nonlocal coherences of the two-qubit system which are unambiguously connected to the squeezing parameter of the Gaussian environmental states .	Thus , the locally interacting two two-level systems represent a dynamical quantum probe for the squeezing in multimode fields .
If $ V $ is the hyperplane orthogonal to a product vector , we prove that $ \dim F_V=d^2-1-\prod ( 2d_i-1 ) $ , where $ d_i $ is the dimension of $ H_i $ and $ d=\prod d_i $ .	We classify the maximal faces of $ S_1 $ in the cases $ 2\otimes2 $ and $ 2\otimes3 $ .
To assess the strength of nematic fluctuations with a finite wave vector in a two-dimensional metal , we compute the static d-wave polarization function for tight-binding electrons on a square lattice .	At Van Hove filling and zero temperature the function diverges logarithmically at q=0 .
We define an algebraic language for specifying general disease processes and multiple treatments , from which a semantics in terms of hybrid dynamical system can be derived .	Then , the application of control-theoretic tools is proposed in order to compute the optimal scheduling of multiple therapies .
Global properties of the dust shell , such as accelerations , variations in the pump and shell-wide magnetic field changes are examined as possibilities , and eliminated .	A possible solution to the problem involving plasma turbulence and the local magnetic field is introduced , and the relevant time scales of the turbulence are calculated .
We derive from first principles their nonlinear equations of motion , using the generalized Griffith criterion for crack fronts and three standard mobility laws for contact lines .	Then we study their roughness using the self-consistent expansion .
In this paper we combine quantum entanglement with nanostructured metal optics in the form of optically thick metal films perforated with a periodic array of subwavelength holes .	These arrays act as photonic crystals that may convert entangled photons into surface-plasmon waves , i.e. , compressive charge density waves .
The measurement was performed in Hall C at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility ( TJNAF ) in quasi free kinematics with the target polarization perpendicular to the momentum transfer .	The electrons were detected in a magnetic spectrometer in coincidence with neutrons in a large solid angle segmented detector .
We study the relation of the new cardinal invariants $ \ell^v $ , $ \bar \ell^v $ to classical cardinal topological invariants such as Lindel\ '' of number $ \ell $ , density $ d $ , and spread $ s $ .	The simplest new verbal cardinal invariant is the foredensity $ \ell^- ( X ) $ defined for a topological space $ X $ as the smallest cardinal $ \kappa $ such that for any neighborhood assignment $ ( O_x ) _ { x\in X } $ there is a subset $ A\subset X $ of cardinality $ |A|\le\kappa $ that meets each neighborhood $ O_x $ , $ x\in X $ .
For example , it is shown that the linear span of trees carries an enveloping algebra structure and embeds as such in an enveloping algebra of increasing trees .	All our constructions arise naturally from the general theory of twisted Hopf algebras .
Currently we can compute the second resolvent function to ten orders in this expansion and also its general Fourier coefficient or moment $ m_ { k } $ to an equivalent length .	The leading large $ N $ , large $ k $ , $ k/N $ fixed form of the moments can be related to the small wave-number expansion of the structure function in the bulk , scaled Dyson circular ensemble , known from earlier work .
The L1489 and NGC 2264D VLA 7 thermal radio jets appear elongated in the direction of the larger scale outflow .	We report the first tentative detection of a non-thermal radio jet , L778 VLA 5 , associated with a low mass Class I protostar and powering a molecular outflow .
We report the recent results from the computer simulations of a fermion-gauge-scalar model with dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking and chiral transition induced by the scalar field .	This model might be considered to be a possible alternative to the Higgs mechanism of mass generation .
In p-wave systems involving the mixture of two-hyperfine states , we show that the interference pattern exhibits a polarization effect depending on the relative orientation of the two vector order parameters .	However , in p-wave systems involving a single hyperfine state , we show that this angular effect reduces to an overall phase difference between the two interfering clouds , similar to s-wave .
I propose to study the complex physics of topological phases by an all optical implementation of a discrete-time quantum walk .	The main novel ingredient is the use of parametric amplifiers in the random network which can in turn be used to emulate intra-atomic interactions and thus analyze many-body effects in topological phases even when using light as the quantum walker .
The detection of gamma rays in the very-high-energy ( VHE ) energy range ( 100 GeV -- 100 TeV ) provides a direct view of the parent population of ultra-relativistic particles found in astrophysical sources .	For this reason , VHE gamma rays are useful for understanding the underlying astrophysical processes in non-thermal sources .
If the Large Mixing Angle MSW solution correctly describes the solar neutrino deficit , there is a small corner of allowed parameter space in which maximal CP-violation in the lepton sector might be observable at a 1 GeV medium baseline experiment .	Superbeams with massive detectors would therefore provide a useful tool en route to a neutrino factory , which would permit a further order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity , together with a more comprehensive check of CP-violation and the oscillation framework .
A numerical method for variable coefficient elliptic problems on two dimensional domains is described .	The method is based on high-order spectral approximations and is designed for problems with smooth solutions .
To address this issue , we introduce the Entropy Search Portfolio ( ESP ) : a novel approach to portfolio construction which is motivated by information theoretic considerations .	We show that ESP outperforms existing portfolio methods on several real and synthetic problems , including geostatistical datasets and simulated control tasks .
Dynamic disorder induced by the polar methyl ammonium cation has been suggested as the root cause of the novel electronic properties observed near room temperature .	Here , we combine low frequency Raman scattering with first-principles molecular dynamics ( MD ) to study the fundamental nature of this dynamic disorder .
At 330 MHz , radio emission extends into the interior of the western ghost bubble , but not the northeast one .	Our re-analysis of the archival Chandra data shows evidence for an X-ray tunnel ( elongated region of reduced X-ray emission ) extending from near the center of the cD out to the west ghost bubble .
Amplitude noise corresponds to photon noise and acts as an additive noise , it can be reduced by increasing the global measurement time .	Phase noise can be divided in three families : random , sinusoidal and drift phase noise ; we show that it acts as a multiplicative noise .
In this paper , we bring more elements to that study in reporting the main results of a practical experiment which was carried out in an hospital for sleep pathology study .	An EEG recording was studied and labeled by a human expert and an ANN .
We demonstrate the utility of a spectral approximation to fermion loop operators using low-lying eigenmodes of the hermitian Dirac-Wilson matrix , Q .	The investigation is based on a total of 400 full QCD vacuum configurations , with two degenerate flavors of dynamical Wilson fermions at beta =5.6 , at two different sea quark masses .
This is known as super-resolution .	However , even with perfectly efficient number-resolving detectors , the detection efficiency of all previously demonstrated methods to measure such interference decreases exponentially with the number of photons in the N00N state , often leading to the conclusion that N00N states are unsuitable for spatial measurements .
One experimental EDM search based on this technique was published , and for a number of reasons including high sample conductivity , high operating temperature , and limited SQUID technology , the result was not particularly sensitive compared to other experiments in the late 1970 's .	Advances in SQUID and conventional magnetometery had led us to reconsider this type of experiment , which can be extended to searches and tests other than EDMs ( e.g. , test of Lorentz invariance ) .
We identify the regimes in parameter space corresponding to these steady states .	In the latter case , the apparent catastrophe frequency near the boundary was found to be significantly larger than that in the interior .
Assuming the dark matter is made entirely from neutralinos , we re-visit the role of their annihilation on the temperature of diffuse gas in the high redshift universe .	We consider neutralinos of particle mass 36 GeV and 100 GeV , respectively .
We also found that non-adiabatic pressure perturbations can be possibly generated .	The fluid dynamics of the perfect fluid due to the three-form field corresponds to the system in which the number of particles is not conserved .
We show that these problems are closely related for all amounts $ c \geq 1 $ of deletion : 1 ) $ GI \equiv^ { l } _ { iso } VDC_ { c } $ , $ GI \equiv^ { l } _ { iso } EDC_ { c } $ , $ GI \leq^ { l } _ { m } LVD_c $ , and $ GI \equiv^ { p } _ { iso } LED_c $ .	2 ) For all $ k \geq 2 $ , $ GI \equiv^ { p } _ { iso } k-VDC_c $ and $ GI \equiv^ { p } _ { iso } k-EDC_c $ .
However , there exist no precise theoretical calculations for He-like ions within dense plasma environment .	The strong need for an accurate theoretical estimates for spectral properties of He-like ions in strongly coupled plasma environment leads us to perform ab initio calculations in the framework of Rayleigh-Ritz variation principle in Hylleraas coordinates where ion-sphere potential is used .
For n=1 case , we find an explicit form of the exact solution .	Using this solution , we show that the two point function at finite flow time t is finite .
We re-examine the existence and extent of the planar structure in the local galaxy density field , the so-called Supergalactic Plane ( SGP ) .	This structure is studied here in three dimensions using both the new Optical Redshift Survey ( ORS ) and the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift survey .

We calculate the critical electron-boson coupling alpha_c as a function of $ U $ and show results for density-density correlation functions in the whole parameter space .	The possibility of many-particle ( bipolaronic ) and Coulomb-assisted transfer is discussed .
The calculations are performed within the MIT Bag model , using an improved multiple reflection expansion .	The results are of relevance for neutron star phenomenology and for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .
The zero point for the proper motion is determined using both background galaxies and the QSOs and the two methods produce consistent measurements within each field .	Averaging the results from the two fields gives a proper motion in the equatorial coordinate system of $ ( \mu_ { \alpha } , \mu_ { \delta } ) = ( 17.7\pm 6.3 , -22.1 \pm 6.3 ) $ mas century $ ^ { -1 } $ and in the Galactic coordinate system of $ ( \mu_ { \ell } , \mu_ { b } ) = ( -23.1\pm 6.3 , -16.3 \pm 6.3 ) $ mas century $ ^ { -1 } $ .
An application and extension of a simple model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old recycled MSP B1957+20 .	It is found that the pulsar wind can , indeed , contribute to both the resolved and unresolved X-ray emission .
One can then ask to extend the results on Schubert intersections to the compactification \bar { M } _ { 0 , r } .	The first part of this paper achieves this goal .
We use EUV images from TRACE , magnetograms from the MDI instrument on SOHO , and linear force-free field extrapolations .	For each loop , we find the particular value of the force-free parameter ( alpha ) that best matches the observed loop axis and then construct flux tubes using different assumed cross sections at one footpoint ( circle and ellipses with different orientations ) .
It is therefore important to include them .	We consider a nonrelativisitic effective theory ( the so-called `` pionless '' Nuclear Effective Field Theory ) as a concrete example and show that the off-shell amplitudes can not be renormalized if the redundant operators are not included .
Using high-resolution non-radiative hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters we obtain simple analytic formulae for DM and gas distribution in the spherical approximation .	We derive fits for the DM density , velocity dispersion and velocity anisotropy .
The graph invariant we consider is the relative density of central similarity PCDs .	We prove that relative density of central similarity PCDs is a U-statistic and obtain the asymptotic normality under mild regularity conditions using the central limit theory of U-statistics .
We study the ordered phases and the phase transitions in the stacked triangular antiferromagnetic Ising ( STAFI ) model with strong interplane coupling modeling CsCoCl $ _3 $ and CsCoBr $ _3 $ .	We find that there exists an intermediate phase which consists of a single phase of so-called partial disordered ( PD ) type , and confirm the stability of this phase .
We focus on the magnetic and thermodynamic properties .	We also discuss a recent theoretical interpretation of this behavior in terms of Griffiths-McCoy singularities close to the magnetic quantum critical point ( QCP ) .
Strong stellar feedback , in the form of galactic winds , is expected to play an important role in the evolution of these regions .	We investigate the effects of these winds by comparing different galactic outflow prescriptions , including ( i ) a constant velocity model ( CW ) , ( ii ) a variable velocity model scaling with galaxy properties ( VW ) , and ( iii ) a model with no outflows ( NW ) .
At present , 161 of them have individual distance estimates .	The galaxy distribution on peculiar velocities along the strip exhibits the known Virgo-centric infall at RA & lt ; 14 $ ^h $ and some signs of outflow from the Local Void at RA & gt ; 17 $ ^h $ .
We relate Fox 3-colorings to Jones and Kauffman polynomials of links and we use this connection to sketch the method of approximating the unknotting number of a knot .	We discuss some elementary open problems in knot theory and show that Fox colorings can be useful in trying to solve them .
The average shift of Leo I stars with respect to ~100 background galaxies implies a proper motion of ( mu_W , mu_N ) = ( 0.1140 +/- 0.0295 , -0.1256 +/- 0.0293 ) mas/yr .	The implied Galactocentric velocity vector , corrected for the reflex motion of the Sun , has radial and tangential components V_rad = 167.9 +/- 2.8 km/s and V_tan = 101.0 +/- 34.4 km/s , respectively .
In a previous work we showed that large nongaussianities and nonscale-invariant distortions in the CMB power spectrum can be generated in hybrid inflation models , due to the contributions of the tachyon ( waterfall ) field to the second order curvature perturbation .	Here we clarify , correct , and extend those results .
Rules to change the hands are self-organized in a society through evolution .	The co-evolution of diversity and complexity of strategies and interactions ( or communications ) are found at later stages of the simulation .
Two order parameters are coupled biquadratically which corresponds to the magnetoelectric materials .	The coupling with strain is assumed to be linear in strain and quadratic in order parameters .
Moreover , unlike other ferropnictides , the superconducting gap in BaFe2 ( As1-xPx ) 2 has been found to contain nodal lines .	The exact nature of the `` iso-valent '' doping and nodal gap here are key open issues in building a comprehensive picture of the iron-based high temperature superconductors .
We show that the evolutionary trajectories are dependent on the model parameters of new HDE model .	Eventually , in the light of SNe+BAO+OHD+CMB observational data , we plot the evolutionary trajectories in $ s-r $ and $ q-r $ planes for best fit values of the parameters of new HDE model .
Using Monte Carlo simulations with the standard Wilson action , gauge-invariant SO ( 3 ) -Z2 monopoles , which are strong-coupling lattice artifacts , have been seen to undergo a percolation transition exactly at the phase transition previously seen using Coulomb-gauge methods , with an infinite lattice critical point near $ \beta = 3.2 $ .	The theory with both Z2 vortices and monopoles and SO ( 3 ) -Z2 monopoles eliminated is simulated in the strong coupling ( $ \beta = 0 $ ) limit on lattices up to $ 60^4 $ .
More specifically , we develop the theory of short and long confocal annular Josephson tunnel junctions in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field of arbitrary orientations .	The behavior of a circular annular Josephson tunnel junction is then seen to be simply a special case of the above result .
We introduce notions of local exactness and local harmonicity and prove the Hodge decomposition , which in our context says that the orthogonal complement to the space of all exact 1-forms coincides with the closed span of all locally harmonic 1-forms .	Then we introduce a related Hodge Laplacian and define a notion harmonicity for finite energy 1-forms .
Adopting a phenomenological approach , I consider the consequences of - a ) allowing the dark energy to cluster , and , b ) including the dark energy in the virialization process .	Both of these issues affect the final state of the system in a fundamental way .
To interpret the observations , we created a geometrical model of a rising loop in 3D .	The relevant parameters of the loop were matched to the observations where possible .
We applied the Floquet scattering-matrix formalism to studying the electronic transport properties in a mesoscopic Dirac system .	Using the method , we investigate theoretically quantum pumping driven by a series of time-periodic potentials in graphene monolayer both in the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes .
We report results of the first computer simulation studies of physically adsorbed hydrocarbons on a quasicrystalline surface : methane , propane , and benzene on decagonal Al-Ni-Co .	The grand canonical Monte Carlo method is employed , using novel Embedded Atom Method potentials generated from it ab initio calculations , and standard hydrocarbon interactions .
We present a suggestion on the interpretation of canonical time evolution when gravitation is present , based on the nonlinear gauge approach to gravity .	Essentially , our proposal consists of an internal-time concept , with the time variable taken from the dynamical fields characteristic of the nonlinear realization of the internal time-translational symmetry .
We show that any omega-limit trajectory has the time-spectrum in the spectral gap [ -m , m ] and satisfies the original equation .	This equation implies the key spectral inclusion for spectrum of the nonlinear term .
In this context we establish a remarkable relation between the arrow of time and the properties of the Weyl group .	The asymptotic states of the developing Universe are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the Weyl group which is a property of the Tits Satake universality classes and not of their single representatives .
Let $ G_ { M } ^ { + } $ be the Artin monoid of finite type generated by the letters $ a_i , i\in I $ with respect to a Coxeter matrix $ M $ that is equipped with the degree map $ \deg\ !	: \ !

Series-parallelisation adds precedence constraints to an activity network , usually increasing its makespan ( execution time ) .	The slowdown ratio describes how additional constraints affect the makespan .
We report on the multi-contact frictional dynamics of model elastomer surfaces rubbed against bare glass slides .	The surfaces consist of layers patterned with thousands spherical caps ( radius of curvature 100 $ \mu $ m ) distributed both spatially and in height , regularly or randomly .
We investigate the phase diagram of this system as a function of the filling factor in the lowest Landau level and in terms of the ratio between s- and p-wave interaction strengths .	We show that the presence of attractive interactions induces a wide regime of phase separation with formation of maximally compact droplets that are either fully polarized or composed of spin-singlets .
Although GLP ( \Lambda ) has no Kripke models , Ignatiev showed that indeed one can construct a Kripke model of the variable-free fragment with natural number modalities .	Later , Icard defined a topological model for the same fragment which is very closely related to Ignatiev 's .
The T2.5 dwarf 2MASS 13243559+6358284 shows consistent ~17 % variability on two consecutive nights .	The T2 dwarf 2MASS J16291840+0335371 exhibits ~10 % variability that may evolve from night to night , similarly to Luhman 16B .
Requiring this `` strong margin adaptivity '' makes the model selection problem more challenging .	We first prove , in a general framework , that some penalization procedures ( including local Rademacher complexities ) exhibit this adaptivity when the models are nested .
To investigate the cause of this , the influence of social interactions and advertisements are studied in an agent-based model of consumers in a social network .	The influence of network topology was varied by using a small-world network , a random network and a Barabasi-Albert network .
In the case where R is a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field , we get an inequality similar to the above , with the length of socle ( R ) interpreted as its length as a bimodule , and with the final summand +1 replaced by the Euler characteristic of a bipartite graph determined by the structure of socle ( R ) .	More generally , that inequality holds if , rather than assuming k algebraically closed , we assume that R/J ( R ) is a direct product of full matrix algebras over k , and exclude the case where k has small finite cardinality .
For seesaw I we consider a heavy Majorana neutrino coupling to the electron or muon .	For seesaw II we concentrate on the likely scenario where the new scalars decay to two leptons .
Analytical and numerical results are given in the Collins-Soper and in the Gottfried-Jackson frame .	We present a Monte Carlo study of the effect of acceptance cuts applied to the leptons and the photon for J/psi+ gamma production at the Tevatron .
The coupling between the adatoms to a graphene sheet is described in the framework of tunneling Hamiltonian .	We account for the possibility of this coupling being of resonant character if a bound state of the adatom effectively interacts with the continuum of 2D delocalized states in graphene .
Recently , this topic has been addressed in experiments on colloidal particles trapped by optical tweezers in a microfluidic device [ PRL , 103 , 230602 ( 2009 ) ] and theoretically by means of a Langevin model [ Eur.Phys .	J E , 33 , 313 ( 2010 ) ] .

Keeping phi_3 = 60 degree fixed in fit gives S_ { pi pi } ~-0.9 , which agrees better with Belle .	With the sizable delta , sigma rescattering phases as fitted , many direct CP asymmetries flip sign , and B0 -- & gt ; pi0 pi0 , K- K+ rates are of order 10^ { -6 } , which can be tested soon .
In our analysis , we consider only objects with T_ew & gt ; 2 keV and adopt an approach that mimics observations , associating with each measurement an error comparable with recent observations and providing best-fit results via robust techniques .	Within the clusters , baryons are distributed among ( i ) a cold neutral phase , with a relative contribution that increases from less than 1 to 3 per cent at higher redshift , ( ii ) stars which contribute with about 20 per cent and ( iii ) the X-ray emitting plasma that contributes by 80 ( 76 ) per cent at z=0 ( 1 ) to the total baryonic budget .
The alpha clusters behave as bosons .	however tritons have Fermionic nature , and how the three cluster structure is different from 12C is an intriguing problem .
( 1 ) The new data and puzzles in exclusive hadronic decays of $ J/\psi $ and $ \psi ' $ give new challenges to the theory of hadronic decays .	( 2 ) With the new observation for $ \xi ( 2230 ) $ and $ f_0 ( 1500 ) $ in $ J/\psi $ radiative decays and other experiments , the situation in searching for glueballs is encouraging , but theoretical uncertainties related to the properties of glueballs still remain and need to be further reduced .
The NVTE is closely associated with the orthorhombic distortion , and becomes smaller as the orthorhombicity weakens due to either Fe doping or application of pressure .	The study highlights an intriguing interplay between lattice , orbital and spin degrees of freedom that is at the root of the novel phenomena in Ca2RuO4 .
The optical reflectance spectra of Bi2OS2 and LaOBiS2 showed optical band gaps of ca .	1.0 eV , which were close to the computationally calculated direct band gaps of ca.0.8 eV .
They allow us to estimate the contribution of the zinc and sulfur vibrations to the bandgap renormalization energy by electron-phonon interaction .	A two-oscillator model based on the zinc and sulfur renormalization energies has been used to account for the temperature dependence of the bandgap energy in ZnS .
In our previous work , a new approach to the notorious problem of quantum measurement was proposed .	Existing treatments of the problem were incorrect because they ignored the disturbance of measurement by identical particles and standard quantum mechanics had to be modified to obey the cluster separability principle .
In particular , this study seems to indicate a greater dependence of the melting transition on the formation of gauche defects in the alkyl chains as the chain length is increased .	In light of the previously proposed footprint reduction mechanism and variations where the formation of gauche defects are energetically negated , simulations seem to suggest that decane and dodecane monolayers are generally equally as dependent upon the formation of gauche defects for the melting transition to take place , whereas octane monolayers seem to have less dependence , but follow a trend that is established in previous studies of melting in butane and hexane monolayers .
In the first part we discuss how the BEC picture for magnons is modified by anisotropies induced by spin-orbit coupling .	In particular we focus on the effects of antisymmetric spin interactions and/or a staggered component of the $ g $ ( gyromagnetic ) tensor .
Here we use the diffusion approximation of population genetics to study analytically the steady-state properties of such prebiotic scenario .	The coexistence of distinct template types inside a protocell is achieved by a selective pressure at the protocell level ( group selection ) favoring protocells with a mixed template composition .
Here we show that the reported violations of the adiabatic theorem all arise from resonant transitions between energy levels .	In the absence of fast driven oscillations the traditional adiabatic theorem holds .
While the conventional approach describes the gradual system decoherence due to the measurement , we study the situation when the detector output is explicitly recorded that leads to the opposite effect : gradual purification of the double-dot density matrix .	Nonlinear Langevin equation is derived for the random evolution of the density matrix which is reflected and caused by the stochastic detector output .
We calculate the frequency of collective modes of a one-dimensional repulsively interacting Fermi gas with high-spin symmetry confined in harmonic traps at zero temperature .	This is a system realizable with fermionic alkaline-earth-metal atoms such as $ ^ { 173 } $ Yb , which displays an exact SU ( $ \kappa $ ) spin symmetry with $ \kappa\geqslant2 $ and behaves like a spinless interacting Bose gas in the limit of infinite spin components $ \kappa\rightarrow\infty $ , namely high-spin bosonization .
Here , we construct a family of channels with sharply bounded classical , hence private capacity .	On the other hand , their quantum capacity when combined with a zero private ( and zero quantum ) capacity erasure channel , becomes larger than the previous classical capacity .
By using a combination of energy detection and correlation techniques , we show that we can effectively detect packet transmissions in real-time with low complexity , without decoding the packets themselves , and indeed , even without detailed knowledge of the packet format .	We present extensive experimental results from a software-defined radio testbed to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for 802.15.4 ( Zigbee ) networks even in the presence of strong interference signals and low SNR .
The renormalization-group approach combines the effect of different channels and allows to study the role of vertex corrections .	The critical interaction strength , which is necessary to induce the symmetry breaking in the latter approach is found in the static approximation to be $ \alpha _ { c } =e^ { 2 } / ( \epsilon v_ { F } ) \approx 1.05 $ without considering the Fermi velocity renormalization , and $ \alpha _ { c } =3.7 $ with accounting the renormailzation of the Fermi velocity .
This result is in agreement with the transport measurements on PDI8-CN2 field effect transistors , which show an 'always on ' behavior .	We also found evidences of the formation of a built-in potential in T6 / PDI8-CN2 and PDI8-CN2 / T6 interfaces , mainly from the T6 side .
Then , we develop a mathematical model to analyze the throughput performance of the proposed MFDC-MAC protocol .	Furthermore , we study the protocol configuration optimization to maximize the network throughput where we show that this optimization can be performed in two steps , namely optimization of access and transmission parameters on each channel and optimization of channel selection probabilities of the users .
We study frequency linear-time temporal logic ( fLTL ) which extends the linear-time temporal logic ( LTL ) with a path operator $ G^p $ expressing that on a path , certain formula holds with at least a given frequency p , thus relaxing the semantics of the usual G operator of LTL .	Such logic is particularly useful in probabilistic systems , where some undesirable events such as random failures may occur and are acceptable if they are rare enough .
The correlation of the load profile with a user 's private activities leaves open the possibility of inference attacks .	Using a rechargeable battery , the user can partially obscure its load profile and provide some protection to the private information using various battery charging policies .
These observations were obtained using the SMA , IRAM Plateau de Bure , and OVRO interferometers .	The maps have relatively high angular resolutions ( 0.4-1 '' ) , making it possible to study the spatial structure of the gas-dust disk .
This kills the cold dark matter component of UED but also removes the upper bound on the inverse compactification radius , and thus non-observation of the KK excitations even at the Large Hadron Collider does not necessarily invalidate the model .	Apart from the decay of the lightest $ n=1 $ KK excitation , this leads to collider signals which are markedly different from those in the mUED scenario .
Subsequently , motivated by warped braneworlds and extra dimensions , we look at Ricci flows of warped spacetimes .	Here , we are able to find analytic solutions for a special case by variable separation .
The Gaunt factor contains terminating hypergeometric functions that can not be calculated with sufficient accuracy for high quantum levels ( $ n \gtrsim 50 $ ) by standard machine-precision methods .	Methods to overcome the accuracy problem have been developed , which include asymptotic expansions and recursion relations .
The detection rates at neutrino telescopes have been evaluated for neutralino annihilation in both the Sun and the Earth using detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the whole chain of processes from the neutralino annihilation products in the core of the Sun or the Earth to detectable muons at a neutrino telescope .	A comparison with other searches for supersymmetry at accelerators and direct dark matter searches is also given .
These functionals are defined on a topological space $ ( \mathcal { X , T } ) $ where $ \mathcal { X } $ is a subset of measurable functions and the $ \mathcal { T } $ convergence is stronger than or equal to the convergence in the Bitting sense .	Given a sequence $ ( f_ { n } ) _n $ of integrands , if the integrand $ f $ is the weak lower sequential epi-limit of the integrands $ f_n $ one of the main results of this article asserts that under the Ioffe 's criterion , the $ \mathcal { T } $ -lower sequential epi-limit of the sequence of integral functionals at the point $ x $ is bounded below by the value of the integral functional associated to the Fenchel-Moreau-Rockafellar biconjugate of $ f $ at the point $ x $ .
After reviewing the construction of metric from premetric electrodynamics with empirical improvement of accuracy in the skewonless case , we explore the role of skewons in the construction of spacetime metric in the full premetric electrodynamics .	For metric principal part plus skewon part , we have shown that the Type I skewon part is constrained to & lt ; a few x 10^ ( -35 ) in the weak field/weak EEP violation limit .
The expansion we advocate is a modification of what has been used previously ; it is no a chiral expansion in powers of the pion mass .	We use dimensional regularization throughout and the MS-bar subtraction scheme ; our final result depends only on physical observables .
Moreover , it unifies two recent independent attempts towards a stochastic description of non-Markovian open systems , based on path integrals on the one hand and coherent states on the other .	The latter approach utilizes the analytical properties of coherent states and enables a microscopic interpretation of the stochastic states .
The focus here is on the last method .	We consider the Poisson and binomial distributions in detail to illustrate a group invariance method for constructing inferred distributions on parameter spaces given observed results .
I have used these spectroscopic data and all other available constraints to evaluate the spectral classifications and membership status of a total sample of 288 candidate members of Chamaeleon I that have appeared in published studies of the cluster .	The latest census of Chamaeleon I now contains 158 members , 8 of which are later than M6 and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs .
In Ladder-system cooling , the cooling rate degrades by orders of magnitude at large classical motion .	This phenomenon causes a critical transition of the final temperature at a hot background .

We prove a sufficient and necessary condition for identifying the mixing matrix through edge detection , which also serves as the foundation for CAM to be applied not only to the exact-determined and over-determined cases , but also to the under-determined case .	We show the optimality of the edge detection strategy , even for cases where source well-groundedness is not strictly satisfied .
The algorithm is based on a loop on the rows of the matrix and on the calculation of the row entries by weighted quadrature .	The test function is incorporated in the integration weight while the trial function , the geometry parametrization and the PDEs coefficients form the integrand function .
We critically compare these theories and assess their accuracy against available photoabsorption and photoelectron spectroscopy data .	The first ionization potentials are consistently well reproduced and are similar for all the fullerenes and methods studied .
Our poor understanding of the boundaries of convective cores generates large uncertainties on the extent of these cores and thus on stellar ages .	Our aim is to use asteroseismology to consistently measure the extent of convective cores in a sample of main-sequence stars whose masses lie around the mass-limit for having a convective core .
In our study , we study various combinations of losing games in order to understand how and how far the losing combinations result in winning .	Further we devise an alternative model to study the similar paradox .
In the case of elliptical model a part of the constructed solutions should be rejected by continuity considerations .	Similar treatment is given for Maxwell equations in hyperbolic Lobachevsky model , the complete basis of electromagnetic solutions in corresponding cylindrical coordinates has been constructed as well , no quantization of frequencies of electromagnetic modes arises .
The current paper is part of a series of papers describing the results of our stellar variability survey .	The BEST is a small aperture telescope with a wide field of view ( FOV ) .
The main theorem obtained in the current paper , Chernoff 's theorem for evolution families , deals with a family of time-dependent generators of semigroups $ A_t $ on a Banach space , a two-parameter family of operators $ Q_ { t , t+\Delta t } $ satisfying the relation : $ \frac { \partial } { \partial \Delta t } Q_ { t , t+\Delta t } |_ { \Delta t = 0 } =A_t $ , whose products $ Q_ { t_i , t_ { i+1 } } ... Q_ { t_ { k-1 } , t_k } $ are uniformly bounded for all subpartitions $ s = t_0 & lt ; t_1 & lt ; & gt ; ... & lt ; t_n = t $ .	The theorem states that $ Q_ { t_0 , t_1 } ... Q_ { t_ { n-1 } , t_n } $ converges to an evolution family $ U ( s , t ) $ solving a non-autonomous Cauchy problem .
The orbital inclination is known from spectroscopic observations of moving lines ; the distance is derived from radio interferometry of relativistic jets ; the mass ratio of its components is determined from X-ray observations of jets ' eclipses .	In 2005 , the accretion donor was detected as an A4 - A8 giant , and its contribution to eclipse light was measured spectroscopically .
We present several translations between formal argumentation frameworks and nonmonotonic logics for reasoning with plausible assumptions .	More specifically , we translate adaptive logics into assumption-based argumentation and ASPIC+ , ASPIC+ into assumption-based argumentation and a fragment of assumption-based argumentation into adaptive logics .
To attain this lower bound , we note that the multinomial distribution is sharply peaked , and apply results regarding primes in short intervals .	This proves that there are infinitely many primes with more than twice as many ones than zeros in their binary expansion .
However , due to the characteristics of restricted resources and operation in a hostile environment , WSNs are subjected to numerous threats and are vulnerable to attacks .	This research proposes a solution that can be applied on LEACH to increase the level of security .
E- ( or H- ) polarized waves are positively refracted whereas H- ( or E- ) polarized waves are negatively refracted at the interface associated with the anisotropic medium .	By suitably using the properties of anomalous refraction in the anisotropic medium it is possible to realize a very simple and very efficient beam splitter to route the light .
The strong blazar emission indicates that the relativistic radio jet is presently active .	The implication is that even weakly accreting AGN can create powerful jets .
The depinning stresses of the leading partial and of the trailing partial show qualitatively different behaviors .	The depinning stress of the trailing partial increases logarithmically with the void radius , while that of the leading partial shows a crossover at 1 nm above which two partials are simultaneously trapped by the void .
We call a nonempty subset $ A $ of a topological space $ X $ finitely non-Urysohn if for every nonempty finite subset $ F $ of $ A $ and every family $ \ { U_x : x\in F\ } $ of open neighborhoods $ U_x $ of $ x\in F $ , $ \cap\ { \mathrm { cl } ( U_x ) : x\in F\ } \ne\emptyset $ and we define the non-Urysohn number of $ X $ as follows : $ nu ( X ) : =1+\sup\ { |A| : A $ is a finitely non-Urysohn subset of $ X\ } $ .	Then for any topological space $ X $ and any subset $ A $ of $ X $ we prove the following inequalities : ( 1 ) $ |\mathrm { cl } _\theta ( A ) |\le |A|^ { \kappa ( X ) } \cdot nu ( X ) $ , ( 2 ) $ | [ A ] _\theta|\le ( |A|\cdot nu ( X ) ) ^ { \kappa ( X ) } $ , ( 3 ) $ |X|\le nu ( X ) ^ { \kappa ( X ) sL_\theta ( X ) } $ , and ( 4 ) $ |X|\le nu ( X ) ^ { \kappa ( X ) aL ( X ) } $ .
For massive and massless modes these have the magnitudes H^6/m^2 and H^6a^2/k*^2 , respectively , and higher order corrections are suppressed by additional powers of ( H/m ) ^2 and ( Ha/k* ) ^2 .	When the scale factor in the conformal time \eta is a simple power a ( \eta ) = ( 1/\eta ) ^n , the stress-energy tensor obeys P=w\rho with w= ( n-2 ) /n for massive and w= ( n-6 ) / ( 3n ) for massless modes .
Ni\'eb\'e is a food leguminous plant cultivated in tropical Africa for its seeds rich in proteins .	The main problem setted by its production is the conservation of harvests .
An earlier calculation in a generalized linear sigma model showed that the well-known current algebra formula for low energy pion pion scattering held even though the massless Nambu Goldstone pion contained a small admixture of a two-quark two-antiquark field .	Here we turn on the pion mass and note that the current algebra formula no longer holds exactly .
A mathematical analysis is presented for a class of interior penalty ( IP ) discontinuous Galerkin approximations of elliptic boundary value problems .	In the framework of the present theory one can derive some overpenalized IP bilinear forms in a natural way avoiding any heuristic choice of fluxes and penalty terms .
In contrast with big Schwarzschildian ones , the evaporation of the smallest black holes is maximally undemocratic and is biased in favor of particular species .	With an increasing mass the democracy characteristic to the usual macro black holes is gradually regained .
The radiation field is assumed to originate in an optically thick accretion disk .	Wind ion populations are calculated under the asumption that local ionization equilibrium is determined by photoionization and radiative recombination , similar to a photoionized nebula .
By changing the photon-assisted tunneling parameters , we can also obtain a $ t $ - $ J $ model with independently controllable tunneling $ t $ , super-exchange interaction $ J $ , and even a Heisenberg-Ising anisotropy .	Hence , the full phase diagram of this paradigmatic model becomes accessible to cold-atom experiments , departing from the region $ t\gg J $ allowed by standard single-band Hubbard Hamiltonians in the strong-repulsion limit .
The dictionary is intended to be helpful to professional as well as amateur astronomers .	As a notable particularity , it also provides a detailed etymology of English and Persian terms .
This has already been a common practice in MCMC applications , where the resulting posterior is expected to be more `` spatially adaptive '' , but a theoretical basis in terms of adaptive contraction rates was missing .	Under some mild assumptions , we establish a result that provides sufficient conditions for adaptive contraction rates in a range of models .
One way of deriving point estimates for the relative rate of recombination to mutation from such data is to use composite likelihood methods .	We extend recent work in this area so as to be able to construct confidence intervals for our estimates , without needing to resort to computationally-intensive bootstrap procedures , and to develop a test for whether the relative rate varies across loci .
Our study also reveals a rich structure of bosonic cluster states .	Besides the lowest cluster states which behave as bosonic droplets , we identify cluster states weakly bound to one or two atoms forming effective cluster-atom `` dimers '' and cluster-atom-atom `` trimers . ''
Three human pathogens were used to evaluate the performance of the SCM at predicting antimicrobial resistance .	Our results show that the SCM compares favorably in terms of sparsity and accuracy against L1 and L2 regularized Support Vector Machines and CART decision trees .
The crossover time is estimated as $ t_x \approx 16 hours $ .	We interpret these results in terms of a global second order rate equation indicating that ( a ) hydrates catalyse the hydration process for $ t & lt ; t_x $ , ( b ) they inhibit further hydration for $ t & gt ; t_x $ and ( c ) the value of the associated second order rate constant is of magnitude 6x10^ { -7 } - 7x10^ { -6 } liter mol^ { -1 } s^ { -1 } .
In nuclear power generation , fissile materials are mainly used .	For example , $ U^ { 235 } $ is fissile and therefore quite essential for use of nuclear energy .
Nevertheless a possibility of existence of relatively small amount of sufficiently large antimatter regions is not excluded .	Such regions can survive the annihilation with surrounding matter only in the case if their sizes exceed a certain scale .
We model the channel as a propagation graph in which vertices represent transmitters , receivers , and scatterers , while edges represent propagation conditions between vertices .	The recursive structure of the graph accounts for the exponential power decay and the avalanche effect .
Particularly we are interested in the average resistance between two connected ports located on the surface .	Based on general grounds as symmetries and relevance we introduce a field theoretic Hamiltonian for semi-infinite random resistor networks .
Unfortunately their computational complexity is prohibitive for any practical application .	We address this problem and propose a CNN based descriptor with improved matching performance , significantly reduced training and execution time , as well as low dimensionality .
It gives an imperfectly canceled J_2 signal of 10.8 milliarcseconds per year corresponding to 23 % of the Lense-Thirring signature .	Uncertainties of the order of 10-30 microarcseconds in the inclinations yield \delta c_1=7.9 10^-9 which corresponds to an uncanceled J_2 signature of 6.5 milliarcseconds per year , i.e.14 % of the Lense-Thirring signal .
We revisit the dynamical equivalence between different representations of vacuum modified gravity models in view of Legendre transformations .	The equivalence is discussed for both bulk and boundary space , by including in our analysis the relevant Gibbons-Hawking terms .
