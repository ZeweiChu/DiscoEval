Simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations are systematically carried out during outburst and quiescence periods .	By correlating extinction-free parameters , such as HI recombination lines and underlying continuum , it is possible to infer on the mechanism ( s ) responsible for their origin .
So one has to apply new physics to describe such systems with taking into account their complex nature .	For example , last two years the attempts to develop the fractionalized two-fluid hydrodynamics for nanoporous media with fractal dimensions have been made .
A prior to posterior analysis of beta-gamma processes is given that not only leads to an easy derivation of the Markov-Krein identity , but additionally yields new distributional identities for gamma and beta-gamma processes .	These results give new explanations and intepretations of exisiting results in the literature .
The errors of the derived orbital parameters are determined with a Monte Carlo method .	Based on the derived orbital parameters , we find that Sh 2-216 , DeHt 5 , NGC 7293 , A21 , and Ton 320 belong to the thin-disk population , and PG 1034+001 and A31 belong to the thick-disk population .
Similarly , we let $ S_ { n } ( \tau ) $ be the set of $ \tau $ -avoiding permutations in the symmetric group $ S_ { n } $ .	Duncan and Steingr\ ' { \i } msson have shown that the ascent statistic has the same distribution over $ \cA_n ( 021 ) $ as over $ S_n ( 132 ) $ .
If the parameter in question is the cardinality of $ X $ , Nathanson and Nash already obtained some of such upper bounds , which can be seen as polynomials in $ h $ with degree $ ( |X| + 1 ) $ .	Here , by taking instead of the cardinality of $ X $ the parameter defined by $ d : = \frac { \diam ( X ) } { \gcd\ { x - y | x , y \in X\ } } $ , we show that the order of $ A \setminus X $ is bounded above by $ ( \frac { h ( h + 3 ) } { 2 } + d \frac { h ( h - 1 ) ( h + 4 ) } { 6 } ) $ .

A general method of coding over expansion is proposed , which allows one to reduce the highly non-trivial problems of coding over analog channels and compressing analog sources to a set of much simpler subproblems , coding over discrete channels and compressing discrete sources .	More specifically , the focus of this paper is on the additive exponential noise ( AEN ) channel , and lossy compression of exponential sources .
The entropy-temperature curves are calculated for non-interacting fermions in a 3D optical lattice .	These curves facilitate understanding of how adiabatic changes in the lattice depth affect the temperature , and we demonstrate regimes where the atomic sample can be significantly heated or cooled .
Proximity-induced superconductivity in a 3D topological insulator represents a new avenue for observing zero-energy Majorana fermions inside vortex cores .	Relatively small gaps and low transition temperatures of conventional s-wave superconductors put the hard constraints on these experiments .
Thick SiC plates serve as the thermal `` source '' and `` drain '' , while graphene sheets function as the `` gate '' to modulate the near-field photon tunneling by tuning chemical potential with applied voltage biases symmetrically or asymmetrically .	The radiative heat flux calculated from fluctuational electrodynamics significantly varies with graphene chemical potentials , which can tune the coupling between graphene plasmon across the vacuum gap .
We suggest several possible explanations , but are forced to reject them all , and are left puzzled .	To obtain a reliable metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge based on microlensed dwarf stars it will be necessary to resolve this issue through the course of additional observations .
We show that in this case , the volume of HI cleared per SN is considerably greater than in either of the two cases considered hitherto .	We derive a simple relationship between the `` porosity '' of the ISM and the star formation rate ( SFR ) , and deduce a critical SFR_crit , at which the ISM porosity is unity .
EBEX was launched December 29 , 2012 and circumnavigated Antarctica observing $ \sim $ 6,000 square degrees of sky during 11 days at three frequency bands centered around 150 , 250 and 410 GHz .	EBEX was the first experiment to operate a kilo-pixel array of transition-edge sensor bolometers and a continuously rotating achromatic half-wave plate aboard a balloon platform .
We also estimate the expected bounds from like-sign top pair production at LHC in the near future .	Then , we address the implications of these limits for the forward-backward asymmetry in t tbar production measured at Tevatron .
This analysis is based on a sample of 467 million $ \FourS $ decays into $ \BB $ pairs , collected with the \babar\ detector at the PEP-II $ e^ { + } e^ { - } $ storage rings .	We select events where one of the B mesons is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode and the other B decays semileptonically into an electron or a muon .
The resulting Casimir forces for these physical arrangements have been found to be attractive .	The repulsive Casimir force found by Boyer for a spherical shell is a special case requiring stringent material property of the sphere , as well as the specific boundary conditions for the wave modes inside and outside of the sphere .
Stellar population models have been used to derive ages , metallicities and alpha/Fe abundances along the radius .	We find that line-strength gradients are due , mainly , to variations of the total metallicity with the radius .
We interpret these weights as delays , and take them as i.i.d exponential random variables .	We analyze the weighted flooding time defined as the minimum time needed to reach all nodes from one uniformly chosen node , and the weighted diameter corresponding to the largest distance between any pair of vertices .

By analyzing B - & gt ; X_u l nu_l spectra with a model based on soft-gluon resummation and an analytic time-like QCD coupling , we obtain |V_ub| = ( 3.76 +-0.13 +- 0.22 ) *10^ ( -3 ) , where the first and the second error refers to experimental and theoretical errors , respectively .	The V_ub value is obtained from the available measured semileptonic branching fractions in limited regions of the phase-space .
As many of these planets follow eccentric orbits and are believed to host dense atmospheres , we expect the equilibrium rotation to differ from the synchronous motion .	Here we provide a general description of the allowed final equilibrium rotation states of these planets , and apply this to already discovered cases in which the mass is lower than twelve Earth-masses .
The low energy excitation of the rotating D3-branes is thermodynamically stable up to a critical angular momentum density .	This indicates that there is a corresponding phase transition of the $ { \cal N } $ =4 large $ N $ super Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature .
We consider an example of two emitters and show that radiation is occurred through symmetric states of emitters as it is in Dicke model of superradiance .	The nanoparticle accelerates collective spontaneous emission similar how it accelerates spontaneous emission of single emitter .
In regime I ( weak rotation ) the large scale circulation ( LSC ) is the dominant feature of the flow .	In regime II ( moderate rotation ) the LSC is replaced by vertically aligned vortices .
We monitor the nuclear polarization of the same atoms that are decaying in situ by photoionizing a small fraction of the partially polarized atoms and then use the standard optical Bloch equations to model their population distribution .	We obtain an average nuclear polarization of $ P = 0.9913\pm0.0008 $ , which is significantly more precise than previous measurements with this technique .
Assuming a cylindrical geometry with axis along the direction of the external field , the two-dimensional board becomes a model for one-dimensional mass transport along the direction of the external field .	This is a purely diffusive process which admits fractal non-equilibrium stationary states under flux boundary conditions .
We discuss the nature of criticality in the $ \beta^2 = 2 \pi N $ self-dual extention of the sine-Gordon model .	This field theory is related to the two-dimensional classical XY model with a N-fold degenerate symmetry-breaking field .
The expression is entirely in terms of asymptotic charges .	It involves the `` scalar charges '' of the black hole which still need to be solved in terms of the dyonic charges and the mass .
This is a particularly important issue considering the current and future space missions ( like Planck from ESA and WMAP from NASA ) operating from an orbit far from Earth with short periods of visibility from ground stations .	We consider , as a working case , the Low Frequency Instrument ( LFI ) on-board the Planck satellite albeit the approach developed here can be easily applied to any kind of experiment that makes use of an observing ( scanning ) strategy which assumes repeated pointings of the same region of the sky on different time scales .
We find in all cases that the alpha-particles are located at the surface of the core-nucleus as dictated by Coulomb and centrifugal barriers .	The two lowest three-body bound states resemble a slightly contracted $ ^ { 8 } \text { Be } $ nucleus outside the core .
A bifurcation analysis of cellular contractility as a function of substrate stiffness reveals a bistable response , thus defining a lower threshold of stiffness , below which cells are not able to build up contractile forces , and an upper threshold of stiffness , above which cells are always in a strongly contracted state .	Using the full dynamical model , we predict that rate-dependent hysteresis will occur in the cellular traction forces when cells are exposed to substrates of time-dependent stiffness .
We consider the homogenization of parabolic equations with large spatially-dependent potentials modeled as Gaussian random fields .	We derive the homogenized equations in the limit of vanishing correlation length of the random potential .
The increased penetration of uncertain and variable renewable energy presents various resource and operational electric grid challenges .	Micro-level ( household and small commercial ) demand-side grid flexibility could be a cost-effective strategy to integrate high penetrations of wind and solar energy , but literature and field deployments exploring the necessary information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) are scant .
In this note we give two explicit upper bounds for $ R ( K\_ { [ k\_1 , t\_1 ] } , \dots , K\_ { [ k\_r , t\_r ] } ) $ ( the smallest integer $ n $ such that for any $ r $ -edge coloring of $ K\_n $ there always occurs a monochromatic $ K\_ { [ k\_i , t\_i ] } $ for some $ i $ ) .	Our first upper bound contains a classical one in the case when $ k\_1=\cdots =k\_r $ and $ t\_i=1 $ for all $ i $ .
We assume that there exists a unique alpha satisfying f ( alpha ) =0 .	When f ' ( alpha ) =0 and A is non derogatory , we solve completely the equation XA-AX=f ( X ) .
But in many applications , there appear nonlinear statistics of processes that are not strongly mixing .	We investigate the nonoverlapping block bootstrap sequences which are near epoch dependent on strong mixing or absolutely regular processes .
In this paper we focus on cylindrical Levy processes .	These have ( weak ) Levy-Ito decompositions and an associated Levy-Khintchine formula .
Taken with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on the Keck2 telescope , these data display a narrow velocity dispersion of 11+/-3 km/s , with a steady radial velocity gradient of 245 km/s over the 125 kpc radial extent of the stream studied so far .	This implies that the Andromeda galaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo .
We describe telescopes and instruments that were developed and used for astronomical research in the ultraviolet ( UV ) and extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum .	The wavelength ranges covered by these bands are not uniquely defined .
We create a Python GUI scripting interface working under Windows in addition to ( UNIX/Linux ) .	The GUI has been built around the Python open-source programming language .
We analyze the partition function and main thermodynamic properties arising from perturbative thermal loops .	We focus on the p-adic models associated with the tachyon phenomenology in string theories .
We compute the equilibrium density profiles in two cases : the semi-infinite tube ( in which case the density is constant ) and a long finite tube ( in which case the density is linear ) .	In the latter case , we also show that convergence to equilibrium is well described by the heat equation .
The results show that the interactions of K* K*bar states are attractive , which consequently result in K* K*bar bound states with the binding energies of about 10-70 MeV , and contrarily , no omega phi bound state is obtained .	The channel coupling effect of K* K*bar and omega phi is found to be considerably large , which makes the binding of K* K*bar 5-45 MeV deeper .
In particular , we plan to study the properties of the onset of deconfinement and to search for the signatures of the critical point .	A two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram will be performed by varying the energy ( 13A-158A GeV ) and system size ( p+p , Be+Be , Ar+Ca , Xe+La ) of collisions .
Nevertheless , even a small fraction of ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter ( uSIDM ) can have observable consequences on astrophysical scales .	In particular , the uSIDM subcomponent can undergo gravothermal collapse and form seed black holes in the center of a halo .
A challenging aspect of VM deployment is the additional computing resources usage in the deployment and management of VM which obliges computing resources for VM creation and configuration .	The management of VM comprises computing resources exploitation in the monitoring of VM in entire lifecycle and physical resources management for VM on SMDs .
Focusing on the collective behaviors on a population level , we explore potential regulatory functions this model can offer .	These functions include fast and synchronized response to environmental change , or long-term memory about the transcriptional status .
In both cases , we find no indication for vacuum instability nor meta-stability induced by top-fluctuations if the cutoff is kept finite but arbitrary .	A lower bound for the Higgs mass arises for the class of standard bare potentials of \phi^4 type from the requirement of a well-defined functional integral ( i.e. , stability of the bare potential ) .
This project shares most of the know-how and sophisticated technology developed for the SPOrt experiment onboard the International Space Station .	The payload is designed to flight onboard long duration stratospheric balloons both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres where low foreground emission sky patches are accessible .
Hultman shows that T_G and Q_G are homotopy equivalent and Cohen-Macaulay , and determines the rank of their top homology .	An application of the theory of building sets and nested set complexes by Feichtner and Kozlov shows that in fact T_G is subdivided by the order complex of Q_G .
By the Robertson-Seymour graph minor theorem , $ \mathcal { D } _k $ is characterised by a finite family of minor-minimal forbidden graphs , which we denote by $ \widehat { \mathcal { D } } _k $ .	This paper discusses $ \widehat { \mathcal { D } } _k $ and related topics .
We have sampled 120,000 stars via differential photometry , of which ~26,000 have sufficient photometric accuracy ( & lt ; =2.5 % ) with which to perform a search for transiting planets .	Ongoing analysis has led to the identification of three candidates .
When $ \Delta\tau & lt ; 0 $ , these evanescent photons would be instantly tunneling from one light cone into another on the distance $ c| \Delta\tau| $ .	( This assertion , previously proved via dispersion relations , is described here by the temporal parameters of process . )
We show how in the new minimal formalism matter coupling presents certain features absent in other formalisms .	In particular , for the large class of matter couplings considered in this paper , matter must possess an R-symmetry , which is gauged by the vector field which becomes dynamical in the `` new minimal '' completion of the $ R+\alpha R^2 $ theory .
We fit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimeter measurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine the temperature of the component ( s ) emitting at those wavelengths .	We present the ratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13 nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type .
We also study the related question for F-harmonic functions ( solutions ) which are continuous across E. Main results assert that if there exists a convex cone subequation M such that F+M is contained in F , then any closed set E which is M-polar has these properties .	To be M-polar means that E = { f = -\infty } where f is M-subharmonic on X and smooth outside of E. Many examples and generalizations are given .
We examine the relationship of the two asymmetries $ A_ { FB } ^t $ and $ A_ { FB } ^\ell $ .	We show their connection through the $ ( V-A ) $ spin correlation between the charged lepton and the top quark with different polarization states .
We argue that the Goldstone $ \phi $ and Higgs $ h $ modes mix in antiferromagnetic systems , and this leads to an effective $ hh\phi $ three-point interaction .	We then analyze the instability of the antiferromagnetic system in two spatial dimensions by studying the non-perturbative behaviour of the Higgs boson self-energy using the Dyson -- Schwinger equations .
We present photometric light curves for a sample of 21 ultra cool M and L dwarfs in the field and in the young open clusters sigma Orionis and the Pleiades .	Evidence for variability with RMS amplitudes ( in the I band ) of 0.01 to 0.055 magnitudes on timescales of 0.4 to 100 hours is discovered in half of these objects .
Grain boundaries in ultrafine grained ( UFG ) materials processed by severe plastic deformation ( SPD ) are often called `` non-equilibrium '' grain boundaries .	Such boundaries are characterized by excess grain boundary energy , presence of long range elastic stresses and enhanced free volumes .
Along the way , we find conditions on the metric of the holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle $ E_T $ corresponding to the operator $ T $ in the Cowen-Douglas class $ B_1 ( \mathbb D ) $ which ensures negative definiteness of the curvature function .	We obtain a generalization for commuting tuples of operators in the class $ B_1 ( \Omega ) $ , for a bounded domain $ \Omega $ in $ \mathbb C^m $ .
Let $ \mathscr { S } _k^+ ( \cn , \Phi ) $ denote the space generated by Hilbert modular newforms ( over a fixed totally real field $ K $ ) of weight $ k $ , level $ \cn $ and Hecke character $ \Phi $ .	We show how to decompose $ \mathscr { S } _k^+ ( \cn , \Phi ) $ into direct sums of twists of other spaces of newforms .
The photospheric absorption lines are narrow , and we use the Fourier transform technique to infer $ v\sin i=15\pm3 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ .	This $ v\sin i $ implies a maximum rotational period of 31.5 d , a value qualitatively consistent with the observed variability of the optical absorption and emission lines , as well as the Stokes $ V $ profiles and longitudinal field .
Accordingly we prove existence of infinitely many periodic orbits with large period accumulating at the origin .	Such periodic orbits bifurcate from resonant finite dimensional invariant tori of the fourth order normal form of the system .
Although nineteen years have passed since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity , there is still no consensus on its physical origin .	This is in large part because of a lack of understanding of the state of matter out of which the superconductivity arises .
Starting from the phenomenological interaction DD-ME2 with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings , we construct a family of point-coupling effective interactions for different values of the strength parameter of the isoscalar-scalar derivative term .	In the meson-exchange picture this corresponds to different values of the $ \sigma $ -meson mass .
This family is used to get uniform estimates on higher derivatives to solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations .	Those estimates are uniform , up to the possible blowing-up time .
The spectroscopic time series for SN 2012ca is essentially unchanged over 1.5 years , and appear to be dominated at all epochs by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium rather than the underlying supernova ( SN ) .	At late phases , we see a near infrared excess in flux which is possibly associated with dust formation , although without any signs of accompanying line shifts .
Our study concentrates on clean intrinsic graphene , where the spin-orbit coupling from the adatoms can be neglected .	We discuss the effect of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction on spin relaxation under various conditions .
At high temperatures or densities matter formed by strongly interacting elementary particles ( hadronic matter ) is expected to undergo a transition to a new form of matter - the quark gluon plasma - in which elementary particles ( quarks and gluons ) are no longer confined inside hadrons but are free to propagate in a thermal medium much larger in extent than the typical size of a hadron .	The transition to this new form of matter as well as properties of the plasma phase are studied in large scale numerical calculations based on the theory of strong interactions - Quantum Chromo Dynamics ( QCD ) .
It also includes artificial stars for the tip-tilt and pupil guiding systems , as well as four metrology pick-up diodes , for tests and calibration of the corresponding sub-systems .	The calibration unit also hosts the reference targets to align GRAVITY to the VLTI , and the safety shutters to avoid the metrology light to propagate in the VLTI-lab .
The time correlation between successive channel gains is exploited to improve the estimation and tracking capabilities of adaptive algorithms and provide robustness against time-varying channels .	Bidirectional normalized least mean-square and conjugate gradient algorithms are devised along with adaptive mixing parameters that adjust to the time-varying channel correlation properties .
We employ a constructivist model of growth of both neurons and synaptic connections , which permits a Genetic Algorithm ( GA ) to automatically evolve sufficiently-complex neural structures .	The spiking classifiers are coupled with a temporally-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm , which allows the system to perform temporal state decomposition by appropriately rewarding `` macro-actions , '' created by chaining together multiple atomic actions .
For this purpose , we introduce the concept of a hypothetical Peierls barrier , which reproduces all the aspects of the dislocation glide at 0 K resulting from the complex response to non-glide stresses and is expressed in a compact form by the yield criteria advanced in Part II .	To achieve this the barrier is dependent not only on the crystal symmetry and interatomic bonding but also on the applied stress tensor .
We present three ways of viewing these pseudo-dualities : as a series of transformations in the STU model , as a combination of Melvin twists and T-dualities and , finally , as a sequence of two generalized spectral flows and a coordinate transformation .	We then use these to find an infinite family of asymptotically flat embeddings of NHEK spacetimes in string theory , parameterized by the arbitrary values of the moduli at infinity .
However , the higher CMB multipoles have a richer phenomenology .	The CMB anisotropy power spectrum will for the most part simply project to smaller scales , as the comoving distance to last scattering increases , and we derive a scaling relation that describes this behaviour .
Hashtags provide users with a tagging mechanism to help organize , group , and create visibility for their posts .	This is a simple idea but can be challenging for the user in practice which leads to infrequent usage .
We show that , within the observation accuracy of the NFW parameters , the calculated value of $ R_ { eff } $ can be rather close to the observable cutoff of the galaxy distribution .	Moreover , the comparison of our toy model with the observable data and simulations leads to the following preferable NFW parameters for the Coma cluster : $ R_ { 200 } \approx 1.77\ , h^ { -1 } \ , \mathrm { Mpc } = 2.61\ , \mathrm { Mpc } $ , $ c=3\div 4 $ and $ M_ { 200 } = 1.29 h^ { -1 } \times10^ { 15 } M_ { \odot } $ .
The MINIBALL germanium array was used to detect gamma rays from the excited states in 12Be .	The gamma-ray detection enabled a clear identification of the four known bound states in 12Be , and each of the states has been studied individually .
The resulting atomic beam has a 1 mm diameter , its divergence is reduced from 40 down to 3 mrad and the atomic density is increased by a factor of 200 .	The collimation effect has been studied versus the order of the Laguerre-Gaussian mode ( up to 10 ) and the laser atom frequency detuning ( 2 to 120 GHz ) .
A two dimensional numerical model of the plasma contraction was developed in a cylindrical frame .	The process is described by a set of time-dependent continuity equations for the electrons , positive and negative ions ; gas and vibrational temperature ; and equations which account for the convective heat and plasma losses by the transverse flux .
The optical theorem for free particles gives a relation between the effective Hamiltonian and the cross section , a relation that is valid also when bound states are present .	We have found that the method with the Covariant-evolution-operator/Green 's operator that we have developed primarily for structure problems can here be applied in a rather straightforward manner .
The infrared behaviour of the medium modified gluon propagator in non-equilibrium situations is studied in the covariant gauge using the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time path formalism .	It is shown that the magnetic screening mass is non-zero at the one loop level whenever the initial gluon distribution function is non isotropic with the assumption that the distribution function of the gluon is not divergent at zero transverse momentum .
The superpartner of $ N $ develops the vacuum expectation value ( VEV ) of order TeV so that the DM $ N $ achieves the desired mass of 2 TeV .	By the VEV , the U ( 1 ) _R symmetry is broken to the discrete Z_2 symmetry , which is identified with the matter parity in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( MSSM ) .
We also extend the number of examples where we can show reducibility significantly by establishing the existence of algebras with the required properties using methods developed by Fuchs , Runkel and Schweigert .	As a result we show that the quantum representations are reducible in the SU ( N ) case , N & gt ; 2 , for all levels k\in \mathbb { N } .
We study six groups and clusters of galaxies suggested in the literature to be `fossil ' systems ( i.e.to have luminous diffuse X-ray emission and a magnitude gap of at least 2 mag-R between the first and the second ranked member within half of the virial radius ) , each having good quality X-ray data and SDSS spectroscopic or photometric coverage out to the virial radius .	The poor cluster AWM4 is clearly established as a fossil system , and we confirm the fossil nature of four other systems ( RXJ1331.5+1108 , RXJ1340.6+4018 , RXJ1256.0+2556 and RXJ1416.4+2315 ) , while the cluster RXJ1552.2+2013 is disqualified as fossil system .
Moreover , a charge transfer of 0.6 electrons off the contact aluminium site is found .	Both the suppressed hybridization and the violated charge neutrality are characteristic features of metallic nanocontacts .
We show that the critical value of the matrix model coupling is identical for the finite and infinite lattice cases .	However , the critical values of the coupling of the continuum field theory , in the large $ N $ limit , is finite in the infinite lattice case and zero in the case of finite lattice .
These models have topological sectors labeled by group products along topologically non-trivial loops .	Measurement of relative sector probabilities and the distribution of distance between defect pairs are done to characterize the types of order ( topological or quasi-LRO ) exhibited by these models .
A total of 302 third-order Goldstone diagrams are organized into 12 one-body and 23 two-body terms .	Only third-order two-body terms and diagrams are presented here , owing to the fact that the one-body terms are identical to the previously studied third-order terms in monovalent ions .
The property has been studied in limited dimensions and the generalization in arbitrary dimensions is not straight-forward .	In this Letter , we prove a useful formula , which makes it possible to investigate this conjectured universality in arbitrary dimensions for the maximally symmetric black holes in general Lovelock gravity and $ f ( R ) $ gravity .
We present a design for high energy density laboratory experiments studying the interaction of hypersonic shocks with a large number of inhomogeneities .	These `` clumpy '' flows are relevant to a wide variety of astrophysical environments including the evolution of molecular clouds , outflows from young stars , Planetary Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei .
Our main contribution is a sound methodto combine our previous optimal method for tracking least fix-points in PDL with our previous optimal method for handling converse in the description logic ALCI .	The extension is non-trivial as the two methods can not be combined naively .
This solution can be found in two different ways : ( i ) by first explicitly constructing the Ricci-flat Kahler metric on resolved conifold and then solving the supergravity equations for the D3-brane ansatz with constant dilaton and ( self-dual ) 3-form fluxes ; ( ii ) by generalizing the `` conifold '' ansatz of hep-th/0002159 in a natural `` asymmetric '' way so that the 1-d action describing radial evolution still admits a superpotential and then solving the resulting 1-st order system .	The superpotentials for the `` resolved '' and `` deformed '' conifold cases turn out to have essentially the same simple structure .
These lattice fractional diffusion equations contain difference operators that describe long-range jumps from one lattice site to other .	In continuum limit , the suggested lattice diffusion equations with non-integer order differences give the diffusion equations with the Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives for continuum .
Certificateless public key cryptography simplifies the complex certificate management in the traditional public key cryptography and resolves the key escrow problem in identity-based cryptography .	Many certificateless authenticated key agreement protocols using bilinear pairings have been proposed .
We report the pressure dependence of all the Raman-active first-order phonons of the tetragonal scheelite phase ( BaWO4-I , space group I41/a ) , which is stable at normal conditions .	As pressure increases the Raman spectrum undergoes significant changes around 6.9 GPa due to the onset of the structural phase transition to the monoclinic BaWO4-II phase ( space group P21/n ) .
The QoS information parameter includes New Connection Blocking Probability ( NCBP ) , Hand off Connection Dropping Probability ( HCDP ) and Connection Outage Probability ( COP ) .	In addition , a Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio ( SINR ) based Call Admission Control ( CAC ) algorithm and Queue based Scheduling algorithm are integrated for the cross layer design .
We evaluate two-loop b - & gt ; s gamma matrix elements of all the four-quark operators containing no derivatives .	Contrary to previous calculations , no expansion in the mass ratio mc/mb is performed , and all the possible Dirac and flavor structures are included .
The second one , LW2 , is obtained from the model of Liu and Weeks ( 1998 ) using the repulsions term to construct the attractions one with retained possibility to change the parameters in the two independently .	The third model , MM2 , is a minimal one constructed ad hoc and in this article it plays a central role .
The second is the class of universal covering maps from the plane to the sphere with two removed points modeled on transcendental meromorphic maps with two asymptotic values .	The problem we address is to give a combinatorial characterization of the holomorphic maps contained in these classes whose post-singular sets are finite .
It is specially suited for high-throughput computing since the jobs evaluating the parameter space are loosely coupled or independent .	A tool that integrates the modeling of a parameter study with the control of jobs in a distributed architecture is presented .
We demonstrate that the different quark flavour branching ratios in proton decay are related to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angles , whereas the lepton flavour branching ratios are undetermined .	The light neutrino mixing angles observable via oscillation effects are related to the heavy conjugate ( right-handed ) neutrino mass matrix , which also plays a key role in cosmological baryogenesis .
102 , 096406 ( 2009 ) ] that FeSc2S4 is in a local `` spin-orbital singlet '' state driven by spin orbit coupling , close to a quantum critical point , which separates the `` spin-orbital singlet '' phase from a magnetically and orbitally ordered phase .	In this paper , we refine further and develop this theory of FeSc2S4 .
The matrix elements are modified by Sudakov form factors and the parton showers are subjected to a veto procedure to cancel dependence on $ y_ { ini } $ to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy .	The method provides a leading-order description of hard multi-jet configurations together with jet fragmentation , while avoiding the most serious problems of double counting .
We test our formulation with a simple advection problem , with sound waves encountering a density discontinuity , and with shock tubes containing a contact discontinuity between air and Diesel oil .	For all examined problems where particles have different masses , the new formulation yields better results than standard SPH .
This chapter is a tutorial on techniques and results in free convex algebraic geometry and free real algebraic geometry ( RAG ) .

The new features studied , often required in practical applications , can be summarized in three main points .	First , we consider a highly expressive terminological language , called ALCNR , including general complements of concepts , number restrictions and role conjunction .
The scheme is based on the competition between the unitary dynamics induced by the classical fields and the collective decays induced by the dissipation of two delocalized field modes .	Under certain conditions , the symmetric or asymmetric entangled state is produced in the steady state .
This description of the transition functions gives a connection between representation theories of the quantum loop algebra $ U_q ( \widetilde { gl } _2 $ and the elliptic quantum group $ E_ { \rho , \gamma } ( sl_2 ) $ and is analogous to the Kohno-Drinfeld theorem on the monodromy group of the differential Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation .	In order to establish these results we construct a discrete Gauss-Manin connection , in particular , a suitable discrete local system , discrete homology and cohomology groups with coefficients in this local system , and identify an associated difference equation with the qKZ equation .
Eight bursts of seventeen entering the sample , have significant extragalactic X-ray absorptions .	Of these we find a range in metallicities from sub-solar to a few hundred times the solar value .
Carbon sequestration is the process of capture and long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) with the aim to avoid dangerous climate change .	In this paper , we propose a simple mathematical model ( a coupled system of nonlinear ODEs ) to capture some of the dynamical effects produced by adding charcoal to fertile soils .
We find that in some samples , changes in the contact resistance dominate the measured resistance change .	In others , strain large enough to fracture the tube can be applied without a significant change in the contact resistance .
To study the coil perfomance , the theoretical signal-to-noise ratio predictions of this coil design were computed using a different number of slots .	Results were also compared with theoretical results obtained for a circular coil with similar dimensions .
Finally , unate cascade functions have been studied in the design of logic circuits and binary decision diagrams .	This paper shows that the class of nested canalyzing functions is equal to that of unate cascade functions .
Thus there occurs a flow of dark energy towards the apparent horizon .	As a result the entropy of the dark energy decreases and that of horizon increases .
Model color magnitude diagrams of low-metallicity globular clusters usually show a deficit of hot evolved stars with respect to observations .	We investigate quantitatively the impact of such modelling inaccuracies on the significance of star formation history reconstructions obtained from optical integrated spectra .
Two equations of state are dynamically generated for the { \it same } set of model parameters used to describe the nucleon : one corresponds to a chiral restored phase with almost massless quarks and the other to a chiral broken phase .	The chiral symmetric phase saturates at around five times the nuclear matter density .
We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data , yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data .	This approach allows us to rapidly learn , sample from , and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps , as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model .
Our method is based on a simple formulation for implicit interfaces , which rewrites boundary integrals as volume integrals over the entire space .	The resulting algorithm thus inherits the benefits of both level set methods and boundary integral methods to simulate the nonlocal front propagation problem with possible topological changes .
We investigate the possibility that the observed rotation of galaxies can be accounted for by invoking a massive baryonic disc with no need for non-baryonic dark matter or a massive halo .	There are 5 primary reasons for suggesting this : 1. there are well known disc surface mass density distributions that naturally produce the observed rotation curves of galaxies .
To study the origin of such AGN pairs , we employ a cosmological , hydrodynamic simulation with a large volume of ( 182Mpc ) ^3 from the set of Magneticum Pathfinder Simulations .	The simulation self-consistently produces 35 resolved black hole ( BH ) pairs at redshift z=2 , with a comoving distance smaller than 10kpc .
The sensitive parameter dependence of the corresponding currents includes frequent sign reversals .	Zeros of either quantity entail the exclusive occurrence of the other and thus give rise in particular to angular-momentum separation without mass transport as a classical analogue of spin-polarized currents .
Automatic headline generation is an important research area within text summarization and sentence compression .	Recently , neural headline generation models have been proposed to take advantage of well-trained neural networks in learning sentence representations and mapping sequence to sequence .
In this paper , we explore this phenomenological possibility within string theory .	In particular , we discuss how the proton decay bound can be satisfied in Type I string theory .
The system provides low-cost minute-by-minute alignment monitoring with submicron precision .	To reduce ambiguities , we modified the original three-element rasnik design to a two-element one .
These formation energies show the pyrochlore structure to be favored over the fluorite structure , apparently contradicting the conclusions based on experimental neutron and X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) .	By calculating and comparing XRD spectra for a set of differently ordered and random structures , we show that the pyrochlore structure is consistent with diffraction experiments .
We study the impact of including the self-energy feedback and frequency-dependent interactions on functional renormalization group grows for the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at weak to moderate coupling strength .	Previous studies using the functional renormalization group had ignored these two ingredients to large extent , and the question is how much the flows to strong coupling analyzed by this method depend on these approximations .
In terms of the imaginary-time formalism at finite temperature , the root of Planck 's law of radiation can be traced back to finite modification of the infinite vacuum energy induced by the periodic boundary condition in the temporal direction .	We give the explicit conversion from the Casimir force to Planck 's law of radiation , which shows the apparent correspondence between the system bounded by parallel conducting plates and the thermodynamic system .
The calculation is performed on a 2+1 flavor , domain wall fermion ensemble with a 330MeV pion mass and a 575 MeV kaon mass .	We use a quenched charm quark with a 949 MeV mass to implement Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani cancellation .
The corresponding upper limits to the time-average rates of the constant variations are |d\alpha/ ( \alpha dt ) | & lt ; 1.6\times 10^ { -14 } yr^ { -1 } and |d\mu/ ( \mu dt ) | & lt ; 2.2\times10^ { -14 } yr^ { -1 } .	These limits serve as criteria for selection of those theoretical models which predict \alpha and \mu variation with the cosmological time .
Some interesting constraints are obtained by studying the universality of kaon and pion leptonic decays , CP violating polarization of $ K^+_ { \mu 3 } $ , charged lepton anomalous magnetic moments , and $ ( \mu\ra e \gamma ) $ like rare decays .	In particular , we can use the limit of electron dipole moment to constrain the size of the CP violating triplet correlation in the $ e^+ e^- \ra t \bar { t } $ process .
Depending on the functional and which error estimate that is being used , the difference in the error between the elastic constants and the bulk modulus can be rather large , about a factor of two .	According to our study , the overall best performing density functional approximation for determining the structure and elastic properties is the PBEsol , closely followed by the two hybrid functionals PBE0 and HSE , and the AM05 functional .
But in high-temperature superconductors ( HTSC ) , it is still controversial whether or not EPC is in favor of paring .	Despite the controversies , many experiments have provided clear evidence for EPC in HTSC .
In this paper , we give a lower bound on the number of independent sets in a $ d $ -regular graph mirroring the upper bound in the Kahn-Zhao theorem .	The main result of this paper is a proof of a strengthened form of Galvin 's conjecture , covering the case $ n\leq 2d $ as well .
In this context I present the Fortran code SUSY_FLAVOR which calculates these processes in the generic MSSM including the complete resummation of all chirally enhanced effects as a new feature of version 2 .	Than I discuss where large new physics effects in the MSSM are still possible .
We apply a technique of the partial wave decompositions and carry out some angular integrations in closed form .	Different representations appropriate for numerical calculations are derived for the matrix elements of interest .
While geometry can explain the observed correlation , many radio sources comprise two radio lobes and so we model the projected area of a two component emitter intercepted by a foreground absorber .	From this , the observed optical depth/linear size relationship is best reproduced through models which approximate either of the two Fanaroff & amp ; Riley classifications , although the observed scatter in the sample can not be duplicated using a single deprojected radio source size .
We consider the statistical inference for precision matrices with ultra high-dimensional time dependent observations .	More specifically , let $ \boldsymbol { \Omega } $ be the precision matrix and $ \mathcal { S } $ be a given index set of interest .
Valid metric distances between high order networks have been defined but they are difficult to compute when the number of nodes is large .	The goal here is to find tractable approximations of these network distances .
In the case of the symmetric two-group model , we establish an explicit `single-letter ' characterization of the per-vertex mutual information between the vertex labels and the graph .	The explicit expression of the mutual information is intimately related to estimation-theoretic quantities , and -- in particular -- reveals a phase transition at the critical point for community detection .
Some practical examples prove that is possible to Recognise Portuguese Granites in 100 % , with only 3 morphological features ( from an original set of 117 features ) , which is well suited for real time applications .	Moreover , the present method represents a robust strategy to understand the proper nature of the images treated , and their discriminant features .
We show that for these systems the choice of boundary conditions ( open boundaries as opposed to periodic boundary conditions ) is not a mere technicality ; the influence of anyons produced at the boundaries becomes in fact dominant for large enough $ L $ .	This influence can be both beneficial or detrimental .
We propose a monotonic logic of internalised non-monotonic or instant interactive proofs ( LiiP ) and reconstruct an existing monotonic logic of internalised monotonic or persistent interactive proofs ( LiP ) as a minimal conservative extension of LiiP .	Instant interactive proofs effect a fragile epistemic impact in their intended communities of peer reviewers that consists in the impermanent induction of the knowledge of their proof goal by means of the knowledge of the proof with the interpreting reviewer : If my peer reviewer knew my proof then she would at least then ( in that instant ) know that its proof goal is true .
We have mapped the dispersion spectrum of the 1D wires down to the depletion of the last 1D subband by measuring the conductance \emph { G } as a function of the in-plane magnetic field \emph { B } , the interlayer bias $ V_ { \rm dc } $ and the wire gate voltage .	There is a strong suppression of tunnelling at zero bias , with temperature and dc-bias dependences consistent with power laws , as expected for a Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid caused by electron-electron interactions in the wires .
However the expected mm variations are too small to be detected above the noise , probably explaining the lack of success of previous searches for a correlation between X-ray and mm variations .	In addition we show that the infrared leads the X-rays by 0.75+/-0.25 days .
They proved that any subword complex is homeomorphic to a ball or a sphere and asked about their geometric realizations .	We show that a family of subword complexes can be realized geometrically via regular triangulations of root polytopes .

The fraction of kinematically-disturbed galaxies increases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from the cluster centre , but remains constant with projected galaxy density .	We also studied morphological disturbances in the stellar light from HST/F814W images , finding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar in all environments .
To solve this problem , we propose a exact branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm , where the pricing subproblem is a resource-constrained elementary least-cost path problem .	We first prove that at least an optimal solution to the pricing subproblem is associated with an extreme collection pattern , and then design a tailored and novel label-setting algorithm to solve it .
It is a closed loop of Dirac Z ( N ) flux and has strength k=1 , 2 , .. , N-1 .	It is analyzed for generic k and small gauge coupling in the high temperature phase of { \cal N } =1 , 2 and 4 SUSY theory up and including cubic order .
One often sees a sharp distinction in mathematics between descriptions from the outside and from the inside .	Think of defining a set in the plane through an algebraic equation , or dynamically as the closure of the orbit of some point under iterations of a given mapping .
A number of interesting relations between common information measures include the duality relations based on M\ '' obius inversion on lattices , which are the direct consequence of the symmetries of the lattices ( subsets ordered by inclusion ) of the sets of variables .	In this paper we define operators on functions on these lattices that map the functions into one another , called M\ '' obius operators .
Motivated by the recent finding of superconductivity in layered CoO_2 compounds , we investigate superconducting and magnetic instabilities of interacting electrons on the two-dimensional triangular lattice .	Using a one-loop renormalization group scheme for weak to moderate coupling strengths , we find that for purely local interactions U & gt ; 0 and small Fermi surfaces the renormalization group flow remains bounded down to very low scales and no superconducting or other instabilities can be detected .
We then employ the familiar canonical quantization procedure in the given cosmological setting to find the cosmological wave functions in the corresponding minisuperspace .	Using a gauge-fixed ( reduced ) Lagrangian , we show that , it may lead to a Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation for the quantum-mechanical description of the model under consideration , the eigenfunctions of which can be used to construct the time dependent wave function of the universe .
We determine dimensionless versions of the maximum surface density , accretion rate , and effective viscosity that can be sustained by density-wave turbulence without fragmentation .	Where fragments do form , we study the final masses that result .
We determine the exact massive prepotentials and the monodromy matrices around the weak coupling limit .	We also study that the double scaling limit of these massive theories and find that the massive N_f -1 theory can be obtained from the massive N_f theory .
The gauge invariant equations for the displacement field have been derived .	It has been shown that the energy-momentum tensor of this field conserves and hence the displacement field can be treated as one that transports energy and gravitates .
We synthesized hexagonal-disc-shaped MgB2 single crystals under high-pressure conditions and analyzed the microstructure and pinning properties .	The lattice constants and the Laue pattern of the crystals from X-ray micro-diffraction showed the crystal symmetry of MgB2 .
Rather , irradiance measurements are typically available from a few , relatively small sensors and thus aggregate solar irradiance must be estimated from these data .	As a step towards finding more accurate methods for estimating aggregate irradiance from avaialble measurements , we evaluate semiparametric spatio-temporal models for global horizontal irradiance .
This rectification occurs for gate voltages for which the normal-metal lead is resonant with a level of the quantum dot .	At the gate voltages at which the current is at the maximum current , a significant decrease in the current shot noise is observed .
We present a procedure for calculating an upper limit on the number of signal events which incorporates the Poisson uncertainty in the background , estimated from control regions of one or two dimensions .	For small number of signal events , the upper limit obtained is more stringent than that extracted without including the Poisson uncertainty .
BL Lac objects are the best candidates to study the jet properties since their spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) are less contaminated by the emission from the accretion disk and external Compton processes .	We compile the broadband SEDs observed with Fermi/LAT and other instruments from literature for 24 TeV BL Lac objects .
This work forms the foundation of our understanding of black hole demography , and provides constraints on scenarios for black hole formation and growth , and on their connection to the formation and properties of the host galaxy .	I will address these topics in this same order .
We also propose two modular extensions to this formulation .	The first extension increases the number of subtrees that define the feature space , and the second one removes noisy features from the graph representations .
We investigated two-dimensional brittle fragmentation with a flat impact experimentally , focusing on the low impact energy region near the fragmentation-critical point .	We found that the universality class of fragmentation transition disagreed with that of percolation .
Previously we have shown that , given a continuous map $ X \to \C\times\C^* $ from a finitely connected planar domain $ X $ without isolated boundary points , a stronger Oka property holds , namely that the map is homotopic to a proper holomorphic embedding .	Here we show that every continuous map from a finitely connected planar domain , possibly with punctures , into $ \C\times\C^* $ is homotopic to a proper immersion that identifies at most countably many pairs of distinct points , and in most cases , only finitely many pairs .
Some of the properties we derive appear to be inconsistent with any of the models put forward to explain the breaking of self-similarity in the baryon content of clusters .	In particular , the entropy profiles , scaled to the virial radius , are broadly similar in form across the sample , apart from a normalization factor which differs from the simple self-similar scaling with temperature .
We show that even tiny variations in the atomic arrangement at the interface cause significant changes in the tunnel barrier parameters and , consequently , in electron transport properties .	Especially , we obtain that variations in the crucial barrier heights and widths can be as large as 2 eV and 5 \AA , respectively .
One of the most fruitful results of this approach is the { \sl morphology -- cosmology connection } for X-ray clusters .	Simulations have provided the means to make concrete predictions for the X-ray morphologies of clusters in cosmologies with different $ \Omega_o $ , with the result that low $ \Omega_o $ cosmologies fair rather poorly when compared to observations .
Then we investigate the observables that could easily differentiate QVF from the classical magnetic dipole radiation for pulsars with braking indices ( n ) measured accurately .	We show this is specially the case for the time evolution of a pulsar 's magnetic dipole direction ( $ \dot { \phi } $ ) and surface magnetic field ( $ \dot { B } _0 $ ) .

In this paper , we present a regularization to 1D Grad 's moment system to achieve global hyperbolicity .	The regularization is based on the observation that the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian of the flux in Grad 's moment system is independent of the intermediate moments .
Work of Simpson , Arapura and others show that if $ \Gamma $ is the fundamental group of a compact K\ '' ahler manifold , then the strata are finite unions of translated affine subtori .	If follows that for K\ '' ahler groups the jumping loci must be defined by binomial ideals .
We give new invariant Einstein metrics on the Stiefel manifold $ V_5\mathbb { R } ^n $ ( $ n\ge 7 $ ) and through this example we show how to prove existence of invariant Einstein metrics by manipulating parametric systems of polynomial equations .	This is done by using Gr\ '' obner bases techniques .

Another idea is to take into consideration all possible singularities of equation studied .	Application of our approach to search exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations is discussed in detail .
This provides an accurate approximation of the condensate density that includes healing effects at leading order that are missing in the widely adopted Thomas-Fermi approximation .	The results presented herein allow us to formulate useful approximations to a range of experimental systems including the equilibrium properties of a finite temperature Bose gas and the steady-state properties of a 2D nonequilibrium condensate .
In this paper , we developed an adaptive beamforming based on least mean squared error algorithm and null deepening to combat co-channel interference ( CCI ) for the space-time coded OFDM ( STC-OFDM ) system .	To illustrate the performance of the presented approach , it is compared to the null steering beamformer which requires a prior knowledge of directions of arrival ( DOAs ) .
We find a well-evolved , intermediate luminosity cluster with Lx= ( 6.4+-1.3 ) x10^43 erg/s ( 0.5-2.0 keV ) and strong central 1.4 GHz radio emission .	The cluster galaxy population exhibits a pronounced transition toward bluer colors at cluster-centric distances of 1-2 core radii , consistent with an age difference of 1-2 Gyr for a single burst solar metallicity model .
We propose another way to topologize $ H^n ( k , G ) $ : in the key case $ n = 1 $ , identify $ H^1 ( k , G ) $ with the set of isomorphism classes of objects of the groupoid of $ k $ -points of the classifying stack $ \mathbf { B } G $ and invoke Moret-Bailly 's general method of topologizing $ k $ -points of locally of finite type $ k $ -algebraic stacks .	Geometric arguments prove that these `` classifying stack topologies '' enjoy the properties expected from the \v { C } ech topologies .
In this paper we find a solution for a quasi-isotropic inflationary Universe which allows to introduce in the problem a certain degree of inhomogeneity .	We consider a model which generalize the ( flat ) FRW one by introducing a first order inhomogeneous term , whose dynamics is induced by an effective cosmological constant .
Such an analysis is more sensitive to structure on scales & gt ; 50 Mpc than a full 3 dimensional analysis given the geometry of the survey .	We find a strong peak in the power spectrum at approximately 100 Mpc relative to the smooth continuum expected from the best fit Cold Dark Matter model ( Probability is 2.5x10^ { -4 } with Omega h = 0.3 assuming a Gaussian random field ) .
Three ongoing microlensing experiments have found more candidate events than expected from the known stars .	These experiments measure only one parameter of the massive compact halo objects ( machos ) , the magnification time scale of the events .

We study the problem of describing such sequences $ ( b_n ) $ in terms of the asymptotic decay of the subsequence $ ( b_ { p_j } ) $ , where $ p_j $ denotes the $ j $ th prime number .	Given a multiplicative sequence $ b= ( b_n ) $ we prove ( among other results ) : $ b $ is an $ \ell_1 $ -multiplier for $ \mathcal { H } _\infty $ provided $ |b_ { p_j } | & lt ; 1 $ for all $ j $ and $ \overline { \lim } _n \frac { 1 } { \log n } \sum_ { j=1 } ^n b_ { p_j } ^ { *2 } & lt ; 1 $ , and conversely , if $ b $ is an $ \ell_1 $ -multiplier for $ \mathcal { H } _\infty $ , then $ |b_ { p_j } | & lt ; 1 $ for all $ j $ and $ \overline { \lim } _n \frac { 1 } { \log n } \sum_ { j=1 } ^n b_ { p_j } ^ { *2 } \leq 1 $ ( here $ b^* $ stands for the decreasing rearrangement of $ b $ ) .

More specifically , for any frame $ E $ of $ m $ vectors in $ \mathbb { R } ^k $ except possibly from a subset of Gaussian measure exponentially small in $ m $ and for any number $ L \geq 2 $ of quantization levels per measurement to be used to encode the unit ball in $ \mathbb { R } ^k $ , there is an algorithmic quantization scheme and a dual frame together which guarantee a reconstruction error of at most $ \sqrt { k } L^ { - ( 1-\eta ) m/k } $ , where $ \eta $ can be arbitrarily small for sufficiently large problems .	Additional features of the proposed algorithm include low computational cost and parallel implementability .
First , a meshless simulation method is presented for multiphase fluid-particle flows with a two-way coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ( SPH ) for the fluid and the Discrete Element Method ( DEM ) for the solid phase .	The unresolved fluid model , based on the locally averaged Navier Stokes equations , is expected to be considerably faster than fully resolved models .
We extend the renormalized perturbation theory for the single impurity Anderson model to the n-channel model with a Hund 's rule coupling , and show that the exact results for the spin , orbital and charge susceptibilities , as well as the leading low temperature dependence for the resistivity , are obtained by working to second order in the renormalized couplings .	A universal relation is obtained between the renormalized parameters , independent of n , in the Kondo regime .
Remarkably , we find evidence of a correlation which is ruled out as a chance alignment at the 3sigma level .	The best fit Bianchi model corresponds to x=0.55 , Omega_0=0.5 , a rotation axis in the direction ( l , b ) = ( 222degr , -62degr ) , shear ( sigma/H ) _0=2.4e-10 and a right -- handed vorticity ( omega/H ) _0=6.1e-10 .

Dynamic trading systems , which make use of market mechanisms , show promise for more efficient resource allocation and pricing in the cloud .	However , most of the existing mechanisms ignore the seller 's costs of providing the resources .
This physics sets clear physical scales for the fragmentation conditions and the properties of gravitationally bound clumps .	Collapse of a fragment proceeds until the neutrons become degenerate ; a neutron star of mass ~0.1-1Msun may result .
For instance , it has been observed that high-z SNe Ia have bluer colours than the local ones : although this goes against extinction to explain why SN are dimmer with redshift until z ~ 1 , supporting a decelerating universe , it also demonstrates intrinsic evolution effects .	-- SNe Ia could evolve because the age and metallicity of their progenitors evolve .
The Helfrich functional , denoted by H^ { c_0 } , is a mathematical expression proposed by Helfrich ( 1973 ) for the natural free energy carried by an elastic phospholipid bilayer .	Helfrich theorises that idealised elastic phospholipid bilayers minimise H^ { c_0 } among all possible configurations .
We exploit the knot insertion algorithm offered by NURBS ( Non Uniform Rational B-splines ) to generate cohesive elements along delamination planes in an automatic fashion .	A complete computational framework is presented including pre-processing , processing and post-processing .
Instead , there is a smooth crossover to a weakly naturated state .	Our second conclusion is that even when the inter-strand attraction alone is too weak for creating a naturated state at the given temperature , and also the surface-strand attraction alone is too weak for creating an adsorbed state , the combined effect of the two attractions can lead to a naturated and adsorbed state .
Our definition of pPDA allows both probabilistic and non-deterministic branching , generalising the classical notion of pushdown automata ( without epsilon-transitions ) .	Our first contribution is a general construction that reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic transition systems to checking bisimilarity of non-deterministic transition systems .

Selfies are an effective medium to grab attention ; they generate on average 1.1 -- 3.2 times more likes and comments than other types of content on Instagram .	Compared to other content , interactions involving selfies exhibit variations in homophily scores ( in terms of age and gender ) that suggest they are becoming more widespread .
The Higgs sector of the Standard Model offers a unique opportunity to probe the hidden sector .	The Higgs squared operator is the only dimension two operator which is Lorentz and gauge invariant .
This is confirmed , however it is also demonstrated that the process can require quite precise conditions .	An alternative , more stable , formation process is proposed as the interaction of more than two segments of domain wall .
For strong spontaneous emission from that state , however , the ionization is never complete because the dark state required for STIRAP does not exist .	We demonstrate that this drawback can be eliminated almost completely by creating a laser-induced continuum structure ( LICS ) by embedding a third discrete state into the continuum with a third control laser .

We adopt class dependency networks , where nodes represent software classes and edges represent dependencies among them , and show that these networks reveal a significant community structure , characterized by similar properties as observed in other complex networks .	However , although intuitive and anticipated by different phenomena , identified communities do not exactly correspond to software packages .
In 2001 , Montgomery \cite { MR2702379 } conjectured that , for a $ d $ -regular graph $ G $ , $ \chi_2 ( G ) -\chi ( G ) \leq 2 $ .	In this regard , for a $ d $ -regular graph $ G $ , we present two upper bounds for $ \chi_2 ( G ) -\chi ( G ) $ , one of them , $ \lceil 5.437\log d+2.721\rceil $ , is an improvement of the bound $ 14.06\log d +1 $ , proved by Alishahi ( 2011 ) \cite { MR2746973 } .
In rare cases , the white dwarf is embedded in the wind nebula of a red-giant companion ; the explosion products plow through the nebula and produce X-ray emission .	Early this year , an eruption of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi [ 2,3 ] provided the first opportunity to perform comprehensive X-ray observations of such an event and diagnose conditions within the ejecta .
It is also a source of increased emissions and delays , and does not yield improved runway throughput .	Leveraging the extensive past research on airport departure management , this paper explores the environmental and safety benefits that improved surveillance technologies can bring in the context of gate- or spot-release strategies .
We find that the tunneling current is multistable when the fluctuating potential with a finite correlation time is applied before the non-equilibrium steady state is built up .	The non-equilibrium stationary current is heavily dependent on the history of the fluctuating potential during the transient period if the potential has a finite correlation time .
The upper main sequence magnetic chemically peculiar ( Ap ) stars exhibit a non-uniform distribution of chemical elements across their surfaces and with height in their atmospheres .	These inhomogeneities , responsible for the conspicuous photometric and spectroscopic variation of Ap stars , are believed to be produced by atomic diffusion operating in the stellar atmospheres stabilized by multi-kG magnetic fields .

The rapidly increasing number of applications has heightened interest in more compact comb generators .
We study the role of spin-orbit interactions in the coupled magnetoelectric dynamics of a ferromagnetic film coated with an electrical conductor .	While the main thrust of this work is phenomenological , several popular simple models are considered microscopically in some detail , including Rashba and Dirac two-dimensional electron gases coupled to a magnetic insulator , as well as a diffusive spin Hall system .
First , we demonstrate how it is possible to identify part of the optimal solution|i.e. , a provably optimal solution for a subset of nodes| without knowing a complete solution .	Second , we show that for submodular functions , a WTA fixed point always yields a globally optimal solution .
The presence of the fundamental length is expected to lead to an improved ultra-violet behavior of the semi-classical propagators .	The hypothesis of path integral duality provides a prescription to evaluate the modified propagator of a free , quantum scalar field in a given spacetime , taking into account the existence of the fundamental length in a locally Lorentz invariant manner .
Comparisons are made with Mackey 's theory of induced representations .	For simplicity , we focus on square integrable ( discrete series ) unitary representations although many of the techniques apply more generally , with minor adjustment .
We place upper limits on the column densities and infer upper limits on the gas masses assuming that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , is well-mixed , and has a temperature , Tgas ~ 65 K. Our measurements suggest that this system possesses very little molecular gas .	Therefore , we infer an upper limit for the gas : dust ratio ( & lt ; 4.0 ) assuming that the gas is atomic .
We shall discuss both a method based on the standard formulation as well as a method based on a penalty approach , which combine techniques developed in our previous work on parametrized saddle point problems with current reduced basis techniques for parabolic problems .	The analysis then shows how time integration affects the development of reduced basis a posteriori error bounds as well as the construction of computationally efficient reduced basis approximation spaces .
Based on the rather old ages ( $ \sim 100 $ Myr ) , masses , sizes of the two clusters and their projected separation , we conclude that the cluster pair must have been born with an initial separation of 15 -- 20 pc .	Clusters with a smaller initial separation tend to merge in $ \aplt 60 $ Myr due to loss of angular momentum from escaping stars .
We develop a worldline approach to quantum gravity in D=4 .	Using the background field method we consider the covariantly gauge fixed Einstein-Hilbert action with cosmological constant , and find a worldline representation of the differential operators identified by its quadratic approximation .
We performed high-resolution simulations of two stellar collisions relevant for stars in globular clusters .	We considered one head-on collision and one off-axis collision between two 0.6 M_sun main sequence stars .
We use emission line diagnostics to compare a sample of 14 clumpy ( unstable ) disks and a sample of 13 smoother ( stable ) disks at redshift z~0.7 .	The majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a high probability of containing AGN .
This is reflected in the analysis of experimental results on tracer particles and the discussions which follow , as reported in recent experimental and numerical publications .	To quantitatively validate this prediction , we have conducted a microfluidic experiment generating elastic turbulence , a flow characterised in the literature as smooth in space and random in time .
Context : Hadronic models , involving matter ( proton or nuclei ) acceleration in blazar jets , imply high energy photon and neutrino emissions due to interactions of high-energy protons with matter and/or radiation in the source environment .	Aims : This paper shows that the sensitivity of the IceCube neutrino telescope in its 40-string configuration ( IC-40 ) is already at the level of constraining the parameter space of purely hadronic scenarios of activity of blazars .
Microstructura lly clean , isov alently P-doped BaFe2As2 ( Ba-122 ) single crystalline thin films have been prepared on MgO ( 001 ) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy .	These films show a superconducting transition temperature ( Tc ) of over 30 K although P content is around 0.22 , which is lower than the optimal one for single crystals ( i.e. , 0.33 ) .
Specifically , we show that spiraling shallow refractive index landscapes induce coupling and periodic energy exchange between states with different topological charges .	Such a resonant effect enables excitation of optical vortices by vortex-free inputs and allows the output topological charge of the beam to be controlled .
The scheme features a filtering mechanism that the faulty events can be discarded by detecting the polarization of the photons .	That is , our protocols either succeed with 100 % fidelity or fail in a heralded way , which is advantageous for implementing realistic long-distance quantum communication .
Xenon between the two spheres forms a self-shield and veto device .	The inner surface of the central sphere is coated with CsI to form an internal photocathode with minimum of 2\pi coverage for any event in the active volume .
We propose a new prediction interval estimation method tailored for this type of data , which is prevalent in biology and medicine .	We call this method Distribution Adaptive Prediction Interval Estimation given Nominal inputs ( DAPIEN ) and has four main phases .
Therefore , by simultaneously fitting the X-ray and lensing profiles of galaxy clusters new constraints can be obtained .	In this work , we apply this methodology to the stacked profiles of 58 high-redshift ( $ 0.1 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.2 $ ) clusters using X-ray surface brightness profiles from the XMM Cluster Survey and weak lensing profiles from CFHTLenS .
Applications relevant for energy production , medicine , or national security also rely on theoretical predictions of basic properties of atomic nuclei .	Heavy elements are best described within the nuclear density functional theory ( DFT ) and its various extensions .
It is applied to the evaluation of the free energy of QCD at order g^5 and the calculation of the g^6 term is outlined .	Implications for the application of perturbative QCD to the quark-gluon plasma are also discussed .
In the case of a circular equilibrium ( i.e.vorton ) state of a closed string loop it is shown that the fundamental axisymmetric ( $ n=0 $ ) and lowest order ( $ n=1 $ ) nonaxisymmetric perturbation modes can never be unstable .	However , stability for modes of higher order ( $ n\geq 2 $ ) is found to be non-trivially dependent on the values of the characteristic propagation velocity , $ c $ say , of longitudinal perturbations and of the corresponding extrinsic perturbation velocity , $ v $ say .
We have found that the bulge of the large , nearby Sb galaxy NGC 7331 rotates retrograde to its disk .	Analysis of spectra in the region of the near-IR Ca II triplet along the major axis shows that , in the radial range between 5 '' and ~20 '' , the line of sight velocity distribution of the absorption lines has two distinct peaks , and can be decomposed into a fast-rotating component with v/sigma & gt ; 3 , and a slower rotating , retrograde component with v/sigma between 1 -- 1.5 .
This abstract system is then included in another abstract system which captures the evolution semantics of Petri-nets .	The evolution semantics results in some B events depending on the chosen policies : basic nets or high level Petri nets .
In the m-L plane , there is a line of center symmetry changing phase transitions .	In the limit m- & gt ; infinity , this transition takes place at L_c=1/T_c , where T_c is the critical temperature of the deconfinement transition in pure Yang-Mills theory .
Background : The triple-alpha reaction is the key to our understanding about the nucleosynthesis and the observed abundance of $ ^ { 12 } $ C in stars .	The theory of this process is well established at high temperatures but rather ambiguous in the low temperature regime where measurements are impossible .
Closed-form expressions are obtained for the average symbol error rate ( ASER ) for general order rectangular QAM and cross QAM schemes using moment generating function based approach .	Derived expressions are in the form of Lauricella 's $ ( F_D^ { ( n ) } ( \cdot ) , \Phi_1^ { ( n ) } ( \cdot ) ) $ hypergeometric functions which can be numerically evaluated using either integral or series representation .
One the one hand , populations may become pinned at a local fitness optimum , being separated from higher-fitness genotypes by a { \em fitness barrier } of low-fitness genotypes .	On the other hand , the population may only be metastable on the level of phenotype or fitness while , at the same time , diffusing over { \em neutral networks } of selectively neutral genotypes .
The phase diagram and other equilibrium observables , obtained from the real part of the effective potential , are calculated in the mean-field approximation .	The obtained results are compared to those found with the so-called saddle-point approach .
In particular , we recover the fundamental Rees 's mixed multiplicity theorem for modules , which was proved first by Kirby and Rees in \cite { Kirby-Rees1 } and recently also proved by the authors in \cite { Bedregal-Perez } .	Our work is based on , and extend to this new context , the results on mixed multiplicities of ideals obtained by Vi\^et in \cite { Viet8 } and Manh and Vi\^et in \cite { Manh-Viet } .
We prove that for a star in dynamic equilibrium , the necessary and sufficient condition for thermodynamic equilibrium ( extremum of total entropy S ) is constancy of angular velocity ( \Omega ) , redshifted temperature , and redshifted chemical potential .	Friedman previously identified positivity of canonical energy , E , as a criterion for dynamic stability and argued that all rotating stars are dynamically unstable to sufficiently nonaxisymmetric perturbations ( the CFS instability ) , so our main focus is on axisymmetric stability .
An important element that distinguishes our study from other works is a consistent allowance for the evolution of the angle between the magnetic and spin axes .	We find the distribution of extinct radio pulsars in spin period for two models : the model with hindered particle escape from the neutron star surface and the model with free particle escape .
Square grids are commonly used in robotics and game development as spatial models and well known in AI community heuristic search algorithms ( such as A* , JPS , Theta* etc . )	are widely used for path planning on grids .
We show how it is used in an abstract algebraic approach to the definition of integrals over paths which involves a cochain complex of finite increments .	In the context of such abstract integration theories we outline a connection with the combinatorics of rooted trees .
We have measured the magneto-resistance of a two-dimensional electron gas ( 2DEG ) under continuous microwave irradiation as a function of electron density and mobility tuned with a metallic top-gate .	In the entire range of density and mobility we have investigated , we observe microwave induced oscillations of large amplitude that are B-periodic .
In this work , we focus on the sensitivity of the evolution to the initial flow state , which has not received much attention in 3-D modeling studies .	We find that different initial states lead to markedly different distributions-even under the application of strong forcing ( large day-night temperature difference with a short `` thermal drag time '' ) that may be representative of close-in planets .
We study the quantization of many-body systems in three dimensions in rotating coordinate frames using a gauge invariant formulation of the dynamics .	We consider reference frames defined by linear gauge conditions , and discuss their Gribov ambiguities and commutator algebra .
Numerical simulations of the SO ( 3 ) lattice gauge theory show that the adjoint Wilson line has a very small value at low temperatures ; at high temperatures , metastable states are observed in which the adjoint Wilson line takes positive or negative values .	The effective action is able to explain the origin of these metastable states .
Delay tomography has so far burdened source and receiver measurement nodes in a network with two requirements such as path establishment and clock synchronization between them .	In this letter , we focus on the clock synchronization problem in delay tomography and propose a synchronization-free delay tomography scheme .
Spatial and temporal inhomogeneities in light and atom variables are incorporated by partitioning the system into small homogeneous segments .	Furthermore , other experimental imperfections as for instance limited detector time-resolution and atomic motion are simulated .
It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand side is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls .	The key idea , first described but not implemented in ( Chernyshenko et al. , Phil.Trans.R . Soc .
The expressions are based on the concept of the ( complex ) magnetic transition dipole moment vector .	Using the new theory , we determine the parities of ground and excited spin states of high-spin ( S = 5/2 ) Fe ( III ) in hemin from the polarization dependence of experimental ground state EPR line intensities .
Through the use of the Kronecker product and some basic facts of tensor algebra , we propose a simple model of nonlinearity , one that can be interpreted as a product of the outputs of K FIR linear filters , and compute its cost function together with its gradient , which allows for some analysis of the optimization problem .	We use these results it in a stochastic gradient framework , from which we derive an LMS-like algorithm and investigate the problems of multi-modality in the mean-square error surface and the choice of adequate initial conditions .
We compute boundary three-point functions involving two scalars and a gauge field of arbitrary spin in the AdS vacuum of Vasiliev 's higher spin gravity , for any deformation parameter \lambda .	In the process , we develop tools for extracting scalar field equations in arbitrary higher spin backgrounds .
The equations of motion of these models reduce to systems of the Liouville equations endowed with energy and momentum constraints .	The general solution of the equations and constraints in terms of chiral moduli fields is explicitly constructed and some extensions of the basic integrable model are briefly discussed .
We perform simulations to examine the accuracy of the derived distribution when nuisance parameters have to be estimated as well as robustness of the derived distribution to deviations from Gaussianity .	Through simulations , we also compare it with the well-known conditional distribution of the mle , which may be interpreted as a Bayesian solution to the change-point problem .
The temperature and abundance were obtained to be 4-6 keV and 0.2-0.5 solar value with average values of 5.62+0.05-0.07 keV and 0.36+0.02-0.01 solar value within a radius of 5 ' , respectively .	The redshift was derived to be 8.01+0.02-0.02x10^-2 against an optical value of 8.45x10^-2 .
Our fringe visibility is as high as 38 % in this optically guided atom interferometer .	We observe a time-of-flight in the waveguide of over half a second , demonstrating the utility of our optical guide for future sensors .
We extend the Deligne-Bezrukavnikov theory of perverse coherent sheaves by showing that a coherent middle extension ( or intersection cohomology ) functor from perverse sheaves on U to perverse sheaves on X may be defined for a much broader class of perversities than has previously been known .	We also introduce a derived category version of the coherent middle extension functor .
First , it answers the question of how large megaprojects are by measuring them in the units mega , giga , and tera , concluding we are presently entering a new `` tera era '' of trillion-dollar projects .	Second , total global megaproject spending is assessed , at USD 6-9 trillion annually , or 8 percent of total global GDP , which denotes the biggest investment boom in human history .
The response system is described by a linear differential equation coupled nonlinearly to the drive system .	In the linear approximation the equations of our coupled system coincide with those of the Bateman dual system ( a pair of damped and anti-damped harmonic oscillators ) .
It is shown that , for these metals , H_fv is underestimated considerably by DFT .	The aim of the present work is to bridge the gap between the estimates made by DFT calculations and experiments .
They all have high X-ray luminosity ( 10^31 erg/s for HD 283572 and 31 Com and 10^30 erg/s for EK Dra ) .	We compare the Emission Measure Distributions ( EMDs ) of these active coronal sources , derived from high-resolution XMM-Newton grating spectra , as well as the pattern of elemental abundances vs. First Ionization Potential ( FIP ) .
A real Milnor manifold is the non-singular hypersurface of degree $ ( 1,1 ) $ in the product of two real projective spaces .	These manifolds were introduced by Milnor to give generators for the unoriented cobordism algebra , and they admit free actions by elementary abelian 2-groups .
IRAS 16293-2422 was observed with the extended Submillimeter Array ( eSMA ) resulting in subarcsecond resolution ( 0.46 '' x 0.29 '' , i.e. $ \sim $ 55 $ \times $ 35~AU ) images of compact emission from the C $ ^ { 17 } $ O ( 3-2 ) and C $ ^ { 34 } $ S ( 7-6 ) transitions at 337~GHz ( 0.89~mm ) .	To recover the more extended emission we have combined the eSMA data with SMA observations of the same molecules .
However , such calculations depend sensitively on a relatively large number of model input parameters .	Given considerable uncertainty in those model parameters , the predicted inspiral rates for double compact objects relevant to gravitational-wave interferometric detectors have been shown to be are uncertain by several orders of magnitude .
Using this as a case study , we underline the students perspective , highlight the inherent issues and suggest ways to improve the delivery of these subjects .	Since , the issues are mainly generic , the aim is to provide discussion and recommendations to benefit a wider computing community in academia .
We analyze the behavior of the purity , fidelity and Husimi distributions corresponding to initial states localized on short periodic orbits ( scar functions ) and map eigenstates .	Scar functions , that have a fundamental role in the semiclassical description of chaotic systems , emerge as very robust against environmental perturbations .
This acyclicity rests on a comparison between the homology of certain homology-manifolds-with-boundary and the homology of the simplicial complexes obtained by deleting collections of boundary faces from them .	Our resolution implies the multiplier ideal sum formula J ( ( a_1+ ... +a_r ) ^c ) = \sum_ { |v|=c } J ( a_1^ { v_1 } ... a_r^ { v_r } ) , which implicitly follows from Takagi 's proof of the two-summand formula ( math.AG/0410612 ) .
Many results are known about test ideals and $ F $ -singularities for $ { \bf Q } $ -Gorenstein rings .	In this paper we generalize many of these results to the case when the symbolic Rees algebra $ O_X \oplus O_X ( -K_X ) \oplus O_X ( -2K_X ) \oplus ... $ is finitely generated ( or more generally , in the log setting for $ -K_X - \Delta $ ) .
By using an improved `method of variation of constants ' , we show how to combine these three time scales , without making the usual approximation of treating the radiative time scale as an adiabatic process .	We explicitly implement our method at the 2.5PN post-Newtonian accuracy .
X-ray diffraction analysis identifies the main phase to be the superconducting tetragonal \b { eta } -FeSe .	The superconducting transition temperature ( TC ) is determined to be 9.4 K by AC magnetic susceptibility and electronic transport measurements .
Supergroups are defined in the framework of $ \dZ_2 $ -graded Clifford algebras over the fields of real and complex numbers , respectively .	It is shown that cyclic structures of complex and real supergroups are defined by Brauer-Wall groups related with the modulo 2 and modulo 8 periodicities of the complex and real Clifford algebras .
We discuss a method to create two-dimensional traps as well as atomic shell , or bubble , states for a Bose-Einstein condensate initially prepared in a conventional magnetic trap .	The scheme relies on the use of time-dependent , radio frequency-induced adiabatic potentials .
This mapping is exact in the classical percolation limit of the plateau transition , and diffusive behavior at the critical energy is shown to be related to the critical exponents of a class of chiral polymers at the $ \theta $ -point .	The exact critical exponents of the chiral polymer model on the honeycomb lattice are found , verifying that this model is in the same universality class as a previously solved model of polymers on the Manhattan lattice .
The measurement of large scale patterns or anisotropies in the arrival direction of high energy cosmic rays is an important step towards the understanding of their origin .	Such measurements rely on an accurate estimation of the detector relative exposure in each direction on the sky : the coverage map .
Furthermore , it is shown that one of the strongest forms of the word problem in a group $ G $ ( we call it the { \em hereditary word problem } ) can be reduced to $ \mathbf { GPCP } _n $ in $ G $ in polynomial time .	The main results are that $ \mathbf { PCP } _n $ is decidable in a finitely generated nilpotent group in polynomial time , while $ \mathbf { GPCP } _n $ is undecidable in any group containing free non-abelian subgroup ( though the argument is very different from the classical case of free semigroups ) .
But these surface transports are buried in presence of metallic bulk conduction .	We synthesized very high quality Bi $ _2 $ Te $ _2 $ Se single crystals by modified Bridgman method , that possess high bulk resistivity of $ & gt ; $ 20~ $ \Omega $ cm below 20~K , whereas the bulk is mostly inactive and surface transport dominates .
This sampling method is a universal solution for all negative probability problem and shows extraordinarily power in negative cross section problem .	A Monte Carlo simulation including negative cross section contribution is developed and successfully preformed to simulate reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy ( REELS ) spectra for Ag and Au as examples .
Albeit in many realistic scenarios the quantum system can simultaneously interact with composite environments , this condition remains little understood , particularly regarding the effect of the coupling between environmental parts .	We analyze the non-Markovian behavior of a qubit interacting at the same time with two coupled single-mode cavities which in turn dissipate into memoryless or memory-keeping reservoirs .
Orbifolds were defined by Satake , as V-manifolds , then studied by W. Thurston , who introduced the term `` orbifold '' .	Due to their importance in physics , and in particular in the string theory , orbifolds have been drawing more and more attention .
The renormalization group is used to construct the effective interaction V_ { low k } in the low momentum space , starting from various high precision potential models commonly used in nuclear many-body calculations .	With a cutoff in the range of $ \Lambda ~ 2.1 fm^ { -1 } $ , the new potential V_ { low k } is independent of the input model , and reproduces the experimental phase shift data for corresponding laboratory energies below $ E_ { lab } ~ 350 MeV $ , as well as the deuteron binding energy with similar accuracy as the realistic input potentials .
We use Chandra data to infer that an X-ray bright component of gas is in the process of separating the radio lobes of 3C 442A .	This is the first radio galaxy with convincing evidence that central gas , overpressured with respect to the lobe plasma and not simply a static atmosphere , is having a major dynamical effect on the radio structure .
In the ordered side , the scalar spectral function exhibits a universal peak at the Higgs mass .	For N=3 and 4 we confirm its \omega^3 rise at low frequency .
The common practice is to augment an external calibration solution using a known reference signal with an internal calibration on the unknown measurement signal itself .	Contemporary self-calibration schemes try to find a self-consistent solution for signal and calibration by exploiting redundancies in the measurements .
It turnes out that any Berwald metric is a perturbed-Cartesian product of Riemannian , Minkowski , and such non-Riemannian metrics which can be constructed on irreducible symmetric manifolds of $ rank & gt ; 1 $ .	The existence of these metrics are well established by the above theories .
The dust opacities are calculated through Mie theory from the given size distribution and optical properties of the dust grains .	The main focus of the code is to obtain insights on ( 1 ) the global energetics of dust grains in the shell ( 2 ) the 2-D projected morphologies that are strongly dependent on the mixed effects of the axisymmetric dust distribution and inclination angle of the shell .
Random paths are obtained by selecting one of the network nodes at random and performing a random self-avoiding walk ( here called path-walk ) until its termination .	It is shown that the distribution of random paths are markedly different for diverse complex network models ( i.e.Erdos-Renyi , Barabasi-Albert , Watts-Strogatz , a geographical model , as well as two recently introduced path-based network types ) , with the BA structures yielding the shortest random walks , while the longest paths are produced by WS networks .
A graph is called ( claw , diamond ) -free if it contains neither a claw ( a $ K_ { 1,3 } $ ) nor a diamond ( a $ K_4 $ with an edge removed ) as an induced subgraph .	Equivalently , ( claw , diamond ) -free graphs can be characterized as line graphs of triangle-free graphs , or as linear dominoes , i.e. , graphs in which every vertex is in at most two maximal cliques and every edge is in exactly one maximal clique .
Changes in the amplitude and in the spectral index are possible , in addition to modulations of the spectrum .	This strengthens the conclusions of previous work in which the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in expanding inflationary cosmologies was studied , and it was found that , for dispersion relations for which the evolution is not adiabatic , the spectrum changes from the standard prediction of scale-invariance .
We study stars and molecular gas in the direction of IRAS06145+1455 ( WB89-789 ) through NIR ( JHK ) , molecular line- , and dust continuum observations .	The kinematic distance of the associated molecular cloud is 11.9 kpc .
However , the quality of these motion paths , with respect to different quality measures such as path length , clearance , smoothness or energy , is often notoriously low .	This problem is accentuated in the case of non-holonomic sampling-based motion planning , in which the space of feasible motion trajectories is restricted .
ALICE at the LHC is the experiment dedicated to study the physics of nucleus-nucleus collisions .	The apparatus is well suited for the measurement of heavy-quark hadron production , making use of the high spatial resolution provided by the tracking detectors and the excellent particle identification , which are distinctive of the ALICE apparatus .
The information provided by these promises allows individual agents to autonomously schedule information requests in the future and sets the basis for maintaining desired levels of performance at lower implementation cost .	We establish provably correct guarantees for the distributed strategies that result from the proposed approach and examine their robustness against delays , packet drops , and communication noise .
This conjecture is now a theorem , but currently there is no purely local proof .	Working in the equal characteristic case , we find a family of affinoids in the Lubin-Tate tower with good reduction equal to a rather curious nonsingular hypersurface , whose equation we present explicitly .
Some of them , like the carbonaceous CM meteorites experienced aqueous alteration thus their olivine content transformed more or less into hydrated silicates such as phyllosilicates .	These hydrated CM2 meteorites have been investigated in KBr pellets by means of Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR ) spectroscopy .
We study BPS dominated loop amplitudes in M-theory on T^2 .	For this purpose we generalize the concept of helicity supertraces to nine spacetime dimensions .
We use a spectrophotometric model of galaxy evolution which provides a self-consistent description of global properties of local galaxies .	We have chosen two CSFR histories , with and without dust extinction , both normalized in order to reproduce the observed comoving luminosity densities at different wavelengths .
Recent results indicate that the generic descriptors extracted from the convolutional neural networks are very powerful .	This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case .
In haloes above ~ 10^14 Msun , the brightest satellite galaxies are slightly cooler compared to the dark matter , while fainter satellites are hotter .	Within the virial radius of a cluster , the mean velocity dispersion based on the 100 brightest galaxies is a factor of 1.065 +/- 0.005 ( stat ) +/- 0.027 ( sys ) higher than that of the dark matter ( corresponding to a ~10-15 per cent bias in the dynamical mass estimate ) while that based on only the five brightest galaxies is 0.868 +/- 0.039 ( stat ) +/- 0.035 ( sys ) .
The binary system modelled consists of a 3 solar masses AGB star on the main sequence , in a 3AU circular orbit .	Three-dimensional simulations are performed for gases with polytropic indices gamma=1 , 1.1 and 1.5 , to bracket more realistic situations that would include radiative cooling .
The band structure of the underlying ordered system is assumed to correspond to either a direct or an indirect semiconductor .	In particular , luminescence and absorption spectra are computed for various levels of disorder and sample temperature to determine thermodynamic relations , the Stokes shift , and the radiative lifetime distribution .
The field-of-view ( FOV ) of 50 '' x 38 '' is well suited for quiet Sun and sunspot observations .	However , in the vector spectropolarimetric mode the FOV reduces to 25 '' x 38 '' .
This makes parameter estimation and a fully Bayesian treatment of discrete Markov random fields difficult .	We apply approximation theory for pseudo-Boolean functions to binary Markov random fields and construct approximations and upper and lower bounds for the associated computationally intractable normalising constant .
In particular , we show that the problem is an instance of the classical problem of Bolza in the calculus of variations .	A minimizing solution is known to exist .
Weak H_2 absorption is detected in the Intermediate-Velocity Arch ( IV Arch ; abundance \~1.0 solar ) toward PG 1259+593 ( log N ( H_2 ) =14.10 ( +0.21 ) ( -0.44 ) at v ( LSR ) =-55 km/s and log N ( HI ) =19.5 ) .	It thus appears that metal- and dust-poor halo clouds like Complex C are not able to form and maintain widely distributed H_2 , whereas metal and dust-rich halo clouds like the IV Arch can maintain H_2 even at low HI column densities .
upper limits on Higgs production are a factor of 6.2 ( 1.4 ) higher than the SM cross section for a Higgs mass of m_Higgs = 115 ( 160 ) GeV/c^2 .	Based on simulation , the median expected upper limit is 4.3 ( 1.9 ) .
We prove that the linear-time prune-and-search algorithm -- -presented in most textbooks on algorithms -- -can be modified to use $ \Theta ( N ) $ bits instead of $ \Theta ( N ) $ words of extra space .	Prior to our work , the best known algorithm by Frederickson could perform the task with $ \Theta ( N ) $ bits of extra space in $ O ( N \lg^ { * } N ) $ time .
For example , one can study the question when the provers share entanglement or not , and the communication between the verifier and the provers is quantum or classical .	While there are several partial results on the subject , so far no one presented an efficient scheme for recognizing NEXP ( or NP with logarithmic communication ) , except for [ KM03 ] , in the case there is no entanglement ( and of course no communication between the provers ) .
We measure branching fractions $ BR ( B^+\to\eta_c K^+ ) = ( 0.69 + 0.26 - 0.21 +- 0.08 +- 0.20 ) \times 10^ { -3 } $ and $ BR ( B^0\to\eta_c K^0 ) = ( 1.09 + 0.55 - 0.42 +- 0.12 +- 0.31 ) \times 10^ { -3 } $ , where the first error is statistical , the second is systematic and the third is from the $ \eta_c $ branching fraction uncertainty .	From these we extract the $ \eta_c $ decay constant in the factorization approximation , $ f_ { \eta_c } = 335 +- 75 $ MeV .
The analysis of Tully 's groups of galaxies belonging to the Local Supercluster ( LSC ) was performed .	In the 1975 Hawley and Peebles presented the method for investigations of the galaxies orientation in the large structures .
Results : The resulting models remain simple and accurately capture the effect of the initial conditions .	It is possible to generalize the model to networks whose partnerships change in time .
Here we analyze the kinematics of dual cascade decays with missing energy resulting from a stable non-interacting new particle state at the bottom of the decay chain .	We find that if the final step of the decay chain involves a metastable particle , the resulting presence of displaced tracks provides strong constraints with which to solve for the unknown kinematic quantities lost through missing energy .
In this paper we study Lipschitz contact equivalence of continuous function germs in the plane definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure , such as semialgebraic and subanalytic functions .	We partition the germ of the plane at the origin into zones where the function has explicit asymptotic behavior .
In this theoretical work we propose a non-contact motion control technique based on the introduction of a tunable magnetic interaction .	The latter is realized by coating two non-touching sliding bodies with ferromagnetic films .
However , because the number of electrons is a good quantum number for the electronic structure problem it is unnecessary to store the full Fock space of the orbitals .	Representation of the wave function in a basis of Slater determinants for fixed electron number suffices .
This paper has two themes that are intertwined : The first is the dynamics of certain piecewise affine maps on the Euclidean space that arise from a class of analog-to-digital conversion methods called Sigma-Delta quantization .	The second is the analysis of reconstruction error associated to each such method .
The corresponding dynamics mimics the motion of vehicles in a simple traffic flow , which explains the name .	Using connections to topological Markov chains we obtain nontrivial invariant measures , prove their stochastic stability , and calculate the topological entropy .
We point out that such screening masses are sensitive to the same infrared physics as light-cone real-time rates .	In particular , on the perturbative side , the inhomogeneous Schrodinger equation determining screening correlators is shown to have the same general form as the equation implementing LPM resummation for the soft-dilepton and photon production rates from a hot QCD plasma .
An analysis of the Fermi gamma ray space telescope data has recently revealed a resolved gamma-ray feature close to the galactic center which is consistent with monochromatic photons at an energy of about 130 GeV .	If interpreted in terms of dark matter ( DM ) annihilating into \gamma\gamma ( \gamma Z , \gamma h ) , this would correspond to a DM particle mass of roughly 130 GeV ( 145 GeV , 155 GeV ) .
Polydispersity always gives rise to non-Gaussian velocity distributions .	Depending on the driving mechanism the tails can be either overpopulated or underpopulated as compared to the molecular gas .
The bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature are investigated for anchored ideal and excluded-volume polymer chains .	Our results are in good agreement with the previous theoretical predictions .
Observations on 2011 August 9 of an X6.9-class flare in active region ( AR ) 11263 by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly ( AIA ) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) , were followed by a rare detection of vertical kink oscillations in a large-scale coronal active region plasma curtain in EUV coronal lines .	The damped oscillations with periods in the range 8.8-14.9 min were detected and analyzed recently .
Although the gradient descent method is a natural choice for this task , it requires exact gradient computations and hence can be inefficient when the problem size is large or the gradient is difficult to evaluate .	Therefore , there has been much interest in inexact gradient methods ( IGMs ) , in which an efficiently computable approximate gradient is used to perform the update in each iteration .
As expected , the spectrum depends only on \emph { dimensionless } combinations of the constants , and we emphasize the points that make this generally true for cosmological observables .	Our analysis suggests that the CMB spectrum shape is mostly determined by $ \alpha^2m_e/m_p $ and the proton-CDM-particle mass ratio , $ m_p/\mchi $ .
The point is that individuals and companies are more and more kept out of the loop when it comes to control private data .	With the goal of empowering informed choices in information leakage through the Internet , we propose CROWDSURF , a system for comprehensive and collaborative auditing of data that flows to Internet services .

Recent studies on stellar evolution have shown that the properties of compact objects strongly depend on the metallicity of the environment in which they were formed .	Using some very simple assumptions on the metallicity of the stellar populations , we explore how this property affects the unresolved gravitational-wave background from extragalactic compact binaries .
Three variations of a basic control strategy are proposed for different versions of the encirclement problem , and their effectiveness is formally established .	An extension ensuring maintenance of a safe inter-robot distance is also discussed .
SmB6 is a typical KI , but its resistivity does not diverge at low temperatures , which was attributed to some in-gap states 3-10 .	However after several decades of research , the nature and origin of the in-gap states remain unclear .
We prove that the `coordinate functions ' $ \ { f_i , i=1 , \ldots , n \ } $ , ( where $ f_i ( g ) : =\lambda_i ( { \rm Ad } _g ( H_1 ) ) $ , $ \ { \lambda_1 , \ldots , \lambda_n\ } $ is basis of $ \clg^\prime $ ) are `quadratically independent ' in the sense that they do not satisfy any nontrivial homogeneous quadratic relations among them .	Using this , it is proved that there is no genuine compact quantum group which can act faithtully on $ C ( M ) $ such that the action leaves invariant the linear span of the above cordinate functions .
Slave particle approaches are widely used in studies of exotic quantum phases .	A complete description beyond mean field also contains dynamical gauge fields , while a simplified procedure considers Gutzwiller-projected trial states .
The Rabi oscillations of a two-level atom illuminated by a laser on resonance with the atomic transition may be suppressed by the atomic motion through averaging or filtering mechanisms .	The optical analogs of these velocity effects are described .
We present theory and experiments on the dynamics of reaction fronts in two-dimensional , vortex-dominated flows , for both time-independent and periodically driven cases .	We find that the front propagation process is controlled by one-sided barriers that are either fixed in the laboratory frame ( time-independent flows ) or oscillate periodically ( periodically driven flows ) .
Define $ C_r $ as the largest constant such that $ \gamma ( G ) \ge C_r \sum_ { 1 \le i & lt ; j \le r } d ( x_i , x_j ) $ for any $ r $ vertices of an arbitrary connected graph $ G $ ; then $ C_2=\frac { 1 } { 3 } $ in this view .	The main result of this paper is that $ C_r=\frac { 1 } { r ( r-1 ) } $ for $ r\geq 3 $ .

The production of single-top quarks occurs via the weak interaction at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider .	Single top quark events are selected in the lepton+jets final state by CDF and D0 and in the missing transverse energy plus jets final state by CDF .
Here we elucidate the general fundamentals of optical resonances in nonspherical subwavelength dielectric structures of different shapes ( rectangular or triangular ) and dimensionalities ( 1D nanowires and 0D nanoparticles ) .	We demonstrate that the optical properties ( i.e.light absorption ) of nonspherical structures are dictated by the eigenvalue of the structure 's leaky modes .
Some structure theory is used to show how any eulerian digraph can be generated by iterating combinations of just a few canonical graph-theoretic moves .	We describe the effect of each of these moves on the lattice polytopes which encode the toric Calabi-Yau varieties and illustrate the construction in several examples .
Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect these particles exhibit toplogical interactions .	The remnant of the U ( 1 ) ^k CS term in the discrete H gauge theory describing the effective long distance physics of such a model is shown to be a 3-cocycle for H summarizing the nontrivial topological interactions cast upon the magnetic vortices by the U ( 1 ) ^k CS term .
I present an elementary primer of black hole physics , including its general relativity basis , all peppered with astrophysical illustrations .	Following a brief review of the process stellar collapse to a black hole , I discuss the gravitational redshift , particle trajectories in gravitational fields , the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions to Einstein 's equations , orbits in Schwarzschild and in Kerr geometry , and the dragging of inertial frames .
GPS measurements have been evaluated by comparison with 940nm-radiometer observations .	Statistical analysis of GPS measurements points to ORM as an observing site with suitable conditions for infrared ( IR ) observations , with a median column of precipitable water vapor ( PWV ) of 3.8 mm .
When the theories are defined on AdS ( 4 ) space-time there are boundary manifestations of the duality , which for the case of gravity account for the energy-momentum/Cotton tensor duality ( also known as dual graviton correspondence ) .	For AdS ( 4 ) black-hole backgrounds there is no direct analogue of gravitational duality on the bulk , but there is still a boundary duality for quasi-normal modes satisfying a selected set of boundary conditions .
We find a distance modulus difference of 2.41 mags at $ l $ = 5 $ ^ { \circ } $ and $ b $ = -8 $ ^ { \circ } $ and that the extension of the Sgr galaxy towards the galactic plane is inclined toward us .	Assuming $ \rm R_ { GC } $ = 8 kpc , this implies the distance to these stars is $ ( m-M ) _0 $ = 16.97 $ \pm $ 0.07 mags , which corresponds to D = 24.8 $ \pm $ 0.8 kpc .
The Web has been chosen as a basic infrastructure to gain the social structure information , through the social network extraction , from all over the world .	However , most of the web documents are unstructured and lack of semantics .
In this case , the moduli space of the noncommutative deformations is of dimension 19 , the same as the moduli dimension of the complex deformations of commutative algebraic K3 surfaces .	Then , we extend this method to the N-point case .
In cosmology , gravitational-wave distortions are produced by most of the inflationary scenarios and their anticipated detection should open a new window to the early universe .	Motivated by the relative lack of studies on the potential implications of gravitational radiation for the large-scale structure of the universe , we consider its coupling to density perturbations during the post-recombination era .
The method is shown to be an absolutely stable HDG method for the indefinite time-harmonic Maxwell equations with high wave number .	By exploiting the duality argument , the dependence of convergence of the HDG method on the wave number k , the mesh size h and the polynomial order p is obtained .
A crucial role in the construction is played by the $ c $ -singleton cones , the cones in the $ c $ -Cambrian fan which consist of a single maximal cone from the Coxeter fan .	Moreover , if $ W $ is a Weyl group and the vertices of the permutahedron are chosen in a lattice associated to $ W $ , then we show that our realizations have integer coordinates in this lattice .
Different from the traditional detection problem , the goal is to discover key salient points as a way to localize and count the number of objects simultaneously .	We propose two alternatives , one that counts first and then point , and another that works the other way around .
Our results are : ( a ) We see three periods , where 14-C varied over 200 yr in a special way showing a certain pattern of strong secular variation : after a Grand Minimum with strongly increasing 14-C , there is a series of strong short-term drop ( s ) , rise ( s ) , and again drop ( s ) within 60 yr , ending up to 200 yr after the start of the Grand Minimum .	These three periods include the strong rises around BC 671 , AD 775 , and AD 1795 .
The weights are obtained composing a suitable support map with the rank function of a graded lattice that satisfies certain regularity properties .	We express the Krawtchouk coefficients of the corresponding MacWilliams transformation in terms of the combinatorial invariants of the underlying lattice , and show that the most relevant weight functions studied in coding theory belong , up to equivalence , to the class that we introduce .
The the duality between $ { \cal N } =4 $ SYM and the AdS $ _5\times\ ; $ S $ ^5 $ superstring appears to enjoy quantum integrability in the planar limit , which allowed to devise powerful methods ostensibly solving the spectral problem .	However , quantization of the AdS $ _5\times\ ; $ S $ ^5 $ superstring from first principles is still an open question and especially the spectrum of short string states has previously been derived only at leading order in large 't Hooft coupling .
Explicit expressions in the comoving , Newtonian and synchronous gauges facilitate the adaptation of Einstein-Boltzmann codes for solving CMB and matter perturbations in the linear regime .	Using a comoving gauge code , we study the effect of metric evolution on the CMB through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect .
We have composed a sample of 68 massive stars in our galaxy whose projected rotational velocity , effective temperature and gravity are available from high-precision spectroscopic measurements .	The additional seven observed variables considered here are their surface nitrogen abundance , rotational frequency , magnetic field strength , and the amplitude and frequency of their dominant acoustic and gravity mode of oscillation .
We also consider Monte Carlo simulations for a vortex model with a screened interaction .	Critical exponents are determined from scaling analysis of Monte Carlo data for current-voltage characteristics and other quantities .
The investigation helps us to find that the optical theorem has severe contradictions and problem , thus is n't right .	Besides , the calculation of a physical amplitude show that the ameliorated cutting rules keeps the physical result gauge-parameter independent .
We show that after the flips the dynamics is characterized by the creation of two types of exciton-biexciton composites .	We analyze the conditions for the existence of these bound states , and discuss their intriguing properties .

The observed azimuthal correlations at large relative pseudorapidity are used to extract the second-order ( v [ 2 ] ) and third-order ( v [ 3 ] ) anisotropy harmonics of K0S and Lambda/anti-Lambda particles .	These quantities are studied as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in the event and the transverse momentum of the particles .
The model is applied to study the laser induced desorption of O $ _2 $ from the Ag ( 110 ) surface , making use of a six-dimensional potential energy surface calculated within density functional theory .	Our results reveal the importance of the phonon mediated process and show that , depending on the value of the electronic density in the surroundings of the molecule adsorption site , its inclusion can significantly enhance or reduce the desorption probabilities .
We show on examples that our bound is sharp .	We also apply it to Gaussian independent sequences and to the generic class of ultrametric Gaussian processes .
The total survey area is 2.1 square degrees , corresponding to a comoving volume of 1.6 x 10^6 Mpc^3 .	Using a uniform detection threshold of 1.4 x 10^ { -18 } erg s^ { -1 } cm^ { -2 } arcsec^ { -2 } for the Ly-alpha images , we construct a sample of 14 LAB candidates with major-axis diameters larger than 100 kpc , including five previously known blobs and two known quasars .
After that , a coarse saliency map is obtained by integrating the four adjusted Mahalanobis distance maps , each of which is formed by the distances between all the patches and background in the corresponding SBD .	To be more discriminative , the coarse saliency map is further enhanced into the posterior probability map within Bayesian perspective .

A locally-oriented programming model is especially useful for the solution of algorithms requiring the application of a stencil or convolution kernel .
The method is first generalized to the case of quantum strangeness canonical ensemble .	Uncertainties in calculation of the K+/pi+ excitation function are discussed .
This has brought dramatic increase in the capability of particle simulations in many application areas , such as electrostatics , particle formulations of fluid mechanics , and others .

The spectra of SN 2003dh , identified in the afterglow of GRB030329 , are modeled using radiation transport codes .	It is shown that SN 2003dh had a high explosion kinetic energy ( $ \sim 4 \times 10^ { 52 } $ erg in spherical symmetry ) , making it one of the most powerful hypernovae observed so far , and supporting the case for association between hypernovae and Gamma Ray Bursts .
In particular , if A is completely rational with n sectors , then C*_ln ( A ) is a direct sum of n type I_\infty factors .	Its ideal K_A of compact operators has nontrivial K-theory , and we prove that the DHR endomorphisms of C* ( A ) with finite statistical dimension act on K_A , giving rise to an action of the fusion semiring of DHR sectors on K_0 ( K_A ) $ .
Here we present ultraviolet images , taken with the OM UVW2 filter ( 140-270 nm ) , of various Seyfert galaxies , some of which have never been observed in this waveband before .	The images show UV emission from both the active nucleus and the host galaxy .
We consider a continuum model of active viscoelastic matter , whereby an active nematic liquid-crystal is coupled to a minimal model of polymer dynamics with a viscoelastic relaxation time $ \tau_C $ .	To explore the resulting interplay between active and polymeric dynamics , we first generalise a linear stability analysis ( from earlier studies without polymer ) to derive criteria for the onset of spontaneous heterogeneous flows ( strain rate ) and/or deformations ( strain ) .
We study connected , singular-hyperbolic , attracting sets with dense closed orbits { \em and only one singularity } .	These sets are shown to be transitive for most $ C^r $ flows in the Baire 's second category sence .
In previous work it has been shown that the electromagnetic quantum vacuum , or electromagnetic zero-point field , makes a contribution to the inertial reaction force on an accelerated object .	We show that the result for inertial mass can be extended to passive gravitational mass .
With absolute visual magnitudes up to M_V = -9.5 they are the ideal to obtain accurate quantitative information about galaxies through the powerful modern methods of quantitative stellar spectroscopy .	The spectral analyis of individual blue supergiant targets provides invaluable information about chemical abundances and abundance gradients , which is more comprehensive than the one obtained from HII regions , as it includes additional atomic species , and which is also more accurate , since it avoids the systematic uncertainties inherent in the strong line studies usually applied to the HII regions of spiral galaxies beyond the Local Group .
A maximum likelihood source detection was performed in the 0.5-2 keV , 2-4.5 keV and 4.5-10 keV energy bands and 1390 point-like sources were detected in at least one band .

In the constant rate mode including a temporary stop at a temperature $ T_a $ , the memory of the aging at $ T_a $ was found to be kept and then to be recalled during the subsequent heating process .	In the negative temperature cycling process , a strong rejuvenation effect has been observed after the temperature shift from the initial temperature $ T_1 $ to the second temperature $ T_2 $ ( $ =T_1+\Delta T $ ) when $ \Delta T\approx -20 $ K .
In order to evaluate combination of evidence for this system , using observed data , auxiliary at tribute and diagnosis variables , and inference rules connecting them , one must first choose an appropriate algebraic logic description pair ( ALDP ) : a formal language or syntax followed by a compatible logic or semantic evaluation ( or model ) .	Three common choices- for this highly non-unique choice - are briefly discussed , the logics being Classical Logic , Fuzzy Logic , and Probability Logic .
Condensate clouds strongly impact the spectra of brown dwarfs and exoplanets .	Recent discoveries of variable L/T transition dwarfs argued for patchy clouds in at least some ultracool atmospheres .
We use this as an input to calculate the low energy part of the current-current correlation function in nuclear matter .	For the isovector channel we find a significant enhancement of the in-medium spectral density below the $ \rho $ resonance while the $ \rho $ meson mass itself changes only slightly .
The strip width/pitch size was chosen such to fulfill the impedance matching with the front-end electronics and the granularity requirements of the innermost zone of the CBM-TOF wall .	The in-beam tests using secondary particles produced in heavy ion collisions on a Pb target at SIS18 - GSI Darmstadt and SPS - CERN were focused on the performance of the prototype in conditions similar to the ones expected at SIS100/FAIR .
On the assumption that z_abs ~ z_em DLAs are neither ejecta from the QSO , nor part of the host galaxy itself , we use the number density statistics of these DLAs to investigate galaxy clustering near the QSO redshift .	We find that n ( z ) of z_abs \~z_em DLAs in our radio-selected QSO sample is ~4 times larger than the number density of intervening DLAs , implying an excess of galaxies near the QSO .

Having in mind the large-scale analysis of gene regulatory networks , we review a graph decimation algorithm , called `` leaf-removal '' , which can be used to evaluate the feedback in a random graph ensemble .	In doing this , we consider the possibility of analyzing networks where the diagonal of the adjacency matrix is structured , that is , has a fixed number of nonzero entries .
The advent of MOOCs has stimulated interest in using online videos to deliver content in university courses .	We examined student engagement with 78 online videos that we created and were incorporated into a one-semester blended introductory mechanics course at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
Cupolets exhibit the interesting property that a given set of controls will uniquely identify a cupolet , independent of its initial condition .	Practical applications of cupolets already include data compression , secure communication , and image processing .
However , a role for selection in cultural evolutionary dynamics is less clear .	Often neutral evolution ( also known as 'drift ' ) models , are used to explain the evolution of human communication systems , and cultural evolution more generally .
We separate the redshifts into 4 bins and assume a constant EOS parameter for dark energy in each bin .	The EOS parameters are decorrelated by diagonalizing the covariance matrix .
The impact of laboratory astrophysics ranges from the scientific conception stage for ground-based , airborne , and space-based observatories , all the way through to the scientific return of these projects and missions .	It is our understanding of the under-lying physical processes and the measurements of critical physical parameters that allows us to address fundamental questions in astronomy and astrophysics .
The result is obtained first for a small-sized system and its validity is checked against the numerical calculation .	Then the general expression is found which is valid for arbitrary size of the system .
In the case of AB And , OO Aql , and U Peg a high-amplitude , nearly one-century long quasi-sinusoidal pattern was also found .	It might be explained as light-time effect , or by some magnetic phenomena , although the mathematical , and consequently the physical , parameters of these fits are very problematic , as the obtained periods are very close to the length of the total data range .
In this paper , we investigate phenomenological aspects of this model and discuss the possibility of the direct detection of the dark matter .	In particular , we focus on the light neutralino case and find that the light-Higgsino scenario such as the focus point is interesting , taking account of the recent CDMS result .
A stable gap and two bands emerges for all momentum when the coupling strength beyonds a critical value .	Generally , The upper band on the positive frequency axis is much sharper than the lower band on the negative side .
We generalize the separability results in one-sided PGICs ( OPGICs ) by Sung \emph { et al . }	to two-sided PGICs ( TPGICs ) .
It is remarkable that the dynamical state can therefore be predicted from the mean spatial configuration of the active colloids , or from an analysis of the fluctuations near equilibrium .	This has the surprising consequence that while 2 particles , or polygonal arrays of 4 or more colloids , synchronize with the nearest neighbors in anti-phase , a system of 3 equally spaced colloids synchronizes in-phase .
Ferromagnetic transition in three-dimensional double-exchange models is studied by the Monte Carlo method .	Critical temperature $ T_ { \rm c } $ is precisely determined by finite-size scaling analysis .
The normalized factorial moments $ F_q $ are continued to noninteger values of the order $ q $ , satisfying the condition that the statistical fluctuations remain filtered out .	That is , for Poisson distribution $ F_q = 1 $ for all $ q $ .
The formalism is applied in various situations and emphasis is put on the momentum representation .	In the presence of a transverse harmonic confinement , dimensional reduction toward two-dimensional ( 2D ) or one-dimensional ( 1D ) physics is derived within this formalism .
When the polarimetric sensitivity and the angular resolution exceed a threshold , magnetic fields show up almost everywhere on the solar surface .	Here I revise the observational properties of the weakest polarization signals , which appear in the InterNetwork ( IN ) regions .
Essentially the only algorithm known previously was for the special case of binary answers , as follows from the work of Tsirelson in 1980 .	Among other things , our result implies that the variant of the unique games conjecture where we allow the provers to share entanglement is false .

Matrix factorization from a small number of observed entries has recently garnered much attention as the key ingredient of successful recommendation systems .	One unresolved problem in this area is how to adapt current methods to handle changing user preferences over time .
This paper establishes the equivalence of a deformed theory with that in a nearby state space in the bundle via a connection that defines maps between nearby state spaces .	We find that an appropriate connection for establishing equivalence is one that arose in a recent paper by Kugo and Zwiebach .
The ionization parameter of the material ( i.e. , the flux to density ratio ) is around 10^3 , resulting in a Fe K line from He-like iron .	A supersolar abundance of iron is not required by the data .
This can be tricky , as both dust and old stars redden galactic spectra at the wavelengths used to infer dust .	Measuring dust emission directly from these galaxies is thus a more accurate way to estimate the total dust mass , giving us real physical information on the stellar populations and interstellar medium ( ISM ) enrichment .
Morphologically , 10 of these remnants have coherent , extended arc or shell structures , while the remaining objects are more irregular in form but clearly filamentary in nature , typical of optically detected SNRs .	In 11 cases there was a clear if not complete match between the optical and radio structures with H filamentary structures registered inside and along the presumed radio borders .
We present a correlation between X-ray surface brightness and Faraday rotation measure in galaxy clusters , both , from radio and X-ray observations as well as from modeling of the intra-cluster medium .	The observed correlation rules out a magnetic field of constant strength throughout the cluster .
Both Nearest-Neighbor Analysis and angular two-point cross-correlation function show that there is no enough evidence supporting the correlation between the GRBs and foreground clusters .	We suggest that the non-correlation is probably related to the GRB number-flux relation slope .
In order to obtain the best-known guarantees , algorithms are traditionally tailored to the particular problem we want to solve .	Two recent developments , the Unique Games Conjecture ( UGC ) and the Sum-of-Squares ( SOS ) method , surprisingly suggest that this tailoring is not necessary and that a single efficient algorithm could achieve best possible guarantees for a wide range of different problems .
Analyzing two standard preparators , the Stern-Gerlach and the hole-in-the-screen ones , it is demonstrated that four entities are the basic ingredients of the theory : the composite-system preparator-plus-object state ( coming about as a result of a suitable interaction between the subsystems ) , a suitable preparator observable , one of its characteristic projectors called the triggering event , and , finally , the conditional object state corresponding to the occurrence of the triggering event .	The concepts of a conditional state and of retrospective apparent ideal occurrence are discussed in the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics .
These objects are made of a self-interacting scalar field and -- depending on the scalar field 's mass -- can be as dense as neutron stars or even black holes .	In contrast to the former these objects do not contain a well-defined surface , while in contrast to the latter the space-time of boson stars is globally regular , can -- however -- only be given numerically .
DCell can support millions of servers with high network capacity by only using commodity switches .	With one exception , we prove that a $ k $ level DCell built with $ n $ port switches is Hamiltonian-connected for $ k \geq 0 $ and $ n \geq 2 $ .

We confirm that the spin excitations are always gapped as long as the intra-ring couplings form a regular triangle .
For extremal case , the near region is expected to be the near horizon region in which the correspondence via the asymptotic symmetry is studied .	We investigate the hidden conformal symmetry in the near horizon limit and consider the relation between the hidden conformal symmetry and the asymptotic symmetry in the near horizon limit .
This phenomenon is counterintuitive to the behavior described by conventional Snell 's law and resulted from the interplay between \epsilon-near-zero and material loss .	This property has potential applications in communications to increase acceptance angle and energy delivery without using optical lenses and mechanical gimbals .
The impact of new stellar evolution models with rotation on the predictions of population synthesis models is discussed .	Massive rotating stars have larger convective cores than their non-rotating counterparts , and their outer layers are chemically enriched due to increased mixing .
Near Earth Objects ( NEOs ) are fragments of remnant primitive bodies that date from the era of Solar System formation .	At present , the physical properties and origins of NEOs are poorly understood .

Measured spectra from threshold to high energy in different conditions are well described by the models based on quantified activities .
We have developed the Point Process Algorithm ( PPA ) , a Bayesian technique for extracting planetary signals using the sine-chopped outputs of a dual nulling interferometer .	It is so-called because it represents the system being observed as a set of points in a suitably-defined state space , thus providing a natural way of incorporating our prior knowledge of the compact nature of the targets of interest .
We search for their identifications in the SIMBAD database and find 3.2 million identified sources .	Based on these known sources , we establish three criteria for selecting candidate AGB stars in the Galaxy , which are three defined occupation zones in a color-color diagram , Galactic latitude |gb| & lt ; 20 deg , and `` corrected '' WISE third-band W3c & lt ; 11 .
In this paper we extend those results to the case when one naively blows up X at any suitably generic zero-dimensional subscheme Z .	The resulting algebra A has a number of curious properties ; for example it is noetherian but never strongly noetherian and the point modules are never parametrized by a projective scheme .
These wells are shown to support many bound states .	We calculate the properties of the wells and bound levels , and show that their lifetimes are limited by that of the constituent Rydberg atoms .
We report on very-long-baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) observations at 2.3 , 8.4 , and 15.4 GHz towards the active galaxy NGC 1052 .	The convex spectra of the double-sided jets and the nucleus imply that synchrotron emission is obscured through free -- free absorption ( FFA ) by the foreground cold dense plasma .
In case the software can not calculate minimal surface integrals analytically , it offers the possibility to proceed with a numerical evaluation of the corresponding terms .	We 'll understand how the area formula incorporates the structure of the domain wall approximation .

In this paper we present the first-ever computer formalization of the theory of Gr\ '' obner bases in reduction rings , which is an important theory in computational commutative algebra , in Theorema .	Not only the formalization , but also the formal verification of all results has already been fully completed by now ; this , in particular , includes the generic implementation and correctness proof of Buchberger 's algorithm in reduction rings .
Numerical values of the magnetic susceptibility for both the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions are reported for arbitrary orientations of the molecule in the magnetic field .	It is shown that both diamagnetic and paramagnetic susceptibilities grow with inclination , while paramagnetic susceptibility is systematically much smaller than the diamagnetic one .
We consider the effect of self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation on the joint spectral amplitude of photon pairs generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing .	In particular , the purity of a heralded photon from a pair is considered , in the context of schemes that aim to maximise the purity and minimise correlation in the joint spectral amplitude using birefringent phase-matching and short pump pulses .
The mirror sterile neutrino masses will have a form of canonical seesaw while the ordinary active neutrino masses will have a form of double and linear seesaw .	In this canonical and double-linear seesaw scenario , we can expect one sterile neutrino at the eV scale and the other two above the MeV scale to fit the cosmological and short baseline neutrino oscillation data .
In the early Universe , when the trace of the matter stress-energy tensor is nearly zero , the chameleon is very light , and Hubble friction prevents it from reaching the minimum of its effective potential .	Whenever a particle species becomes non-relativistic , however , the trace of the stress-energy tensor is temporarily nonzero , and the chameleon begins to roll .

Using a path integral formulation , we derive a reduced effective action with long-range impurity spin-spin interactions at different imaginary times .	In the semiclassical limit , it is equivalent to a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain with two-spin , three-spin , etc .
Despite the fact that the problem of interference mechanism of magnetoresistance in semiconductors with hopping conductivity was widely discussed , most of existing studies were focused on the model of spinless electrons .	This model can be justified only when all electron spins are frozen .
For the first time all the light travel time effects ( LCTE ) are fully considered , along with a proper treatment of Compton cooling , which depends on them .

They include in particular ( i ) the manifestly conformally covariant construction , from the basic principle , of the singlet-projection operator for performing the Wick contraction and ( ii ) the derivation of the monodromy relation for the case of the so-called `` harmonic R-matrix '' , as well as for the usual fundamental R-matrtix .	The former case , which is new and has features rather different from the latter , is expected to have important applications .
We investigate the shielding performance of the experiment by means of a geometric diffraction model in order to predict the level of the spillover and diffraction sidelobes in the direction of the ground .	Using 408 MHz and 1465 MHz feed measurements , the model shows how a weakly-diffracting and unshielded antenna configuration becomes strongly-diffracting and double-shielded as far-field diffraction effects give way to near-field ones .
These new results are also compared to published results from F-K supergiant analyses , and found to be in good agreement when both sets of data are carefully examined as differential ( SMC minus Galactic standard ) abundances .

Electronic transport in highly doped but still insulating silicon at low temperatures is dominated by hopping between localized states ; it serves as a model system of a disordered solid for which the electronic interaction can be investigated .	We have studied the frequency-dependent conductivity of phosphorus-doped silicon in the THz frequency range ( 30 GHz to 3 THz ) at low temperatures $ T\geq 1.8 $ K.

The non-Markovian character observed from both online and offline cases is suggested by the scaling law in the distribution of dwelling time at individual and collective levels , respectively .	Furthermore , we argue that the lower entropy and higher predictability in human mobility for both online and offline cases may origin from this non-Markovian character .
One prediction of particle acceleration in the supernova remnants in the magnetic wind of exploding Wolf Rayet and Red Super Giant stars is that the final spectrum is a composition of a spectrum $ E^ { -7/3 } $ and a polar cap component of $ E^ { -2 } $ at the source .	This polar cap component contributes to the total energy content with only a few percent , but dominates the spectrum at higher energy .

We show that BiMnO3 displays under pressure a rich sequence of five phases with a great variety of structures and properties , including a metallic phase above 53 GPa and , between 37 and 53 GPa , a strongly elongated monoclinic phase that allows ferroelectricity , which contradicts the traditional expectation that ferroelectricity vanishes under pressure .	Between 7 and 37 GPa , the Pnma structure remains remarkably stable but shows a reduction of the Jahn-Teller distortion in a way that differs from the behavior observed in the archetypal orthorhombic Jahn-Teller distorted perovskite LaMnO3 .
We are able to resolve a long-standing controversy by showing that the soft-pion theorem result $ f_0 ( q^2_ { max } ) = f_B/f_ { \pi } $ does hold as $ m_ { \pi } \rightarrow 0 $ .	We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism for the light quarks and show that staggered chiral perturbation theory for the $ m_ { \pi } $ dependence is almost identical to continuum chiral perturbation theory for $ f_0 $ , $ f_B $ and $ f_ { \pi } $ .

Using a data clustering method to combine hadronic cross section data sets from different measurements we demonstrate that using all available experimental data up to c.m .	energies of 10.538 GeV allows for determinations of experimental moments and their correlations with small errors and that there is no need to rely on theoretical input above the charmonium resonances .
We present a theory of the elementary spin excitations in transition metal ferromagnet nanoparticles which achieves a unified and consistent quantum description of both collective and quasiparticle physics .	The theory starts by recognizing the essential role played by spin-orbit interactions in determining the energies of ferromagnetic resonances in the collective excitation spectrum and the strength of their coupling to low-energy particle-hole excitations .
We apply a tree-based methodology to solve new , very broadly defined families of nested recursions of the general form R ( n ) =sum_ { i=1 } ^k R ( n-a_i-sum_ { j=1 } ^p R ( n-b_ { ij } ) ) , where a_i are integers , b_ { ij } are natural numbers , and k , p are natural numbers that we use to denote `` arity '' and `` order , '' respectively , and with some specified initial conditions .	The key idea of the tree-based solution method is to associate such recursions with infinite labelled trees in a natural way so that the solution to the recursions solves a counting question relating to the corresponding trees .

In a plot of i against Omega the bright Kreutz sungrazers ( such as C/1843 D1 , C/1882 R1 , C/1963 R1 , etc . )
At classical level , dynamical derivation of the properties and conservation laws for topologically non-trivial systems from Noether theorem versus the derivation of the system 's properties on topological grounds are considered as distinct .	We do celebrate any agreements in results derived from these two distinct approaches : i.e.the dynamical versus the topological approach .
We study the properties of random graphs where for each vertex a { \it neighbourhood } has been previously defined .	The probability of an edge joining two vertices depends on whether the vertices are neighbours or not , as happens in Small World Graphs ( SWGs ) .
With a single-step high temperature growth , second phase clusters are formed at an early stage .	On the other hand , with low temperature growth , the film tends to be disordered even in the absence of a second phase .
We investigate the stability of spherically symmetric , purely magnetic , soliton and black hole solutions of four-dimensional $ { \mathfrak { su } } ( N ) $ Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ .	These solutions are described by $ N-1 $ magnetic gauge field functions $ \omega _ { j } $ .
However , context-aware applications do not always behave as user 's desire , and can cause users to feel dissatisfied with unexpected actions .	To solve these problems , context-aware systems must provide mechanisms to adapt automatically when the context changes significantly .
We introduce a three-dimensional lattice gas model to study the glass transition .	In this model the interactions come from the excluded volume and particles have five arms with an asymmetrical shape , which results in geometric frustration that inhibits full packing .
This source is X-ray absorbed , shows only narrow emission lines in the optical spectrum and is detected in the sub-mm : it is the ideal candidate in an evolution scheme for AGN ( e.g.Fabian ( 1999 ) ; Page et al .	( 2004 ) ) of an early phase corresponding to the main growth of the host galaxy and formation of the central black hole .
A full-fledged combined numerical analysis is performed of these high-energy and low-energy FCNC decay modes in the MSSM parameter space .	Our calculation shows that the available data on B ( b- & gt ; s \gamma ) severely restricts the allowed values of B ( h- & gt ; b\bar { s } ) .
We observe sharp changes in the low frequency mass and scattering rate below the upper ferromagnetic transition $ T_C = 53 K $ .	The characteristic changes are exhibited most strongly at an energy scale of around 12 meV ( 100 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ ) .

Using optical second-harmonic generation ( SHG ) microscope , we observed a marked history dependence of SHG intensity through zero-field cooling ( ZFC ) , zero-field heating ( ZFH ) , field heating after ZFC ( FH/ZFC ) and FH after field cooling ( FH/FC ) .	These show different paths with respect to temperature : In the ZFC/ZFH process , weak SHG was observed at low temperature , while in the FH/ZFC process , relatively high SHG appears in a limited temperature range below TF depending on the field strength , and in the FC and FH/FC processes , the SHG exhibits ferroelectric-like temperature dependence : it appears at the freezing temperature of 50K , increases with decreasing temperature and has a tendency of saturation .
The $ \Omega $ -phase of the liquid sodium $ \alpha $ - $ \Omega $ dynamo experiment at NMIMT in cooperation with LANL has successfully demonstrated the production of a high toroidal field , $ B_ { \phi } \simeq 8\times B_r $ from the radial component of an applied poloidal magnetic field , $ B_r $ .	This enhanced toroidal field is produced by rotational shear in stable Couette flow within liquid sodium at $ Rm \simeq 120 $ .
However , these generalizations also give radiative masses that can dominate the seesaw masses in regions of parameter space -- - i.e.they are not purely seesaw models , nor are they purely radiative models , but instead they are something in between .	A recent work detailed the remaining minimal models of this type .
We produce a wide class of unoriented quiver gauge theories , including new instances of N=1 superconformal theories .	We then consider unoriented D-brane instanton corrections of both `gauge ' and `exotic ' kinds .
The amplitudes for this process receive tree level contributions and one-loop contributions , which are of comparable magnitude .	The tree level amplitudes are dominated by helicity non-flip terms and the one-loop amplitudes are dominated by helicity flip terms .
Rewritten in this form , all tree-level MHV and next-to-MHV amplitudes exhibit manifest dual superconformal symmetry .	We propose a new , compact and Lorentz covariant formula for the tree-level NMHV amplitudes for arbitrary numbers and types of external particles .
Application of tetragonal distortion lowers the energy with respect to the cubic phase for all the materials .	The equilibrium volumes of both the phases are nearly same .
In this paper , this representation is made explicit , obtaining the raising operators associated with the Lie algebra of $ SU ( 5 ) $ , one of the earliest grand unified theories .	Because the braids form a group , the action of these operators are braids themselves , leading to their identification as gauge bosons .
Two systems with one transiting `` hot Jupiter '' each , TrES-2 and XO-5 , exhibit small excesses both at 12 and 22 microns at a & gt ; 3 sigma level .	Provided that one or both of these detections are real , the frequency of warm excesses in systems with transiting planets of 2-4 % is comparable to that around solar-type stars probed at similar wavelengths with Spitzer 's MIPS and IRS instruments .
We consider the uplink of non-cooperative multi-cellular systems deploying multiple antenna elements at the base stations ( BS ) , covering both the cases of conventional and very large number of antennas .	Given the inevitable pilot contamination and an arbitrary path-loss for each link , we address the impact of time variation of the channel due to the relative movement between users and BS antennas , which limits system 's performance even if the number antennas is increased , as shown .
Because all particles occupy a single spatial mode , this quantum many body system has a well defined classical limit consisting of three degrees of freedom , corresponding to the three macroscopically occupied spin states .	We study both the classical limit and its quantization , finding an integrable system in both cases .
The conservative version , instead , behaves like a random graph .	Besides indicating the robustness of the model to describe earthquake dynamics , those findings reinforce that conservative and non conservative versions of the OFC model are qualitatively different .
We study the problem of finding large cuts in $ d $ -regular triangle-free graphs .	In prior work , Shearer ( 1992 ) gives a randomised algorithm that finds a cut of expected size $ ( 1/2 + 0.177/\sqrt { d } ) m $ , where $ m $ is the number of edges .
Subdiffusive fractional equations are not structurally stable with respect to spatial perturbations to the anomalous exponent ( Phys.Rev .	E 85 , 031132 ( 2012 ) ) .
24 ( 1996 ) 992-1024 ] does not hold when the stochastic regression model includes an unknown intercept or when the characteristic polynomial of the unstable autoregressive model has a unit root .	To this end , two new statistics are proposed to test for the distribution of the long-memory noises of stochastic regression models and unstable autoregressive models .
The Quantum Monte Carlo method for spin 1/2 fermions at finite temperature is formulated for dilute systems with an s-wave interaction .	The motivation and the formalism are discussed along with descriptions of the algorithm and various numerical issues .
The scale in which present measuments are made is called present scale which gives present knowledge .	Quantities at the limits to present measurement may be observables in other scales .
Experiments , both over synthetic and real datasets , reveal that AdaBoostDB is able to save over 99 % training time with regard to Cost-Sensitive AdaBoost , providing the same cost-sensitive results .	This computational advantage of AdaBoostDB can make a difference in problems managing huge pools of weak classifiers in which boosting techniques are commonly used .
Non-modal amplification of disturbances in streamwise-constant channel flows of Oldroyd-B fluids is studied from an input-output point of view by analyzing the responses of the velocity components to spatio-temporal body forces .	These inputs into the governing equations are assumed to be harmonic in the spanwise direction and stochastic in the wall-normal direction and in time .
Finally , all-to-all transmission probability calculations are performed in order to get an order-of-magnitude estimate of the current-voltage characteristics of this junction model .	The computed currents are within the range of the few available experimental observations on scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) currents in water , indicating that our calculation may have taken into account all the important physical attributes of such systems .
This places the source in the category of X-ray bursters showing high-energy emission .	The tail can be modeled as a soft power law component , with the photon index of ~2.4 , on top of thermal Comptonization emission from a plasma with the electron temperature of kT_e~6 keV and optical depth of \tau~4 .
However , we present evidence that suggests dwarf galaxies may be subject to strong dynamical processes in high density environments , the combined effects of multiple encounters and the tidal effects due to the potential well of rich clusters could result in the effective disruption of dwarf galaxies in the clusters ' central regions .	Alternatively , the lack of dwarf galaxies in rich environments has been interpreted in terms of a `` density-morphology relation '' : dwarf galaxies prefer low density environments ( Phillipps et al.1998 ) .
Although the guide is red-detuned , the optical scattering rate at this detuning ( $ \approx $ 70 GHz ) is acceptably low .	For lower detuning ( $ & lt ; $ 30 GHz ) a larger fraction was guided but radiation pressure starts to push the atoms upward , effectively lowering the acceleration due to gravity .
We study thermal rectifying effect in two dimensional ( 2D ) systems consisting of the Frenkel Kontorva ( FK ) lattice and the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam ( FPU ) lattice .	It is found that the rectifying effect is related to the asymmetrical interface thermal resistance .
But if we introduce the quantum effects of gravity into the stress-energy tensor , these peculiar objects can be constructed self-consistently .	Fortunately , loop quantum cosmology ( LQC ) has the potential to serve as a bridge connecting the classical theory and quantum gravity .
This model is an example of a spatial game in which players located on the~ $ d $ -dimensional integer lattice are characterized by one of two possible strategies and update their strategy at rate one by mimicking one of their neighbors chosen at random with a probability proportional to the neighbor 's payoff .	To understand the role of space in the form of local interactions , the process is compared with its non-spatial deterministic counterpart for well-mixing populations , which is described by the replicator equation .
For dimensions less than $ d_c=2 $ we find a strong -- coupling fixed point , which diverges at $ d=2 $ , indicating that there is non -- perturbative strong -- coupling behavior for all $ d \geq 2 $ .	At $ d=1 $ our method yields the identical fixed point as in the one -- loop approximation , and the two -- loop contributions to the scaling functions are non -- singular .
We consider three examples of anisotropic geometry : slabs , squared beams and `` cigars '' to demonstrate that the `` quasi-condensate '' which exists in domain $ \rho_c & lt ; \rho & lt ; \rho_m $ is in fact the van den Berg-Lewis-Pul\'e generalised condensation ( vdBLP-GC ) of the type III with no macroscopic occupation of any mode .	We show that for the slab geometry the second critical density $ \rho_m $ is a threshold between quasi- two-dimensional ( quasi-2D ) condensate and the three dimensional ( 3D ) regime when there is a coexistence of the `` quasi-condensate '' with the standard one-mode BEC .
In the present work the properties of this effective noise are studied numerically .	Some assumptions made in earlier work were verified , the dependence of various quantities on the localization length of the linear problem were computed .
We consider non-Abelian 1/2 BPS flux tubes ( strings ) in a deformed N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory , with mass terms mu_ { 1,2 } of the adjoint fields breaking N=2 down to N=1 .	The main feature of the non-Abelian strings is the occurrence of orientational moduli associated with the possibility of rotations of their color fluxes inside a global SU ( N ) group .
The MACHO collaboration has now discovered in excess of 40 microlensing events toward the Galactic Bulge during the 1993 observing season .	A preliminary analysis of this data suggests a much higher microlensing optical depth than predicted by standard galactic models suggesting that these models will have to be revised .
Piatetsky-Shapiro and I.R .	Shafarevich ( 1971 ) , the automorphism group Aut ( X ) of a K3 surface X over C and its action on the Picard lattice S_X are prescribed by the Picard lattice S_X .

Isotope effects in a multiband superconductor with a leading interband pairing channel are investigated .	A relatively small electron-phonon contribution into the pair-transfer interaction can cause effects of observed magnitude .
Finally , we provide a quantitative insight into the balance between information gain and state disturbance .	We define the quality of an information transfer .
The constraints from the cosmic background explorer can be met with natural values of the relevant parameters .	Also , there is no disastrous production of magnetic monopoles after inflation since the Pati-Salam gauge group is already broken on the `` shifted '' path .
Unlike more conventional perturbations to the inflationary initial state , these signatures can survive even relatively long periods of inflation .	In addition , we find that for a given collision the observers in the bubble with smaller cosmological constant are safest from collisions with domain walls , possibly providing another anthropic selection principle for small positive vacuum energy .
In the early stages of the outburst , the optically thick disc dominates the optical and the line components show clear orbital radial velocity excursions .	In the course of several weeks , optically thin regions become more prominent as strong emission lines replace the broad disc absorption .
Discrete properties of the lattice allow the prediction of scales at which microscopic to cosmic structures should occur .	Deformations of primary cells by exchange of empty set cells allow a cell to be mapped into an image cell in the next section as far as mapped cells remain homeomorphic .

It is believed that albatrosses power their flight through dynamic soaring , a technique where energy is extracted from horizontally blowing shear winds .	The Rayleigh model of dynamic soaring , also called the two layer model , makes a 2-dimensional approximation of the wind field and glider trajectory .
To understand the role of the excluded volume of the microions , we first consider an uncharged system .	For a fixed bulk concentration we find that upon increasing the fluid particle size one strongly increases the local concentration nearby the colloidal surface and that the particles become laterally ordered .
As a result , Zeeman observations tend to sample the outer layers of the core and consistently underestimate the core magnetic field .	The degree of ionization follows a complicated dependence on the number density at central densities up to 10^5 cm^ { -3 } for magnetic models and 10^6 cm^ { -3 } in non-magnetic models .
We investigate both experimentally and theoretically , the magneto-gyrotropic photogalvanic effect in zinc-blende based quantum wells with $ C_ { 2v } $ point-group symmetry using optical excitation in the terahertz frequency range .	The investigated frequencies cause intra-subband but no inter-band and inter-subband transitions .
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) has obtained repeated imaging in five UV-to-IR photometric bands for 33,881 spectroscopically confirmed quasars .	About 10,000 quasars have an average of 60 observations in each band obtained over a decade along Stripe 82 ( S82 ) , whereas the remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps .
Comparisons with previous microscopic numerical calculations are made .	Further experimental implications are given .
Dynamics of the dayside magnetosphere and proton radiation belt was analyzed during unusual magnetic storm on 21 January 2005 .	We have found that during the storm from 1712 to 2400 UT , the subsolar magnetopause was continuously located inside geosynchronous orbit due to strong compression .
For many examples of Fano manifolds this method can be used to compute the minimal length of chains needed to join two general points .	One consequence of our computation is a bound on the multiplicities of divisors at a general point of the moduli of stable bundles of rank two on a curve .
Homotopy algorithm reduces the regularization parameter in a series of steps , and uses proximal-gradient algorithm to solve the problem at each step .	Proximal-gradient algorithm has a linear rate of convergence given that the objective function is strongly convex and the gradient of the smooth component of the objective function is Lipschitz continuous .
Network data appear in a number of applications , such as online social networks and biological networks , and there is growing interest in both developing models for networks as well as studying the properties of such data .	Since individual network datasets continue to grow in size , it is necessary to develop models that accurately represent the real-life scaling properties of networks .
Using a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) Data Release 4 , we study the trends relating surface brightness profile type and apparent axis ratio to the local galaxy environment .	We use the SDSS parameter `fracDeV ' to quantify the profile type .

We propose a novel mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking in supersymmetric models , as the one recently discussed by Birkedal , Chacko and Gaillard , in which the Standard Model Higgs doublet is a pseudo-Goldstone boson of some global symmetry .	The Higgs mass parameter is generated at one loop level by two different , moderately fine-tuned sources of the global symmetry breaking .

We discuss various channels in the context of the standard model .	Many of these do not support a condensate , but some mixed-flavor channels do .
We consider two settings : output noise models where the noise enters after the projection and input noise models where the noise enters before the projection .	We consider two types of distortion for reconstruction : support errors and mean-squared errors .
We find that $ M $ and/or S defects create mid-gap states that localize charge carriers around the defects and which modify the optical and transport properties of the material , in agreement with recent experiments .	Furthermore , our results indicate a much higher mobility for $ p $ -doped WS $ _2 $ in comparison to MoS $ _2 $ .

The consecutive processing steps can be easily automated and the individual time points can be processed independently , which lends itself to trivial parallelization on a high performance cluster ( HPC ) .	Here we introduce an automated workflow for processing large multiview , multi-channel , multi-illumination time-lapse LSFM data on a single workstation or in parallel on a HPC .
Huge datasets in cyber security , such as network traffic logs , can be analyzed using machine learning and data mining methods .	However , the amount of collected data is increasing , which makes analysis more difficult .
Let $ Gr_G $ be the affine Grassmannian of $ { \mathfrak g } $ , and let $ D_\kappa ( Gr_G ) -mod $ be the category of $ \kappa $ -twisted right D-modules on $ Gr_G $ .	By taking global sections of a D-module , we obtain a functor $ \Gamma : D_\kappa ( Gr_G ) -mod\to { \mathfrak g } _\kappa-mod $ .
A continuous time model for multiagent systems governed by reinforcement learning with scale-free memory is developed .	The agents are assumed to act independently of one another in optimizing their choice of possible actions via trial-and-error search .
Moreover , we show that the h-vector of the simplicial complex \Delta_ { \chi } is precisely the f-vector , denoted f ( \Delta ) , of the original complex \Delta .	We deduce this result by relating f ( \Delta ) with the graded Betti numbers of the Alexander dual of \Delta_ { \chi } .
At each time , the server can observe instantaneous service rates for only a subset of flows ( from within a fixed collection of observable subsets ) before scheduling a flow in the subset for service .	We are interested in queue-length aware scheduling to keep the queues short , and develop scheduling algorithms that use only partial service rate information from subsets of channels to minimize the likelihood of queue overflow in the system .
There exist 6 kinds of orientational domains , which are related with a permutation or a mirror symmetry .	Interdomain walls are found to be rather narrow .
With the wealth of high-throughput sequencing data generated by recent large-scale consortia , predictive gene expression modelling has become an important tool for integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenetic data .	However , sequencing data-sets are characteristically large , and previously modelling frameworks are typically inefficient and unable to leverage multi-core or distributed processing architectures .
The galaxy is known to have properties of a cD galaxy progenitor and be surrounded by a 3 Mpc-sized structure , identified with a protocluster .	The morphology shown on the new deep HST/ACS image is reminiscent of a spider 's web .
We show that the class of languages recognized by quantum multi-prover interactive proof systems , QMIP , is equal to MIP* , the class of languages recognized by classical multi-prover interactive proof systems where the provers share entanglement .	After the recent result by Jain , Ji , Upadhyay and Watrous showing that QIP=IP , our work completes the picture from the verifier 's perspective by showing that also in the setting of multiple provers with shared entanglement , a quantum verifier is no more powerful than a classical one : QMIP=MIP* .
Also , the existence of a family of global attractors is shown to exist .	After proving a general result concerning the upper-semicontinuity of a one-parameter family of sets , the result is applied to the family of global attractors .
Our results describe the centreless cores of a class of affine reflection Lie algebras , hence apply in particular to the centreless cores of extended affine Lie algebras , the so-called Lie tori , for which we recover results of Allison-Gao and Faulkner .	Our classification ( b ) extends a recent result of Benkart-Yoshii .

We coupled these abundances with previously derived abundance of O , Na , Mg to fully characterize the interplay of the NeNa and MgAl cycles of H-burning at high temperature in the early stellar generation in NGC 1851 .
We have observed the Blue Compact Dwarf ( BCD ) galaxy He 2-10 in the 10 microns mid-infrared ( MIR ) atmospheric window using broad-band filters centered at lambda=10.1 microns and lambda=11.65 microns .	In both filters , only the galaxy 's central regions were detected .
In the long time limit the spatial density profile becomes scale invariant .	The mean-field approximation of this scenario bears some surprises .
Their radius provides a dynamically generated minimal length acting as a universal short-distance cut-off .	We propose a quantisation scheme for this new kind of microscopic objects based on a Bohr-like approach , which does not require a detailed knowledge of quantum gravity .
This decay mode is phenomenologically important if the mass difference between the lightest squark $ \tilde u_1 $ ( which is assumed to be mainly stop-like ) and the neutralino LSP $ \tilde \chi^0_1 $ is smaller than the top mass .	In such a scenario $ \tilde u_1\to t \tilde\chi^0_1 $ is kinematically not allowed and searches for $ \tilde u_1\to W b \tilde\chi^0_1 $ and $ \tilde u_1\to c \tilde\chi^0_1 $ are performed .
Such flows are often experimentally unstable even in the absence of a linear instability .	The transition to turbulence in these systems , as well as the large linear transient amplification of initial disturbances , may depend upon the non-self-adjoint nature of the differential operator that describes the dynamics of perturbations to the background state .
In the present work we carry out related calculations in Minkowski space , so that we can study the effects of the significant vector and axial-vector interactions that appear in extended NJL models and which play an important role in the study of the $ \rho $ , $ \omega $ and $ a_1 $ mesons .	We study the modification of the quark self-energy in the presence of matter and find that our model reproduces the behavior of the quark condensate predicted by the model-independent relation $ & lt ; \bar qq & gt ; _ { \rho } = & lt ; \bar qq & gt ; _0 ( 1-\sigma_N\rho_N/f_ { \pi } ^2m_ { \pi } ^2 + ... ) $ , where $ \sigma_N $ is the pion-nucleon sigma term and $ \rho_N $ is the density of nuclear matter .
Ionization of polar liquids and glasses often yields metastable electron centers collectively known as weakly bound ( wb ) electrons that absorb to the red of the ground state of the solvated/trapped electron .	Formation of these species is thought to be the initial stage of electron localization in such media .
This leads to the so-called shear-free metrics , which have the interesting property of violating the cosmological principle while still preserving the isotropy of the cosmic mi- crowave background ( CMB ) radiation .	In this work we show that shear-free cosmologies correspond to an attractor solution in the space of models with anisotropic spatial curva- ture .
But the question is still open , the debate is still alive , as was shown by the participants in the present Workshop .	There is no smoke without fire , and the existence of many facts and theories on alternative origins of redshifts may point to some new pathways in physics that deserve further attention .
This transition is of the same type and has the same finite-size scaling properties as the corresponding transition for the Cayley tree .	At the upper threshold , on the other hand , a single unbounded cluster forms which overwhelms all the others and occupies a finite fraction of the volume as well as of the boundary connections .

We study both sudden and slow quenches in a variety of systems including one-dimensional ultracold atoms in an optical lattice , an infinite range ferromagnetic Ising model , and some exactly solvable spin models in one and two dimensions ( such as the Kitaev model ) .	We show that quenching leads to the formation of defects whose density has a power-law dependence on the quenching rate ; the power depends on the dimensionalities of the system and of the critical surface and on some of the exponents associated with the critical point which is being crossed .
The optimal ( usually shortest ) time altering the magn etisation along with the smallest applied magnetic field are sought in technological applications s uch as high-density reading or writing of information , spintronics , quantum inform ation and quantum communication systems .	This work reviews the magnetization change with a time dependent field and tem perature and discusses the time it takes to alter the magnetization as a function of the control parameter chosen , temperature and material parameters .
Applying a time dependent variational principle , the time evolution of the parameters of the coupled Gaussian wave packets can be calculated from a set of ordinary differential equations .	Unfortunately , the set of equations is ill-behaved in most practical applications , depending on the number of propagated Gaussian wave packets , and methods for regularization are needed .
However , to date all analyses of fluctuation corrections neglect the finite ranged nature of the Coulomb interaction .	We develop the formalism to consider the effects of fluctuations with a realistic screened Coulomb potential .
We consider histories characterized by position samplings at $ n $ moments of time .	We use this to construct a probability distribution on the value of ( discrete approximations to ) the field equations , $ F = m \ddot x + V ' ( x ) $ , at $ n-2 $ times .
These challenges make the existing narrow-band radio surveys of the Galactic plane difficult to interpret : e.g.a small region of emission might be a supernova remnant ( SNR ) or an HII region , or a complex combination of both .	Instantaneous wide bandwidth radio observations in combination with the capability for high resolution spectral index mapping , can be directly used to disentangle these effects .
We study bulk and edge correlations in the compressible half-filled state , using a modified version of the plasma analogy .	The corresponding plasma has anomalously weak screening properties , and as a consequence we find that the correlations along the edge do not decay algebraically as in the Laughlin ( incompressible ) case , while the bulk correlations decay in the same way .
We consider practical phonon-polaritonic metamaterials for thermal engineering in the mid-infrared range and show that the effect exists in spite of the losses , absorption and finite unit cell size .	For thermophotovoltaic energy conversion applications requiring energy transfer in the near-infrared range we introduce high temperature hyperbolic metamaterials based on plasmonic materials with a high melting point .
In particular , the proof of this theorem does not use any deep results in Teichmueller theory , Kleinian group theory , or the coarse geometry of A ( F , p ) .	A similar result holds for quasi-Fuchsian manifolds N = ( F x R ) .

In this study we compile for the first time comprehensive data sets of solar and stellar flare parameters , including flare peak temperatures T_p , flare peak volume emission measures EM_p , and flare durations t_f from both solar and stellar data , as well as flare length scales L from solar data .	Key results are that both the solar and stellar data are consistent with a common scaling law of EM_p ~ T_p^4.7 , but the stellar flares exhibit ~250 times higher emission measures ( at the same flare peak temperature ) .
For the hydrodynamic fields of such a liquid , linearized equations with random thermal sources are used .	For the time dependent amplitudes of the expansion of the fields in the basis functions of the vector Helmholtz equations a set of Langevin equations is obtained that allowed us , with the help of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem , to find the spectral densities of the correlation functions of the amplitudes .
The statistics of peak counts in reconstructed shear maps contain information beyond the power spectrum , and can improve cosmological constraints from measurements of the power spectrum alone if systematic errors can be controlled .	We study the effect of galaxy shape measurement errors on predicted cosmological constraints from the statistics of shear peak counts with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ( LSST ) .
Under a random walk model the probability that all pandemics between times 0 and 300 occur by time 150 is 1/2 .	Under a Poisson model with mean inter arrival time of 30 years the probability that no pandemic occurs during at least 60 years is 14 % .
In the scenario investigated here , each user is willing to coordinate its actions only when an incentive exists and benefits of cooperation are fairly allocated .	The users are first allowed to negotiate for the use of a simple Han-Kobayashi type scheme with fixed power split .
First-principles methods have only recently been developed to calculate the full ME response tensor $ \alpha $ including both electronic and ionic ( i.e. , lattice-mediated ) contributions .	The latter is proportional to both the Born dynamical electric charge $ Z^ { \rm e } $ and its analogue , the dynamical magnetic charge $ Z^ { \rm m } $ .
We pay attention that besides $ \sqrt { -g } $ , the 4-D space-time differentiable manifold possesses also a `` manifold volume measure '' ( MVM ) described by a 4-form which is sign indefinite and generically independent of the metric .	The FOF proceeds with originally independent connection and metric structures of the space-time manifold .
Based on a representation of the best pair of linear unbiased estimators in continuous time models as a stochastic integral , an efficient pair of linear unbiased estimators with corresponding optimal designs for finite sample size is constructed .	This pair minimises the width of the confidence band for the difference between the estimated curves .
TMine provides a visual development environment for the LAT event analysis and utilizes advanced multivariate classification algorithms implemented in ROOT .	We discuss the application of TMine to the next iteration of the event analysis ( Pass 8 ) , the LAT charged particle analyses , and the classification of unassociated LAT gamma-ray sources .
We examine the neutralino parameter space to identify the dark matter property depending on the Peccei-Quinn scale .	As the Peccei-Quinn scale becomes higher resulting in longer axino lifetime , the neutralino dark matter appears in a lighter Higgsino-like LSP region or a more restricted Bino-like LSP region allowing a resonant annihilation through a CP-odd Higgs boson to meet stronger reannihilation .
The normal crossings condition considered by Goward is weakened to the condition that components of the generating divisors meet as complete intersections .	This leads to a substantial generalization of the notion of monomial scheme ; we call the resulting schemes `c.i.monomial ' .
Some matrix models admit , on top of the usual 't Hooft expansion , an M-theory-like expansion , i.e.an expansion at large N but where the rest of the parameters are fixed , instead of scaling with N. These models , which we call M-theoretic matrix models , appear in the localization of Chern-Simons-matter theories , and also in two-dimensional statistical physics .	Generically , their partition function receives non-perturbative corrections which are not captured by the 't Hooft expansion .
Combining this calculation with simulations at several gauge couplings , we estimate the strange quark mass in the continuum limit .	The perturbative one-loop mass renormalization is comparable to that for Wilson quarks and considerably smaller than that for Kogut-Susskind quarks .
The slips can be characterised by their location in phase space and their duration .	We show that when properly normalised , their location converges , in the vanishing noise limit , to the sum of an asymptotically geometric random variable and a Gumbel random variable .
In the presence of a boundary , with the so-called method of images it is possible to study the surface critical behaviour of these systems , and the conformal boundary conditions can be related to the bulk operator content of the theory .	After an overview of the basic concepts of bulk and boundary conformal field theory , we present an explicit calculation of some two-point correlation functions in Virasoro minimal models with boundary .
No such extremely fast athermal concerted process has been reported before at ultra low temperatures .	The outlined novel transient atomic exchange mechanism could be of general validity .

We carried out experiments using the Switchboard corpus , with both mel frequency cepstral coefficient features and bottleneck feature derived from a deep neural network .	Reductions in word error rate were obtained by using tied PLDA , compared with the PLDA mixture model , subspace Gaussian mixture models , and deep neural networks .
We analyze the radial and vertical metallicity and [ alpha/Fe ] gradients of the disk stars of a disk galaxy simulated in a fully cosmological setting with the chemodynamical galaxy evolution code , GCD+ .	We study how the radial abundance gradients vary as a function of height above the plane and find that the metallicity ( [ alpha/Fe ] ) gradient becomes more positive ( negative ) with increasing height , changing sign around 1.5 kpc above the plane .
The recent measurement on the muon anomalous magnetic moment $ a_\mu $ shows a $ 2.6\sigma $ deviation from the standard model value .	We show that it puts an interesting bound on the mass of the second generation leptoquarks .
The `` drifting '' subpulses exhibited by some radio pulsars have fascinated both observers and theorists for 30 years , and have been widely regarded as one of the most critical and potentially insightful aspects of their emission .	Here , we report on detailed studies of pulsar B0943+10 , whose nearly coherent sequences of `` drifting '' subpulses have permitted us to identify their origin as a system of subbeams that appear to circulate around the star 's magnetic axis .
We consider a one-dimensional lattice model with the nearest-neighbor interaction $ V_1 $ and the next-nearest neighbor interaction $ V_2 $ with filling factor 1/2 at zero temperature .	The particles are assumed to be spinless fermions or hard-core bosons .
Temperature features can provide evidence of merging events which shock heat the intracluster gas .	Temperature maps were made from both \textit { Chandra } and \textit { XMM-Newton } obervations .
We show that revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the overall number of susceptible individuals , but also because it better protects highly-connected individuals , who would otherwise make a disproportionately large contribution to influenza transmission .	Our work thus contributes a population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza vaccination and advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual vaccine histories .
We find a class of exact solutions of noncommutative gauge theories corresponding to unstable non-BPS solitons .	In the two-dimensional euclidean ( or 2+1 dimensional lorentzian ) U ( 1 ) theory we find localized solutions carrying nonzero magnetic flux .
We find that in the Milky Way , early-type WN stars evolve from stars with masses as low as 20Mo .

Context .	Due to its great mass and its rapid formation , Jupiter has played a crucial role in shaping the Solar System .
It is known that a point sequence in R^d that is order-type homogeneous forms the vertex set of a convex polytope that is combinatorially equivalent to a cyclic polytope in R^d .	Two famous theorems of Erdos and Szekeres from 1935 imply that OT_1 ( n ) = Theta ( n^2 ) and OT_2 ( n ) = 2^ ( Theta ( n ) ) .

We give results for the behaviour of the AIC for the logistic map .	Since the AIC is not a computable function we use , as approximation of the AIC , a notion of information content given by the length of the string after it has been compressed by a compression algorithm , and in particular we introduce a new compression algorithm called CASToRe .

The SIDM nuclear recoil spectrum is more peaked towards low energies compared to the usual case of contact interactions , because the mediator mass is comparable to the momentum transfer of nuclear recoils .	We show that the SIDM signal could be distinguished from that of DM particles with contact interactions by considering the time-average energy spectrum in experiments employing different target materials , or the average and modulated spectra in a single experiment .

Given a connected graph $ G= ( V , E ) $ , a set $ S\subseteq V $ is said to be a $ k $ -metric generator for $ G $ if the elements of any pair of different vertices of $ G $ are distinguished by at least $ k $ elements of $ S $ , i.e. , for any two different vertices $ u , v\in V $ , there exist at least $ k $ vertices $ w_1 , w_2 , ... , w_k\in S $ such that $ d_G ( u , w_i ) \ne d_G ( v , w_i ) $ for every $ i\in \ { 1 , ... , k\ } $ .	A metric generator of minimum cardinality is called a $ k $ -metric basis and its cardinality the $ k $ -metric dimension of $ G $ .
In the parameter region where the model has a mean-field behavior - corresponding to $ d \geq 4 $ for a $ d $ -dimensional Ising model - we find a stable FP that corresponds to a spin-glass transition in a field .	In the non-mean-field parameter region the FP above is unstable , and we determined exactly all other FPs : to our knowledge , this is the first time that all perturbative FPs for the full set of RG equations of a spin glass in a field have been characterized in the non-mean-field region .
Typically 20 or more pulses have been followed for each model , allowing us to calculate the third dredge-up parameter for each case .	Using the results from this large and homogeneous set of models , we present an approximate fit for the core mass at the first thermal pulse , as well as for the third dredge-up efficiency parameter , and the core mass at the first third dredge-up episode as a function of metallicity and total mass .
We formalize NLPs in the context of mixtures and show how they lead to extra parsimony and well-separated components that have non-negligible weight , hence interpretable as distinct subpopulations .	We derive tractable expressions and suggest default prior settings aimed at detecting multi-modal densities .
Compared with current assessment methods which are limited to isometric embeddings , the NIEQA method has a much larger application range due to two features .	First , it is based on a new measure which can effectively evaluate how well local neighborhood geometry is preserved under normalization , hence it can be applied to both isometric and normalized embeddings .
Here we report on the first detection of the Fe XVII absorption line at 15.02 A from the hot ISM in the spectrum of the low mass X-ray binary 4U~1820-303 observed with Chandra X-Ray Observatory .	By jointly analyzing this absorption line with those from OVII , OVIII , and NeIX ions in the same spectrum , we obtain an abundance ratio as Fe/Ne=0.8 ( 0.4 , 2.1 ) in units of the Anders & amp ; Grevesse solar value ( 90 % confidence intervals ) .
It is shown analytically that environmental spins initially in their ground state do not influence the staying probability P. This changes if they are prepared in a statistical ensemble .

Networks describe various complex natural systems including social systems .	We investigate the social network of co-occurrence in Reuters-21578 corpus , which consists of news articles that appeared in the Reuters newswire in 1987 .
In structure-based models of proteins , one often assumes that folding is accomplished when all contacts are established .	This assumption may frequently lead to a conceptual problem that folding takes place in a temperature region of very low thermodynamic stability , especially when the contact map used is too sparse .
Evidence is given that some particles with large charges in gauge theories , including 4d N=4 SU ( 3 ) and 5d theories with N=1 supersymmetry , have macroscopic entropy .	The ground state entropy is found to be extensive in the charges .

A novel mechanism to realize the triplet-doublet splitting in supersymmetric SU ( 5 ) grand unified theories is proposed in the framework of higher dimensional theories where chiral multiplets are localized due to kink configuration of a SU ( 5 ) singlet .	An adjoint Higgs field which spontaneously breaks the SU ( 5 ) gauge symmetry is assumed to be involved with the localization process , splitting the wave functions of the color-triplet Higgs from its doublet counterpart .
75As nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) experiments were performed on Ba ( Fe1-xMnx ) 2As2 ( xMn = 2.5 % , 5 % and 12 % ) single crystals .	The Fe layer magnetic susceptibility far from Mn atoms is probed by the75As NMR line shift and is found similar to that of BaFe2As2 , implying that Mn does not induce charge doping .

Existing strong coupling theories rely heavily on the so-called many-body T-matrix approximation that sums ladder-type Feynman diagrams .	Here , by acknowledging the fact that the effective interparticle interaction ( i.e. , the vertex function ) becomes smaller above three dimensions , we propose an alternative way to reorganize Feynman diagrams and develop a theoretical framework for interacting Fermi gases beyond the ladder approximation .
These violations are analogous to the oblique corrections in the electroweak sector of the standard model , and can be parametrized in terms of super-oblique parameters .	The $ e^- e^- $ collision mode of a future linear collider is shown to be an excellent environment for such high precision measurements of these SUSY parameters , which will provide an important probe of superparticles beyond reachable energies .
A representation using the principle of know-how maps in two or three dimensions is privileged .	The most interesting aspect is that these maps include tacit and explicit knowledge .
Identification of neurons within such Nissl-stained sections is inherently difficult due to the variability in neuron staining , the overlap of neurons , the presence of partial or damaged neurons at tissue surfaces , and the presence of non-neuron objects , such as glial cells , blood vessels , and random artifacts .	To overcome these challenges and identify neurons , ANRA applies a combination of image segmentation and machine learning .

We find that the contribution from H $ _2 $ into cooling rate around $ T\sim ( 4-5 ) \times 10^3 $ K stimulates thermal instability in the metallicity range $ Z\simlt 10^ { -2 } Z_\odot $ .	Isobaric cooling rates are generally lower than isochoric ones , because the associated increase of gas density leads to both more efficient hydrogen recombination and equilibration of the fine-structure level populations .
However , current countermeasures seem to be no longer effective .	Thus , it is our belief that it is now time for researchers and security experts to turn to nature in the search for novel inspirations for defense systems .
The rings relax stress much faster than linear polymers and the zero-shear viscosity was found to vary as approximately N to the 1.4 power which is much weaker than the N to the 3.4 power of linear chains , not matching any commonly known model for polymer dynamics when compared to the observed mean-square displacements .	These findings are discussed in view of the conformational properties of the rings presented in the preceding paper ( DOI : 10.1063/1.3587137 ) .

Developments in algorithms over the past decade suggest that there is a new computational approach to a class of quantum field theories .	This approach is based on rewriting the partition function in a representation similar to the world-line representation and hence we shall call it the `` WL-approach '' .
The high value for K_2 is , in part , due to the high binary inclination of the system but may also indicate a high neutron star mass .	The mass function ( f_2 ) of 0.684 +/- 0.047 solar masses , along with our constraints on the companion 's spectral type ( K5V-K9V ) and previous constraints on the inclination , gives a likely range of neutron star masses from 1.2 to 1.8 solar masses .

We find an exotic spin excitation in a magnetically ordered system with spin orbit magnetism in 2D , where the order parameter has a net spin current and no net magnetization .	Starting from a Fermi liquid theory , similar to that for a weak ferromagnet , we show that this excitation emerges from an exotic magnetic Fermi liquid state that is protected by a generalized Pomeranchuck condition .
We present photometric and spectroscopic optical and near-infrared ( NIR ) observations ( Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory , Chile ( ESO ID 63.H-0493 and 64.H-0382 ) ) taken during the outburst of the microquasar V4641 Sgr = SAX J1819.3-2525 ( in'tzand et al. , 2000 ) in September 1999 .

We see a clear increase in the bar fraction with redder ( g-r ) colours , decreased luminosity and in galaxies with more prominent bulges , to the extent that over half of the red , bulge-dominated , disk galaxies in our sample possess a bar .
Second , it can account for the limited buffer memory of transmitters which store arriving packets as a queue and transmit them with a success rate that is determined by the transmit power and channel conditions .	Remarkably , this metric is shown to have attractive properties such as quasi-concavity with respect to the transmit power and a unique maximum , allowing to derive an optimal power control scheme .
Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics , such as packet rate , others can be severely distorted .	However , it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns .

The entanglement entropy of a free quantum field in a coherent state is independent of its stress energy content .	We use this result to highlight the fact that while the Einstein equations for first order variations about a locally maximally symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields seem to follow from Jacobson 's principle of maximal vacuum entanglement entropy , their possible derivation from this principle for the physically relevant case of finite but small variations remains an open issue .

Taking an approach different from existing literature , our method first involves a specific biased sampling , with an element being chosen based on the leverage scores of its row and column , and then involves weighted alternating minimization over the factored form of the intended low-rank matrix , to minimize error only on these samples .	Our method can leverage input sparsity , yet produce approximations in { \em spectral } ( as opposed to the weaker Frobenius ) norm ; this combines the best aspects of otherwise disparate current results , but with a dependence on the condition number $ \kappa = \sigma_1/\sigma_r $ .

We show that the velocity dispersion of the cool component ( ~4 km/s ) when used with a Toomre-Q criterion gives an optimal description of ongoing star formation in NGC 6822 , superior to that using the more conventional dispersion value of 6 km/s .	However , a simple constant surface density criterion for star formation gives an equally superior description .
We show that when the infimum is reached , a relaxation hierarchy constructed from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker ideal is always exact and that the vanishing ideal of the KKT minimizer points is generated by the kernel of the associated moment matrix in that degree , even if this ideal is not zero-dimensional .	We also show that this relaxation allows to detect when there is no KKT minimizer .

The new constraint leads to a Schr\ '' odinger equation for the system.i.e.to non-vanishing eigenvalues for the super-Hamiltonian operator ; the physical interpretation of this feature relies on the appearance of a `` dust fluid '' ( non-positive definite ) energy density , i.e.a kind of `` materialization '' of the reference frame .

We are interested in two different micromagnet shapes : cylindrical ( micro-disk ) and rectangular geometry .	We show that in the case of a micro-disk , the spin object is localized in all three directions and therefore zero-dimensional states are created , and in the case of an elongated rectangular micromagnet , the quasi-particles can move freely in one direction , hence one-dimensional states are formed .
We find that by including a term Omega_L & gt ; 0 , the same best-fit anisotropy pattern is reproduced by several combinations of cosmological parameters .	This sub-set of models can then be further constrained by current observations that limit the values of various cosmological parameters .

Whereas one nonrelativistic model favors $ \eta_b ( 1S ) $ production from $ \Upsilon ( 2S ) $ , this advantage is lost when relativistic corrections are taken into account , and is not common to all sets of wave functions even in the purely nonrelativistic limit .	Thus , the prospects for discovering $ \eta_b ( 1S ) $ in $ \Upsilon ( 3S ) $ radiative decays could be comparable to those in $ \Upsilon ( 2S ) $ decays .

It is revealed that Mach number dependence of the effective electron temperature in the MTSI dominant case is essentially different from that in the BI dominant case .	The effective electron temperature through the MTSI does not depend much on the Mach number , although that through the BI increases with the Mach number as in the past studies .
During episodes of especially low luminosity ( ASM count rates & lt ; 0.6 counts/sec ) , kT strongly decreases and the power law significantly hardens to a photon index of ~1.8 .	These changes are consistent with state changes of LMC X-3 from the soft state to the canonical hard state of galactic black hole candidates .
We study the bound states of a two dimensional free electron gas ( 2DEG ) subjected to a perpendicular inhomogeneous magnetic field .	An analytical transfer matrix ( ATM ) based exact quantization formula is derived for magnetic fields that vary ( arbitrarily ) along one spatial direction .
In this work , we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to-leading order scalar and tensor primordial power spectra in k-inflation needed in order to obtain robust constraints on the inflationary theory .	The method used is the uniform approximation together with a second order expansion in the Hubble and sound flow functions .
Stellar light contributes relatively more to the MIR emission of YSOs with lower temperature stars ( Tstar ~4000 K ) because the emission peak wavelength of the star is closer to that of the thermal radiation .	Next we consider realistic Class 0 , I , and II source models and find that the other dominant effect of varying stellar temperature on YSO SEDs is that of the inner disk wall : In high-Tstar models , the dust destruction radius is much further out with a consequently larger inner disk wall that contributes relatively more to the 2-10 um flux .

This phenomenon is known as the second law of thermodynamics ( $ S_ { a } \geq0 $ ) .	Here we analytically prove that , unlike the entropy itself , the entropy variation rate ( $ B=dS_ { a } /dt $ ) defies the monotonicity for multiple reservoirs ( $ n\geq2 $ ) .
In the relativistic theory based on the refined structure , energies and momenta turn out to be invariantly bounded from above , and lengths and durations similarly bounded from below , by their respective Planck scale values .	Along the external timelike world-lines , the theory naturally captures the `flow of time ' as a genuinely structural attribute of the world .
We conclude that this region is located at ~10 parsecs , the distance coinciding with the location of the hot dust region .	This location is consistent with the high amplitude variations observed on ~10 day time scale , provided the Lorentz factor of a jet is ~20 .
We obtain a new symplectic Lagrangian density and deduce Faddeev-Jackiw ( FJ ) generalized brackets of the gauge invariant self-dual fields interacting with gauge fields .	We further give FJ quantization of this system .
We start with a brief reminder of the passage from the AdS5xS5 string theory to certain flavored confining holographic models .	We then describe the string configurations in holographic backgrounds that correspond to a Wilson line , a meson , a baryon and a glueball .
On the other hand , we have considered the conjunction { \em et ( and ) } as the head of the coordinate structure , so that coordinate structures stem simply from the subcategorization specifications of { \em et } and the general schemata of a head saturation .	Both parts have been encoded within HPSG using the same resource that is the subcategorization and its principle which we have just extended .
While the laser can be pointed anywhere in the sky , one still needs to have a natural star , albeit fainter , reasonably close to correct the image motion ( tip-tilt ) to which laser guide stars are insensitive .	There are in fact many astronomical targets without suitable tip-tilt stars , but for which the enhanced resolution obtained with the Laser Guide Star Facility ( LGSF ) would still be very beneficial .
The smoothed bootstrap method is used to calculate confidence regions of the derived luminosity functions .	We find a strong environmental dependency for the LF of elliptical galaxies .
The space of m-ary differential operators acting on weighted densities is a ( m+1 ) -parameter family of modules over the Lie algebra of vector fields .	For almost all the parameters , we construct a canonical isomorphism between this space and the corresponding space of symbols as sl ( 2 ) -modules .
In all these cases the governing equations are intractable , consisting as they do of multidimensional Fokker-Planck equations or , equivalently , coupled nonlinear stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise .	We develop a methodology which exploits a separation in time scales between fast and slow variables to reduce these equations so that they resemble those for a single island , which are amenable to analysis .
To investigate this , we make use of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations .	We follow the thermodynamic evolution of the gas by solving the full thermal energy equation , and also track the evolution of the dust temperature and the chemical evolution of the gas .
The aim of this paper is to analyse the previously discovered discontinuity of the periodicity of the GeV $ \gamma $ -ray emission of the radio-loud X-ray binary LS I +61 { \deg } 303 and to determine its physical origin.Methods .	We used wavelet analysis to explore the temporal development of periodic signals .
The unique association of passive EROs with elliptical galaxies therefore appears to be too simplistic .	We speculate on the evolution of EROJ003707 : if gas continues to cool onto this galaxy in the manner predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation models , then by the present day , EROJ003707 could evolve into a very luminous spiral galaxy .
As a consequence , every object in such a model category has a naturally associated endomorphism ring inside this spectra category .	We establish the basic properties of this enrichment .
We discuss the modifications for a realistic model of N_f , up up-type flavours and N_f , down down-type flavours .	We have implemented these corrections into a numerical program and we quantify the size of these effects in a toy model .
Based on their classical analogues , one would expect them to provide a powerful quantum tool .	However , the difficulty of solving a nonlinear operator partial differential equation such as the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation ( QHJE ) has hindered progress along this otherwise promising avenue .
From these analytical formulae on can get the delta function wakefields .	The relations between the loss factors ( wakefields ) and the structure geometrical dimensions are well established .
We keep the ratio of the left- and right-handed gauge coupling free in order to take into account different patterns of left-right symmetry breaking .	By combining the dielectron and dimuon data we can exclude $ Z^ { \prime } $ masses below $ 3 $ ~TeV for $ g_R=g_L $ , and for $ g_R \sim 1 $ we rule out masses up to $ \sim 4 $ ~TeV .
The computation of radiative energy loss in a finite size QCD medium with dynamical constituents is a key ingredient for obtaining reliable predictions for jet quenching in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions .	We here present a theoretical formalism for the calculation of the first order in opacity radiative energy loss of a quark jet traveling through a finite size dynamical QCD medium .
A search for supersymmetry is presented using a sample of events with b jets and missing transverse momentum .	The search uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 inverse picobarns , collected with the CMS detector .
In this article we derive expressions for the length polynomial where $ X $ is any conjugacy class of involutions , or the set of all involutions , in any finite Coxeter group $ W $ .	In particular , these results correct errors in the paper `` Permutation statistics on involutions '' , W.M.B .
We present results on dielectron production in Ar+KCl collisions at 1.76A GeV .	For the first time $ \omega $ mesons could be reconstructed in a heavy-ion reaction at a bombarding energy which is well below the production threshold in free nucleon-nucleon collisions .
In this paper , we discuss lepton jets as a promising signature of an extended dark sector .	As a simple toy model , we consider an $ \mathcal { O } ( \text { GeV } ) $ DM fermion coupled to a new $ U ( 1 ) ' $ gauge boson ( dark photon ) with a mass of order GeV and kinetically mixed with the Standard Model photon .
We show that the non-equilibrium evolution of the system is isoenergetic and for small initial $ N_0 $ observe a clear separation between $ T $ and $ N_0 $ dynamics , thus explicitly demonstrating the theoretically expected `` two-step '' picture of condensate growth .	For increasing initial $ N_0 $ values we observe a crossover to classical relaxation dynamics .
Out of 149 Seyferts in the MIR atlas of local AGN ( Asmus et al .	) , 21 show extended MIR emission on single dish images .
At early times , a large-scale helical dynamo develops in the bottom layer .	At later times the dynamo saturates , but the vertical magnetic field continues to develop and rises to form dynamic bipolar structures at the top , which later disappear and reappear .
In this paper we show how to overcome this shortcoming .	To this end we identify an appropriate quantity , which we term $ D $ , that represents the correlation correction of the condensate order parameter , as it does the self-energy for the Green 's function .
The behavior of the electronic stopping power versus projectile velocity displays an effective threshold velocity of ~0.2 a.u .	for the proton , consistent with recent experimental observations , and also for the antiproton .
We use ultraviolet absorption-line spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope to constrain the velocity of the outflowing gas within these regions , targeting the quasar PDS 456 ( Galactic coordinates l , b=10.4 , +11.2 degrees ) .	This sightline passes through a clear biconical structure seen in hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission near the base of the northern Fermi Bubble .
From the first epoch observations of the VVDS up to z=1.5 we have derived luminosity functions ( LF ) of different spectral type galaxies .	The VVDS data , covering ~70 % of the life of the Universe , allow for the first time to study from the same sample and with good statistical accuracy the evolution of the LFs by galaxy type in several rest frame bands from a purely magnitude selected sample .
This inverse can remove heavy tails from data , and also provide analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution ( cdf ) and probability density function ( pdf ) .	As a special case , these yield explicit formulas for Tukey 's h pdf and cdf - to the author 's knowledge for the first time in the literature .
We consider the Dunne-Jackiw-Pi-Trugenberger model of a U ( N ) Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to a nonrelativistic complex adjoint matter on noncommutative space .	Soliton configurations of this model are related the solutions of the chiral model on noncommutative plane .
This topical review gives a comprehensive overview of the main contributions that led to the major accomplishments in probe-based data storage .	The most investigated technologies are reviewed : topographic , phase-change , magnetic , ferroelectric and atomic and molecular storage .
However , their efficacy on highly articulated objects such as humans is yet to be explored .	Inspired by hierarchical object representation and recent application of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ( DCNNs ) on human pose estimation , we propose a novel formulation that incorporates both hierarchical exemplar-based models and DCNNs in the spatial terms .
Aims : This paper describes an extensive survey of polarized Galactic emission at 1.4 GHz that provides data with arcminute resolution and complete coverage of all structures from the broadest angular scales to the resolution limit , giving information on the magneto-ionic medium over a wide range of interstellar environments .	Methods : Data from the DRAO Synthesis Telescope , the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope , and the DRAO 26-m Telescope have been combined .
In this work we clarify the relationship between the coupling function and the dynamics .	We focus on cases where the clusters are inequivalent in the sense of not being related by a temporal symmetry , and demonstrate that there are coupling functions that give robust heteroclinic networks between periodic states involving three or more nontrivial clusters .
The mass of 56Ni synthesized and the asymptotic velocities attained in our calculations are in accord with those inferred from observations of SN1998bw and SN2003dh .	These steady wind-like outflows are generally proton rich , characterized by only modest entropies , and consequently synthesize essentially nothing heavier than the Fe-group elements .
A $ 4.3\sigma $ excess over background was observed between 10 and 20 minutes following the onset of a GRB on 11 May 1991 .	The confidence level that this is due to a real effect and not a background fluctuation is 99.8\ % .
We perform a cross-section analysis and show that present limits on some products of R-parity violating couplings in the sneutrino sector can be significantly improved in future upgraded Fermilab Tevatron runs .	Furthermore , we introduce CP-violating and CP-conserving \tau-spin asymmetries which are generated already at the TREE-LEVEL in the reaction p \bar p - & gt ; sneutrino - & gt ; \tau^+ \tau^- +X if there is muon-sneutrino - \bar muon-sneutrino mixing and that vanish in the SM .
We extend to the non-local case the general analysis of the modular structure .	The local algebras turn out to be $ III_1 $ -factors associated with free groups .
This object is at least as hot as an early B type star based on its intrinsic luminosity and is surrounded by a circumstellar disc/envelope which produces near infrared excess emission .	A number of other relatively bright cluster members also display excess emission in the $ K $ -- band , indicative of disks/envelopes around young massive stars .
Our aim is to probe the spatial distribution of oxygen-rich dust with high spatial resolution .	BM Gem was observed with VLTI/MIDI at 44 -- 62 m baselines using the UT2-UT3 and UT3-UT4 baseline configurations .
We find that the effect of magnetic field on the matter of neutron stars and hence on the mass-radius relation is important , when the central magnetic field is atleast of the order of 10^ { 17 } G. Very importantly , the effect of strong magnetic field reveals anisotropy to the system .	Moreover , if the central field approaches 10^ { 19 } G , then the matter becomes unstable which limits the maximum magnetic field at the center of magnetars .
They provide a simple framework for many phenomena , such as epidemic spreading and opinion formation .	Combining contact processes with rules for topological evolution yields an adaptive network in which the states of the nodes can interact dynamically with the topological degrees of freedom .
The topic of this paper concerns a different approach leading to plasma confinement .	More exactly we are interested in mathematical models with fast oscillating magnetic fields .
2M 1237+6526 has a { \teff } $ \approx $ 800-850 K. If [ M/H ] is solar , $ \log { g } $ is as high as $ \sim $ 5.5 ( cgs ) and this source is older than 10 Gyr .	We find a more plausible scenario to be a modestly subsolar metallicity ( [ M/H ] = -0.2 ) and moderate $ \log { g } $ $ \sim $ 5.0 , implying an age older than 2 Gyr and a mass greater than 0.035 M $ _ { \sun } $ .
The transverse ac drive can also be used to control switching in the longitudinal velocity response .	We discuss how these effects could be used to create new types of devices such as current effect transistors .
The two outflows are nearly perpendicular to each other , showing a quadrupolar morphology .	The northern bipolar outflow extends along the southeast ( redshifted , with a velocity up to ~23 km/s ) and northwest ( blueshifted , velocity up to ~30 km/s ) directions , while the southern pair has an orientation from southwest ( blueshifted , velocity up to 13 km/s ) to northeast ( redshifted , velocity up to ~41 km/s ) .
A theoretical introduction on spectral expansion is first given and a particular emphasis is put on the fast convergence of the spectral approximation .	We present then different approaches to solve partial differential equations , first limiting ourselves to the one-dimensional case , with one or several domains .
In Chapter 2 of the Ph .	D. dissertation by Behtash Babadi [ 2 ] , this error was fixed and a more detailed proof in the non-asymptotic regime was presented .
Attention is focused on the properties of the charge distributions observed in the breakup of the source .	Since the microcanonical version of the model used in this study provides the primary fragment excitation energy distribution , one may correlate the reduction of the odd-even staggering in the charge distribution with the increasing occupation of high energy states .
After passing a critical temperature , which does not coincide with the material 's superconducting temperature , the angular acceleration and angular velocity applied to the rotating ring could be seen on the sensors although they are mechanically de-coupled .	A parity violation was observed for the laser gyroscope measurements such that the effect was greatly pronounced in the clockwise-direction only .
The compound for x = 0.5 is identified as the one with the highest conductivity ( { \sigma } ~ 678 S/cm ) and lowest activation energy for polaron conductivity ( Ep = 39 meV ) .	The evolution of the electronic structure was monitored by soft x-ray Fe and oxygen K-edge spectroscopy .
We discuss the concept of an equivalent instantaneous source on which both techniques rely .	We also discuss the phase-space occupancy and entropy per particle .
The common definition of these order parameters is the mean value of percolation cluster size .	Percolation cluster includes spins with given energy .
Such changes in radius have been indirectly probed by the measurements of the changes in the time lag between the near-IR and UV/optical light variation .	Here we report direct evidence for such a receding sublimation region through the near-IR interferometry of the brightest Type 1 AGN in NGC4151 .
As a follow-up to our previous paper arxiv : 1309.4244 [ hep-th ] , we determine radion induced spherically symmetric solution using the gradient approximation scheme , when two warped $ 3 $ -branes are slant with respect to each other such that the radion field in this case is a radial co-ordinate varying function .	The slanting between the branes is assumed to be small .
We have calculated the polarization of the constituents of \Li6 as a three-body bound state of $ \alpha + n + p $ interacting with local potentials fitted to the scattering data .	It is necessary to include partial waves up to $ j=17/2 $ ( 75 channels , or , when including the $ T=1 $ state , 150 channels ) in the Faddeev equations before the energy eigenvalue converges .
We introduce a line strength parameter ( LSP ) that allows us to quantify the strength of the absorption features as compared to the sample by a single number .	Using the distributions of EWs of single-species features , we derive the distribution of column densities by a curve of growth ( CoG ) fit .
The second one is defined on the Hochschild homology associated with a cyclic , multiplicative operad of graded modules .	The latter can be applied to Bousfield-Salvatore spectral sequence converging to the homology of the space of framed long knots .
The superlattice show both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric transitions which is an evidence for the coexistence of both the properties .	The high magnetoresistance ( 40 % at 80K ) shown by the superlattice can be attributed to the coupling between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric layers , i.e , to the magnetoelectric effect .
Its limitations in terms of flight path differences have already been investigated analytically for neutron beams with vanishing divergence .	In the present work Monte-Carlo simulations for quasi-elastic MIEZE experiments taking into account beam divergence as well as the sample dimensions are presented .
Following the coupling between meteorological and wave models , we derive that on the whole this should imply stronger wind and higher waves in the most energetic part of the spectrum .	This is supported by numerical experiments .
The results of two fermionic models are compared .	In the first one , the diagonal $ S^z $ operator has four states , where two eigenvalues vanish ( 4S model ) , which are suppressed by a restriction in the two states 2S model .
$ $ The problem arises in applications such as solid combustion , composite membranes , climatology and fluid dynamics .	It is known that solutions to the above problem may exhibit singularities - that is points at which the second derivatives of the solution are unbounded - as well as degenerate points .
We demonstrate that the so claimed `` rigorous data selection criteria '' used by Schuermann et al .	relies on the s-factors extracted by Assuncao et al .
We introduce the notion of zero energy observers ( ZEOs ) as counterparts to known zero angular observers ( ZAMOs ) .	It is shown that the trajectory of a ZEO has precisely one turning point that lies on the boundary for photons and inside the ergoregion for massive particles .
Results show that is adequate to perform feature reduction and simultaneous improve the recognition rate .	Moreover , the present methodology represents a robust strategy to understand the proper nature of the images treated , and their discriminant features .
The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian on a finite Hilbert subspace gives a number of meaningful eigenvalues .	Thus together with the ground state some excited states are also reliably approximated .
The quasars were chosen to lie at the two extreme ends of the ROSAT PSPC spectral index distribution and hence of the H $ \beta $ FWHM distribution .	The observation strategy has been carefully designed to provide even sampling on these three basic timescales and to provide a uniform sampling among the quasars We have found clear evidence that the X-ray steep , narrow H_beta , quasars systematically show larger amplitude variations than the X-ray flat broad H_beta quasars on timescales from 2 days to 20 days .
In this paper we illustrate the simplifications produced by FDR in NNLO computations .	We show with an explicit example that - due to its four-dimensionality - FDR does not require an order-by-order renormalization and that , unlike the one-loop case , FDR and dimensional regularization ( DR ) generate intermediate two-loop results which are no longer linked by a simple subtraction of the ultraviolet ( UV ) poles in epsilon .
Episodic mass loss produces dust and therefore causes evolved massive stars to be very luminous in the mid-infrared and dim at optical wavelengths .	We aim to increase the number of investigated luminous mid-IR sources to shed light on the late stages of these objects .
Such semantics seems impossible because classical logic allows the Law of Excluded Middle ( LEM ) , not accepted in constructive logic since it does not have computational meaning .	However , the apparently oracular powers expressed in the LEM , that for any proposition P either it or its negation , not P , is true can also be explained in terms of constructive evidence that does not refer to `` oracles for truth . ''
Student 's t-distribution .	This class of prior parametrized by its degree of freedom is relevant to modelize either dense or sparse ( accounting for outliers ) noise .
Here , we demonstrate similar Bloch oscillations in a slightly richer Josephson circuit , the quantronium .	The quantronium is a Bloch transistor with two small junctions in series , defining an island , in parallel with a larger junction .
With OrdEval algorithm we first evaluate the importance of competences for the users of clinical pharmacy and extract their nature according to the users expectations .	Next , we build a model for predicting a successful introduction of clinical pharmacy to the clinical departments .
The general notion of a $ \Gamma $ -symmetric space was introduced by R.Lutz .	We approach the classification of such spaces in the case $ \Gamma=Z_2^2 $ using recent results on the classification of complex $ Z_2^2 $ -graded simple Lie algebras .
A detailed analysis of the measured NMR spectra presented in this paper enables us to find a very high degree of $ L2_1 $ type ordering up to 81 % concomitantly with excess Fe of 8 to 13 % at the expense of Al and Si .	We show , that the formation of certain types of order do not only depend on the thermodynamic phase diagrams as in bulk samples , but that the kinetic control may contribute to the phase formation in thin films .
The CoRoT satellite exoplanetary team announces its sixth transiting planet in this paper .	We describe and discuss the satellite observations as well as the complementary ground-based observations - photometric and spectroscopic - carried out to assess the planetary nature of the object and determine its specific physical parameters .
The conjecture for arbitrary finitely generated group has its own importance to analyse potential counter-examples to the original conjecture .	We study the Andrews-Curtis and Nielsen equivalence in the class of finitely generated groups for which every maximal subgroup is normal , including nilpotent groups and Grigorchuk groups .
We set out to recover a complete image of the Fe I and Ca II gas emission around { \beta } Pic by spatially resolved , high-resolution spectroscopic observations to better understand the morphology and origin of the gaseous disk component .	The multiple fiber facility FLAMES/GIRAFFE at the VLT , with the large IFU ARGUS , was used to obtain spatially resolved optical spectra in four regions covering the northeast and southwest side of the disk .
Some well-known statements , such as the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation , descend directly from the Ward identities and have thus a general relevance .	Such Ward identities are recovered in gauge/gravity dual setups through holographic renormalization .
From a Bayesian viewpoint , this involves computation of the Bayesian evidence .	In this paper , we generalise the Fisher matrix approach from the context of parameter fitting to that of model testing , and show how the expected evidence can be computed under the same simplifying assumption of a gaussian likelihood as the Fisher matrix approach for parameter estimation .
Furthermore , the constant in the exponent in the case of bipartite $ F $ and two colors is lowered so that $ r_2 ( F ) \le 2^ { ( 1+o ( 1 ) ) 2\sqrt { 2m } } $ improving the result of Alon , Krivelevich and Sudakov [ Combin.Probab.Comput.12 ( 2003 ) , no .	5 -- 6 , 477 -- 494 ] .
Samples both uncovered and covered with a transparent dielectric ( a quartz plate ) with the compressive force of up to 0.5GPa were initiated .	In the transparent spectral region ( the first and second laser harmonics ) of the heavy metal azide matrix the effect of covering the sample surface with a plate on initiation energy threshold was insignificant , whereas , in the region of bandgap absorption ( the fourth harmonic ) strong dependence of the initiation threshold on whether the surface under irradiation is uncovered or covered .
Quantum properties are soon subject to decoherence once the quantum system interacts with the classical environment .	In this paper we experimentally test how propagation losses , in a Gaussian channel , affect the bi-partite Gaussian entangled state generated by a sub-threshold type-II optical parametric oscillator ( OPO ) .
The nature of monetary arrangements is often discussed without any reference to its detailed construction .	We present a graph representation which allows for a clear understanding of modern monetary systems .
This opens the possibility of having a CFT dual .	Metastable de Sitter vacua behave differently depending on the uplifting mechanism .
Certain other puzzles of the standard model such as the absence of flavor changing neutral currents ( FCNC ) , are also explained naturally by the binary particle model .	These puzzles are currently thought to be esoteric properties of electro weak interactions that have origins in physics beyond the standard model at some ultra high energy scales .
Conventional design requires exactly the same number of base functions as given data , and the result is not robust against outliers .	To solve these problems , we propose to use L1 optimality , that is , we use the L1 norm for the regularization term and/or the empirical risk term .
Whether the origin of the non-Fermi-liquid behavior is related to physics specific to the cuprates is a fundamental question still under debate .	We uncover a new transformation from the non-Fermi- to a standard Fermi-liquid state driven not by doping but by magnetic field in the overdoped high-T_c superconductor Tl_2Ba_2CuO_ { 6+x } .
UV photoionisation , supernova feedback and interactions with the larger host halo are all thought to play a role in shaping the population of satellites that we observe today , but there is still no consensus as to which of these effects , if any , dominates .	In this paper , we revisit the issue by re-simulating a Milky Way class dark matter ( DM ) halo with unprecedented resolution .
Based on an analysis of the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope ( EGRET ) data we infer that the diffuse emission from the MBAs , Trojans , and KBOs has an integrated flux of less than ~6x10^ { -6 } cm^ { -2 } s^ { -1 } ( 100-500 MeV ) , which corresponds to ~12 times the Lunar albedo , and may be detectable by the forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) .	If detected by GLAST , it can provide unique direct information about the number of small bodies in each system that is difficult to assess by any other method .
D Souza , arxiv:0907.0894 ) .	The case of network of n networks with both interdependent and interconnected links is more complicated , and also more closely to real-life coupled network systems .
In this paper , we turn our attention to the full subcategory of weak higher dimensional transition systems which are unions of cubes .	It is proved that there exists a left proper combinatorial model structure such that two objects are weakly equivalent if and only if they have the same cubes after simplification of the labelling .
We discuss the classical and the quantum mechanics of a free particle in this framework , and show that they strongly depend on the sign of a coupling constant $ \lambda $ , appearing in the fundamental commutators and proportional to $ \beta^2 $ .	For example , if $ \lambda $ is negative , momenta are bounded .
aHUGIN is an extension of the HUGIN shell , and is based on the methods reported by Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen ( 1990a ) .	The adaptive systems resulting from aHUGIN are able to adjust the C011ditional probabilities in the model .
This has significantly heightened the need for automated annotation of the images on one side , and fast and memory-efficient content-based image retrieval systems on the other side .	Binary descriptors have recently gained more attention as a potential vehicle to achieve these goals .
We study the exact dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-polarized gas of fermions in a double-well potential at zero and finite temperature .	Despite the system is made of non-interacting fermions , its dynamics can be quite complex , showing strongly aperiodic spatio-temporal patterns during the tunneling .
All four lens systems were modeled with PixeLens , Lenstool , glafic , and Lensmodel .	The input data and parameterization of each lens model was similar for the four model programs used to highlight differences in the output results .
Since the radiation interacts with matter moving with relativistic velocities near the event horizon , the interplay between the radiation and the matter should be described fully relativistically .	In the formalism used in this study , while the interactions between matter and radiation are introduced in the comoving frame , the equations and the equations and the derivatives for the description of the global evolution of both matter and the radiation are given in the Kerr-Schild frame ( KSF ) which is a frame fixed to the coordinate describing the central black hole .
However , in a larger magnetic field this relaxation becomes oscillating .	The phenomenon is related to the statistical dependence of the components of transformed random force caused by the simultaneous influence of magnetic field and anisotropic dissipation .
The latter seems to depend on the hour angle of the observation .	In this document , a more detailed analysis of these two effects is carried out and summarised .
The exact computation of the number of distinct elements ( frequency moment $ F_0 $ ) is a fundamental problem in the study of data streaming algorithms .	We denote the length of the stream by $ n $ where each symbol is drawn from a universe of size $ m $ .
As a key component of continuous-time DUE models , DNL aims at describing and predicting the spatial-temporal evolution of traffic flows on a network that is consistent with established route and departure time choices of travelers , by introducing appropriate dynamics to flow propagation , flow conservation , and travel delays .	The DNL procedure gives rise to the path delay operator , which associates a vector of path flows ( path departure rates ) with the corresponding path travel costs .
It was found that to account for cosmological observations , the masses of the first Kaluza-Klein modes ( and thus the approximate size of the extra dimension ) should be in the range 600-1200 GeV when the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle ( LKP ) corresponds to the hypercharge boson and in the range 1 - 1.8 TeV when it corresponds to a neutrino .	In this article , we compute the elastic scattering cross sections between Kaluza-Klein dark matter and nuclei both when the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle is a KK mode of a weak gauge boson , and when it is a neutrino .
The potential utilization of two-stage sintering for the production of highly dense and pure nickel diniobate ( Ni4Nb2O9 ) ceramics with low firing temperature was demonstrated .	Effects of designed sintering conditions on phase formation , densification and microstructure of the ceramics were characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , Archimedes method and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , respectively .
Rather , it gives an alternative definition of the recursively enumerable Turing degrees that does not rely on oracles .	The definitions give rise to a number of questions about computable paths inside Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups , and several of these questions are answered .
Our population synthesis model includes variation in 16 elements from C to Ba , the shift in effective temperature , Delta ( Teff ) , of the stars with respect to a solar metallicity isochrone , amongst other parameters .	In our approach we fit the full optical spectra rather than a select number of spectral indices and are able to , for the first time , measure the abundances of the elements V , Cr , Mn , Co , and Ni from the integrated light of distant galaxies .
The cluster Abell 2199 is one of the prototypical `` cooling flow '' clusters .	Its central cD galaxy is host to a steep-spectrum radio source , of the type associated with cooling cores .
The other set ( the `` damped modes '' ) retains a finite decay rate even for extremal Kerr black holes , and exists only for a subset of corotating modes .	As the angular momentum approaches its extremal value , the frequency spectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modes are present .
These relations become exact at asymptotic energies and , provided the SUSY scale is not too heavy , they may be approximately correct at LHC energies also .	In addition to these , we study the 1loop EW corrections to the inclusive $ \tilde d\tchi_i^+ $ production at LHC , presenting as examples , the $ p_T $ and angular distributions .
We assume $ X $ to be Hausdorff , locally compact and second countable and prove that a POVM $ F $ is commutative if and only if it is the smearing of a spectral measure $ E $ by means of a Feller Markov kernel .	Moreover , we prove that the smearing can be realized by means of a strong Feller Markov kernel if and only if $ F $ is uniformly continuous .
However , the secrecy capacity is non-zero even when the receiver is allowed to feed back only one bit at the end of each block .	Our novel achievable strategy improves the rates proposed in the literature for the non-hybrid adversarial model .
Non-zero CP asymmetries are expected for $ D^+ \to K^+ \ok $ ( the most promising channel for which a non-zero CP asymmetry has not yet been reported ) , as well as $ D^0 \to \pi^0 \pi^0 $ , $ D_s^+ \to \pi^+ \ko $ , and $ D_s \to \pi^0 K^+ $ .	No CP asymmetry is predicted for $ D^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0 $ or $ D^0 \to \ko \ok $ in this framework .
In this work , we propose to assess classifiers in terms of normalized mutual information ( NI ) , which is novel and well defined in a compact range for classifier evaluation .	We derive close-form relations of normalized mutual information with respect to accuracy , precision , and recall in binary classifications .
We performed large-eddy simulation with the sub-grid scale ( LES-SGS ) stretched-vortex model of momentum and scalar transport to study the gas-dynamics interactions of a helium inclined round jet into a supersonic ( $ M=3.6 $ ) turbulent ( \Reth $ =13\times10^3 $ ) air flow over a flat surface .	The video shows the temporal development of Mach-number and magnitude of density-gradient in the mid-span plane , and isosurface of helium mass-fraction and $ \lam_2 $ ( vortical structures ) .
When the hole encompasses a point of a short periodic orbit , the entropy difference is significantly smaller than $ \mu_P ( \alpha ) $ .	This discrepancy is described by the formula which relates the length of the short periodic orbit , the Parry measure $ \mu_P ( \alpha ) $ , and the topological entropies of the two chaotic sets .
The curvature was found to have a singularity at the critical point .	We focused on the zero field case to derive thermodynamic curvature and its components near the criticality .
We find that the jet density has limited influence on the structure for a given jet Mach number .	The speed of advance varies by a small factor for jet densities between 0.1 and 0.0001 of the ambient density while the cocoon and cavity evolution change from narrow pressure balanced to wide over-pressure as the ratio falls .
Despite their near dominance , heuristic state search planners still lag behind disjunctive planners in the generation of parallel plans in classical planning .	The reason is that directly searching for parallel solutions in state space planners would require the planners to branch on all possible subsets of parallel actions , thus increasing the branching factor exponentially .
Although powerful , it fails to extract substantial information from the data to guide the search efficiently , as this methodology is not based on any statistical modeling .	The proposed approach uses Gaussian Process ( GP ) modeling to improve upon SELC , and hence named $ \mathcal { G } $ -SELC .
We estimate the radii and the masses and derive a mass ratio M_2/M_1 = 2.1 .	We confirm that V524 Mon is a W-type contact system , likely enclosed in a common convective envelope , as found by Samec & amp ; Loflin ( 2003 ) .
We combine far-infrared photometry from Herschel ( PEP/HERMES ) with deep mid-infrared spectroscopy from Spitzer to investigate the nature and the mass assembly history of a sample of 31 Luminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies at z~1 and 2 selected in GOODS-S with 24 $ \mu $ m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mJy .	We model the data with a self-consistent physical model ( GRASIL ) which includes a state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing .
A numerical discretization is proposed for which the convergence towards duality solutions of the aggregation equation is proved .	It relies on a careful choice of the discretized macroscopic velocity $ v $ in order to give a sense to the product $ v \rho $ .
With this procedure we are able to generate maps of proper motion velocities along and across the outflow axis , as well as ( angularly integrated ) proper motion velocity distributions .	From the four available epochs , we find the time evolution of the velocities , intensities and spatial distribution of the line emission .
Intriguingly , it possesses both euclidean and scale-free structure with Fisher exponent smaller than $ 2 $ .	Remarkably , an indistinguishable Fisher exponent and the same euclidean structure is obtained at the critical point of the random percolation model after absorbing all enclaves into their surrounding clusters .
Multipermutations are permutations of a multiset that generally consist of duplicate entries .	We first introduce a class of binary matrices called multipermutation matrices , each of which corresponds to a unique and distinct multipermutation .
A fast and efficient coding algorithms are needed for effective storage and transmission , due to the popularity of telemedicine and the use of digital medical images .	Medical images are produced and transferred between hospitals for review by physicians who are geographically apart .
We propose a multivariate extension .	First it is shown that an arbitrary copula is in the domain of attraction of a multivariate extreme value distribution if and only if its upper tail can be approximated by the upper tail of a multivariate GPD with uniform margins .
Using operator approach , we derive the TGTG-formula for the Casimir interaction energy between the two spheres .	A byproduct is the explicit formula for the translation matrix that relates the fermionic spherical waves in different coordinate systems .
Its 250 mK focal plane detector array consists of 1,274 polarization-sensitive antenna-coupled bolometers , each with an associated lithographed band-defining filter .	Each detector 's planar antenna structure is coupled to the telescope 's optical system through a contacting dielectric lenslet , an architecture unique in current CMB experiments .
We probe the redshift and luminosity evolution of intrinsic alignments in Horizon-AGN between $ z=0 $ and $ z=3 $ for galaxies with an $ r $ -band absolute magnitude of $ M_r\leq-20 $ .	Alignments transition from being radial at low redshifts and high luminosities , dominated by the contribution of ellipticals , to being tangential at high redshift and low luminosities , where discs dominate the signal .
Our nine fields are , according to several catalogs , centred on Galactic star clusters , namely Trumpler 13 , Trumpler 20 , Lynga 4 , Hogg 19 , Lynga 12 , Trumpler 25 , Trumpler 26 , Ruprecht 128 , and Trumpler 34 .	Apart from their coordinates , and in some cases additional basic data ( mainly from the 2MASS archive ) , their properties are poorly known .
In a previous work Lazarian and Pogosyan suggested a technique to extract velocity and density statistics , of interstellar turbulence , by means of analysing statistics of spectral line data cubes .	In this paper we test that technique , by studying the effect of correlation between velocity and density fields , providing a systematic analysis of the uncertainties arising from the numerics , and exploring the effect of a linear shear .
The first improvement is the usage of a period function which is not one-to-one on its period .	We show that even in this case Shor 's algorithm computes the period with constant probability .
We present results obtained from a series of observations of the supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 by the Suzaku satellite .	The observations cover about two-thirds of the remnant surface .
Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally-applied magnetic field yields a wealth of detailed information on the violent collapse process .	We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate , atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms , spikes appearing in the condensate wave function , and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse .
The first pinpointed those ( p , D ) slots consistent with kappa-symmetric Green-Schwarz type actions ; the second generalized the `` membrane at the end of the universe '' idea to all those superconformal groups describing p-branes on the boundary of AdS_ { p+2 } x S^ { D-p-2 } .	Although the second version predicted D3 and M5 branes in addition to those of the first , it came unstuck because the 1/2 BPS solitonic branes failed to exhibit the required symmetry enhancement in the near-horizon limit , except in the non-dilatonic cases ( p=2 , D=11 ) , ( p=3 , D=10 ) and ( p=5 , D=11 ) .
The new algorithm requires no preprocessing , still it has linear complexity on average .	In terms of bit complexity , instead of arithmetic , we only have extra logarithmic factors .
HESS J0632+057 is an unidentified gamma-ray source located in the Monoceros region , probably associated with the massive Be star MWC 148.H.E.S.S .	and VERITAS observations in the very high energy ( VHE ) range combined with Swift X-ray data indicate that this object is a new member of the elusive gamma-ray binary class .
The observed alternation of low- and high-spin states along the Co-Rh and Fe-Rh chains is related to differences in the oxygen coordination of the transition metal sites .	Due to strong hybridization the O 2p states are polarized , giving rise to extended localized magnetic moments centered at the high-spin sites .
In this article , we explore the natural connectivity of random graphs both analytically and numerically and show that it increases linearly with the average degree .	By comparing with regular ring lattices and random regular graphs , we show that random graphs are more robust than random regular graphs ; however , the relationship between random graphs and regular ring lattices depends on the average degree and graph size .
Here , one is allowed to replace some of the pattern letters with some special symbols `` ?	`` , termed wildcards or do n't cares , which can be mapped to an arbitrary substring of the text .
The experimental results are compared with predictions of tilted axis cranking calculations .	The transition from irregular dipole band in 144Gd to more regular ones in lighter Gd nuclei is observed .
In this paper , we show that the coefficient c_2 ' can be computed perturbatively .	We also show that the remaining second-order coefficient c_2 '' depends on non-perturbative physics but can be related , by a perturbative calculation , to quantities that have previously been measured using lattice simulations of three-dimensional O ( 2 ) scalar field theory .
If such a basis ( e.g.wavelets ) is used to represent the signals , then the variation in many coordinates is likely to be small .	Consequently , we study a simple `` sparse PCA '' algorithm : select a subset of coordinates of largest variance , estimate eigenvectors from PCA on the selected subset , threshold and reexpress in the original basis .
First , the eigenfunctions are close to plane waves $ e^ { i\langle \vec \varkappa , \vec x\rangle } $ at the high energy region .	Second , the isoenergetic curves in the space of momenta $ \vec \varkappa $ corresponding to these eigenfunctions have a form of slightly distorted circles with holes ( Cantor type structure ) .
Electric transport in semiconductor superlattices is dominated by pronounced negative differential conductivity .	In this report the standard transport theories for superlattices , i.e.miniband conduction , Wannier-Stark-hopping , and sequential tunneling , are reviewed in detail .
Generating absorbers for these channels is a new problem for SIE methods , as the methods were initially developed for problems with finite surfaces .	In this paper we show that the obvious approach for eliminating reflections , making the channel mildly conductive outside the domain of interest , is inaccurate .
In such models , the probability distribution for $ \rho_\L $ is a product of an { \it a priori } distribution $ { \cal P } _* ( \rho_\L ) $ and of the number density of galaxies at a given $ \rho_\L $ ( which is proportional to the number of observers who will detect that value of $ \rho_\L $ ) .	To determine $ { \cal P } _* $ , we consider inflationary models in which the role of the vacuum energy is played by a slowly-varying potential of some scalar field .
A treatment regime is a deterministic function that dictates personalized treatment based on patients ' individual prognostic information .	There is a fast-growing interest in ? nding optimal treatment regimes to maximize expected long-term clinical outcomes of patients for complex diseases , such as cancer and AIDS .
From a fit to ARGUS and CLEO data on B- & gt ; D*lv semileptonic decay we find for the Cabbibo Kobayashi Maskawa matrix element Vcb=0.036+-0.003 .	We compare our form factors to the pole dominance hypothesis and the heavy quark limit .
Using a backward separation method with a decomposition technique , two optimality conditions and two coupled forward-backward optimal filters are derived .	Several linear-quadratic optimal control problems for mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equations are studied .
We further observe a quasi-steady evolution thanks to an open boundary condition , and find that the Petschek-type structure is stable over the long time period .	Simulation results and theoretical analyses exhibit that the Petschek outflow channel becomes narrower when the reconnection inflow contains more magnetic energy , as previously claimed .
We find that the kinematics in these outer regions are all different despite the fact that these four galaxies have similar photometric properties , and are uniformly classified as `` fast rotators '' from their stellar kinematics within $ 1R_e $ .	The globular cluster systems exhibit a wide range of kinematic morphology .
The longitudinal degrees of freedom are described by an abstract Verma module .	The central charge of this module is restricted by the requirement of the closure of the nonlinear realization of the Poincare algebra .
The task involves taking a user query as input and returning a list of people who are sorted by their level of expertise with respect to the user query .	Despite recent interest in the area , the current state-of-the-art techniques lack in principled approaches for optimally combining different sources of evidence .
A class of models is introduced describing the evolution of population species whose carrying capacities are functionals of these populations .	The functional dependence of the carrying capacities reflects the fact that the correlations between populations can be realized not merely through direct interactions , as in the usual predator-prey Lotka-Volterra model , but also through the influence of species on the carrying capacities of each other .
The identification process of NEP X-ray sources resulted in 144 X-ray sources having a normal stellar counterpart , with an excess of yellow stars with respect to model predictions .	We want to determine if these X-ray active stars are young or intermediate-age stars , or active binaries .
We present results from an infrared study of 87 nearby Seyfert galaxies using the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes .	Combining detailed modelling of the 3 - 100 micron spectral energy distributions with mid-IR spectral diagnostics and near-infrared observations , we find broad support for the unified model of AGNs .
Pulsations were found from analysis of high time resolution spectra obtained with the ESO Very Large Telescope using a cross correlation method for wide spectral bands , from lines belonging to rare earth elements and from the H alpha core .	Pulsation amplitudes reach more than 200 m/s for some lines in HD69013 with a period of 11.4 min and about 100m/s in HD96237 with periods near 13.6 min .
Some time ago , Svetitsky and Yaffe have argued that -- if the deconfinement phase transition of a ( d+1 ) -dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group G is second order -- it should be in the universality class of a d-dimensional spin model symmetric under the center of G. For d=3 these arguments have been confirmed numerically only in the SU ( 2 ) case with center Z ( 2 ) , simply because all SU ( N ) Yang-Mills theories with N & gt ; =3 seem to have non-universal first order phase transitions .	The symplectic groups Sp ( N ) also have the center Z ( 2 ) and provide another extension of SU ( 2 ) = Sp ( 1 ) to general N. Using lattice simulations , we find that the deconfinement phase transition of Sp ( 2 ) Yang-Mills theory is first order in 3+1 dimensions , while in 2+1 dimensions stronger fluctuations induce a second order transition .
The Walsh transform $ \widehat { Q } $ of a quadratic function $ Q : F_ { p^n } \rightarrow F_p $ satisfies $ |\widehat { Q } ( b ) | \in \ { 0 , p^ { \frac { n+s } { 2 } } \ } $ for all $ b\in F_ { p^n } $ , where $ 0\le s\le n-1 $ is an integer depending on $ Q $ .	In this article , we study the following three classes of quadratic functions of wide interest .
Development of many futuristic technologies , such as MANET , VANET , iThings , nano-devices , depend on efficient distributed communication protocols in multi-hop ad hoc networks .	A vast majority of research in this area focus on design heuristic protocols , and analyze their performance by simulations on networks generated randomly or obtained in practical measurements of some ( usually small-size ) wireless networks. % some library .
We present empirical relations between the global dust reddening and other physical galaxy properties including the Halpha luminosity , Halpha surface brightness , metallicity and axial ratio for star-forming disc galaxies .	The study is based on a large sample of ~22 000 well-defined star-forming galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) .
During the self-detuning cycle new and new narrow phonon modes are sequentially `` fired '' on one side of the spectrum and approximately the same number of modes are `` extinguished '' on the other side , up to a complete generation breakdown in a certain final portion of the frequency axis .	This is usually followed by a short-time refractority , after which the generation is fired again in the opposite ( starting ) portion of the frequency axis .
I consider the Hubbard model of graphene in an external magnetic field and in the Hartree-Fock approximation .	In the continuum limit , the ground state energy at half filling becomes nearly symmetric under rotations of the three-component vector ( N1 , N2 , m ) , with the first two components representing the Neel order parameter orthogonal to and the third component the magnetization parallel with the external magnetic field .
We apply the shock powered emission model to this system .	The collision of the pulsar and Be star winds forms a shock , which accelerates electrons and positrons to the relativistic energies .
With this information , we are able to estimate the redshift evolution of the total ( FUV + FIR ) star formation rate density ( SFRD_TOT ) .	Our main conclusions are that : 1 ) the dust attenuation A_FUV is found to increase from z = 0 to $ z \sim 1.2 and then starts to decrease until our last data point at z = 3.6 ; 2 ) the estimated SFRD confirms published results to z \sim 2 .
Non-magnetic light element atmospheres can not be simultaneously reconciled with the optical and X-ray data .	We extend previous studies , which were limited to one fixed neutron star mass and radius .
Neither plate tectonics nor Earth expansion theory is sufficient to provide a basis for understanding geoscience .	Each theory is incomplete and possesses problematic elements , but both have served as stepping stones to a more fundamental and inclusive geoscience theory that I call Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics ( WEDD ) .
For any space X with the homotopy type of simply-connected , finite-type CW-complex , we construct an associative cochain algebra fls ( X ) whose cohomology algebra is isomorphic to that of LX , the free loop space on X .	For certain X , we define a cochain map from fls ( X ) to itself that is a good model of the pth-power operation on LX .
Galaxy formation models exhibit remarkable success in reproducing observed relations such as the relation between galaxies ' star formation rates ( SFRs ) and stellar masses and the stellar mass -- halo mass relation .	We demonstrate that comparisons of the short-timescale variability in galaxy SFRs with observational data provide an additional useful constraint on the physics of galaxy formation feedback .
Guided by these results we develop a framework of backward algorithms for constructing such a martingale .	In turn this martingale may then be utilized for computing an upper bound of the Bermudan product .
Since superfluids and superconductors in neutron stars profoundly affect neutrino emissivities and specific heats , their presence can be observed in the thermal evolution of neutron stars .	An ever-growing number of cooling neutron stars , now amounting to 13 thermal sources , and several additional objects from which upper limits to temperatures can be ascertained , can now be used to discriminate among theoretical scenarios and even to dramatically restrict properties of nucleon pairing at high densities .
The problem of derivation of the equations of motion from the field equations is considered .	Einstein 's field equations have a specific analytical form : They are linear in the second order derivatives and quadratic in the first order derivatives of the field variables .
The solution to the problem minimizes a suitable divergence index with respect to an a priori spectral density .	We derive a new divergence family between multivariate spectral densities which takes root in the prediction theory .
Let $ S_n $ denote the symmetric group .	For any $ \sigma \in S_n $ , we let $ \mathrm { des } ( \sigma ) $ denote the number of descents of $ \sigma $ , $ \mathrm { inv } ( \sigma ) $ denote the number of inversions of $ \sigma $ , and $ \mathrm { LRmin } ( \sigma ) $ denote the number of left-to-right minima of $ \sigma $ .
Our first proposition provides us with a pathwise definition of the gain process for a large class of continuous-time , path-dependent , self-finacing trading strategies , including the important class of 'delta-hedging ' strategies , and is based on the recently developed 'non-anticipative functional calculus ' .	Two versions of the statement involve respectively continuous and c\`adl\`ag price paths .
Suppose that we are given a quantum computer programmed ready to perform a computation if it is switched on .	Counterfactual computation is a process by which the result of the computation may be learnt without actually running the computer .
From ( i ) -- ( ii ) , we get an induced dual representation of an associated dual group $ G^c $ .	All three properties , selfsimilarity , order-covariance , and positivity , are satisfied in a natural context when $ G $ is semisimple and hermitean ; but when $ G $ is the $ ( ax+b ) $ -group , or the Heisenberg group , positivity is incompatible with the other two axioms for the infinite-dimensional irreducible representations .
A simple interlayer pair tunneling is solved exactly .	We find that in the normal state spin-1/2 particle and hole excitations are gapped .
The BAO peak standard ruler should also follow this inhomogeneous evolution if the comoving rigidity assumption is false .	This `` standard '' ruler has now been detected to be flexible , as expected under general relativity .
As their name suggests , OR circuits have OR gates as their computation gates , as well as the usual input , output and constant ( 0/1 ) gates .	As is the norm for Boolean circuits , our circuits have multiple sink gates , which implies that an OR circuit computes an OR function on some subset of its input variables .
All the topologies of the Feynman diagrams such as the non-factorizable spectator ones and the annihilation ones are calculated in the pQCD approach .	It is of great interest to find that , contrary to the known $ B \to \pi \pi $ decays , the $ B \to a_0 a_0 $ decays are governed by the large non-factorizable contributions , which give rise to the large $ B \to a_0 a_0 $ decay rates in the order of $ 10^ { -6 } \sim 10^ { -5 } $ , although the $ a_0 $ meson has an extremely small vector decay constant $ f_ { a_0 } $ .
We account for the OVRO beamwidth and calibration uncertainties , as well as the uncertainty induced by the removal of non-CMB foreground contamination .	We consider open and spatially-flat-Lambda cold dark matter cosmogonies , with nonrelativistic-mass density parameter Omega_0 in the range 0.1 -- 1 , baryonic-mass density parameter Omega_B in the range ( 0.005 -- 0.029 ) h^ { -2 } , and age of the universe t_0 in the range ( 10 -- 20 ) Gyr .
They can be absorbed ( in a right-sided formulation ) by replacing the axiom P , ( not P ) by Gamma , P , ( not P ) for any context Gamma , and replacing the original disjunction rule with Gamma , A , B implies Gamma , ( A or B ) .	This paper presents a classical sequent calculus which is also free of contraction and weakening , but more symmetrically : both contraction and weakening are absorbed into conjunction , leaving the axiom rule intact .
These eruptions are thought to represent key mass loss episodes in the lives of massive stars .	I discuss the possibility of dormant LBVs and implications for the duration of the greater LBV phase and its role in stellar evolution .
Several coronal signatures , \textit { e.g . } , filaments , coronal cavities , sigmoid structures and hot channels ( or hot blobs ) , are proposed as MFRs and observed before the eruption , which support the pre-existing MFR scenario .	There is almost no reported observation about MFR formation during the eruption .
Most of these hybridization approaches , however , follow an ad hoc design methodology , justified by success in certain application domains .	Due to the lack of a common framework it often remains difficult to compare the various hybrid systems conceptually and to evaluate their performance comparatively .
Gaze stabilization is an important requisite for humanoid robots .	Previous work on this topic has focused on the integration of inertial and visual information .
Using standard calculus , explicit formulas for the one-dimensional continuous and discrete homotopy operators are derived .	It is shown that these formulas are equivalent to those in terms of Euler operators obtained from the variational complex .
The task is accomplished in three steps .	The first step is the construction of a modified cobar complex adapted to a non-coassociative comultiplication .
We discuss heavy quark contributions to the neutrino-nucleon total cross section at very high energies , well above the real top production threshold .	The top-bottom weak current is found to generate strong left-right asymmetry of neutrino-nucleon interactions .
To facilitate our analysis , we have developed a novel triangulation algorithm that allows efficient study of hypersurfaces with $ h^ { 1,1 } $ as large as 25 , which is difficult using algorithms internal to packages such as Sage .	Our results serve as input for statistical studies of the vacuum structure in flux compactifications , and of the distribution of axion decay constants in string theory .
The first grating creates the conditions for Smith Purcell emission mechanism .	The second grating provides the distributed feedback for emitted wave .
For the index 1 saddle case the stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM are co-dimension one in the energy surface , and act as conduits for reacting trajectories in phase space .	The situation for index 2 saddles is quite different .
As an ingredient for the proof of our main result , we construct a new diagrammatic realization $ \overrightarrow { D } _ { k } $ of the Sergeev superalgebra $ Ser_ { k } $ .	Finally , we give a presentation of $ \overrightarrow { B } _ { r , s } $ in terms of generators and relations .
We estimate the sensitivity of this search at the proposed International Linear Collider ( ILC ) , under a variety of run scenarios .	We employ the effective operator formalism to provide a quasi-model-independent theoretical description of the signal , and present the reach of the ILC in terms of the scale \Lambda suppressing the dark matter-electron coupling operator .
As it appears , the structure may be interpreted as either a core-jet or a double source .	However , the supernova structure could be somewhat confused with a possible close by noise peak .
In 2010 , Alessio Figalli and Nicola Gigli introduced a transportation cost that can be used to obtain parabolic equations with drift subject to Dirichlet boundary condition .	However , the drift and the boundary condition are coupled in their work .
Some traces of amoebas were appearing from time to time , even before the formal introduction , as auxiliary tools in several problems .	After 1994 amoebas have been seen and studied in several areas of mathematics , from algebraic geometry and topology to complex analysis and combinatorics .
We perform molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the occurrence of inhomogeneous shear flows in soft jammed materials .	We use rough walls to impose a simple shear flow and study the athermal motion of jammed assemblies of soft particles , both for purely repulsive interactions and in the presence of an additional short-range attraction of varying strength .
Thermal timescale mass transfer generally occurs in close binaries where the donor star is more massive than the accreting star .	The mass transfer rates are usually estimated in terms of the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale of the donor star .
Simulations assuming a Gaussian peak shape and a Gaussian autocorrelation function show that desired error levels are achieved for relatively low SNR and are robust to partial peak overlap .	Simulations also show that detection power is maximized when the smoothing bandwidth is close to the bandwidth of the signal peaks , akin to the well-known matched filter theorem in signal processing .
Also the chiral nature of U ( 1 ) ' flavor symmetry calls for new U ( 1 ) '-charged Higgs doublets in order for the SM fermions to have realistic renormalizable Yukawa couplings .	The stringent constraints from the top FB asymmetry at the Tevatron and the same sign top pair production at the LHC can be evaded due to contributions of the extra Higgs doublets .

For this , we focused on the development of a framework capable of testing different indirect biofeedback models within a specified game , in order to assess the effect of each of these variations on the user experience .
Much of what we know about neutrinos , and hope to learn in the future , is derived from a unique feature of neutrinos -- `` oscillation '' among neutrino `` flavor '' types .	An initial neutrino flavor will in general oscillate into another flavor as the neutrino propagates in space and time .
The spatial distribution of stars in the nearby S0 galaxy NGC 5102 is investigated using images obtained with WIRCam and MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope .	With the exception of gaps between detector elements , the entire galaxy is surveyed in r ' and i ' , while the J and Ks data extend out to 6 kpc ( 7 disk scale lengths ) .
These different behaviors are determined by whether the dielectric layer is beyond the domain where the near field of nanoparticles takes effect , and geometrical optics effects must be taken into account .	It is revealed that for particle of a certain size , an appropriate dielectric layer thickness is desirable to achieve the best absorption performance .
Two approaches are used .	The first one is based on Harris theorem , and the second on Doeblin 's coupling argument .
With $ N $ , $ W $ , and $ L $ denoting , respectively , system size , disorder strength , and the average number of levels in units of the mean level spacing , we find that both $ \chi ( N , W ) $ and the integrated $ \Sigma_ { 2 } $ obey finite-size scaling .

Moreover , the heat conduction of Rubin-Greer-like model for FK chain at low temperature is calculated .	It is found that the stationary heat flux $ J ( N ) \sim N^ { \alpha } $ , and $ \alpha $ depends on the strength of the external potential .
Theory predicts there should be an odd number of images but , paradoxically , almost all observed lenses have 2 or 4 images .	The missing image should be faint and appear near the galaxy 's center .
When a specific genotype is only able to influence a few other genotypes , the ecology consists of separate non-interacting clusters in genotype space .	When different types may influence a large number of other sites , the network becomes one large interconnected cluster .
In this letter , we establish physical limits on how closely can a quantum mechanical system be steered to a desired target state in the presence of relaxation .	In particular , we explicitly compute the maximum coherence or polarization that can be transferred between coupled nuclear spins in the presence of very general decoherence mechanisms that include cross-correlated relaxation .
The approach we use is based on the Galilei group , where the non-commutativity is seen as a central extension upon identification of the boost generators with the position operator .	We perform a systematic study of the free particle , defined by the symmetries of the space time , which include the no-commutativity .
We show that this quantity is $ \Theta ( \sqrt { n } ) $ , closing a line of incrementally larger lower bounds .	The same lower bound was recently obtained independently by Sherstov using related techniques .
Such metric quantifies the amount of common randomness extractable through public discussion between two legitimate nodes under an eavesdropper attack .	We show some general topological properties that the desired max-min solutions shall satisfy .
Other approaches for stating security policies fall short of what is desirable with respect to either policy clarity , executability , or the precision with which a policy may be expressed .	However , LaSCO is designed to have those three desirable properties of a security policy language as well as : relevance for many different systems , statement of policies at an appropriate level of detail , user friendliness for both casual and expert users , and amenability to formal reasoning .
Unfortunately all previous attempts suffered from instabilities .	In the present work , we evolve the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge and smooth the derived magnetic field for usage in the momentum equation .
In such an operational formalism a quantum mechanical time operator is constructed and analyzed .	A phase space time and energy uncertainty relation is derived .
For $ \Delta m^2 & gt ; 0 $ ( the light side ) , the electron neutrinos from the neutronization burst would be lost , while the first event at Kamiokande is quite likely to be due to an electron neutrino .	For $ \Delta m^2 & lt ; 0 $ ( the dark side ) , the average energy of the dominantly $ \bar { \nu } _e $ events is already lower than the theoretical expectations , which would get aggravated by a complete conversion from $ \bar { \nu } _\mu $ to $ \bar { \nu } _e $ .
We detect the second known lambda Bootis star ( HD 54272 ) which exhibits gamma Doradus-type pulsations .	The star was formerly misidentified as a RR Lyrae variable .
Each valley is predicted to exhibit a Hall effect in the absence of a magnetic field whose sign depends on the valley index , but to date this effect has not been observed .	Here we report the first observation of this new valley Hall effect ( VHE ) .
However , such a success is essentially limited to qualitative data characterization , identification and analysis ( CIA ) .	In this work , we outline a general protocol to construct objective-oriented persistent homology methods .
Large N resurgent transseries compute gauge-theoretic finite N results nonperturbatively ( no matter how small N is ) .	Explicit calculations are carried out within the gauge theory prototypical example of the quartic matrix model .
Futhermore , the counterpropagating geometry results in images that are symmetric with respect to the relative velocity vector .	This allows for the use of inverse Abel transformation methods that enhance the resolution further .
The strong coupling of rho meson to the nucleon produces $ s $ and $ p $ wave rho meson nucleon $ ( \rho N ) $ resonances .	In a nucleus , the $ \rho N $ resonance-hole polarization generates the optical potential or self-energy for the rho meson .
Results of such experiments have revealed typical spectra that are quite different from what is seen in conventional low-Tc superconductors .	In particular the Caroli-deGennes-Matricon state at $ E\sim 0 $ in the core center is not seen .
In contrast to Fisher 's original mapping , this enables us to reformulate frustrated Ising models as dimer models with positive weights and we illustrate this by providing a new solution of the fully frustrated Ising model on the square lattice .	Finally , by means of the modified mapping we show that a large class of three-dimensional Ising models are precisely equivalent , in the time continuum limit , to particular quantum dimer models .
We focus on the sum rules associated with QCD 4-point correlators which were not analyzed in detail before .	Convergence properties of the sum rules are deduced from a general analysis of the form of the counterterms in the presence of electromagnetic spurions .
The observation probability of target state is not improved by designing unitary transform , but oracle function .	Its complexity is polynomial .
The spectrum of the fermion zero modes in the vicinity of the vortex with fractional winding number is discussed .	This is inspired by the observation of the 1/2 vortex in high-temperature superconductors ( Kirtley , et al , Phys.Rev.Lett .
We analytically calculate the pressure and entropy to three-loop order and the screening mass to two-loop order , expanding in powers of m/T .	The truncated m/T-expansion results are compared with numerical SPT results for the pressure , entropy and screening mass which are accurate to all orders in m/T .
This improvement in resolution can potentially improve the photometry of faint stars in extremely crowded fields significantly by alleviating crowding .	Alleviating crowding is a prerequisite for observing gravitational microlensing in main sequence stars towards the galactic bulge .

Very recently , after Belgun and Moroianu conjectured that the number of factors was at most one , Matveev and Nikolayevsky found an example with two factors .	When the non-flat factor has dimension 2 , we give a complete classification of the examples with two factors .
We study integrable models solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and possessing the GL ( 3 ) -invariant R-matrix .	We consider a composite model where the total monodromy matrix of the model is presented as a product of two partial monodromy matrices .
In particular , we prove that the commutative ladders of length less than 5 are representation-finite and explicitly show their Auslander-Reiten quivers .	Furthermore , a generalization of persistence diagrams is introduced by using Auslander-Reiten quivers .
It is also seen that such backgrounds are able to yield state oscillations even in the absence of the electromagnetic field .	The foreseen effects are used to establish upper bounds on the Lorentz-violating coefficients .

Our spectroscopic redshifts for 169 radio sources reveal a flat median redshift distribution , and these sources are hosted by similarly luminous optical L* galaxies , regardless of redshift .	This is a serious concern for radio estimates of the local star formation rate density , as a substantial fraction of the ultraviolet luminosity density is generated by sub-L* galaxies at low redshifts .
A significant lensing signal is detected around most of the clusters .	The lensing mass correlates tightly with the cluster richness .

Using the numerically exact density matrix renormalization group method , we find that these interacting phases -- previously studied only in the nearest-neighbor case -- survive in the presence of long-range dipolar interactions .	We also show how to use our approach to realize the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 and the Kitaev honeycomb models .
In an in-plane magnetized Pt/Co/Pt thin film with perpendicular interface anisotropy , we found excellent agreement between theoretical prediction with plausible parameters and experimental data measured using time resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect .	This agreement confirms that the time evolution of the anisotropy field , which is driven by the interaction between electrons and phonons , determines the magnetization precession completely .
Our proof uses a multivariate extension of the techniques introduced by Dehling , Durieu and Voln\'y \cite { DehDurVol09 } in the univariate case .	As an important technical ingredient , we prove a $ ( 2p ) $ th moment bound for partial sums in multiple mixing systems .
It generalises previous work of Perrin-Riou , Howard , and the author , to the context of the work of Yuan-Zhang-Zhang on the archimedean Gross-Zagier formula and of Waldspurger on toric periods .	We further construct analytic functions interpolating Heegner points in the anticyclotomic variables , and obtain a version of our formula for them .
Its saturation value at the maximum is about 10 T_c .	When the spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity is well stabilized at low temperatures in the optimal regime , the imaginary part of the antiferromagnetic spin susceptibility shows a very sharp resonance peak reminiscent of the 41 meV peak observed in the neutron scattering experiment on YBCO .
This important experimental result has been theoretically predicted by us almost 6 years ago on a basis of the phenomenological boson fermion model .	An earlier theoretical prediction on the basis of this model was that of a pseudogap in the electron DOS , setting in at some temperature T* and evolving into the superconducting gap upon approaching Tc .
The data were taken with the CMS detector for PbPb collisions at sqrt ( s [ NN ] ) = 2.76 TeV and pPb collisions at sqrt ( s [ NN ] ) = 5.02 TeV , covering a very wide range of multiplicity .	Factorization is observed to be broken as a function of both particle pt and eta .

This paper is devoted to the multigrid convergence analysis for the linear systems arising from the conforming linear finite element discretization of the second order elliptic equations with anisotropic diffusion .	The multigrid convergence behavior is known to strongly depend on whether the discretization grid is aligned or non-aligned with the anisotropic direction and analyses in the paper will be mainly focused on two-level algorithms .
We develop parallel and distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithms ; the former on shared memory machines with mini-batching , and the latter in a delayed update framework .	Whenever possible , we perform computations asynchronously , which helps attain speedups on multicore machines as well as in distributed environments .
It is found that in the context of the symmetries of the system , the electrostatic repulsion between the two is considerably increased as compared to the electrostatic repulsion between two bare charges in a dielectric .	This increase in repulsion , directly resulting from interactions between the symmetrical parts of the system , was found to be dependent on the magnitude of the charges and the separation between them .
In most cases the solution is explored via Monte Carlo sampling or variational methods .	Here we work further on the application of variational methods to clustering problems .
The gravitational interaction is scale-free in both Newtonian gravity and general theory of relativity .	The concept of self-similarity arises from this nature .

In particular , we are now able to confirm that many , but not all , lines of sight with shallow far-UV extinction curves and large values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio , $ R_V $ = $ A_V $ / $ E ( B-V ) $ -- characteristic of larger than average dust grains -- are associated with particularly low hydrogen molecular fractions ( $ f_ { \rm H2 } $ ) .	In the lines of sight with large $ R_V $ , there is in fact a wide range in molecular fractions , despite the expectation that the larger grains should lead to less H $ _2 $ formation .
It operates in the energy range 2.4-27 keV by using a silicon double reflection Bragg monochromator .

The data are compared with QCD predictions for various sets of parton distribution functions .	The cross section for jets with $ E_T & gt ; 200 $ GeV is significantly higher than current predictions based on O ( $ \alpha_s^3 $ ) perturbative QCD calculations .
Prior calculations of the bound states of this system famously revealed a zero-energy state that is its own conjugate , a Majorana fermion bound to the vortex core .	We calculate , not the bound states , but the scattering states of this system , and ask how the spin-momentum-locked massless Dirac form of the single-particle Hamiltonian , inherited from the TI surface , affects the cross section for scattering Bogoliubov quasiparticles from the vortex .
Such R-parity violation is very constrained , however , by resulting B and L violating signals , requiring couplings so small that LSPs will decay outside the detector in all but a few scenarios .	In theories with additional matter fields , R-parity can be broken collectively , such that R-parity is not broken by any single coupling , but only by an ensemble of couplings .
The detection of hadronic ionization signatures in spatial coincidence with gamma ray signatures can help to unambiguously identify supernova remnants as sources of cosmic ray protons .	Methods : In order to calculate hadronic signatures from cosmic ray-induced ionization for an examination of the origin of the observed gamma rays , the transport equation for cosmic ray protons propagating in a molecular cloud , including the relevant momentum loss processes , is solved analytically and the proton flux at any position in the cloud is determined .

The observed near decoupling of the four-gluon conditions permits a solution to the 2-and-3-point conditions within an effective one-parameter freedom .	There exists a parameter range in which one solution has all vertex coefficients real , as required for a physical solution , and a narrower range in which the transverse-gluon and massless-quark propagators both exhibit complex-conjugate pole pairs .
Using an established light-curve inversion algorithm , we study the evolution of the surface features based on Kepler space telescope light curves over a period of two years ( with a gap of .25 years ) .

Some RSGs are surrounded by circumstellar envelopes detectable by their dust and molecular and , in particular , maser emission .	This study consists of a search for maser emission from silicon monoxide ( SiO ) toward a significant number of RSGs that are members of massive stellar clusters , many of which have only recently been discovered .
This region will be a site of vortex pinning and creep .	Entrainment of the neutron superfluid with the crustal lattice leads to a requirement of superfluid moment of inertia associated with vortex creep in excess of the available crustal moment of inertia .
X-ray point-source detections are reported for 22 of 177 observed galaxies , down to a limit of f_ ( 0.5-8 keV ) ~ 5x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 , corresponding to a limiting luminosity of L_ ( 0.5-8 keV ) ~3x10^40 erg s^-1 .	With the majority of the X-ray sources attributed to AGNs of low-to-moderate levels ( L/L_Edd & gt ; ~10^-4 ) , we discuss the detection rate in the context of the occupation of AGNs to halos of this mass scale and redshift , and compare the structural/morphological properties between AGN-active and non-active galaxies of different rank and location within the group halos .
However , since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes fail , a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way while transferring as little data as possible across the network .	For an erasure coded system , a common practice to repair from a node failure is for a new node to download subsets of data stored at a number of surviving nodes , reconstruct a lost coded block using the downloaded data , and store it at the new node .

We study coherent structures in solar photospheric flows in a plage in the vicinity of the active region AR 10930 using the horizontal velocity data derived from Hinode/SOT magnetograms .	Eulerian and Lagrangian coherent structures are detected by computing the Q-criterion and the finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the velocity field , respectively .
We found that the amplitude of an even-numbered cycle of the number of large groups is smaller than that of its immediately following odd-numbered cycle .	This is consistent with the well known Gnevyshev and Ohl rule or G-O rule of solar cycles , generally described by using the Zurich sunspot number ( Rz ) .
The chiral/continuum extrapolation is performed through a simultaneous fit in the three variables ( m_\pi , q^2 , a ) using HMChPT formulae with additional O ( a^2 ) terms that parametrically account for the lattice spacing dependence .

Wavefunctions describing spacetime positions are modeled as complex disturbances of quasi-monochromatic radiation .	It is shown that the product of standard deviations of two position wavefunctions in the plane of a holographic light sheet is equal to the product of their normal separation and the Planck length .
We derive algebraic formulations and compute numerically the first contact time instants and the contact points of two moving CQMs in $ \mathbb R^3 $ .	Since it is difficult to process CCD of two CQMs in a direct manner because they are composed of semi-algebraic varieties , we break down the problem into subproblems of solving CCD of pairs of boundary elements of the CQMs .
By using local bottomgates , a p-n interface tilted with respect to the current direction can be formed .	We show that the p-n interface acts as a semi-transparent mirror in the bipolar regime and that the reflectance and transmittance of the p-n interface can be tuned by the gate voltages .
Then we hire temporal ( 1D ) convolutional neural network to learn hidden feature representations .	Finally , we use Multilayer Perceptron ( MLP ) to predict event spans .
Using 535 x 10^6 B-meson pairs collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB e+ e- collider , we measure branching fractions of ( 7.16 +/- 0.10 ( stat ) +/- 0.60 ( syst ) ) x 10^-4 for B+ - & gt ; J/psi K+ pi+ pi- and ( 4.31 +/- 0.20 ( stat ) +/- 0.50 ( syst ) ) x 10^-4 for B+ - & gt ; psi-prime K+ pi+ pi- .	We perform amplitude analyses to determine the resonant structure of the K+ pi+ pi- final state in B+ - & gt ; J/psi K+ pi+ pi- and B+ - & gt ; psi-prime K+ pi+ pi- and find that the K_1 ( 1270 ) is a prominent component of both decay modes .
We prove that finite volume approximations of order $ O ( h^ { k+1 } ) $ , with $ k $ integer , can be obtained after $ k $ corrections , starting with finite volume solution of order $ O ( h ) $ , by using the same matrix and changing only the second member of the original system .	This is done for general smooth second order elliptic problems in one dimension and for second order elliptic problems of the form $ -\Delta u+pu=f $ , with Dirichlet conditions .
For a fixed native geometry , small changes in the effective contact map may affect the folding times in a chance way and to the extent that is comparable to the shift in the folding times due to cooperativity .	The contact order controlls folding scenarios : the average times necessary to bring pairs of amino acids into their near native separations depend on the sequential distances within the pairs .
We use the mass profile we determined from the distribution and kinematics of the early-type galaxies ( i.e.ellipticals , excluding the brightest ones , and S0s ) outside substructures ; the latter were assumed to be on isotropic orbits , which is supported by the shape of their velocity distribution .	The projected distribution and kinematics of the galaxies of other types are used to search for equilibrium solutions in the gravitational potential derived from the early-type galaxies , using the method described by Binney and Mamon as implemented by Solanes and Salvador-Sole ' .

We use multi-scale SPH simulations to follow the inflow of gas from galactic scales to & lt ; 0.1pc , where the gas begins to resemble a traditional Keplerian accretion disk .	The key ingredients are gas , stars , black holes ( BHs ) , self-gravity , star formation , and stellar feedback .
A main assumption that is employed is functional dependence of the soliton potential , with the conformal factor in the first case , and with the warping function in the second .	The main result in the first case is a partial classification in dimension $ n\geq 4 $ .
We show that if the GRB outflow is proton loaded , spectral energy distribution of this emission is expected to sharply peak in 0.1-1~MeV energy band .	If the small pitch angle synchrotron emission efficiently cools relativistic particles of the outflow , its spectrum below the peak energy is a powerlaw with spectral index alpha ~ -1 , close to the typical spectral index of the time-resolved GRB spectra .
We prove that the algebraic condition $ |p-2| | & lt ; { \mathscr Im } { \mathscr A } \xi , \xi & gt ; | \leq 2 \sqrt { p-1 } & lt ; { \mathscr Re } { \mathscr A } \xi , \xi & gt ; $ ( for any $ \xi\in\mathbb { R } ^ { n } $ ) is necessary and sufficient for the $ L^ { p } $ -dissipativity of the Dirichlet problem for the differential operator $ \nabla^ { t } ( { \mathscr A } \nabla ) $ , where $ { \mathscr A } $ is a matrix whose entries are complex measures and whose imaginary part is symmetric .	This result is new even for smooth coefficients , when it implies a criterion for the $ L^ { p } $ -contractivity of the corresponding semigroup .
The current sample includes 92 RR Lyrae-six of them are new identifications-and 20 Anomalous Cepheids , one of which is new identification .	The analysis of the Bailey diagram shows that the luminosity amplitude of the first overtone component in double-mode variables is located along the long-period tail of regular first overtone variables , while the fundamental component is located along the short-period tale of regular fundamental variables .

Its main scientific target is the detection of high-energy ( TeV and beyond ) neutrinos from cosmic accelerators , as predicted by hadronic interaction models , and the measurement of the diffuse neutrino flux .	Its location allows for surveying a large part of the Galactic Plane , including the Galactic Centre .
The partial cribbing scheme is especially motivated by the additive noise Gaussian MAC since perfect cribbing results in the degenerated case of full cooperation between the encoders and requires an infinite entropy link .	We derive a single letter characterization of the capacity of the MAC with partial cribbing for the cases of causal and strictly causal partial cribbing .
Observations of T $ _C $ & lt ; T $ _ { C0 } $ in the comparatively more disordered { \alpha } -A $ _x $ ( S ) $ _y $ TiNX compounds are modeled as pair-breaking by remote Coulomb scattering from the A $ _x $ cations , which attenuates exponentially with increasing { \zeta } .	The T $ _ { C0 } $ values calculated for nine A $ _x $ ( S ) $ _y $ MNCl compounds , shown to be optimal , agree with the measured T $ _C $ to within experimental error .
Protein molecules often self-assemble by means of non-covalent physical bonds to form extended filaments , such as amyloids , F-actin , intermediate filaments , and many others .	The kinetics of filament growth is limited by the disassembly rate , at which inter-protein bonds break due to the thermal motion .
We find matrix models encoding the instanton part of Nekrasov partition functions , whose measure , to the leading order in $ \epsilon_2 $ expansion , is given by the Vandermonde determinant to the power $ \beta=-\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2 $ .	An additional , trigonometric deformation of the measure arises in five-dimensional theories .
The system has some scaling symmetries which are used in our analysis of the solutions .	We find exact solutions , i.e. , regular AdS solution for $ k=1 $ and a massless black hole solution for $ k=-1 $ .
In this { \it Letter } , we present the results of an analysis of a RXTE observation of a Z source GX~5-1 , where the 6 Hz NBO is simultaneously detected along with a HBO at 51 Hz .	The variations in the intensity and the associated power density spectrum indicate that the HBO and NBO are strongly coupled , originating from the same location in the inner accretion disk .
We use the helicity amplitude method to calculate the cross section formula .	We find that for the light quark jet production the diffractive process is related to the differential off-diagonal gluon distribution function in the proton .
The first errors are statistical , the second systematic .	These results are obtained with a sample of 913 $ \Sigma_c^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \pi^- $ decays and 1110 $ \Sigma_c^++ \to \Lambda_c^+ \pi^+ $ decays .
A parabolic-parabolic ( Patlak- ) Keller-Segel model in up to three space dimensions with nonlinear cell diffusion and an additional nonlinear cross-diffusion term is analyzed .

Our estimate of the thermal pressure in the O VI-rich thick disk/halo gas , p_ { th } /k = 6500^ { +2500 } _ { -2600 } K cm^ { -3 } , suggests that the thick disk/halo is more highly pressurized than would be expected from theoretical analyses .	The ratios of C IV to O VI to O VII to O VIII , intensities were compared with those predicted by theoretical models .
It is shown that all non-negative real numbers are l^2-Betti numbers , and that `` many '' ( for example all non-negative algebraic ) real numbers are l^2-Betti numbers of simply connected manifolds with respect to a free cocompact action .	Also an explicit example is constructed which leads to a simply connected manifold with a transcendental l^2-Betti number with respect to an action of the threefold direct product of the lamplighter group Z/2 wr Z .
Since the critical temperature in the long-range Ising model is proportional to the number of spins , a ferromagnetic order can be formed at a temperature of tens of millikelvin for a sample with $ \sim10^4 $ nitrogen-vacancy centers .	This method may provide a new platform for studying many-body physics using qubit systems .
Our analysis is based on a qualitative coding for approximately 3000 tweets in Arabic and English from the Syrian social bot that was active for 35 weeks on Twitter before it was shutdown .

In an appendix we indicate how one might extend this to qurves over non-algebraically closed fields .	Further , we classify all finitely generated groups G such that the group algebra lG is an l-qurve .
Particularly interesting is that such a high temperature superconductivity occurs in a single-layer FeSe system that is considered as a key building block of the Fe-based superconductors .	Understanding the origin of high temperature superconductivity in such a strictly two-dimensional FeSe system is crucial to understanding the superconductivity mechanism in Fe-based superconductors in particular , and providing key insights on how to achieve high temperature superconductivity in general .
We demonstrate that the technique is free of radio bias and thus applicable regardless of radio detections .	For observations made with a moderate beamsize ( ~18 '' ) , this technique identifies ~85 per cent of SMG counterparts .
In this paper we discuss our new radio-selected gravitational lens sample , JVAS/CLASS , in order to test and constrain this proposition .	We have obtained ground-based and HST images of all multiple-image lens systems in our sample and in 12 cases out of 12 we find the lensing galaxies in the optical and/or near infrared .
In comparison to random or round-robin partner matching , we find that the average payoffs attained with preferential partner selection tend to be more narrowly confined to a few isolated payoff regions .	Most ecologies evolve to essentially full cooperative behavior , but when agents are intolerant of defections , or when the costs of refusal and social isolation are small , we also see the emergence of wallflower ecologies in which all agents are socially isolated .
This is a necessary condition for the neutrino vacuum to be able to support the wormhole geometry .	In this respect , neutrino vacuum behaves like electromagnetic one and differs from the conformal scalar vacuum which does not seem to violate energy conditions for slowly varied metric automatically , but requires self-consistent wormhole solution for this .
A detailed map of how and where to target stable Kerr frequency combs in the parameter space defined by the frequency detuning and the pump power is provided .	Moreover , the work presented also includes the organization of various dynamical regimes in terms of bifurcation points of higher co-dimension in regions of parameter space that were previously unexplored in the Lugiato-Lefever equation .
This effect can be attributed to the fact that the fluctuation spectrum for closed geometries is gapped , inhibiting the thermal excitation of modes at low temperatures .	By contrast , open geometries support a thermal excitation of the low-lying modes in the gapless spectrum already at low temperatures .
We will present discontinuous Galerkin ( dG ) methods that allow for discontinuities across the subdomain ( patch ) boundaries .	The required interface conditions are weakly imposed by the dG terms associated with the boundary of the sub-domains .
In this paper , we propose a generalized version of the Rashmi-Shah-Kumar Minimum-Storage-Regenerating ( RSK-MSR ) codes based on the product-matrix framework .	For any $ ( n , k , d ) $ such that $ d \geq 2k-2 $ and $ d \leq n-1 $ , we can directly construct an $ ( n , k , d ) $ MSR code without constructing a larger MSR code and shortening of the larger MSR code .
We adopt a simple Roche model to determine the envelope structure of the primary , assumed massive and centrally condensed , and use the results to calculate the flux .	As for single rotating stars , gravity darkening reduces the flux along the stellar equator of the primary , but , unlike for rotating stars , we find that gravity brightening enhances the flux in a region around the stellar poles .
Considering longitudinal waves , the exact dispersion relation in each homogeneous layer is first obtained and subsequently used within the transfer matrix method to derive an approximate dispersion relation for the overall periodic medium .	The result is an amplitude-dependent elastic band structure that may be used to elucidate the interplay between the waveform steepening and spreading effects that emerge due to the nonlinearity and periodicity , respectively .
Remarkably , it is possible to generate entanglement even in the absence of direct interactions : provided that which path information is erased , weak spin-state dependent light scattering can be used to project two distant spins onto a maximally entangled state upon detection of a single photon .	Even though this approach is necessarily probabilistic , successful generation of entanglement is heralded by the photon detection event .
Based on the analytical derivation of the optimal IS Bernoulli distribution , with explicit calculation of the variance of the corresponding IS estimator , two novel algorithms for fast-simulation of linear block codes are proposed .	For sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios ( SNRs ) one of the proposed algorithm is SNR-invariant , i.e.the IS estimator does not depend on the cross-over probability of the channel .
In this article we review the current experimental status of searches for rare decays in charmed hadrons .	While the Standard Model rates are yet to be reached , current experimental limits are already putting constraints on New Physics models .

We combine these data with re-analyzed archival Spitzer Space Telescope data to construct a SED for the pulsar , and quantify the contamination from the knot .
The association of filaments with protostellar objects has made these structures a priority target in star formation studies .	The datasets of the Herschel Galactic Cold Cores Key Programme allow for a statistical study of filaments with a wide range of intrinsic and environmental characteristics .
Our algorithms have respective running times $ O ( n^2\log n ) $ when $ P $ is monotonic and $ O ( n^2\log^2 n ) $ when $ P $ is an arbitrary simple polyline .	Finally , we examine the application of our algorithms iteratively in a bootstrapping technique to define a smooth robust non-parametric approximation of the original sequence .
We call a graph $ H $ $ k $ -good if the $ k $ -tuple $ ( H , H , \dots , H ) $ is good , and $ H $ is good if it is $ k $ -good for every $ k $ .	Bialostocki and Gy\'arf\'as proved that matchings are good and asked whether every acyclic $ H $ is good .
In the present paper , lattice ordered pseudo-effect algebras are considered as possible algebraic non-commutative analogs of non-commutative non-standard reasoning .	To this aim , the interplay among conjunction , implication and negation connectives is studied .
As a consequence , Sobolev mappings from an open set of the plane , taking values in the first Heisenberg group and that have almost everywhere maximal rank must have images with positive 3-dimensional Hausdorff measure with respect to the sub-Riemannian distance of the Heisenberg group .	This provides a complete solution to a question raised in a paper by Z. M. Balogh , R. Hoefer-Isenegger and J. T. Tyson .
To investigate this proposal , we compare the metallicity of the hosts of LGRBs , broad-lined Type Ic ( Ic-bl ) supernovae ( SNe ) , and Type II SNe to each other and to the metallicity distribution of star-forming galaxies using the SDSS to represent galaxies in the local universe and the TKRS for galaxies at intermediate redshifts .	The differing metallicity distributions of the LGRB hosts and the star formation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicity preference of LGRBs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation between star-formation and metallicity , but rather must be overwhelmingly due to the astrophysics of the LGRBs themselves .
NGC 4945 hosts one of the brightest AGN in the sky above 10 keV , but it is only visible through its reflected/scattered emission below 10 keV , due to absorption by a column density of ~4\times10^24 cm-2 .	A new Suzaku campaign of 5 observations spanning ~6 months , together with past XMM-Newton and Chandra observations , show a remarkable constancy ( within & lt ; 10 % ) of the reflected component .
Using methods of conformal partial wave analysis , we present a general procedure to study conformal four-point functions in terms of exchanges of scalar and tensor fields .	The logarithmic terms in the four-point functions are connected to the anomalous dimensions of the exchanged fields .
Previous studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss function or a strongly convex regularizer , making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization .	We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is bilinear in primal and dual variables .
Analytical results are obtained by perturbation theory in the limit $ \sigma_ { xx } \gg 1 $ .	For mesoscopic systems the conduction process is dominated by diffusion but we show that , due to the lack of time-reversal symmetry , the boundary condition for diffusion is altered at the reflecting edges .
For the XXZ model we discuss in detail the relation between our results , the phenomenological theory of spin diffusion , and measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation rate in spin chain compounds .	Furthermore , we study the Haldane-Shastry model where the current operator is also orthogonal to the set of conserved quantities associated with integrability but becomes itself conserved in the thermodynamic limit .
It is then shown that all known examples of fractional supersymmetry can be understood in this formulation .	However , the incorporation of three dimensional fractional supersymmetry in this framework needs some care .
Our best estimate of the renormalization scale independent B-parameter is $ \hat { B } _ { B_d } = 1.03 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.18 $ .	$ \hat { B } _ { B_d } $ has been obtained by using `` boosted '' perturbation theory to calculate the renormalization constants which relate the matrix elements of the lattice operators to the corresponding amplitudes in the continuum .
Serre 's K\ '' ahlerian analogue of the Weil conjectures carries over as well .	Generalizing a construction of Looijenga and Lunts one obtains possibly infinite dimensional Lie algebras attached to K\ '' ahler-Riemann foliations .
This provides a statistical model of the zeta function that involves the primes in a natural way .	We then employ the model in a heuristic calculation of the moments of the modulus of the zeta function on the critical line .
Timmes , Brown & amp ; Truran found that metallicity variations could theoretically account for a 25 % variation in the mass of 56Ni synthesized in Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) , and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter in observed SN Ia luminosities .	Higher-metallicity progenitors are more neutron-rich , producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive 56Ni .
It is found that the density profile is weakly affected by the edge density , it broadens when the current or the temperature are decreased while the connection length has the opposite effect .	The statistics of the turbulence is relatively insensitive to variations of all the edge parameters and show a certain degree of universality .
Herein , $ g ( \cdot ) $ is a continuous function on $ \mathbb { R } $ and $ \ { a_n\ } $ is a sequence of self-normalizing constants .	As the innovation $ \ { \varepsilon_i\ } $ is usually not observable , the residual marked empirical process $ \hat { \alpha } _n ( x ) =\frac { 1 } { n } \sum_ { i=1 } ^ng ( X_i/a_n ) I ( \hat { \varepsilon } _i\l eq x ) , x\in\mathbb { R } , $ is considered instead , where $ \hat { \varepsilon } _i=X_i-\hat { \beta } X_ { i-1 } $ and $ \hat { \beta } $ is a consistent estimate of $ \beta. $ In particular , via the martingale decomposition of stationary process and the stochastic integral result of Jakubowski ( Ann.Probab .
Our study reveals the relevance of two factors : the effect of local variations of the striped patterns within defect-free domains and the presence of both point-like and extended defects .	Taking into account these two aspects we are able to identify the characteristic length scale selected during the quench and to relate it to the density of defects .
The class of automata that we study in this article has none of these properties .	Their cell structure is weaker , as it does not come with a multiplication , and they are far from being p-Fermat , even weakly .
A linear increase of the current with voltage is obtained up to a threshold value at which current saturation takes place .	We show that the activated behavior , the voltage threshold and the saturation current can all be quantitatively explained by considering a single optical phonon mode with energy $ \hbar \Omega \approx 8 $ meV .
These calculations have been made possible by the use of highly optimized polynomial time modular algorithms and a total of more than 150000 CPU hours on computer clusters .	For $ \chi^ { ( 5 ) } $ 10000 terms of the series are calculated { \it modulo } a single prime , and have been used to find the linear ODE satisfied by $ \chi^ { ( 5 ) } $ { \it modulo } a prime .
We investigate holographic superconductors in asympototically geometries with hyperscaling violation .	The mass of the scalar field decouples from the UV dimension of the dual scalar operator and can be chosen as negative as we want , without disturbing the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound .
These topics are used when submitting a document to a digital mathematics library and to perform searches in a library .	The latter are refined by the use of these topics as they allow a precise classification of the mathematics area this document addresses .
A topological qubit subspace is defined using Majorana fermions which emerge in a network of atomic Kitaev one-dimensional wires .	We show how braiding can be efficiently implemented in this setup and propose a direct way to demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of Majorana fermions via a single parity measurement .
N-Reggeized gluon states in Quantum Chromodynamics are described by BKP equation .	In order to solve this equation for N & gt ; 3 particles the Q-Baxter operator method is used .
Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations predict that the average opacity of the Ly-alpha forest should increase in the neighborhood of galaxies because galaxies form in dense environments .	Recent observations ( Adelberger et al .
For a given sensor , the higher the portion of channels with unconditionally secure key exchange the higher the trust value .	We give a brief introduction to unconditionally secured key exchange concepts and mention current trust measures in sensor networks .
In hydrodynamics the existence of an entropy current with non-negative divergence is related to the existence of a time-independent solution in a static background .	Recently there has been a proposal for how to construct an entropy current from the equilibrium partition function of the fluid system .
We calculate the quantum Cram\'er -- Rao bound for the sensitivity with which one or several parameters , encoded in a general single-mode Gaussian state , can be estimated .	This includes in particular the interesting case of mixed Gaussian states .
This strategy allows us to establish the lower semicontinuity result without an Alberti-type theorem in $ \BD ( \Omega ) $ , which is not available at present .	We also include existence and relaxation results for variational problems in $ \BD ( \Omega ) $ , as well as a complete discussion of some differential inclusions for the symmetrized gradient in two dimensions .
Using Luna 's slice theorem , we give criteria for $ p_m^* $ to be an isomorphism for all $ m $ , and we prove this when $ G=SL_n $ , $ GL_n $ , $ SO_n $ , or $ Sp_ { 2n } $ and $ V $ is a sum of copies of the standard representation and its dual , such that $ V//G $ is smooth or a complete intersection .	We classify all representations of $ \mathbb { C } ^* $ for which $ p^*_ { \infty } $ is surjective or an isomorphism .
The attractor dimension at the transition to complete synchronization in a network of chaotic units with time-delayed couplings is investigated .	In particular , we determine the Kaplan-Yorke dimension from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents for iterated maps and for two coupled semiconductor lasers .
Using a time series model to mimic an observed time series has a long history .	However , with regard to this objective , conventional estimation methods for discrete-time dynamical models are frequently found to be wanting .
After discussing the flavor decomposition and the $ P_T $ -dependence of the asymmetry obtained in the previous analysis at the center-of-mass energy $ \sqrt { S } =62.4 $ and 200 GeV , we will give a prediction for the asymmetry at $ \sqrt { S } =500 $ GeV and also for the $ \eta $ -meson production .	We found slightly smaller asymmetry at $ \sqrt { S } =500 $ GeV for $ \pi^ { \pm,0 } $ and $ K^+ $ compared with those at the lower energies .
Relativistic invariance is incorporated within the framework of Poincare invariant quantum mechanics , and presented in some detail .	Based on a Malfliet-Tjon type interaction , observables for elastic and break-up scattering are calculated up to projectile energies of 1 GeV .
For example , building predictive models with high dimensional data and heterogeneous population is a non-trivial task .	Co-clusters extracted from such data , which shows similar pattern in both the dimension , can be used for a more accurate predictive model building .
This finally lends itself to non-zero probability of neutrino helicity flip .	While for neutrino flavour oscillation we have derived general results for oscillation phase , which subsequently have been applied to different gravity theories .
Furthermore , clear charge disproportionation is observed for the pseudo cubic and double-layer systems , while not in the single-layer system .	These results indicate that the orbital shape and charge disproportionation are sensitive to the dimension of Mn-O network .
Based on our structural data we perform a bond-valence calculation for the vanadium sites in the low temperature state .	Due to an asymmetric charge ordering we obtain only two different vanadium valences despite the three inequivalent sites .
We divided the sample in several mass-redshift bins to obtain stacked galaxy spectra with an improved S/N .	We exploited emission-line diagnostic diagrams to separate AGN from star-forming galaxies .
We formulate a simple theory of these shape transitions , which is adapted from a calculation originally developed by Binder and coworkers [ { \em J . Chem.Phys . }	{ \bf 120 } , 5293 ( 2004 ) ] .
However , the recovery of higher-order multispectra is difficult from realistic data due to their complex response to inhomogeneous noise and partial sky coverage , which are often difficult to model analytically .	A traditional alternative is to use one-point cumulants of various orders , which collapse the information present in a multispectrum to one number .
While this conjecture implies that smooth functions are easy to compute in the simplest computational model , to date no non-trivial upper bounds were known for such functions in any computational model , including unrestricted Boolean circuits .	Even a bound on the description length of such functions better than the trivial $ 2^n $ does not seem to have been known .
We investigate the astrometric effects of stellar surface structures as a practical limitation to ultra-high-precision astrometry , e.g.in the context of exoplanet searches , and to quantify the expected effects in different regions of the HR-diagram .	Stellar surface structures are likely to produce fluctuations in the integrated flux and radial velocity of the star , as well as a variation of the observed photocentre , i.e.astrometric jitter , and closure phase .
They affect social interactions , but do not appear in the surveillance logs which record the participants of the social interactions .	Discovering the covert nodes is defined as identifying the suspicious logs where the covert nodes would appear if the covert nodes became overt .
Our presentation is pedagogical .	Thus , in addition to providing a bird 's eye view of the present status of the subject , the article should also serve as a vehicle to enter the field and explore it in detail .
For quantum cosmology to be part of empirical science , it must allow for a systematic framework in which corrections to well-tested classical equations can be derived , with any ambiguities and ignorance sufficiently parameterized .	As in particle and condensed-matter physics , a successful viewpoint is one of effective theories , adapted to specific issues one encounters in quantum cosmology .
When $ \tau/2\pi $ , where $ \tau $ is the kick period , is very close to a rational number , the localization length is larger than the typical localization length .	We analytically prove anomalous localization and confirm it by numerical calculations .
First , the mean number $ N ( R ) $ of LRGs within completely surveyed LRG-centered spheres of comoving radius $ R $ is shown to be proportional to $ R^3 $ at radii greater than $ R\sim 70 h^ { -1 } \mathrm { Mpc } $ .	The test has the virtue that it does not rely on the assumption that the LRG sample has a finite mean density ; its results show , however , that there \emph { is } such a mean density .
Stokes profiles of Zeeman-sensitive lines of neutral iron in the visible and infrared spectral ranges emerging from the simulated atmosphere have been calculated in order to study their relation to the relevant physical quantities and compare with observational results .	We have analyzed the dependence of the Stokes-I line strength and width as well as of the Stokes-V signal and asymmetries on the magnetic field strength .
Surrounded by a compact dusty , gaseous disk , this little-studied late-G ( or early-K ) type star emits about 75 % of its detected energy flux at infrared wavelengths .	Evidence for accretion of gas in conjunction with narrow bi-polar jets and Herbig-Haro objects is apparently consistent with classification of BP Psc as a pre-main sequence star , as postulated in most previous studies .
We then show that the concurrence monotones provide bounds on quantum information tasks .	As an example , we discuss their applications to remote entanglement distributions ( RED ) such as entanglement swapping and remote preparation of bipartite entangled states ( RPBES ) .
We employ Spitzer/IRS spectral mapping observations of the northern part of W49A to investigate the mid-infrared ( MIR ) spatial appearance of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) bands , PAH plateau features , atomic lines and continuum emission .	We examine the spatial variations of the MIR emission components in slices through two of the ultra compact-HII ( UC-HII ) regions .
We consider a microscopic theory of F/S/F trilayers with metallic or insulating ferromagnets .	The trilayer with metallic ferromagnets is controlled by the formation of non local pair correlations among the two ferromagnets which do not exist with insulating ferromagnets .
Moreover it is shown that the constants can be calculated explicitly in special cases ( i.e.for compact operators ) .	Furthermore , the techniques also can be used to establish linear convergence for related methods such as the iterative thresholding algorithm for joint sparsity and the accelerated gradient projection method .
Traditional end-to-end congestion control mechanisms assume data transferring happens between each pair user .	In contrast , in a P2P network , many peers may locally keep a copy of a specific data object .
We reappraise some of the hybrid classical-quantum models proposed in the literature with the goal of retrieving some of their common characteristics .	In particular , first , we analyze in detail the Peres-Terno argument regarding the inconsistency of hybrid quantizations of the Sudarshan type .
A fit to the infrared coronal lines places strong constraints on the properties of the unseen ionising source .	We find the best fit comes from using a 220,000 K hydrogen-deficient central star model atmosphere , indicating that the central star of this PN may have undergone a late thermal pulse .
These simulations include explicit treatment of metal-line cooling in addition to dust and self-shielding , $ \mathrm { H_ { 2 } } $ based star formation .	The 4 simulated halos have masses ranging from a few times $ 10^ { 10 } $ to nearly $ 10^ { 12 } $ solar masses .
The technique is based on preparation of an atomic ensemble in a state with a desired number of atomic spin excitations , which is later converted into a photon pulse .	Spatio-temporal control over the pulses is obtained by exploiting long-lived coherent memory for photon states and electromagnetically induced transparency ( EIT ) in an optically dense atomic medium .
We used the wave diameter and leading edge methods and measured the CME heights for a set of 32 metric type II bursts from solar cycle 24 .	We minimized the projection effects by making the measurements from a view that is roughly orthogonal to the direction of the ejection .
We characterize Cohen-Macaulay , l-Cohen-Macaulay , Buchsbaum , and Gorenstein* complexes X , and also orientable manifolds in terms of the enriched modules .	We introduce the notion of girth for simplicial complexes and make a conjecture relating the girth to invariants of the simplicial complex .
We first consider a model independent SUSY breaking hidden sector on one boundary and generic chiral matter on another .	Using the definition of GGM , the effects of the hidden sector are contained in a set of global symmetry current correlator functions and is mediated through the bulk .
We study the photon self-energy for the in-medium photon in a three-flavor color superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field .	At strong magnetic field , the quark dynamics becomes $ ( 1+1 ) $ -dimensional and the self-energy tensor only has longitudinal components .
The proposed algorithm has data-selective updates , a variable forgetting factor and performs one iteration per update to reduce the computational complexity .	The updated parameters construct a space of feasible solutions that enforce the constraints .
The derived abundances of s-elements nicely agree with theoretical s-process nucleosynthesis predictions during the AGB phase .	However , the figures obtained for Li and the 12C/13C ratios might imply the existence of a non-standard mixing process during the AGB phase operating preferentially in low mass stars .
Two aspects relevant to low-frequency studies are particularly emphasized .	First , the method is generalized beyond the Cowling approximation in order to fully account for the effects of self-gravitation .
We present additional optical spectroscopic identifications of sources identified in three deep ASCA GIS fields which also form part of a deep ROSAT survey .	In total , 26 ASCA sources have been detected down to a 2-10keV flux limit of S = 5e-14 erg/cm/s .
For filling factors $ \nu & lt ; 1 $ , there is a gap in the current-voltage characteristics centered about $ V=0 $ , followed by a tunneling peak at $ \sim 6 $ ~mV .	Both features have been observed before and have been attributed to electron-electron interactions within a layer .
The two-component potential of the many-electron system of interest is constructed of a scalar external potential and a collinear magnetic field ( coupled only with the spin operator ) .	Various equilibrium characteristics of two systems are defined and investigated .
Analysis of the rotation measure ( RM ) data shows cluster-generated Faraday RM excess out to ~0.5 Mpc from cluster centers .	The results , combined with RM imaging of cluster-embedded sources and ROSAT X-ray profiles indicates that the hot intergalactic gas within these `` normal '' clusters is permeated with a high filling factor by magnetic fields at levels of & lt ; |B| & gt ; = 5-10 ( l/10 kpc ) ^ { -1/2 } microGauss , where l is the field correlation length .
It will be shown that perturbative treatments must be discarded , and replaced by a more sophisticated formalism where the dynamics of the nanomagnet and the nuclei that couple to it are treated together from the beginning .	After a critical review of the theoretical predictions and their experimental verification , we continue with a set of experimental results that challenge our present understanding , and outline the importance of filling also this last gap in the theory .
We investigate clustering of malignant glioma cells .	\emph { In vitro } experiments in collagen gels identified a cell line that formed clusters in a region of low cell density , whereas a very similar cell line ( which lacks an important mutation ) did not cluster significantly .
This paper examines the onset of the viscous overstability in dense particulate rings .	First , we formulate a dense gas kinetic theory that is applicable to the Saturnian system .
We study the probability distribution $ F ( u ) $ of the maximum of smooth Gaussian fields defined on compact subsets of $ \R^d $ having some geometric regularity .	Our main result is a general formula for the density of $ F $ .
Transparent media exhibiting anomalous dispersion have been of considerable interest since Wang , Kuzmich , and Dogariu [ Nature { \bf 406 } , 277 ( 2000 ) ] first observed light propagate with superluminal and negative group velocities without absorption .	Here , we propose an atomic model exhibiting these properties , based on a generalization of amplification without inversion in a five-level DIGS system .
Using VLT/ISAAC , we detected 2 candidate counterparts to the bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28 , one bright and one faint , within the X-ray error circles of XMM-Newton and Chandra .	In determining the spectral types of the counterparts we applied 3 different extinction corrections ; one for an all-sky value , one for a Galactic Bulge value and one for a local value .
Conditions corresponding to the approximation are given for the case of harmonic driving force .	The Born series of the harmonic forced oscillation case are derived by directly applying the approximation to the LTI system or by transforming the LTI system to Helmholtz equation prior to doing the approximation .
In this paper a new multiscale modeling technique is proposed .	It relies on a recently introduced measure-theoretic approach , which allows to manage the microscopic and the macroscopic scale under a unique framework .
The Sr II spectrum is very strong , and the resonance lines show similar core-nib structure to the stronger Ca K line .	We place only loose constraints on a model .
We also observe that from our pregeometric perspective it is rather natural to contemplate a spacetime whose pregeometric picture is based on the phase-space coordinates ( fields ) of a string .	The fact that such `` stringspaces '' essentially provide spacetime points with extendedness is relevant for the fuzziness of geometric spacetime observables in ways that we preliminarily characterize through an analysis of the distance observable on a two-dimensional stringspace and through the observation that by implementing the Amati-Ciafaloni-Veneziano/Gross-Mende uncertainty relation in the phase space of the pregeometric string one could have stringspaces with a novel type of fuzzy coordinates .
The difference in phase shift between the orthogonally polarized components of this scattered emission can cause a transformation of linear to circular polarization .	Methods : We compared linear polarization maps from dust continuum , obtained with PolKa at APEX , and $ ^ { 12 } $ CO ( $ J=2\rightarrow1 $ ) and ( $ J=1\rightarrow0 $ ) from the IRAM 30-m telescope and found no consistency between the two sets of polarization maps .
HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies , from 100 to 857 GHz .	To get the best accuracy on the calibration on such a large range , two different photometric calibration schemes have to be used .
The model is two-dimensional and has two different `` amino acids '' .	Using numerical simulations of all chains containing eight or ten monomers , we examine the sequence dependence at a fixed temperature .
Our calculations reproduce well the trends in high pressure behavior of the structural parameters .	The present results show that the compressibility of LiN $ _3 $ crystal is anisotropic and the crystallographic b-axis is more compressible when compared to a- and c-axis which is also consistent with the experiment .
We test our theory and perform numerical bifurcation analysis on two models which are known to generate auxin patterns for biologically plausible parameter values .	In the same parameter regimes , we find that realistic tissues are capable of generating a multitude of stationary patterns , with a variable number of auxin peaks , that can be selected by different initial conditions or by quasi-static changes in the active transport parameter .
The set of species present undergoes long-term evolution due to speciation and extinction events .	We summarize results obtained on the macro-evolutionary dynamics of speciations and extinctions , and on the statistical properties of the food webs that are generated by the model .
Deuterium chemistry and spin states of H $ _2 $ and H $ _3^+ $ isotopologues are included in this primarily gas-phase chemical model .	We investigate dependence of deuterium chemistry on model parameters : density ( $ n_ { \rm H } $ ) , temperature , cosmic ray ionization rate , and gas-phase depletion factor of heavy elements ( $ f_ { \rm D } $ ) .
We show that the theory always develops instabilities unless the linearized nonsymmetric lagrangian reduces to a particular simple form .	This form contains a gauge invariant kinetic term , a mass term for the antisymmetric metric-field and a coupling with the Ricci curvature scalar .
A manifestly $ N=2 $ supersymmetric coset formalism is introduced to describe integrable hierarchies .	It is applied to analyze the super-NLS equation .
This graph functional originated from the problem of source coding in information theory and was introduced by J. K\ '' { o } rner in 1973 .	Although the notion of graph entropy has its roots in information theory , it was proved to be closely related to some classical and frequently studied graph theoretic concepts .
The HI detected , yet deficient galaxies show a strong correlation in their HI properties with projected distance from the cluster center .	The most strongly HI deficient ( HI Def & gt ; 0.4 ) galaxies are located inside a radius of 30 arcmin ( aprox 0.6 Mpc ) from the center of Coma , roughly the extent of the central X-ray emission .
Magnetic field plays a crucial role in the evolution of these $ r $ -modes and hence the evolution of the neutron star itself .	An attempt is made here to investigate the role of magnetic field in the evolution of $ r $ -mode instability and detectibility of gravitational waves emitted by a newly born , hot and rapidly and differentially rotating neutron star .
About half of the lines and half of the species ( in particular N2H+ , SiO , C34S , DCN , DNC , DCO+ , HC3N , H2CO , H2CS , SO2 ) have not been previously reported in S255IR and partly in S255N at high angular resolution .	Our data reveal several new clumps in the S255IR and S255N areas by their millimeter wave continuum emission .
It appears that SFE is well-defined for arbitrary electromagnetic fields .	It should be possible to calculate the dissipative pulsar magnetosphere and resolve the magnetic separatrix using SFE .
For this purpose , a microcanonical version of the heatbath algorithm is implemented .	The finite size behaviour of the loop in the curve describing the inverse temperature versus energy density is discussed , emphasizing that the extrema do not have the meaning of van der Waals-like `` spinodal points '' separating metastable from unstable states , but rather describe the onset of heterophase states : droplet/bubble evaporation/condensation transitions .
As examples we apply the theory to several models of current interest in the study of Bose-Einstein condensates , which have been successfully created using ultracold dilute atomic gases .	The first model we introduce describes Josephson tunneling between two coupled Bose-Einstein condensates .
We relate uniformly rigid spaces to their associated classical rigid spaces , and we transfer various constructions and results from rigid geometry to the uniformly rigid setting .	In particular , we prove an analog of Kiehl 's patching theorem for coherent ideals , and we define the uniformly rigid generic fiber of a formal scheme of formally finite type .
In this study , their combinatorial interpretation is given and their application on sorting is examined .	Given an array of n integer keys each in [ 1 , n ] , if it is allowed to modify the keys in the range [ -n , n ] , idempotent permutations make it possible to obtain linearly ordered arrangement of the keys in O ( n ) time using only 4log ( n ) bits , setting the theoretical lower bound of time and space complexity of sorting .
In other words , the pertubation series for $ F ( x ) $ , due to analyticity imperative , may change its form turning into an { \it asymptotic expansion \`a la Erd\'elyi over a nonpower set } $ \ { { \cal A } _n ( x ) \ } $ .	We analyse sets of functions $ \ { { \cal A } _n ( x ) \ } $ and discuss properties of non-power expansion arising with their relations to feeble loop and scheme dependence of observables .
We developed a new type of AC microcalorimeter based on a modulated-bath technique for measuring the specific heat of small microgram samples in the temperature range from 30-300 K , and tested it in magnetic fields up to 14 T. The device is built from a modified commercial Peltier element .	The temperature of its top plate can be modulated periodically by Peltier effect , so that the oscillation is symmetrical about the temperature of the main bath .
In this model , assigning orthogonal training sequences to all users will incur a substantial overhead to the overall network , and is even impossible when the number of users is large .	Therefore , in this paper , we introduce the notion of local orthogonality , under which the training sequence of a user is orthogonal to those of the other users in its neighborhood .
Over the past two decades , the liklihood of this has risen and fallen as more and more data has become available from laboratory experiments and the latest telescopes .	Hot dark matter models were studied in the late 1970s and early 1980s , and there was considerable interest in cold plus hot dark matter models for a few years in the mid-1990s .
In the case of mesoscopic renormalization one may treat the dynamical defect as coupled with Friedel oscillations originated by the other defects , both static and mobile .	Such coupling lifts the energy degeneracy of the states of the dynamical defects giving different mesoscopic contribution to resistance , and provides a new model for the fluctuator as for the object originated by the electronic mesoscopic disorder rather than by the structural one .
We measure both a characteristic size of the emission region and the emission sizes for individual pulses .	Our results imply that the radio emission altitude for the Vela pulsar at this frequency is less than 340 km .
All three absorbers show similar metallicities ( -1.3 to -1.5 dex ) , and dust depletion of Fe , Ni , and Mn .	Two of the absorbers show supersolar [ S/Zn ] and [ Si/Zn ] .
The broad line widths of the H52 $ \alpha $ line are probably related to motions in the ionized gas rather than pressure broadening .	A number of models have been proposed to explain the long lifetime of UC HII regions , including the photoevaporated disk model proposed by Hollenbach et al . ( 1994 ) .
Here we demonstrate that exchange interactions alone can achieve high-order decoupling against general noise in the 3-qubit DFS .	We present decoupling sequences for a 3-qubit DFS coupled to classical and quantum baths and evaluate the performance of the sequences through numerical simulations .
Efforts to modulate the electronic properties of atomically thin crystalline nanoribbons requires precise control over their morphology .	Here , we perform atomistic simulations on freestanding graphene nanoribbons ( GNRs ) to first identify the minimal shapes , and then employ a core-edge framework based on classical plate theory to quantify the width dependence in more general systems .
We investigate the dependence of pulse amplitudes of accreting millisecond pulsars on the masses of the neutron stars .	Because the pulsation amplitudes are suppressed as the neutron stars become more massive , the probability of detection of pulsations decreases in systems that have been accreting for a long time .
As a variational wave function , we consider a Gutzwiller projected wave function for a staggered spin and/or orbital ordered state .	We find a ferromagnetic phase with staggered orbital order around quarter-filling , i.e. , electron number n=1 per site , and an antiferromagnetic phase without orbital order around half-filling n=2 .
Stars of 15 and 25 solar masses with both primordial and solar composition were modeled .	The zero metallicity supernova progenitors were compact blue stars and the amount of Rayleigh-Taylor induced mixing in them was greatly reduced compared with what was seen in the red supergiants with solar metallicity .
The differential cross section with radiative corrections due to emission of virtual and soft real photons calculated to a power accuracy is presented .	Emission of two hard photons and total expressions for radiative correction are given in leading logarithmical approximation .
The oxygen partial pressure , PO2 , during the growth was systematically varied .	As PO2 decreased , the growth behavior was changed from a 2-dimensional layer-by-layer-like growth to a 3-dimensional island-like one , which resulted in an increase in the saturation magnetization .
Diffuse interstellar bands ( DIBs ) can trace different conditions of the ISM along the sightline toward the observed stars .	A small survey was made in optical wavelengths , producing high resolution and high signal to noise spectra .
It is modest for B - & gt ; DK but can be O ( 1 ) for B - & gt ; D\pi .	We illustrate the size of the shift on an example of Gronau-London-Wyler method .
Project management education programmes are often proposed in higher education to give students competences in project planning ( Gantt 's chart ) , project organizing , human and technical resource management , quality control and also social competences ( collaboration , communication ) , emotional ones ( empathy , consideration of the other , humour , ethics ) , and organizational ones ( leadership , political vision , and so on ) .	This training is often given according a training-by-project type of learning with case studies .
Three of these observers were Richard C. Carrington , Christian H. F. Peters , and Warren de la Rue ( and their respective collaborators ) .	They published , in various articles the data corresponding to 26 641 sunspot positions ( Carrington , Peters , and de la Rue registered 4 900 , 14 040 , and 7 701 sunspot positions , respectively ) .
The calculation is done in a range of pion masses from 300 to 500 MeV .	A stochastic source method is used to reduce inversions in calculating propagators .
We find that the charge current is generated well before the first electron-hole scattering event .	Generation of the transverse current in the scattering-free ballistic transport regime provides unambiguous evidence for the intrinsic inverse spin Hall effect .
The characteristic times of sorption and desorption coincide .	It is found that the temperature dependences of the characteristic times of occupying the octahedral and tetrahedral interstices are nonmonotonic .
The theoretical formalism used is the generalized gradient approximation to density functional theory ( GGA-DFT ) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof ( PBE ) exchange-correlation functional .	Each compound has been studied at six levels of theory : non-magnetic ( NM ) , non-magnetic with spin-orbit coupling ( NM+SOC ) , ferromagnetic ( FM ) , ferromagnetic with spin-orbit coupling ( FM+SOC ) , anti-ferromagnetic ( AFM ) , and anti-ferromagnetic with spin-orbit coupling ( AFM+SOC ) .
As a by-product of this investigation , we study the causal structure of the string dual to the nucleated pair as seen by different static observers and we show that it can be interpreted as a dynamical creation of a `gluonic ' wormhole .	We explain how this result provides further evidence for the ER=EPR conjecture as an equivalence between two descriptions of the same physical phenomenon .
We consider generalizations of Szpiro 's classical discriminant conjecture to hyperelliptic curves over a number field $ K $ , and to smooth , projective and geometrically connected curves $ X $ over $ K $ of genus at least one .	The main results give effective exponential versions of the generalized conjectures for some curves , including all curves $ X $ of genus one or two .
We then turn to the many-body problem , where particle-hole symmetry and the existence of two valleys lead to a number of effects peculiar to graphene .	We find that the coupling together of a large number of low-lying excitations leads to strong many-body corrections , which could be observed in inelastic light scattering or optical absorption .
For several companies , share prices are defined only by CPI readings in the past .	Therefore , our empirical pricing model is a deterministic one .
Our approach combines first-order state abstraction that avoids evaluating states individually , and heuristic search that avoids evaluating all states .	Firstly , we apply state abstraction directly on the FOMDP avoiding propositionalization .
In this paper , we study the supercurrent in a mesoscopic Josephson junction ( MJJ ) and its quantum statistical properties in the presence of nonclassical light fields .	We investigate in detail the influence of external nonclassical light fields on current-voltage step structures of the MJJ .
Such a procedure -besides not modifying the spin 1 sector- leads to the well-known conformal coupling between the scalar curvature and the massless Klein-Gordon-Fock field .	Going beyond the riemannian spacetimes , we briefly discuss the effects of a nonvanishing torsion in the scalar case .
Vector autoregression ( VAR ) is a fundamental tool for modeling the joint dynamics of multivariate time series .	However , as the number of component series is increased , the VAR model quickly becomes overparameterized , making reliable estimation difficult and impeding its adoption as a forecasting tool in high dimensional settings .
We compare particle spectra , thermal photon spectra and histories of evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced in the central collision of gold ( lead ) nuclei at RHIC ( LHC ) energies , considering ideal hydrodynamical expansion of the system .	The particle and thermal photon spectra are seen to differ only marginally , for the two equations of state .
We have observed condensation of fermionic atom pairs in the BCS-BEC crossover regime .	A trapped gas of fermionic 40K atoms is evaporatively cooled to quantum degeneracy and then a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance is used to control the atom-atom interactions .
Since these defects form even upon annealing in vacuum of TiN-capped films their formation is not due to oxidation .	The pyramidal defects are absent when the erbium disilicide forms on amorphous substrates , which suggests that epitaxial strains play an important role in their formation .
We have carried out dc magnetization ( M ) , heat-capacity ( C ) and dielectric studies down to 2K for the compound GdCrTiO5 , crystallizing in orthorhombic Pbam structure , in which well-known multiferroics RMn2O5 ( R= Rare-earths ) form .	The points of emphasis are : ( i ) The magnetic ordering temperature of Cr appears to be suppressed compared to that in isostructural Nd counterpart , NdCrTiO5 , for which the Neel temperature is about 21 K. This finding on the Gd compound suggests that Nd 4f orbital plays a role on the magnetism of Cr in contrast to a proposal long ago .
We present a theoretical study on the behavior under pressure of the two hypothetical C $ _ { 46 } $ and Li $ _8 $ C $ _ { 46 } $ type-I carbon clathrates in order to bring new informations concerning their synthesis .	Using \textit { ab initio } calculations , we have explored the energetic and structural properties under pressure of these two carbon based cage-like materials .
A previous CMSSM global fit is then re-weighted by our likelihood map .	The CMS results nibble away at the high fit probability density region , transforming probability distributions for the scalar and gluino masses .
The magnitude and frequency dependence of the observed photo-thermal effect are consistent with predicted corrections due to transverse thermal diffusion and coating structure .	While the observed photo-thermal feed-back tends to destabilize the optical spring , we also propose a small coating modification that would change the sign of the effect , making a single-carrier stable optical spring possible .
We consider the problem of finding $ \lambda\in \mathbb { R } $ and a function $ u : \mathbb { R } ^n\rightarrow\mathbb { R } $ that satisfy the PDE $ $ \max\left\ { \lambda + F ( D^2u ) -f ( x ) , H ( Du ) \right\ } =0 , \quad x\in \mathbb { R } ^n .	$ $ Here $ F $ is elliptic , positively homogeneous and superadditive , $ f $ is convex and superlinear , and $ H $ is typically assumed to be convex .
This technology allows for provisioning of various resources such as virtual machines ( VM ) , physical machines , processors , memory , network , storage and software as per the needs of customers .	Application providers ( AP ) , who are customers of the CP , deploy applications on the cloud infrastructure and then these applications are used by the end-users .
Majorana and pseudo-Dirac heavy neutrinos are introduced into the type-I and inverse seesaw models , respectively , in explaining the naturally small neutrino mass .	TeV scale heavy neutrinos can also be accommodated to have a sizable mixing with the Standard Model light neutrinos , through which they can be produced and detected at the high energy colliders .
We argue herein that this lack of agreement can largely be traced to electrode effects that have not been properly taken into account .	A series of drainage and imbibition experiments are considered , in which we find that previously proposed approaches to remove electrode effects are unlikely to provide adequate corrections .
We derive consistency relations for the late universe ( CDM and \Lambda CDM ) : relations between an n-point function of the density contrast \delta and an ( n+1 ) -point function in the limit in which one of the ( n+1 ) momenta becomes much smaller than the others .	These are based on the observation that a long mode , in single-field models of inflation , reduces to a diffeomorphism since its freezing during inflation all the way until the late universe , even when the long mode is inside the horizon ( but out of the sound horizon ) .
Yet , most common techniques either adopt classical power control , in which mobile stations are received with the same Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio , or use centralized schemes , in which base stations coordinate their allocations .	In this work , we suggest a novel scheduling approach in which each base station , besides allocating the time and frequency according to given constraints , also manages its uplink power budget such that the aggregate interference , `` Noise Rise '' , caused by its subscribers at the neighboring cells is bounded .
We calculate this soft function at the next-to-leading order , and perform the resummation at the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy .	We compare our results with parton shower programs and with the experimental data at the Tevatron and the LHC .
Remote information concentration ( RIC ) in $ d $ -level systems ( qudits ) is studied .	It is shown that the quantum information initially distributed in three spatially separated qudits can be remotely and deterministically concentrated to a single qudit via an entangled channel without performing any global operations .
The estimated total mass of G19.30+0.07 is ~1130 Msun .	The cloud comprises four compact NH3 clumps of mass ~30 to 160 Msun .
The same data put tight limits on other sources of anisotropy .	Cosmic strings are a particularly interesting alternate source to constrain .
Within the provided approach radial ingoing or outgoing Minkowski particles do not exist .	An application of this formalism to the Rindler metric recovers the well-known Unruh effect .
The simulation quantitatively reproduced the cumulative probability distribution of revenue , material cost , capital , and labor .	Then , the response of the firms to a given exogenous shock , defined as a sudden change of gross domestic product , is discussed .
In this paper we construct a noncommutative space of `` pointed Drinfeld modules '' that generalizes to the case of function fields the noncommutative spaces of commensurability classes of Q-lattices .	It extends the usual moduli spaces of Drinfeld modules to possibly degenerate level structures .
We present observations of XRF 050406 , the first burst detected by Swift showing a flare in its X-ray light curve .	During this flare , which peaks at t_peak ~210s after the BAT trigger , a flux variation of ( delta F ) /F~6 in a very short time ( delta t ) /t_peak & lt ; & lt ; 1 was observed .
Maximally-entangled qubit pairs that one can extract in the formal protocol correspond to secret key bits in the realistic protocol .	More specifically , we define a qubit encoding scheme that allows the formal protocol to produce more than one entangled qubit pair per coherent state , or equivalently for the realistic protocol , more than one secret key bit .
As this equation is very cumbersome , we also study , in parallel to it , its simplified version which keeps the most essential term : the term which accounts for the { \it nonlinear diffraction } .	The full equation additionally includes terms generated by a deviation from the paraxial approximation and by a longitudinal electric-field component in the beam .
Let $ S $ be an oriented surface of finite type , $ \mathcal { MCG } ( S ) $ its mapping class group , and $ \mathcal { T } ( S ) $ its Teichm\ '' uller space with the Teichm\ '' uller metric .	Let $ H \leq \mathcal { MCG } ( S ) $ be a finite subgroup and consider the subset of $ \mathcal { T } ( S ) $ fixed by $ H $ , $ \mathrm { Fix } ( H ) \subset \mathcal { T } ( S ) $ .
A generic prediction of this mechanism is the existence of Kaluza-Klein excitations for gauge bosons and higgses .	In particular the first excitation of the photon could be accessible to future accelerators and give a clear signal of the proposed mechanism .
The correct asymptotics originally came at the price of representing the solution in terms of charge-transfer variables instead of atomic charges .	However , we have found an exact reformulation of fluctuating-charge models in terms of atomic charges again , which is made possible by the symmetries of classical electrostatics .
Here we solve this long-standing problem for the case of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain by explicitly constructing a GGE which uniquely fixes the macrostate describing the stationary behaviour after a general quantum quench .	A crucial ingredient in our method , which readily generalizes to other integrable models , are recently discovered quasi-local charges .
We show that every Pauli partner is an attractive fixed point of this operator , which means that we can find complete sets of Pauli partners very efficiently .	As a particular case , we found numerically 24 mutually unbiased bases in dimension N=23 in less than 30 seconds in a standard PC .
In the first one , response variables depend on multiple linear combinations of covariates .	In the second one , only response variables are observed while the linear covariates are missing .
In this paper , we take the Toeplitz and Virasoro approach for a fairly large class of symbols , leading to a systematic and simple way of generating such recursion relations .	The latter are very naturally expressed in terms of the $ L $ -matrices appearing in the Lax pair for the Toeplitz lattice equations .
The present sample now includes 32 clusters of galaxies , including 15 clusters above z=0.4 , which corresponds to a three-fold increase compared to our previous work at high redshift .	At z & lt ; 0.4 we have obtained new observations of AGN candidates in six additional clusters and found no new luminous AGN in cluster members .
The last decades brought an impressive progress in synthesizing and studying properties of nuclides located very far from the beta stability line .	Among the most fundamental properties of such exotic nuclides , usually established first , is the half-life , possible radioactive decay modes , and their relative probabilities .
We provide a topological characterization of attractors and repellers and prove Morse inequalities .	The generalization aims at algorithmic analysis of dynamical systems through combinatorialization of flows given by differential equations and through sampling dynamics in physical and numerical experiments .
Due to its proximity to the Hubble scale , the new physics is not necessarily decoupled from inflationary observables and can potentially affect the predictions of the model .	To understand the types of corrections that may arise , we construct weakly-coupled completions of the theory and study their observational signatures .
Hard X-ray emissions from a Herbig Be star MWC297 were discovered in three separate observations spanning 5 days in April 1994 with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics ( ASCA ) .	An X-ray flare was found at the beginning of the second observation with a maximum luminosity of 4.9E32 ergs/s , which is five times larger than that of the quiescent phase ( the first observation ) .
This is a reversal of Patrascu 's reduction from 3SUM to listing triangles ( STOC '10 ) .	Our result builds on and extends works by the Paghs ( PODS '06 ) and by Vassilevska and Williams ( FOCS '10 ) .
The linear dispersion of graphene gives lifetime energy dependences that are qualitatively different from those of parabolic-band semiconductors .	We also get good agreement with data from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments .
Simulations are performed using a hybrid dynamical Monte Carlo protocol that allows self-assembling clusters to rearrange internally while still providing Stokes-Einstein-like diffusion of aggregates of different sizes .	Our simulations explicitly capture the thermodynamic , dynamic and steric challenges typically faced by self-assembly processes , including competition between multiple partially-completed structures .
In quantum information theory , for $ a , b $ two positive operators living in $ B ( \mathcal { H } ) $ , where $ \mathcal { H } $ is a separable Hilbert space , the quantum fidelity is denoted by $ a*b = ( b^ { 1/2 } ab^ { 1/2 } ) ^ { 1/2 } $ .	One of the aim of this let ter is to interpret the quantum fidelity as an algebraic law .
Modeling dynamical systems , both for control purposes and to make predictions about their behavior , is ubiquitous in science and engineering .	Predictive state representations ( PSRs ) are a recently introduced class of models for discrete-time dynamical systems .
The cloud structure is studied with a column density image derived from Herschel continuum maps obtained at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500 micron .	We identify two high-column density filamentary clouds , quoted as the W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges , which both account for 1.5x10^4 Msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2 , respectively .
The standard analysis technique involves calculating the 90 % upper confidence limit on the number of events in each bin , and excluding any set of parameters ( WIMP mass and cross-section ) which produces a theoretical event rate for any bin which exceeds the 90 % upper confidence limit on the event rate for that bin .	We show that , if there is more than one energy bin , this produces exclusion limits that are actually at a lower degree of confidence than 90 % , and are hence erroneously tight .
Its spectrum reveals both H $ _ { \alpha } $ and [ NII ] emission lines and strong Balmer absorption lines .	The H $ _ { \alpha } $ and Spitzer MIPS 24 $ \mu $ m fluxes are both weak , thus indicating a low star formation rate of SFR $ \lesssim5-10 $ M $ _ { \odot } $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ .
Using linear response and asymptotic methods for pairs of unconnected integrate-and-fire ( IF ) neurons receiving white noise inputs , we show that this correlation transfer depends on the output spike firing rate in a strong , stereotyped manner , and is , surprisingly , almost independent of the interspike variance .	For cells receiving heterogeneous inputs , we further show that correlation increases with the geometric mean spiking rate in the same stereotyped manner , greatly extending the generality of this relationship .
More precisely , we prove existence and uniqueness for 2BSDEs with a generator which is Lipschitz in $ z $ and uniformly continuous with linear growth in $ y $ .	Moreover , we emphasize throughout the paper the major difficulties and differences due to the 2BSDE framework .
The three-dimensional Newtonian equations of hydrodynamics are integrated by the `Piecewise Parabolic Method ' However , we do include the effects of the emission of gravitational waves on the hydrodynamics .	The properties of neutron star matter are described by the equation of state of Lattimer & amp ; Swesty .
The search is performed by looking for an excess of high energy muon neutrinos from WIMP annihilations in the Sun , the core of the Earth , and the Galactic Center , as compared to the number expected from the atmospheric neutrino background .	No statistically significant excess was seen .
We supply a characterisation of the automatic Boolean algebras , and it is proven that the free Abelian group of infinite rank , as well as certain Fraisse limits , do not have automatic presentations .	In particular , the countably infinite random graph and the random partial order do not have automatic presentations .
The gas content of such cavities can be spatially resolved for the first time using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) .	We have developed a new series of models to simulate the physical conditions and chemical abundances of the gas in cavities to address the question whether the gas is primarily atomic or molecular inside the dust free cavities exposed to intense UV radiation .
Using the NIRSPEC spectrograph at Keck II , we have obtained infrared echelle spectra covering the range $ 1.5-1.8 \mu \rm m $ for the highly reddened bulge globular clusters Terzan 4 and Terzan 5 .	The clusters are of interest because a blue horizontal branch in Terzan 4 is consistent with very low metallicity , while Terzan 5 has been proposed as possibly the most metal rich known Galactic globular cluster .
The fourth stream is much broader , roughly 45 kpc distant , at least 53 degrees in length , and is most likely the tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy .	As the streams each span multiple constellations , we extend tradition and designate them the Acheron , Cocytos , Lethe , and Styx streams .
Beyond $ h_ { ct } $ the bifurcation is stationary and subcritical until a tricritical field $ h_t= 57.2 $ is reached , beyond which it is supercritical .	The bifurcation sequence as a function of $ h $ found in the experiment confirms the qualitative aspects of the theoretical predictions .
We discuss our general statements in detail for the familiar case of qubits , the GHZ states , Werner states and Gisin states , emphasizing their geometric features .	As theorists we use and play with this free choice of factorization , which is naturally fixed for an experimentalist .
The first phase of the heuristic solves a simplified constraint programming model of the problem , the second performs a local search , and the third handles overproduction in a greedy fashion .	This work was initiated in the context of the ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2010 , a competition organized jointly by the French Operational Research and Decision Support Society , the European Operational Research Society , and the European utility company Electricite de France .
Thus , the inducibility of the 4-path was addressed in a construction of Exoo ( 1986 ) , but remains unknown .	Refuting a conjecture of Erdos , Thomason ( 1997 ) constructed graphs with a small density of both 4-cliques and 4-anticliques .
Above a few GeV/n , a dozen spallation antideuterons should be collected by the future AMS experiment on board ISSA .	For energies less than about 3 GeV/n , the antideuteron spallation component becomes negligible and may be supplanted by a potential supersymmetric signal .
Using quasiparticle self-consistent $ GW $ calculations we examined the electronic structure of LaNiO $ _3 $ and the LaNiO $ _3 $ /LaAlO $ _3 $ superlattice .	The effects of electron correlation in Ni- $ d $ bands were reasonably well described without any { \it ad hoc } parameter and without the ambiguity related to the double-counting and downfolding issues .
Our study of the transit times show no evidence for transit timing variations and we are able to rule out co-planar companions with masses \ge 0.20 \mearth\ in low order mean motion resonance with XO-2b .	We also explored the stability of the XO-2 system given various orbital configurations of a hypothetical planet near the 2:1 mean motion resonance .
Constraints on the axion-electron coupling constant were obtained for axions with masses in the $ ( 0.1-1.0 ) $ MeV range : $ g_ { Ae } \leq ( 1.8-9.0 ) \times 10^ { -7 } $ .	The solar positron flux from $ A\rightarrow e^-+e^+ $ decay was determined for axions with masses $ m_A & gt ; 2m_e $ .
The two-body ( $ \Lambda^ { \ast } N $ ) and three-body ( $ \Lambda^ { \ast } NN $ ) systems are solved by a variational method .	It is shown that the spin and isospin of the ground states are assigned as $ \Lambda^ { \ast } N ( S=1 , I=1/2 ) $ and $ \Lambda^ { \ast } NN ( S=3/2 , I=0 ) $ , respectively .
Consequently , differences in coverage by standard bibliometric databases installed a dichotomy between on the one hand the well covered 'exact ' sciences , and on the other hand most of the social sciences and humanities with a more limited coverage ( Nederhof , 2006 ) .	Also the latter domains need to be able to soundly demonstrate their level of performance and claim or legitimate funding accordingly .
The signatures on the power spectrum and bispectrum were previously computed using a slow-roll Fourier transform ( SRFT ) approximation , and here we compare it with generalized slow-roll ( GSR ) and in-in methods , for which we derive new formulas that account for moderately sharp features .	The agreement between them is excellent , and also with the power spectrum obtained from the numerical solution to the equation of motion .
We consider the advection-diffusion equation \ [ \phi_t + Au \cdot \nabla \phi = \Delta \phi , \qquad \phi ( 0 , x ) =\phi_0 ( x ) \ ] on $ \bbR^2 $ , with $ u $ a periodic incompressible flow and $ A\gg 1 $ its amplitude .	We provide a sharp characterization of all $ u $ that optimally enhance dissipation in the sense that for any initial datum $ \phi_0\in L^p ( \bbR^2 ) $ , $ p & lt ; \infty $ , and any $ \tau & gt ; 0 $ , \ [ \|\phi ( \cdot , \tau ) \|_ { L^\infty ( \bbR^2 ) } \to 0 \qquad \text { as $ A\to\infty $ . }
The aim of this work is to establish the fraction of AGN with relativistic Fe Kalpha lines , and study possible correlations with source physical properties .	An XMM-Newton collection of 149 radio-quiet Type 1 AGN has been systematically and uniformly analyzed in order to search for significant evidence of a relativistically broadened Fe Kalpha line .
\pm 0.35 ( syst . ) ) x 10^ { -2 } .	A search for orbital excitations of charm mesons contributing to the B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ pi- pi+ final state is also performed , and the first observation of the B0 - & gt ; Dbar_ { 1 } ( 2420 ) ^0 pi+ pi- decay is reported with the ratio of branching fractions B ( B0 - & gt ; ( Dbar_ { 1 } ( 2420 ) ^0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ ) pi- pi+ ) / B ( B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ pi- pi+ ) = ( 2.04 \pm 0.42 ( stat . )
I analyze the fraction of differentially rotating stars as a function of color , rotation , and activity in a large sample of F-type stars .	Color and rotation exhibit a correlation with differential rotation in the sense that more stars are rotating differentially in the cooler , less rapidly rotating stars .
We investigate the dependence of stellar properties on the mean thermal Jeans mass in molecular clouds .	We compare the results from the two largest hydrodynamical simulations of star formation to resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit , the first of which was reported by Bate , Bonnell & amp ; Bromm .

When the hierarchy is truncated , one obtains the ordinary closed-system of correlation functions up to a certain order , and from the nPI effective action , a set of time-reversal invariant equations of motion .	But when the effect of the higher order correlation functions is included ( through e.g. , causal factorization -- molecular chaos -- conditions , which we call 'slaving ' ) , in the form of a correlation noise , the dynamics of the lower order correlations shows dissipative features , as familiar in the field-theory version of Boltzmann equation .
The algorithmimprovesthe estimation of centroids of the generative distribution during the process of clustering and outlier discovery .	The proposed algorithm consists of two stages .
Middlebox functionalities are usually deployed on expensive and proprietary hardware that require trained personnel for deployment and maintenance .	Middleboxes contribute significantly to a network 's capital and operational costs .
We derive a formula for the first variation that turns out to be a non-degenerate elliptic operator for the special case $ q=2 $ -- - a fact that seems not to be the case for the original tangent-point energies .	This observation allows us to prove that stationary points of $ TP^ { ( p,2 ) } $ + \lambda length , $ p\in ( 4,5 ) $ , \lambda & gt ; 0 , are smooth -- - so especially all local minimizers are smooth .
We examine here whether energy can escape physically from naked singular regions to reach either a local or a distant observer within the framework of general relativity .	We find that in case of imploding null dust collapse scenarios field outgoing singular null geodesics including the cauchy horizon can be immersed between two Vaidya spacetimes as null boundary layers with non vanishing positive energy density .
Both are represented by second rank field tensors with , in general , six independent components .	Measurements of these quantities are usually achieved by measuring a property that depends on the translational symmetry and periodicity of the crystal lattice , such as optical phonon energies using Raman spectroscopy , the electronic band gap using cathodoluminescence , photoelasticity via the optical birefringence , or Electron Back Scattering Diffraction ( EBSD ) .
However some models are opaque to probabilistic interpretation , and MF-based methods , typically solved using Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) , may incur loss of corpus information .	In addition , it is desirable to incorporate global latent factors , such as topics , sentiments or writing styles , into the word embedding model .
In heap-based languages , knowing that a variable x points to an acyclic data structure is useful for analyzing termination : this information guarantees that the depth of the data structure to which x points is greater than the depth of the structure pointed to by x.fld , and allows bounding the number of iterations of a loop which traverses the data structure on fld .	In general , proving termination needs acyclicity , unless program-specific or non-automated reasoning is performed .
Generally , for a Hamilton dynamic system established by a set of general velocity functions , several abstract theories have been well established , such as Lie algebra , Symplectic manifold , Poisson brackets , and others .	However , mathematically , to find out a general Hamilton function is very difficult even for very simple problems .
We apply empirical population synthesis techniques to samples of Starburst and HII galaxies in order to measure their evolutionary state and correlate the results with their emission line properties .	A couple of useful tools are introduced which greatly facilitate the interpretation of the synthesis : ( 1 ) an evolutionary diagram , whose axis are the strengths of the young , intermediate age and old components of the stellar population mix , and ( 2 ) the mean age of stars associated with the starburst , $ \ov { t } _ { SB } $ .
The new constrained evolutionary algorithm is successfully tested and validated on a diverse range of experimentally known polymers , namely polyethylene ( PE ) , polyacetylene ( PA ) , poly ( glycolic acid ) ( PGA ) , poly ( vinyl chloride ) ( PVC ) , poly ( oxymethylene ) ( POM ) , poly ( phenylene oxide ) ( PPO ) , and poly ( p-phenylene sulfide ) ( PPS ) .	By fixing the orientation of polymeric chains , this method can be further extended to predict all polymorphs of poly ( vinylidene fluoride ) ( PVDF ) , and the complex linear polymer crystals , such as nylon-6 and cellulose .
The quantum master equation , considered in the FA framework as the quantity parametrizing BRST anomalies , is argued to be incomplete at two and higher order loops and conjectured to reproduce only the one-loop corrections to the $ \hbar^p $ anomaly generated by the addition of $ O ( \hbar^ { k } ) $ , $ k & lt ; p $ , counterterms .	Chiral $ W_3 $ gravity is used to exemplify the nonlocally regularized FA formalism .
Molecules of a nematic liquid crystal respond to an applied magnetic field by reorienting themselves in the direction of the field .	Since the dielectric anisotropy of a nematic is small , it takes relatively large fields to elicit a significant liquid crystal response .
It is known that this problem can be formulated as an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold .	Riemannian optimization techniques can be used to solve this optimization problem .
In tropical algebraic geometry , the solution sets of polynomial equations are piecewise-linear .	We introduce the tropical variety of a polynomial ideal , and we identify it with a polyhedral subcomplex of the Grobner fan .
We find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular momentum of the light .	We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of the transmitted image .
The angular distribution of 12CO and 13CO emission over 1 km/s velocity intervals and the full velocity extent of the cloud are presented .	These reveal a complex , dynamic medium of cold , molecular gas .
We discuss non-commutative generalisations of well-known singularities such as the Del Pezzo singularities and the conifold .	We also introduce new techniques for deriving superpotentials , based on quivers with ghosts and a notion of generalised Seiberg duality .
A fairness proportional utility functions policy approach is used to allocate the resources among the user equipment ( UE ) s in a utility percentage form and to ensure a minimum level of customer satisfaction for all the subscribers .	Meanwhile , the priority of resources allocation is given to the real-time applications .
The metal-rich and metal-poor clusters have systematically different locations and kinematics in their host galaxies .	However , the red and blue clusters have similar internal properties , such as the masses , sizes , and ages .
Let E be an elliptic curve over Q ( or , more generally , a number field ) .	Then on the one hand , we have the finitely generated abelian group E ( Q ) , on the other hand , there is the Shafarevich-Tate group Sha ( Q , E ) .
However , the original algorithm presents some limitations such as noise sensitivity and its lack of rotational invariance which have led to many proposals or extensions in order to overcome such limitations .	In this paper we performed a quantitative study of the Ojala 's original LBP proposal together with other recently proposed LBP extensions in the presence of rotational , illumination and noisy changes .
In the self-focusing case , for negative detunings the pattern arises naturally from a codimension two bifurcation .	For a critical value of the field intensity there are two wave numbers that become unstable simultaneously , corresponding to two Turing-like instabilities .
In this paper we investigate how the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation and the nuclear luminosity versus velocity dispersion relation in QSOs/active galactic nuclei ( AGNs ) are connected with the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation in local galaxies , through the nuclear luminosity evolution of individual QSOs/AGNs and the mass growth of individual BHs .	In the study we ignore the effects of BH mergers and assume that the velocity dispersion does not change significantly during and after the nuclear activity phase .
For this purpose , we derive linearized perturbed equation of motion following the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches .	We formulate perturbed pressure in terms of adiabatic index by employing the conservation of baryon numbers .
The prototype consists of four parts : antennas with broadband front-ends , analog back-ends , digital receivers and a correlator .	The prototype antennas are mounted on the outermost stations of the Siberian Solar Radio Telescope ( SSRT ) array .
The resulting measure \mu_j is defined on configurations \sigma= ( \sigma ( x ) ) _ { x\in V } \in A^V , where A is some finite set .	Let \mu_j^n denote the restriction of \mu to the sigma-algebra generated by the variables \sigma ( x ) , where x is at distance exactly n from \rho .
The consistency of our approach is demonstrated by checking the baryon number , isospin and total momentum sum rules , as well as the Bjorken sum rule .	We present numerical estimates of the quark and antiquark distributions and find reasonable agreement with parametrizations of the data at a low normalization point .
The population dynamics of such sequential acquisition of ( epi ) genetic alterations has been the topic of much investigation .	The phenomenon of stochastic tunneling , where an intermediate mutant in a sequence does not reach fixation in a population before generating a double mutant , has been studied using a variety of computational and mathematical methods .
They minimize a special uncertainty relation .	Like standard coherent states they resolve the identity with a uniform measure .

By comparing pulse arrival times measured on-board the spacecraft with predicted pulse arrivals at some reference location , the spacecraft position can be determined autonomously with accuracies on the order of 5 kilometres .	For a spacecraft at a distance of 10 astronomical units from Earth ( e.g. , Earth-Saturn ) , this means an improvement by a factor of 8 compared to conventional methods .

The neutrino-driven explosion mechanism for core-collapse supernovae in its modern flavor relies on the additional support of hydrodynamical instabilities in achieving shock revival .	Two possible candidates , convection and the so-called standing accretion shock instability ( SASI ) , have been proposed for this role .
The sufficient CP insertion converts an inter-symbol interference ( ISI ) channel from multipaths into multiple ISI-free subchannels as the key in a wireless communications system , and analogously , it provides an inter-range-cell interference ( IRCI ) free ( high range resolution ) SAR image in a SAR system .	The sufficient CP insertion along with our newly proposed SAR imaging algorithm particularly for the OFDM signals also differentiates this paper from all the existing studies in the literature on OFDM radar signal processing .

A new parallel , computationally efficient immersed boundary method for solving three-dimensional , viscous , incompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented .	Immersed surfaces with prescribed motions are generated using the interpolation and regularization operators obtained from the discrete delta function approach of the original ( Peskin 's ) immersed boundary method .
Reflective light concentrators with hexagonal entrance and exit apertures are frequently used at the focal plane of gamma-ray telescopes in order to reduce the size of the dead area caused by the geometries of the photodetectors , as well as to reduce the amount of stray light entering at large field angles .	The focal plane of the large-sized telescopes ( LSTs ) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array ( CTA ) will also be covered by hexagonal light concentrators with an entrance diameter of 50 mm ( side to side ) to maximize the active area and the photon collection efficiency , enabling realization of a very low energy threshold of 20 GeV .
It is shown that the three-level system with degenerate ground states might have different behaviors depending on the details of the interaction with the heat bath when the temperature approaches zero .	If we introduce an external field to break the degeneracy of the ground states and let it approach zero after letting the temperature approach zero , then two possibilities will arise : the steady state is a definite one of the degenerate states independent of the initial state , or the steady state is dependent on the initial state in a complicated way .
In this note , we show that hcap ( A ) is comparable to a more geometric quantity hsiz ( A ) that we define to be the 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the union of all balls tangent to R whose centers belong to A .	Our main result is that hsiz ( A ) /66 & lt ; hcap ( A ) leq 7 hsiz ( A ) / ( 2 pi ) .
We develop a theory to describe the transient optomechanical behavior underlying the Ramsey fringes .	We also perform the experimental demonstration using a silica microresonator .
It is demonstrated that out-of plane motion does not affect the properties of the adsorbed films as long as the total density is not close to the monolayer completion .	On the other hand , close to the monolayer completion , the promotion of particles to the second layer considerably affects the properties of mixed films .
We predict the covering fractions of strong HI absorbers ( $ N_ { \rm { HI } } \gtrsim 10^ { 17 } \rm { cm } ^ { -2 } $ ) inside haloes to increase rapidly with redshift but to depend only weakly on halo mass .	For massive ( $ M_ { 200 } \gtrsim 10^ { 12 } { \rm M_ { \odot } } $ ) halos the covering fraction profiles are nearly scale-invariant and we provide fitting functions that reproduce the simulation results .
As images from the EINSTEIN and ROSAT satellites have shown , the outer ejecta is also visible in soft X-rays , while the central source is present in the harder X-ray bands .	With our CHANDRA observations we show that the morphology and properties of the X-ray nebula are the result of shocks from fast clumps in the outer ejecta moving into a pre-existing denser circumstellar medium .
To bring observational constraints on the occurrence and properties of planets in binaries and multiple stars , we have been conducting two dedicated observing programs using both adaptive optics imaging and radial-velocity monitoring .

The theory is formulated using a formalism of multi-vectors of magnetization dynamics , which allows one to study edge excitations in arrays having arbitrary complex primitive cells and lattice geometry .	The developed formalism can describe edge excitations localized both at the physical edges of the array and at the internal `` domain walls '' separating array regions existing in different static magnetization states .

We attempt to accommodate the result by employing an effective theory for the electromagnetic field alone .	No new particles with a mass of order the laser frequency or below are assumed .
The scalar mesons arise from fluctuations of the probe techniflavour branes and complement the ( axial- ) vector meson spectra that we investigated in earlier work .	By explicitly finding the spectrum of scalar masses , we show that the nonsupersymmetric D7 - anti-D7 embedding is stable with respect to such fluctuations .
Some infinite dimensional analogues are discussed .	A simple proof is given of Arveson 's result on the weak-operator density of transitive spaces that are masa bimodules .
We point out the somewhat surprising fact that decoherence can be useful , indeed necessary , for practical quantum computation , in particular , for the effective erasure of quantum memory in order to initialize the state of the quantum computer .	The essential point behind the deleter is that the environment , by means of a dissipative interaction , furnishes a contractive map towards a pure state .
Each time an agent takes an action , the corresponding reward is instantaneously observed by the agent , as well as its neighbours in the social network .	We perform a regret analysis of various policies in this collaborative learning setting .
The Hamiltonian microscopic dynamics also exhibits critical slowing down close to the transition .	Moreover , the relationship between chaos and the phase transition is considered , and interpreted in the light of a geometrization of dynamics .
One of the key problems related to the Bak-Sneppen evolution model on the circle is to compute the limit distribution of the fitness at a fixed observation vertex in the stationary regime , as the size of the system tends to infinity .	Simulations in \cite { J } and \cite { B } suggest that this limit distribution is uniform on $ ( f,1 ) $ , for some $ f\sim2/3 $ .
For this , techniques based on tensor methods are known , but these have only been studied in the exact case .	In this paper , we generalize an existing method to the noisy case , by introducing a weight factor in the tensor decomposition .
This includes frequency mixing , optical rectification or nonlinear current generation , which are of particular interest for generating radiation in spectral regions that are difficult to access , such as the terahertz gap .	Owing to its specific linear dispersion and high electron mobility at room temperature , graphene is particularly attractive for realizing strong nonlinear effects .
In other words , it is a confirmation that the so-called fine-tuning problem in the Standard Model is just an artefact of the regularization scheme and should not lead to any physical interpretation in terms of the energy scale at which new physics should show up , nor to the appearance of a new symmetry .	We analyse the characteristic physical scales relevant for the description of these radiative corrections .
We present detailed predictions for various observables that can be measured at LHC in ongoing experiments like ATLAS or CMS at sqrt { s } =7 TeV : the cross-section , the azimuthal correlations and the angular distribution of these jets .	For this purpose , we apply realistic kinematical cuts and binning , and study the dependence of our results with respect to several parameters .
Analysis of the relative intensities of these transitions can be used to reliably measure the densities of molecular cores .

For a monatomic system , analysis of the potential surface is facilitated by the random and symmetric classification of potential energy valleys .	Since the random valleys are numerically dominant and uniform in their macroscopic potential properties , only a few quenches are necessary to establish these properties .
Via To\ '' en 's derived Morita theory , we identify Hochschild cohomology with derived endomorphisms of the diagonal curved module ; we compute the latter and get the expected result .	Finally , we show that our categories are smooth , proper when the singular locus of W is proper , and Calabi-Yau when the total space X is Calabi-Yau .
Employing the time-dependent density functional theory approach we study quasi-fission in the systems $ ^ { 40,48 } $ Ca+ $ ^ { 238 } $ U .	Results show that for $ ^ { 48 } $ Ca projectiles the quasi-fission is substantially reduced in comparison to the $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca case .
It is widely believed that existing electroweak data requires a Standard Model Higgs to be light while electroweak and flavour physics constraints require other scalars charged under the Standard Model gauge couplings to be heavy .	We analyze the robustness of these beliefs within a general scalar sector and find both to be incorrect , provided that the scalar sector approximately preserves custodial symmetry and minimal flavour violation ( MFV ) .

The nonperturbative definition of a topological insulator given here is distinct from previous efforts in that it involves boundary phase twists that couple only to charge , does not refer to edge states , and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge .	In this definition , the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states is determined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the IQHE case .
Specifically , The eigenvectors are extended even in two dimensions .	Moreover , the correlation exponent does not diverge in the transition from localized to delocalized states .

A new experiment at Fermilab will measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with a precision of 140 parts per billion ( ppb ) .	This measurement is motivated by the results of the Brookhaven E821 experiment that were first released more than a decade ago , which reached a precision of 540 ppb .
We suggest that this is partly because collisionless dynamics is also important and contribute to shaping the cluster properties .	We show using time-scale and length-scale arguments that except for the very centers of clusters , collisionless dynamics should be more important than collisional .
Keplerian conic sections are obtained for special choices for p and p ' and the systems are shown to be equivalent to nonrelativistic systems .	Their quantum behaviour is also equivalent to the corresponding non-relativistic limit .
In this article I continue to investigate a particular type of K\ '' ahler manifolds with positive first Chern class which generalize Calabi -- Yau manifolds in a natural way and which provide a framework for mirrors of rigid string vacua .	This class is comprised of a special type of Fano manifolds which encode crucial information about ground states of the superstring .
Thus , these have emerged as powerful candidates for soft actuators .	To further this potential , we introduce the key metric constraint which governs shape changing actuation in these sheets .
According to the E.L. Feinberg viewpoint on the possibility of a semi-bare electron state we may expect a state of electron with non-equilibrium Coulomb field during the time range of { \gamma^2 \lambda/c } , where { \gamma } is the Lorents-factor of electron , c is light velocity and { \lambda } is the wavelength corresponding to a frequency in Fourier expansion of the Coulomb field of relativistic electron .	If this non-equilibrium Coulomb field has a spatial asymmetry , a relativistic electron may be deflected by its own Coulomb field .
In this work we report on a detailed fully atomistic molecular dynamics study of this phenomenon .	Our results show that it has its physical basis in the interplay of the molecular hydrogens and the Cu ( 110 ) atomic spacing , which is a direct consequence of an accidental commensurability between molecule and surface dimensions .
In Sec.2 we formulate the following problem : `` does every cyclic Hilbert space embed into $ L^2 ( M , \tau ) $ , for some $ M $ ? `` .	An affirmative answer would imply the existence of an algorithm to check Connes ' embedding Conjecture .
The Higgs VEVs break conformal symmetry in the strong sector at the TeV scale , and the strong sector in turn gives important contributions to the Higgs potential , giving rise to a kind of Higgs bootstrap .	A Higgs with mass $ 125\GeV $ can be accommodated without any fine tuning .
As the assumed flare height influences the derived flare energy , the mathematical foundations of nanoflare distributions and their conversion to different height assumptions are studied first .	This also allows a comparison with various published energy distributions differing in height assumptions and to relate the observations to the input parameters of the heating model .
The method yields physical insight into the maximum-likelihood determinations of the luminosity and velocity distribution and enables us to conduct a vigorous Monte Carlo investigation into various systematic effects .	We apply our analytic formalism to the RR Lyrae sample of Layden et al .
Quasar selection was carried out both in multicolor space and in `` profile space , '' defined as the multi-parameter space formed by the radial profiles of the objects in the different images .	By combining the dither frames available for each filter , we were able to obtain well-sampled radial profiles of the objects and measure their deviation from that of a stellar source .
Perturbative expansions of QCD observables in powers of $ \alpha_s $ are believed to be asymptotic and non-Borel summable due to the existence of singularities in the Borel plane ( renormalons ) .	This fact is connected with the factorization of scales ( which is inherent to QCD and asymptotic freedom ) and jeopardizes the convergence of the perturbative expansion and the accurate determination of power-suppressed corrections .
We find 15 candidate z~3 objects ( F300W dropouts ) , 1 candidate z~4 object ( F450W dropout ) and 16 candidate z $ \sim $ 5 objects ( F606W dropouts ) in the ~ 4.7 arcmin^2 WFPC-2 field , 4 candidate z~6 ( optical dropouts ) and 1 candidate z~8 ( F110W dropout ) in the 0.84 arcmin^2 NICMOS-3 field .

We propose a theory of three-dimensional ( anti ) de Sitter gravity carrying Chan-Paton color charges .	We define the theory by Chern-Simons formulation with the gauge algebra $ ( \mathfrak { gl } _ { 2 } \oplus \mathfrak { gl } _ { 2 } ) \otimes \mathfrak { u } ( N ) $ , obtaining a color-decorated version of interacting spin-one and spin-two fields .
We predicted the most probable sites occupied by Eu3+ and Li+ ions and the related charge-compensation mechanisms involved into these substitutions .	The results show that the Eu3+ and Li+ ions are incorporated mainly at the Gd3+ site .
An interesting model of this phenomena consists of $ N $ scalars with a random potential of fourth order .	Here we show that the scaling of the typical minimal bounce action with $ N $ is readily understood , and differs from statements in the literature .
An EMHD wave ( also known as whistler wave ) propagates along magnetic field lines .	The direction of propagation can be either parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field lines .
An important peculiarity of the full Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations is the use of the full continuity equation required even for a binary mixture of incompressible liquids , firstly , due to dependence of mixture density on concentration and , secondly , due to strong concentration gradients at liquids ' interfaces .	Using the multiple-scale method we separate the physical processes occurring on different time scales and , ultimately , provide a strict derivation of the Boussinesq approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations .
We find that to a large extent FSI masks the sensitivity of the tensor analyzing power to models of the deuteron wave function .	For the transversely polarized deuterons the FSI induced forward-backward asymmetry of the missing momentum distribution is shown to have a node at precisely the same value of $ p_m $ as the PWIA missing momentum distribution .
The consequence is often severe performance degradation and is one of the major barriers for the application of classifiers in real-world systems .	In this paper , we show how to learn transform-based domain adaptation classifiers in a scalable manner .
The density parameters of both components are then constant , as they expand as a^ { -4 } .	If the field energy is then prevalently kinetic , as is expected , its energy is exactly half of the pressureless component ; the dual component as a whole , then , has a density parameter \Omega_ { cd } = 3/4\beta^2 ( e.g. , for \beta~2.5 , \Omega_ { cd } ~0.1 , in accordance with Dark Radiation expectations ) .
However , such a pure low-resolution ADC architecture also complicates parameter estimation problems such as time/frequency synchronization and channel estimation .	A mixed-ADC architecture , where most of the antennas are equipped with low-precision ADCs while a few antennas have full-precision ADCs , can solve these issues and actualize the potential of the pure low-resolution ADC architecture .
It is based on an existing phase-field formulation of the bulk free energy and incorporates two crucial effects : ( i ) anisotropic ionic mobility in the crystal and ( ii ) surface reactions governing the flux of ions across the electrode/electrolyte interface , depending on the local free energy difference .	Although the phase boundary can form a classical diffusive `` shrinking core '' when the dynamics is bulk-transport-limited , the theory also predicts a new regime of surface-reaction-limited ( SRL ) dynamics , where the phase boundary extends from surface to surface along planes of fast ionic diffusion , consistent with recent experiments on LiFePO4 .
Using a continuum , membrane-like model we study the height-height correlation functions and the destabilization modes corresponding to two different boundaries conditions : ribbons which are fixed or free on the edges .	For the first situation , the thermal spectrum has a gap and the correlations along the ribbon decay exponentially .
Most software verification tools can be classified into one of a number of established families , each of which has their own focus and strengths .	For example , concrete counterexample generation in model checking , invariant inference in abstract interpretation and completeness via annotation for deductive verification .
We use first principles calculations to study structural , vibrational and superconducting properties of H $ _2 $ S at pressures $ P\ge 200 $ GPa .	The inclusion of zero point energy leads to two different possible dissociations of H $ _2 $ S , namely 3H $ _2 $ S $ \to $ 2H $ _3 $ S + S and 5H $ _2 $ S $ \to $ 3H $ _3 $ S + HS $ _2 $ , where both H $ _3 $ S and HS $ _2 $ are metallic .
The crucial role is played in this by the Bohr 's insistence on the wavefunction providing the most complete description possible for an even individual system .	The alternative of introducing extra dynamical variables , called hidden variables , in addition to the wavefunction of the system so as to be able to retain at least some of the desirable features of classical physics , is then explored .
In the current parlance , this is the hidden subgroup problem ( HSP ) over groups of the form G^n , where G is a nonabelian group of constant size , and where the hidden subgroup is either trivial or has order two .	Although groups of the form G^n have a simple product structure , they share important representation-theoretic properties with the symmetric groups S_n , where a solution to the HSP would yield a quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism .

These equations exhibit stochastic behavior when E_0 exceeds a threshold .	The diffusion coefficient above the threshold is determined .
However , it is also known that this transition can be observed for sub-critical Reynolds numbers .	In that case , the basin of attraction of the laminar state coexists with the sustained turbulence .
For ttbar events under typical 2011 pileup conditions , the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of pt & gt ; 0.9 GeV is 94 % for pseudorapidities of abs ( eta ) & lt ; 0.9 and 85 % for 0.9 & lt ; abs ( eta ) & lt ; 2.5 .	The inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material .
Accordingly , we compute the coefficient function for the production of a Higgs boson from two off-shell gluons , and the impact factors for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a gluon or a quark jet .	We include the full top quark mass dependence and compare this with the result obtained in the large top-mass limit .
Likewise , the high-energy behaviour will be demanded for the whole correlator , not for individual absorptive channels .	The amplitude is progressively improved by considering more and more complicated operators in the hadronic lagrangian .

We find a lower bound $ L $ on the number of colours such that Glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing if at least $ L $ colours are used .	We give a closely-matching upper bound $ U $ on the number of colours such that with probability that tends to 1 , the Glauber dynamics mixes slowly on random $ \Delta $ -regular graphs when at most $ U $ colours are used .
Starting from the ( 3+1 ) -dimensional Yang-Mills action , we implement the high energy limit $ s\ ! & gt ; \ ! & gt ; \ !	t $ via a scaling argument and we derive from this a simplified effective theory .
Much of the interstellar medium in disk galaxies is in the form of neutral atomic hydrogen , H I .	This gas can be in thermal equilibrium at relatively low temperatures , T & lt ; 300 K ( the cold neutral medium , or CNM ) or at temperatures somewhat less than 10^4 K ( the warm neutral medium , or WNM ) .
Our procedure unifies in a single structure the quantum plane coordinates and the q-group matrix elements T^a_b , and allows to deduce without effort the differential calculus on the q-plane IGL_qr ( N ) / GL_qr ( N ) .	The general theory is illustrated on the example of IGL_qr ( 2 ) .
One process to alter the inclination of a planet is through planet-disc interactions .	Recent simulations considering radiative transport have shown that the evolution of migration and eccentricity can strongly depend on the thermodynamic state of the disc .
We say~ $ n $ is weird if~ $ n $ is abundant but not pseudoperfect .	We call a weird number~ $ n $ primitive if none of its aliquot parts are weird .
SCUBA observations of three fields detect at least one candidate quasar-associated galaxy .	Many galaxies with SEDs indicating considerable dust are not detected , but the limits are only sufficient to rule out hyperluminous infrared galaxies .
Partly to cure them , we present several arguments for `` $ F $ -Theory '' , enlarging spacetime to $ ( 2 , 10 ) $ signature , following the original suggestion of C. Vafa .	We introduce a suggestive Supersymmetric 27-plet of particles , associated to the exceptional symmetric hermitian space $ E_ { 6 } /Spin^ { c } ( 10 ) $ .
The prototype model of a fluidized granular system is a gas of inelastic hard spheres ( IHS ) with a constant coefficient of normal restitution $ \alpha $ .	Using a kinetic theory description we investigate the two basic ingredients that a model of elastic hard spheres ( EHS ) must have in order to mimic the most relevant transport properties of the underlying IHS gas .
This sample contains a substantial portion of the WAT clusters in the VLA 20 cm survey of Abell clusters , including 75 % of WAT clusters in the complete survey ( z & lt ; =0.09 ) , and 20 % of WAT clusters with z & gt ; 0.09 .	It is a representative sample which should not contain biases other than selection by radio morphology .
Transcription regulation is largely governed by the profile and the dynamics of transcription factors ' binding to DNA .	Stochastic effects are intrinsic to this dynamics and the binding to functional sites must be controled with a certain specificity for living organisms to be able to elicit specific cellular responses .
A long-standing puzzle is the low carrier mobility ( { \mu } ) in them as compared with corresponding bulk structures , which constitutes the main hurdle for realizing high-performance devices .	To address this issue , we perform combined experimental and theoretical study on atomically thin MoS2 field effect transistors with varying the number of MoS2 layers ( NLs ) .
The data set covers 42 contiguous cycles of the system orbital motion .	Analyzing this X-ray monitoring dataset , the largest to date for this source , we report on the variability of the orbital profile and the spectral distribution , and provide strong evidence for an anti-correlation between flux and spectral index ( the higher the flux , the harder the spectral index ) .
All the IARs present EDs in lower temperature lines ( e.g. , 171 { \AA } ) at their early emerging stages , meanwhile in higher temperature lines ( e.g. , 211 { \AA } ) , the ED regions brighten continuously .	There are two type of EDs : fan-shaped and halo-shaped .
This question has a positive answer for a large family of curves and H.Yoshihara conjectured that it is true in general .	We exhibit counterexamples to this conjecture , over any ground field .
It is then important to ask what such singular peaks imply , with or without the effects of other biological factors .	We studied the stochastic escape time from the infinite potential peaks in the Wright-Fisher model , where the typical two-scale diffusion dynamics was observed via computer simulations .
A large class of non-minimal gauge mediation models , such as ( semi- ) direct gauge mediation , predict a hierarchy between the masses of the supersymmetric standard model gauginos and those of scalar particles .	We perform a comprehensive study of these non-minimal gauge mediation models , including mass calculations in semi-direct gauge mediation , to illustrate these features , and discuss the phenomenology of the models .
We find a class of analytic solutions in open bosonic string field theory , parametrized by the chiral copy of higher spin algebra in $ AdS_3 $ .	The solutions are expressed in terms of the generating function for the products of Bell polynomials in derivatives of bosonic space-time coordinates $ X^m ( z ) $ of the open string , which form is determined in this work .
The particular models derived describe different non-linear ( parabolic , cubic , sinh , cosh , etc . )	level-sweeping or level-glancing processes , double- or triple-level-crossing processes , as well as periodically repeated resonance-glancing or resonance-crossing processes .
In such scheme , each transmitter is equipped with one conventional antenna and each receiver is equipped with one reconfigurable ( multi-mode ) antenna .	Assuming that the channel is known to the receivers only , we show that BIA can achieve $ \frac { 2K } { K+2 } $ DoF , which surpasses the sum DoF achieved by previously known interference alignment schemes with delayed channel state information at transmitters ( CSIT ) .

Additionally the joint analysis of increased number of targets ( with addition of Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma hominis , and Ureaplasma urealyticum DNA ) was done in two-stage version of assay : first stage was in-tube PCR with target-specific primers , while the reverse ones contained 5'-adapter region ; the second stage was on-chip amplification with immobilized target-specific forward primers and adapter as common reverse primer in solution .	The possible application of one-stage reaction for human cDNA analysis was additionally demonstrated with utilization of a common poly-T-containing primer in solution .

We investigate the magnetization process for a quasi-one-dimensional S=1 antiferromagnet with bond alternation .	By combining the density matrix renormalization group method with the interchain mean-field theory , we discuss how the interchain coupling affects the magnetization curve .
Mesoscopic quantum electrodynamics is therefore subject to `` doing quantum electrodynamics while thinking classically , '' allowing one to substitute essentally classical considerations for quantum ones without any loss in generality .	Implications of these results for the quantum measurement theory are discussed .
We show that it is possible to extract valuable information about social phenomena , such as an epidemic or even rainfall rates , by automatic analysis of the content published in Social Media , and in particular Twitter , using Statistical Machine Learning methods .	An important intermediate task regards the formation and identification of features which characterise a target event ; we select and use those textual features in several linear , non-linear and hybrid inference approaches achieving a significantly good performance in terms of the applied loss function .
For wireless networks ( and other networks ) , graphs are actually not the correct model of the communication ; instead hyper-graphs better capture the communication over a wireless shared channel .	Motivated by this example , we study in this paper random walks on hyper-graphs .
Two contributions to the Seebeck coefficient are clearly identified : the expected contribution that is dependent on the position of the transport level and reflects the activated character of carrier generation , and an unexpected intrinsic contribution of 265 plus minus 40 micro V/K that is independent of the temperature and the treatment of the oxide surface .

We consider the emission of gravitational waves in the two proposed models for the collapse of a massive star to a black hole : the prompt collapse , in which nearly all the star collapses to a black hole in a dynamical time scale , and the delayed collapse , in which a light black hole , or a neutron star , which subsequently accretes matter , forms due to the fall-back achieving , in the neutron star case , the critical mass for black hole formation .	Recent simulations strongly support this last scenario .

It was pointed out by many authors that the non-regular eigenvectors should correspond to the Bethe ansatz wavefunctions which have multiple infinite rapidities .

After the discovery of a Higgs-like boson by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS , it is of crucial importance to determine its properties in order to not only identify it as the boson responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking but also to clarify the question if it is a Standard Model ( SM ) Higgs boson or the Higgs particle of some extension beyond the SM as { \it e.g . } supersymmetry .	In this context , the precise prediction of the Higgs parameters as masses and couplings play a crucial role for the proper distinction between different models .

It is found that the PME can overestimate the mass by approx 40 % if a cluster is sampled only about its effective radius , Re .	The exact value of this error depends on the mass profile of the cluster .
Further , the SL ( 2 , R ) can always be extended to Osp ( 1|2 ) superconformal symmetry , with a suitable choice of torsion , by the addition of N real fermions .	Extension to SU ( 1,1|1 ) requires a complex structure I and a holomorphic U ( 1 ) isometry $ D^a I_a { ^b } \partial_b $ .
These values are in accord with predictions of Parry { \it et al . } [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 100 } , 136105 ( 2008 ) ] .
The crossed susceptibility in two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators shows a quantized signature of the $ \mathbb { Z } _2 $ topological phase in response to Zeeman coupling via an averaged g-factor , and the quantization persists even when $ \sigma^z $ -conservation of electrons is broken by a tilted magnetic field .	The bulk orbital magnetization is interpreted by the persistent edge current attributed to the chiral anomaly at the ( 1+1 ) -dimensional boundary .
This means as soil column volume increases , variability of the SWRC and SHC decreases .	Although prediction of the SWRC and SHC from available parameters , such as textural data , organic matter , and bulk density have been under investigation for decades , up to now no research has focused on the effect of measurement scale on the soil hydraulic properties pedotransfer functions development .
As a measure of dynamical ( over ) heating , we use the ratio of the observed velocity dispersion to the minimal dispersion which provides the local stability of the stellar disks with respect to gravitational perturbations .	We came to conclusion that stellar disks in a significant part of galaxies ( including LSB and some S0 galaxies ) are close to the marginal stability condition ( or are slightly overheated ) -- at least at radial distances $ r\sim $ 2-3 radial scalelenghts .
In this light I show that , contrary to what claimed in that article , there was no `` probabilistic pitfall '' in the Columbo 's episode pointed as example of `` bad mathematics '' yielding `` rough justice '' .	Instead , such a criticism could have a `negative reaction ' to the article itself and to the use of Bayesian reasoning in courts , as well as in all other places in which probabilities need to be assessed and decisions need to be made .
We present results from observations of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 ( SGR J1550-5418 ) taken with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) following the source 's outbursts in 2008 October and 2009 January .	During the time span of the Chandra observations , which covers days 4 through 23 and days 2 through 16 after the 2008 and 2009 events , respectively , the source spectral shape remained stable , while the pulsar 's spin-down rate in the same span in 2008 increased by a factor of 2.2 as measured by RXTE .
We developed a new technology for global detection of atmospheric disturbances , on the basis of phase measurements of the total electron content ( TEC ) using an international GPS networks .

We predict the primary angular bispectrum from inflation , and forecast how well we can measure the primordial non-Gaussian signal .	In addition to that , secondary anisotropy sources in the low-redshift universe also produce non-Gaussianity , so do foreground emissions from extragalactic or interstellar microwave sources .
While these results do not challenge the suggested parameters , a 2^ ( n^epsilon ) approximation algorithm with epsilon & lt ; 2/3 for lattice basis reduction in n dimensions could be used to break these parameters .	We have implemented our algorithm , and it performs better in practice than the theoretical analysis suggests .

The noise spectra associated with correlations of the current through a single level quantum dot , and with the charge fluctuations on the dot , are calculated for a finite bias voltage .	The results turn out to be sensitive to the asymmetry of the dot 's coupling to the two leads .
We show that G345 is , in fact , two subclusters separated on the sky by 400 kpc .	We measure the subclusters ' gas temperatures ( ~ 2-3 keV ) , total ( ~ 1-2 x 10^14 solar masses ) and gas ( ~ 1-2 x 10^13 solar masses ) masses , gas mass fraction within r500 , entropy profiles , and X-ray luminosities ( ~ 10^43 erg/s ) .
In this paper we consider the steepest descent $ H^ { -1 } $ -gradient flow of the length functional for immersed plane curves , known as the curve diffusion flow .	It is known that under this flow there exist both initially immersed curves which develop at least one singularity in finite time and initially embedded curves which self-intersect in finite time .
The HST UV instruments ( STIS and ACS ) can greatly contribute to the success of the Juno mission by providing key complementary views of Jupiter 's UV aurora from Earth orbit .	Juno carries an ultraviolet Spectrograph ( UVS ) and an infrared spectral mapper ( JIRAM ) that will obtain high-resolution spectral images providing the auroral counterpart to Juno 's in situ particles and fields measurements with the plasma JADE and JEDI particle detectors .
For some special cases , e.g. , for relay channels where the optimal PDF strategy reduces to DF or P2P transmission , it could be deduced that Gaussian inputs maximize the PDF rate .	For the general case , however , the problem has remained open until now .
Unfortunately , a complete time evolution of the measured physical quantities is not available .	The time series contains many gaps which increase in frequency and duration at larger distances .
The analogy is complete if the medium is assumed to behave as fluid in shear motions , while it may still behave as elastic solid under compressional motions .	Then the governing equations of the elastic fluid are re-derived in the Eulerian frame by replacing the partial time derivatives by the properly invariant ( frame indifferent ) time rates .
As a consequence , we show that all primes are completely prime in the generic case where the deformation parameter q is not a root of unity .	There is a torus H that acts naturally on the quantum grassmannian and the cell decomposition of the set of H-primes leads to a parameterisation of the H-spectrum via certain diagrams on partitions associated to the Schubert cells .
We learned the extent of this often-cited observation in the construction of the probabilistic part of a complex influence diagram in the field of cancer treatment .	Based upon our negative experiences with existing methods , we designed a new method for probability elicitation from domain experts .
The classical estimators such as the least squares estimator may not provide a reliable estimate under the so-called ( p , m ) -sparse attack .	In this work , we are not restricting our efforts in studying whether any specific estimator is resilient to the attack or not , but instead we aim to present the generic sufficient and necessary conditions for resilience by considering a general class of convex optimization based estimators .
% For illustration , we use the intelligent-driver model ( IDM ) as underlying model , characterize the level of service solely by the velocity and couple the internal variable to the IDM parameter `` netto time gap '' , modelling an increase of the time gap in congested traffic ( `` frustration effect '' ) , that is supported by single-vehicle data .	% We simulate open systems with a bottleneck and obtain flow-density data by implementing `` virtual detectors '' .
Given an ideal triangulation of a connected 3-manifold with non-empty boundary consisting of a disjoint union of tori , a point of the deformation variety is an assignment of complex numbers to the dihedral angles of the tetrahedra subject to Thurston 's gluing equations .	From this , one can recover a representation of the fundamental group of the manifold into the isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space .
The stable right-handed neutrino communicates with the Standard Model via s-channel exchange of the Higgs field and the U ( 1 ) ' gauge boson , so that the observed relic density for dark matter is obtained in a wide range of the parameter space .	The experimental signatures in collider and other experiments are briefly discussed .
In the frame of a Gaussian model , we derive the probability distribution of P & amp ; Ls and analyze its moments ( mean , variance , skewness and kurtosis ) and asymptotic behavior ( quantiles ) .	We show that the asymmetry of the distribution ( with often small losses and less frequent but significant profits ) is reminiscent to trend following strategies and less dependent on peculiarities of price variations .

Starting from initially random configurations , we monitor the average earthquake size in different portions of the system as a function of time ( the time is defined as the input energy per site in the system ) .	We find that the process of self-organisation develops from the boundaries of the system and it is controlled by a dynamical critical exponent z~1.3 that appears to be universal over a range of dissipation levels of the local dynamics .
We claim that the fuzzieness in quantum mechanics , in statistical physics and thermodynamics is due to the fact that we do not see the real image of the object , but a holographic projection of it .	We found that the projection of a point particle is a de Broglie-type wave .

The quenched spectrum shows a Mott-transition from a ( delocalized ) Goldstone phase softly broken by the current mass , to a ( localized ) heavy quark phase , with quarks localized over their Compton wavelength .	Both phases are distinguishable by the quark density of states at zero virtuality , with a critical quark mass of the order of 100-200 MeV .
The analytic and numerical treatment of our model results in a very good fit to the experimental data and practically has no free parameters .	Changing the values of the parameters in the restricted range allowed by the related experimental estimates has almost no effect on the shape of the curves and results mainly in a variation of the zero load velocity which can be directly fitted to the measured data .
Moreover , recent analysis techniques based on the matrix element likelihood method assign probabilities for every event to belong to any of a given set of possible processes .	This method originally used for the top mass measurement , although computing intensive , has shown its power at LHC to extract the new boson signal from the background .
The key is to derive an iteration bound based on a frequency decomposition of the solution .	This iteration bound is different than the one used earlier in the work of Bourgain , and is less dependent on the structure of the nonlinearity .
In this article we present recent theoretical and computational observations that challenge this point of view , in particular for high-dimensional sparsity-promoting Bayesian inversion .

This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary dimension n and p , while previous results pertained only to p=1 , or a fixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on this result , several quantization bounds are derived for sphere packing and rate distortion tradeoff .	We establish asymptotically equivalent lower and upper bounds for the rate distortion tradeoff .
We prove the exponential sharp rate of strong convergence to equilibrium for conservative measure solutions having finite mass and energy .	The proof is based on the regularizing property of the iterated collision operators , exponential moment production estimates , and some previous results on the exponential rate of strong convergence to equilibrium for square integrable initial data .
We found that under some conditions the molecules reverse their spin direction at a resonance field in the form of an avalanche .	The avalanche front velocity is of the order of $ 1 $ m/sec and is sensitive to field gradients and sweep rates .
Cluster stars have been selected from a membership probability analysis based on a non-parametric method that uses both positions and proper motions and does not make any a priori assumption on the underlying distributions .	The internal structure is then characterized by means of the minimum spanning tree method ( Q parameter ) , King profile fitting , and the correlation dimension ( Dc ) for those clusters with fractal patterns .
That theory , which we call KM CFT , consists of d \leq 1 matter plus a scalar and a dressing prescription : \Delta = 0 for every primary field .	By adding a spin-1 bc system the KM CFT provides a realization of the N=2 twisted topological algebra .

By adjusting the dust attenuation effect using one parameter and matching the observed size-luminosity relation of LABs using another parameter , we show that our simulations can reproduce the observed \civ/\lya\ and \heii/\lya\ ratios adequately .	This analysis provides the first successful physical model to account for simultaneously the LAB luminosity function , luminosity-size relation , and the \civ/Ly $ \alpha $ and \heii/Ly $ \alpha $ ratios , with only two parameters .
Through its sizable couplings to the Z ' , the dark matter is predicted to possess an elastic scattering cross section with neutrons which can generate the signals reported by the CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA collaborations .	To avoid being overproduced in the early universe , the dark matter must annihilate to leptons through the exchange of charged or neutral fermions which appear in the 27 of E_6 , providing an excellent fit to the gamma ray spectrum observed from the Galactic Center by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope .
We work out the kinetic term for the complex modulus of a deformed conifold with flux , i.e.the Klebanov-Strassler solution embedded in a compact Calabi-Yau manifold .	Earlier results of a power-like divergence are confirmed qualitatively ( the kinetic term does contain the main effect of warping ) but not quantitatively ( the correct results differ by an order one coefficient ) .

We observe layer breathing and shear modes which allow for easy assignment of the number of layers .	Polarization-dependent measurements give further insight into the crystal structure and reveal an energetic shift of the shear mode which stems from the in-plane anisotropy of the shear modulus in this material .
We find that , despite the presence of a strong magnetic field , the bar can grow fast enough that for a modest initial perturbation ( at 5 % level ) a large aspect ratio is obtained during the isothermal phase of cloud collapse .	The highly elongated bar is expected to fragment into small pieces during the subsequent adiabatic phase .
The energy and the spatial profile of the gas are computed using a theory of the crossover from Fermi to Bose superfluids at finite temperature .

Outside this range the errors grow rapidly making the inference difficult even at very large numbers of events ( N\approx 10000 ) .	On the other hand , the average mass of the MHOs will be determined to better than about 30 % accuracy from N\approx 100 events for any slope .
The variation of the expansion rate of the Universe with time produces an evolution in the cosmological redshift of distant sources ( for example quasar Lyman- $ \alpha $ absorption lines ) , that might be directly observed by future ultra stable , high-resolution spectrographs ( such as CODEX ) coupled to extremely large telescopes ( such as European Southern Observatory 's Extremely Large Telescope , ELT ) .	This would open a new window to explore the physical mechanism responsible for the current acceleration of the Universe .
Grain boundary ( GB ) enthalpies in nanocrystalline ( NC ) $ \mathrm { Pd_ { 90 } Au_ { 10 } } $ are studied after preparation , thermal relaxation and plastic deformation .	By comparing results from atomistic computer simulations and calorimetry , we show that increasing plastic deformation of equilibrated NC $ \mathrm { Pd_ { 90 } Au_ { 10 } } $ specimen causes an increase of the stored GB enthalpy $ \Delta \gamma $ .
One of these modes undergoes an Ising transition by spontaneously breaking the sublattice symmetry .	We calculate the critical point , the renormalization of the phonon frequency and the average lattice distortion .
An added complication is the tendency of protoplanetary disks in binaries to become eccentric , giving rise to additional excitation of planetesimal eccentricity .	Here , for the first time , we analytically explore secular dynamics of planetesimals in binaries such as $ \alpha $ Cen and $ \gamma $ Cep under the combined action of ( 1 ) gravity of the eccentric protoplanetary disk , ( 2 ) perturbations due to the ( coplanar ) eccentric companion , and ( 3 ) gas drag .
We present an updated description of the Planck Low Frequency Instrument ( LFI ) data processing pipeline , associated with the 2015 data release .	We point out the places where our results and methods have remained unchanged since the 2013 paper and we highlight the changes made for the 2015 release , describing the products ( especially timelines ) and the ways in which they were obtained .
Recent work has shown that structural variants ( insertions , deletions , inversions and transpositions ) are a major source of genetic variation , often out-numbering single nucleotide variants in terms of total bases affected .	Despite the near ubiquity of structural variants , major questions about their interaction with natural selection remain .
We select host galaxies housing pockets of gas-particles , young and with different thresholds in metallicities , that can be sites of LRGB events , according to the collapsar model .	The simulated samples are compared with 18 observed LGRB hosts in the aim at discriminating whether the metallicity is a primary parameter .
By the consequence of Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters theorem , each basis set of local measurement on the third part will correspond to a particular decomposition of the bipartite mixed state into a weighted sum of pure states .	It is possible to associate an average bipartite entanglement ( $ \bar { \mathcal { S } } $ ) with each of these decompositions .
The blood glucose concentration ranged from 41.4 to 435.6 mg/dL .

The VOCs were later recovered by thermal desorption and analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry .
The perturbations , which are confined near the peak of the light curves , can be easily distinguished from the central perturbations caused by planets .	However , the degeneracy between close and wide binary solutions can not be resolved with a $ 3\sigma $ confidence level for 3 events , implying that the degeneracy would be an important obstacle in studying binary distributions .

But is it really this result , as it would seem to suggest our common sense , the prelude to an inevitable phase of ungovernability ?	Can a Parliament with changing majorities in Senate to be as efficient as a Parliament with a large majority in both the Houses ?
Thus , RDEC can be considered as the simplest , clean tool for investigation of the electron-electron interaction in the presence of electromagnetic fields generated during ion-atom collisions .	Within this dissertation , the 38 MeV O ( 8+ ) + C experiment , conducted at Western Michigan University using the tandem Van de Graaff accelerator , is discussed and the first experimental evidence of the RDEC process is presented .
We have also shown that the ring closing time for a chain with hydrodynamic interaction in theta solvent scales with the chain length ( N ) as N^ ( 1.527 ) , in good agreement with previous renormalization group calculation based prediction by Freidman et al . ( Phys.Rev.A .	40 , 5950 ( 1989 ) ) .
We observe that the phase diagram of a dyonic black hole in constant electric potential and magnetic charge ensemble is similar to that of a Van der Waals fluid with chemical potential .	Phase transitions and other critical phenomena have been studied in presence of magnetic charge and chemical potential .
We model actin filaments as two chains of one-dimensional binary-state semi-totalistic automaton arrays to describe hypothetical signalling events therein .	Each node of the actin automaton takes state `0 ' ( resting ) or `1 ' ( excited ) and updates its state in discrete time depending on its neighbour 's states .
However , they will prove to be a powerful tool for explicit calculations and proofs of finite dimensionality results .	We develop a structure theory for certain graphs $ G_x $ of unramified Hecke operators , which is of a similar vein to Serre 's theory of quotients of Bruhat Tits trees .

The bubbles are followed until the point of break-out into the halo , starting from an initial adiabatic phase to a radiative phase .	We show that a key property which sets the fate of bubbles in the ISM is the gas surface density , through the work done by the expansion of bubbles and its role in setting the gas scaleheight .
The particle Randers transformations are achieved through the Finslerian Killing equation which also shows the equivalence between observer and particle Randers transformation .	For a constant background vector , the Randers transformations can be regarded as a deformed directional-dependent Poincar\'e transformation .
We call this duality Spin ( 7 ) duality .	Two theories are named Spin ( 7 ) dual if they have the same moduli space : a real Spin ( 7 ) cone with base a weak G_2 manifold , and they are hence holographic dual to the same AdS_4 x G_2 M theory solution .
We show that the minimum edge length is a spectral invariant .	We give an upper bound for the size of isospectral families in terms of the total edge length of the quantum graphs .
AR 11158 , which consisted of two major emerging bipoles , showed prominent activities including one X- and several M-class flares .

Two streams of modeling exist on explaining the dynamics of social networks : 1 ) models predicting links through network properties , and 2 ) models considering the effects of social attributes .	In this interdisciplinary study we work to overcome a number of computational limitations within these current models .
Our results strongly suggest the absence of integrable nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians for the infinite lattices except for the trivial Ising case .	In the vicinity of the Ising case , the largest Lyapunov exponents exhibit a power-law growth , while further away they become rather weakly sensitive to the Hamiltonian anisotropy .
For LBP , we adopt a recently proposed `` turbo '' message passing schedule that alternates between exploitation of HMT structure and exploitation of compressive-measurement structure .	For the latter , we leverage Donoho , Maleki , and Montanari 's recently proposed approximate message passing ( AMP ) algorithm .
In 2010 Spergel introduced an alternative to the traditional Sersic form for galactic luminosity profiles based on modified Bessel functions of the second kind .	His motivation was the desire for an accurate one-parameter profile form with a simple Fourier transform ( in contrast to the Fourier transform of the Sersic profile which ca n't be written in closed form ) , but we have found that the Spergel profile almost universally makes integrals easier when it replaces the Sersic profile in the integrand .
We extract the finite part of spurious external-bubble contributions systematically ; this is crucial for the application of integrand-level CSW rules in theories without supersymmetry .	Our approach yields integrands that are independent of the choice of CSW reference spinor even before integration .
Secure identifications for most spectral lines are given , based on synthetic atmosphere models calculated by our group .	We also propose that two unidentified absorption features have interstellar and/or circumstellar origin .
Our results show that the abundances of N2H+ , CS and H13 CO+ remain quite constant across the galaxy confirming that these species are excellent tracers of the dense molecular gas .	On the contrary , the abundance of CN increases by a factor of 3 in the inner x2 bar orbits .

The relation for a diffusion coefficient due to the random switching of the direction of rotation of their rotary motors is derived on the basis of the master equation .	The obtained relation is confirmed by the direct numerical simulation of random trajectory of a magnetotactic bacterium under the action of the Poisson type internal noise due to the random switching of rotary motors .
One possible such mechanism is suggested by the observation that granular motions in plage areas tend to be slightly `` abnormal '' , dampened compared to quiet sun .	In this paper we consider the effect that abnormal granulation observed in active regions should have on the propagation of acoustic waves .
One of the major types of glycans , N-linked glycans , is formed by sequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of enzymes .	Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as substrates , thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their intermingled pathways .
An individual detected as HIV positive in Cuba is asked to provide a list of his/her sexual contacts for the previous 2 years .	This allows one to gather detailed information on the spread of the HIV epidemic .
Here , we derive predictions for the ( smoothed ) cumulants of the velocity divergence field $ \theta \equiv \nabla\cdot\vv $ for an irrotational fluid in the SC model .	By comparing with the exact analytic results by Scoccimarro & amp ; Frieman ( 1996 ) , it is shown that , at least for the unsmoothed case , the loop corrections to the cumulants of $ \theta $ are dominated by tidal effects .
The wave-guide in question is equipped with a mirror below and a rough absorber above .	We show that such a system acts as a quantum filter , i.e.it effectively absorbs quantum states with sufficiently high transversal energy but transmits low-energy states .
It turns out that good performance in the `` classic '' case provides no performance guarantees when memory capacity fluctuates : roughly speaking , moving from static to dynamic capacity can mean the difference between optimality within a factor 2 in space and time , and suboptimality by an arbitrarily large factor .	More precisely , adopting the competitive analysis framework , we show that some online paging algorithms , despite having an optimal ( h , k ) -competitive ratio when capacity remains constant , are not ( 3 , k ) -competitive for any arbitrarily large k in the presence of minimal capacity fluctuations .
Such postulates enable us to reason about selecting alternative change options , and consequently to develop a machinery that automatically performs this task .	We further argue that a possible implementation of such a change propagation process can be considered as a classical state space search in which each state represents a snapshot of the model in the process .
For large $ \omega $ , the spectral density oscillates around the zero-temperature result with an exponentially decreasing amplitude .	Contrast this with QCD where the spectral density of the current-current correlator approaches the zero temperature result like $ ( T/\omega ) ^4 $ .
Learning problems in the text processing domain often map the text to a space whose dimensions are the measured features of the text , e.g. , its words .	Three characteristic properties of this domain are ( a ) very high dimensionality , ( b ) both the learned concepts and the instances reside very sparsely in the feature space , and ( c ) a high variation in the number of active features in an instance .
A special law of variation for the Hubble parameter proposed by Berman ( 1983 ) has been utilized to solve the field equations .	The Berman 's law yields two explicit forms of the scale factor governing the FRW space-time and constant values of deceleration parameter .
Using this analogy , we investigate the applicability of a real space renormalisation group approach , originally developped for quantum spin systems , to interacting particle systems .	We apply the technique to an exactly solvable reaction-diffusion system and to the contact process ( both in $ d=1 $ ) .
A state-of-the-art ultra-low threshold nanolaser has been successfully developed though embedding quantum dots into photonic crystal cavity ( PhCC ) .	However , several core challenges impede the practical applications of this architecture , including the random positions and compositional fluctuations of the dots , extreme difficulty in current injection , and lack of compatibility with electronic circuits .
These solutions give a rather non-trivial examples of real tunnelling geometries .	Possible interpretation of obtained results and their connection with inflationary cosmology is discussed .
The influence of the three dimensional magnetic field and the space charge effect was considered to extract the highly charged ion beam .	In this paper , the design results of the extraction system were reported in detail .
The forming and melting of complementary base pairs in RNA duplexes are conformational transitions required to accomplish a plethora of biological functions .	Yet the dynamic steps of these transitions have not been quantitatively characterized at the molecular level .
The 17 Very Red Objects ( VROs ; 3.5 & lt ; I-K ' & lt ; 4 ) are also significantly detected ( 1.32 +/- 0.19 mJy ) , bringing the combined VRO and ERO contribution to 2.59 +/- 0.19 x 10^4 mJy per square degree .	There is a substantial systematic uncertainty ( about a factor of two ) in this value due to field-to-field variation , but even with this uncertainty it is clear that a large fraction of the 850-micron background arises from red objects .
The considerations will then be extended to the asymptotic limit , and we will prove some asymptotic continuity properties .	We proceed by investigating the entanglement of formation and the relative entropy of entanglement in the infinite-dimensional setting .
We apply $ 2FACE $ to a variety of geometric routing algorithms .	Our simulation results indicate that bi-directional face traversal decreases the latency of message delivery two to three times compared to single direction face traversal .
An effective tight-binding description of such helical Shiba chains involves long-range ( power-law ) hopping and pairing amplitudes which induce an unconventional topological critical point .	At the critical point , we find exponentially localized Majorana bound states with a short localization length unrelated to a topological gap .
We evaluate the formation cross sections of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei using an effective number approach .	We show that the indications of the kaonic bound states can be observed in the outgoing proton energy spectra .
For the Hilbert space \HE of Dirichlet-finite functions on $ G $ , we construct a Gel'fand triple $ S \ci { \mathcal H } _ { \mathcal E } \ci S ' $ .	This yields a probability measure $ \mathbb { P } $ on $ S ' $ and an isometric embedding of $ { \mathcal H } _ { \mathcal E } $ into $ L^2 ( S ' , \mathbb { P } ) $ , and hence gives a concrete representation of the boundary as a certain class of `` distributions '' in $ S ' $ .
The Dirac point gap enhancement can be much larger than that of the minigaps opened by Bragg scattering at principal superlattice harmonics .	This naturally explains the conundrum of large Dirac point gaps recently observed in G/h-BN heterostructures and their tunability by the G/h-BN twist angle .
Such geometries can be modelled by moving nonholonomic frames on ( pseudo ) Riemannian manifolds and describe various types of nonholonomic Einstein , Eisenhart-Moffat and Finsler-Lagrange spaces with connections compatible to a general nonsymmetric metric structure .	Elaborating a metrization procedure for arbitrary distinguished connections , we define the class of distinguished linear connections which are compatible with the nonlinear connection and general nonsymmetric metric structures .
The measured cross section sigma ( pp to ZZ ) = 6.24 [ +0.86/-0.80 ] ( stat . )	[ +0.41/-0.32 ] ( syst . )
We investigate numerically optical properties of novel two-dimensional photonic materials where parallel dielectric rods are randomly placed with the restriction that the distance between rods is larger than a certain value .	A large complete photonic gap ( PG ) is found when rods have sufficient density and dielectric contrast .
The introduction of a periodicity in the third direction ( perpendicular to the layer ) is completely artificial and may lead in some cases to spurious results and to difficulties in treating the action of external fields .	In this paper we develop a new approach , which is `` native '' to quasi-2D materials , making use of basis function that are periodic in the plane , but atomic-like in the perpendicular direction .
It derives the modified radial Diracequation which has the consistency solution involving the quantum neutronradius and the neutron binding energy .	The inevitable solution for otheratomic energy states is only equivalent to the Bohr solution .
Our formalism includes the exact treatment of the so-called Pauli operator in a partial wave expansion of the equation of state .	Nuclear and neutron matter calculations are done using a coupled particle-particle and hole-hole ladder approximation .
This chirally symmetric phase appears to be analytically connected with the expected conformal window of many-flavor continuum QCD .	We perform simulations in the chirally symmetric phase at zero quark mass for various system sizes L , and measure the torelon mass and the Dirac spectrum .
The system is driven out of equilibrium either by considering different values for the noise strengths in the Langevin equations describing the evolution of the dynamic variables ( effectively placing these at different temperatures ) , or more generally by allowing for anisotropic noise strengths , i.e. , by constraining the dynamics to be at different temperatures in d_par- and d_perp-dimensional subspaces , respectively .	In the first , case , we find one infrared-stable and one unstable renormalization group fixed point .
We show by an exact calculation , that the reduced density matrix for a uniformly accelerated observer when the quantum field is in a thermal state of temperature $ T^\prime $ is symmetric between acceleration temperature $ T = a/ ( 2\pi ) $ and the thermal bath temperature $ T^\prime $ .	Thus thermal phenomena can not distinguish whether ( i ) one is accelerating with $ a = 2\pi T $ through a bath of temperature $ T^\prime $ or ( ii ) accelerating with $ a=2\pi T^\prime $ through a bath of temperature T. This shows that thermal and quantum fluctuations in an accelerated frame affect the observer in a symmetric manner .
The conjecture that several recently observed mesons have a structure , which is not dominated by an ordinary quark-antiquark pair , but by a four-quark structure , is being actively investigated both theoretical and experimentally .	Such a state may be characterized as a mesonic molecule or as a diquark-antidiquark pair .
This equation can be linearized around the homogeneous state and a dispersion relation , that depends explicitly on the Fourier modes of the lattice , can be derived .	This allows one to compute the stability thresholds of the homogeneous state , which turn out to depend on the mode number .
Central to this picture is a putative accretion disk which is believed to be the source of the majority of the radiative output .	It is well known , however , that the most extensively studied disk model -- an optically thick disk which is heated locally by the dissipation of gravitational binding energy -- is apparently contradicted by observations in a few major respects .
We consider , in a string theory framework , physical processes of phenomenological interest in models with a low string scale .	The amplitudes we study involve tree-level virtual gravitational exchange , divergent in a field-theoretical treatment , and massive gravitons emission , which are the main signatures of this class of models .
This term is positive definite and leads excess to the neutrino flux over the in-coherent value at macroscopic distance of near detector region .	The flux decreases slowly with distance in a universal manner that is determined by the absolute value of the neutrino mass and energy .
We show that quantum fluctuations trigger the dynamical instability of the Bloch states of the condensate and can lead to the generation of arrays of matter-wave gap solitons .	Our approach also allows us to study the instability-induced anomalous heating of the condensate at the edge of the Brillouin zone and growth of the uncondensed atomic fraction .
From robust spectral energy distributions of these regions we conclude that the present 8.0-micron diffuse calibration of the SST is 36 % too high compared with the MSX validated calibration , perhaps due to scattered light inside the camera .	This is an independent confirmation of the result derived for the diffuse calibration of IRAC by the Spitzer Science Center ( SSC ) .
The model exhibits a 1-st order phase transition of the liquid-gas type .	An extension of the model including the Fisher 's term is also studied .
In a previous work , we analyzed the non-decoupling effects in the two and three point Green 's functions of gauge fields .	We complete here the calculation of the chiral effective operators by analyzing the four point functions .
At low fields , the effect of a magnetic field is through the direct modification of the quasiparticle density of states of the superconductor , and magnetic field and bias current are interchangable , as is expected for homogeneous dirty-limit superconductors .	At the field where a first vortex enters the detector , the effect of the magnetic field is reduced , up until the point where the critical current of the detector starts to be determined by flux flow .
Our studies clearly show that earlier authors have incorrectly reported the tetragonal structure in the I4/m space group for SrLa ( FeTi ) O6 and the cubic structure in the Fm3m space group for BaLa ( FeTi ) O6 .	The correct structure is found to be orthorhombic in the Pnma space group for SrLa ( FeTi ) O6 while cubic in the Pm3m space group for BaLa ( FeTi ) O6 .
This flaring event , which lasted a total of about three hours , was detected simultaneously by EPIC on XMM-Newton and the NICMOS near-infrared camera on the HST .	Given the inherent difficulty in , and the lack of readily available methods for quantifying the probability of a periodic signal detected over only several cycles in a data set where red noise can be important , we developed a general method for quantifying the likelihood that such a modulation is indeed intrinsic to the source and does not arise from background fluctuations .
For $ 0 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; 1 $ we furnish the closed form expressions for the inverse Laplace transforms $ \mathcal { L } ^ { -1 } [ F ( p^ { \alpha } ) ; x ] $ and $ \mathcal { L } ^ { -1 } [ p^ { \alpha-1 } F ( p^ { \alpha } ) ; x ] $ .	In both cases they involve definite integration with kernels which are appropriately rescaled one-sided L\ ' { e } vy stable probability distribution functions $ g_ { \alpha } ( x ) $ , $ 0 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; 1 $ , $ x & gt ; 0 $ .
When the energy densities of the beam and the magnetic field are comparable , $ \alpha = 8\pi n_0m_pc^2 ( \Gamma_0-1 ) /B^2_0\sim 1 $ , the process of the beam -- barrier interaction is strongly nonstationary , and the density of reversed protons is modulated in space by a factor of 10 or so .	The modulation of reversed protons decreases with decrease of $ \alpha $ .
The complex structure of solutions of the classical nonlinear ( real-valued ) wave equation and quantization are closely connected among themselves and allow to construct non-perturbatively the quantum field theory with interaction $ : \ ! \phi^4_4\ !	: $ in four-dimensional space-time .
This star is also ultra-Be deficient .	Relative to Be in the Li-normal stars at [ Fe/H ] = $ - $ 2.7 , G 182-26 is down in Be by more than 0.8 dex .
Similar , but much simpler , constructions hold for other noncompact Lie groups such as the unitary group U ( p , q ) and the symplectic group Sp ( p , q ) .	This extension provides a starting point for an abundance of constructions in ( higher ) geometry and applications in physics .
Decoupling of four component currents of dimension 1/2 in them yields , respectively , u ( 2|1 ) and u ( 3 ) Knizhnik-Bershadsky superconformal algebras .	We also discuss how the N=2 superfield formulations of N=2 W_ { 3 } and N=2 W_ { 3 } ^ { ( 2 ) } superconformal algebras come out in this framework , as well as some unusual extended N=2 superconformal algebras containing constrained N=2 stress tensor and/or spin 0 supercurrents .
The specific shear viscosity $ \bar\eta $ of a classically rotating system of nucleons that interact via a monopole pairing interaction is calculated including the effects of thermal fluctuations and coupling to pair vibrations within the selfconsistent quasiparticle random-phase approximation .	It is found that $ \bar\eta $ increases with angular momentum $ M $ at a given temperature $ T $ .
We study a model of spinless fermions with infinite nearest-neighbor repulsion on the square ladder which has microscopic supersymmetry .	It has been conjectured that in the continuum the model is described by the superconformal minimal model with central charge c=3/2 .
In contrast , the choice of micron-sized colloidal building blocks of particles with flat facets , i.e. , particles with polygonal shapes , is significantly more limited .	This can be attributed to the fact that , contrary to nanoparticles , the larger colloids are significantly harder to synthesize as single crystals .
On the other side , the 3+1 formulation of general relativity provides a powerful setting for studying the spacetime dynamics , in particular gravitational radiation from black hole systems .	Here we revisit the kinematics and dynamics of null hypersurfaces by making use of some 3+1 slicing of spacetime .
The action of this theory is that of d=4 , N=2 supergravity , up to a twist .	The topological field theory is SU ( 2 ) invariant , but the full SO ( 4 ) invariance is recovered after untwist .
In this approach , an orthoalgebra is considered as a general structure for propositions in a physical theory .	We proved that an orthoalgebra admits cloning operation if and only if it is a Boolean algebra .
Here we develop a simplified , idealized model of impact conditions that can be adapted to fit the details of specific deflection-test scenarios , such as what is being proposed for the AIDA project .	Ongoing studies based upon the methodology described here can be used to inform observational strategies and safety conditions for an observing spacecraft .
Utilizing in-medium vector spectral functions which describe dilepton data in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions , we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of QCD and Weinberg sum rules at finite temperature .	The starting point is our recent study in vacuum , where the sum rules have been quantitatively satisfied using phenomenological axial-/vector spectral functions which describe hadronic tau-decay data .
An error analysis result is given for classical Gram -- Schmidt factorization of a full rank matrix $ A $ into $ A=QR $ where $ Q $ is left orthogonal ( has orthonormal columns ) and $ R $ is upper triangular .	The work presented here shows that the computed $ R $ satisfies $ \normal { R } =\normal { A } +E $ where $ E $ is an appropriately small backward error , but only if the diagonals of $ R $ are computed in a manner similar to Cholesky factorization of the normal equations matrix .
We study the moduli space of 4d N=1 supersymmetric QCD in the Veneziano limit using Hilbert series .	In this limit , the numbers of colours and flavours are taken to be large with their ratio fixed .
Practical issues about the implementation of the rule are also covered in this paper by : ( a ) writing down ready-to-implement algorithms ; ( b ) analysing the numerical stability of the computations and ( c ) estimating the overall computational cost .	We finish by showing some numerical experiments which illustrate the theoretical results presented in this paper .
The obtained expressions are equivalent to the formally derived helicity $ \alpha_d $ and diffusivity $ \eta_d $ in the first paper of this series .	The model we propose predicts that the $ \alpha $ -effect in galactic discs has opposite sign with respect to that resulting directly from the sign of the Coriolis force .
Participation in conferences is an important part of every scientific career .	Conferences provide an opportunity for a fast dissemination of latest results , discussion and exchange of ideas , and broadening of scientists ' collaboration network .
To this end we employ the technique of extended Burnside rings .	Our main theorem is that the Ganter-Kapranov 2-character is a particular mark homomorphism of the Burnside ring .
The approach is based on recent results of random matrix theory .	We extend our previous results to a more difficult situation where some spikes are equal , and compare our algorithm to an existing benchmark method .
We have studied the gamma-ray flux observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System ( HESS ) from the J1745-290 Galactic Center source .	The data are well fitted as annihilating dark matter in combination with an astrophysical background .
FRET radii were experimentally estimated in background electrolyte solution ( 0.01 M NaNO3 ) and proved to be 3.9 +- 0.3 nm and the data are in satisfactory agreement with the theoretically calculated value Ro = 3.5 +- 0.3 nm .	Concentration of DNA sites , exposed to Cu ( II ) , Cu ( I ) , Ag ( I ) ions , AgNPs impact as well as laser irradiation ( { \lambda } = 457 nm ) and temperature , which are applicable for intercalation , were estimated in relative units .
This work investigates phase separation of a monodisperse gas of inelastically colliding hard disks confined in a two-dimensional annulus , the inner circle of which represents a `` thermal wall '' .	When described by granular hydrodynamic equations , the basic steady state of this system is an azimuthally symmetric state of increased particle density at the exterior circle of the annulus .
We present a spectroscopic catalog of 67082 M dwarfs from the LAMOST pilot survey .	For each spectrum of the catalog , spectral subtype , radial velocity , equivalent width of H $ { \alpha } $ , a number of prominent molecular band indices and the metal sensitive parameter $ \zeta $ are provided .
As a key step , we prove a central limit theorem for triangular arrays of stationary $ m $ -dependent random fields with unbounded $ m $ .	We also apply a moment inequality recently established for stationary random fields .
A uniqueness theorem is proved , namely it is shown that the minimal 2-D surface $ \Sigma $ describing a captured stationary string coincides with a { \it principal Killing surface } , i.e.a surface formed by Killing trajectories passing through a principal null ray of the Kerr-Newman geometry .	Geometrical properties of principal Killing surfaces are investigated and it is shown that the internal geometry of $ \Sigma $ coincides with the geometry of a 2-D black or white hole ( { \it string hole } ) .
Thus obtained low-energy Hamiltonian is solved by the path-integral renormalization-group method , where spatial and dynamical fluctuations are fully considered .	An application to Sr $ _2 $ VO $ _4 $ shows that the scheme is powerful in agreement with experimental results .
The comoving source has a projected separation of 130 '' , corresponding to 2500 AU at the distance of the primary ( 19.2 pc ) .	If it is physically associated , then its absolute magnitude at 4.5um is ~1 mag fainter than the faintest known T dwarfs , making it a strong candidate for the coolest known brown dwarf .
In diffusion index forecasts , identified factors are strongly related to several directly measurable economic variables such as consumption-wealth variable , financial ratios , and term spread .	To incorporate the explanatory power of these observed characteristics , we propose a new two-step estimation procedure : ( i ) regress the data onto the observables , and ( ii ) take the principal components of the fitted data to estimate the loadings and factors .
In some cases , people do not know what the right behaviors are to protect the environment .	Game engine has been used in the AEC industry for visualization .
The widely-accepted theoretical treatment of the electromagnetic boundary problem of evanescent wave transfer at an interface between a normal medium of n=1 and an ideal negative index medium of n=-1 neglects the non-zero induced surface current and charge densities at the interface and is self-inconsistent .	We re-solve the electromagnetic boundary problem by taking into account the non-zero induced surface current and charge densities that have been neglected so far by others .
In this paper we study the case c_X=2 .	We show that up to a birational modification given by a sequence of flips , X has a conic bundle structure , or an equidimensional fibration in Del Pezzo surfaces .
The liquid argon -- germanium system ( LArGe ) is operated as a 4 $ \pi $ anti-Compton spectrometer to suppress backgrounds in the HPGe .	This R & amp ; D is carried out in the framework of the GERDA experiment which searches for 0 $ \nu\beta\beta $ decays with HPGe detectors enriched in $ ^ { 76 } $ Ge .
These results can not be explained in terms of conditional probabilistic outcomes of projective measurements .	However , a classical model has been recently put forward that can reproduce peculiar expectation values , reminiscent of weak values .
Then we consider the Prym map and analyze it using tautological classes .	We study the locus of curves with an etale double cover of p-rank 0 in some detail .
The following branching fractions are also determined : $ { \cal B } ( B^0 \to D^ { *- } p { \bar p } \pi^+ ) = ( 5.61\pm 0.59\pm 0.73 ) \times 10^ { -4 } $ , $ { \cal B } ( B^0 \to { \bar D } ^ { *0 } p { \bar p } ) = ( 0.67\pm 0.21\pm 0.09 ) \times 10^ { -4 } $ , and $ { \cal B } ( B^0 \to { \bar D } ^ { 0 } p { \bar p } ) = ( 1.24\pm 0.14\pm 0.12 ) \times 10^ { -4 } $ .	In each decay mode the invariant mass spectra of the charmed mesons and the baryons are compared with a pure phase-space hypothesis in order to gain insight into the $ B $ meson decay dynamics .
When there is non-collinear magnetization in the sample however , there will be significant scattering from one spin state into the other and the reference potentials will differ between the incoming and outgoing wavefunctions , changing the angle and intensities of the scattering .	The theory of the scattering and recommended experimental practices for this type of measurement are presented , as well as an example measurement .
It is shown that either nonlocal or nonlinear effects may cut off the linear- $ T $ dependence of both the free energy and the penetration depth in all the experimental geometries .	At extremely low $ T $ , the nonlocal effects will also generically modify the linear $ H $ dependence of the penetration depth ( `` nonlinear Meissner effect '' ) in most experimental geometries , but for supercurrents oriented along the nodal directions , the effect may be recovered .
We discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of parameters for the binding and final state interactions .	We find these uncertainties to be more pronounced at the larger missing momenta explored by the ( gamma , p ) reaction .
It was pointed out in the first part of this study that EPR-type entanglement is defined by the possibility of performing any of two mutually incompatible distant , i. e. , direct-interaction-free , measurements .	They go together under the term 'EPR-type disentanglement ' .
We give three formulas expressing the Smale invariant of an immersion f of a ( 4k-1 ) -sphere into ( 4k+1 ) -space .	The terms of the formulas are geometric characteristics of any generic smooth map g of any oriented 4k-dimensional manifold , where g restricted to the boundary is an immersion regularly homotopic to f in ( 6k-1 ) -space .
Traditional parallel schedulers running on cluster supercomputers support only static scheduling , where the number of processors allocated to an application remains fixed throughout the execution of the job .	This results in under-utilization of idle system resources thereby decreasing overall system throughput .
Composition-driven structural transitions in Bi1-xCaxFe1-xMnxO3 ceramics prepared by the tartaric acid modified sol-gel technique have been studied to analyze its effect on the magnetic properties of bismuth ferrite ( BiFeO3 ) .	It was observed that the co-substitution of Ca & amp ; Mn at Bi & amp ; Fe sites in BiFeO3 ( BFO ) significantly suppress the impurity phases .
We present UBVRI photometry obtained from Mosaic images of M31 and M33 using the KPNO 4-m telescope .	The survey covers 2.2 sq degrees of M31 , and 0.8 sq degrees of M33 , chosen so as to include all of the regions currently active in forming massive stars .
Furthermore , we study the precision that can be achieved for the solar parameters , $ \sin^2 2\theta_ { 12 } $ and $ \Delta m_ { 21 } ^2 $ , with a mobile reactor and with a conventional power station .	With the mobile reactor , a precision slightly better than from current global fit data is possible , while with a power reactor , the accuracy can be reduced to less than 1 % .
We would like to prove something like the following : a ) That there exists an infinite index set $ I $ , and a family of mappings indexed by $ I $ , $ \ { F_i\ , |\ , i\in I\ } \subset { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) $ such that $ $ { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) = { \rm Aut } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) \cup\bigcup_ { i\in I } R_ { F_i } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) , $ $ where if $ i\ne j $ then $ R_ { F_i } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) \cap R_ { F_j } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) =\emptyset $ .	b ) That the parallel representation to the representation described in ( a ) above holds true , this time with respect to the left composition operators $ L_ { G_j } $ .
This is primarily motivated by growing observational evidence that clusters have essentially experienced no-evolution since redshift $ z\approx1 $ , indicating that the contribution of a time-dependent potential to CBR anisotropy discussed in literature could be rather small for the dynamically-relaxed clusters .	Using the softened isothermal sphere model and the universal density profile for the mass distribution of rich clusters , we calculate the CBR anisotropy by the time-delay effect and compare it with those generated by the thermal and kinematic S-Z effects as well as by the transverse motion of clusters .
To perform accurate numerical investigations by the finite differences or finite element method , one must consider a specific problem known as the numerical dispersion of waves .	Numerical dispersion may increase the numerical error during the propagation process as the wave velocity ( phase and group ) depends on the features of the numerical model .
In this \textit { Letter } , we report a strong detection of the [ CII ] line in the host galaxy of the brightest quasar known at $ z & gt ; 6.5 $ , the Pan-STARRS1 selected quasar PSO J036.5078+03.0498 ( hereafter P036+03 ) , using the IRAM NOEMA millimeter interferometer .	Its [ CII ] and total far-infrared luminosities are $ ( 5.8 \pm 0.7 ) \times 10^9 \ , L_\odot $ and $ ( 7.6\pm1.5 ) \times 10^ { 12 } \ , L_\odot $ , respectively .
A total of twelve of those sources are detected .	For eleven of them an accurate position and in part detection of X-ray pulsations support the proposed identification as Be/X-ray binaries .
We explain the relation between the Baecklund transformations and the energy shift of the dual field theory state .	We show that the Baecklund transformations can be represented as a finite-time evolution generated by a special linear combination of the Pohlmeyer charges .
It is therefore straightforward to partition the full N-particle Hilbert space into active and inactive parts to implement the frozen-orbital method .	In the frozen-core approximation , for example , the core electrons can be eliminated in the correlated part of the calculations , greatly increasing the computational efficiency , especially for heavy atoms .
For this scenario , we derive sample complexity bound for the Minimum Disagreement Algorithm ( MDA ) on the number of labeled examples to be obtained from each annotator .	Next , we consider the incomplete information scenario , where each annotator is strategic and holds the respective noise rate as a private information .
Motivated by these findings , we employ a recently developed schematic mode-coupling theory [ Brader \textit { et al . }	( 2009 ) ] to investigate the three dimensional flow of a colloidal glass , subject to a combination of simple shear and uniaxial compression .
We intrinsically characterize such common lines in terms of the unembedded geometric data detected in experiments .	We show these common lines form a semi-algebraic set , i.e. , they are defined by polynomial equalities and inequalities .
The Swift Burst Alert Telescope ( BAT ) is a huge ( 5200 cm2 ) coded aperture imager that will detect gamma-ray bursts in real time and provide a location that the Swift satellite will use to slew the optical and x-ray telescopes .	The huge size of BAT is a challenge for the on-board triggering : a change as small as 1 % is equivalent to a 1 sigma statistical variation in 1 second .
We characterize the ISS variation by an rms amplitude and a timescale and examine the statistics of these parameters for the 121 sources with significant ISS at 2 GHz .	We model the scintillations using the NE2001 Galactic electron model assuming the sources are brightness-limited .
Sine preserving self-mappings are studied , and a complete description of the linear ones is given .	In the last section we exhibit a version of the Law of Sines for Radon planes .
In contrary to atomic spin glasses , strong cooling rate effects are observed , and no evidence for temperature-chaos is found .	The flip time of a magnetic moment is much longer than that of an atomic spin and hence much shorter time scales are probed within the experimental time window for a superspin glass than for an atomic spin glass .
Our work is a fundamental study of the notion of approximation in V-categories and in ( U , V ) -categories , for a quantale V and the ultrafilter monad U .	We introduce auxiliary , approximating and Scott-continuous distributors , the way-below distributor , and continuity of V- and ( U , V ) -categories .
The resulting orthonormal and complete loop basis , explicitly constructed in terms of the $ d ( 2d-1 ) $ prepotential intertwining operators , is used to transcribe the gauge dynamics directly in $ { \cal H } ^ { L } $ without any redundant gauge and loop degrees of freedom .	Using generalized Wigner-Eckart theorem and Biedenharn -Elliot identity in $ { \cal H } ^L $ , we show that the loop dynamics for pure SU ( 2 ) lattice gauge theory in arbitrary dimension , is given by the real symmetric $ 3nj $ symbols of first kind ( e.g. , n=6 , 10 for d=2 , 3 respectively ) .
In the present work , we study the $ ( \beta ^ { - } \beta ^ { - } ) _ { 0\nu } $ decay for the $ 0^ { + } \to 0^ { + } $ transition in the mass mechanism and extract limits on effective mass of light as well as heavy neutrinos from the observed half-lives $ T_ { 1/2 } ^ { 0\nu } ( 0^ { + } \to 0^ { + } ) $ using nuclear transition matrix elements calculated with the same set of wave functions .	Further , the effect of deformation on the nuclear transition matrix elements required to study the $ ( \beta ^ { - } \beta ^ { - } ) _ { 0\nu } $ decay in the mass mechanism is investigated .
We find 8 such objects in the region , giving a comoving number density comparable to that of nearby bright galaxies ( for a flat q $ _0 $ =0.5 , H $ _0 $ =100 kms $ ^ { -1 } $ Mpc $ ^ { -1 } $ universe ) .	We provide basic data on the properties of these objects , and show that despite their absolute magnitude being significantly brighter than L $ ^* $ ( typically M $ _B $ = -22 ) , they are generally smaller than nearby galaxies .
The model has a continuous transition as a function of hole-density x and temperature T to a phase in which a current circulates in each unit cell .	This phase preserves the translational symmetry of the lattice while breaking time-reversal invariance and the four-fold rotational symmetry .
The observations were taken approximately once per day between 2009 May and 2011 April .	Each image covers 11.8 square degrees and has 100 arcsecond FWHM resolution .
Specifically , we find that the longitudinal stretching mode and the radial breathing mode are coupled via the strong deformation potential , while twist modes couple more weakly via a mechanism involving modulation of the electronic hopping amplitudes between carbon sites .	A special case are bending modes : for symmetry reasons , their coupling is only quadratic in the vibron coordinate .
A secondary emission component is quite clearly needed , and while this could also be thermal at a temperature significantly lower than kT~15 keV , the best fit ( to the combined PCA and HEXTE datasets ) is obtained with a power law secondary spectral component .	The deduced parameters of the non-thermal ( NT ) emission imply a significant fractional flux amounting to ~25 % of the integrated 3-50 keV emission .
93 , 150601 ( 2004 ) ] in the general idea that the phase transition is signaled by a topological discontinuity .	We show that in both models the phase transition energy v_c is actually non-coincident with , and always higher than , the energy v_theta at which a topological change appears .
The network appears to be driven to a random Boolean network with uniform in-degree of two in the large network limit .	However , for biologically realized network sizes , significant finite-size effects are observed including a broad in-degree distribution and an average in-degree connection between two and three .
The Spin Foam Model for the SO ( 4 , C ) BF theory is discussed .	The Barrett-Crane intertwiner for the SO ( 4 , C ) general relativity is systematically derived .
We also estimate the anharmonic expansion from Fe ( 56- & gt ; 54 ) isotope substitution to \Delta a=5.1 10^ { -4 } \AA and \Delta d_ { Fe-As } = 2.510^ { -4 } \AA and the shift of harmonic zero point fluctuations of bond lengths & lt ; \Delta x^2 & gt ; & lt ; =3 10^ { -5 } \AA^2 , giving a total relative average decrease of electronic hopping integrals of |\delta t|/t & lt ; = 2.0 10^ { -4 } .	The results poses a serious challenge for any theory of superconductivity in the pnictides that does not include electron-phonon interactions to produce a sizable Fe-isotope effect .
Planetary nebulae had a double anniversary in 2014 , 250 year since their discovery and 150 year since the correct spectroscopic identification .	This paper gives an overview of planetary nebula research published in 2014 .

We find that it is possible to realize observationally supported spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations provided that the correction is dominated by the $ ( \nabla \phi ) ^4 $ term even in the absence of the dilaton potential .	When the Gauss-Bonnet term is dominant , tensor perturbations exhibit violent negative instabilities on small-scales about a de Sitter background in spite of the fact that scale-invariant scalar perturbations can be achieved .
We describe a mean field interacting particle system in any number of dimensions and in a generic external potential as an ideal gas with fractional exclusion statistics ( FES ) .	We define the FES quasiparticle energies , we calculate the FES parameters of the system and we deduce the equations for the equilibrium particle populations .
$ \Gamma\cap P^ { n-p+1 } _\nu $ est le bord d'une surface de Riemann dans $ P^ { n-p+1 } _\nu $ .4 .	Aucun ouvert non vide de $ \Gamma\cap P^ { n-p+1 } _\nu $ n'est reel analytique .
We find a transition somewhat stronger than in 2-loop perturbation theory , leading to the conclusion that from the point of view of the non-equilibrium constraint , MSSM electroweak baryogenesis can be allowed even for a Higgs mass mH \approx 115 GeV .	We also find that small values of the mass parameter mA ( \lsim 120 GeV ) , which would relax the experimental constraint on mH , do not weaken the transition noticeably for a light enough stop .
A similar statement applies to the $ K_0 $ group of the boundary crossed product $ C^* $ -algebra $ C ( \Omega ) \rtimes\Gamma $ .	If the Tits system has type $ \widetilde A_2 $ , exact computations are given , both for the crossed product algebra and for the reduced group $ C^* $ -algebra .
We compute the generating function of random planar quadrangulations with three marked vertices at prescribed pairwise distances .	In the scaling limit of large quadrangulations , this discrete three-point function converges to a simple universal scaling function , which is the continuous three-point function of pure 2D quantum gravity .
Gravity is described in this approach not by one Riemannian metric ( i.e.a symmetric two-tensor field ) but by a multiplet of such fields , or by a matrix-valued symmetric two-tensor field that satisfies certain conditions .	We define the matrix extensions of standard constructions of differential geometry including connections and curvatures , and finally , an invariant functional of the new field that reduces to the standard Einstein action functional in the commutative ( diagonal ) case .
A global analysis of a large set of hadronic scattering data provides empirical constraints on the allowed range of the gluino mass as a function of the value of the strong coupling strength alpha_s ( M_Z ) .	We find that the gluino mass m_ { \widetilde { g } } & gt ; 12 GeV for the standard model world-average value alpha_ { s } ( M_ { Z } ) =0.118 .
On the other hand , non-termination analysis seems to remain a much less attractive subject .	If we divide this line of research into two kinds of approaches : dynamic versus static analysis , this paper belongs to the latter .
Localization lengths of superconducting quasiparticles $ \lambda_s $ are evaluated and compared with the corresponding normal state values $ \lambda_n $ in one and two dimensional lattices .	The effect of superconducting correlation on the localization of quasiparticles is generally stronger in an off-site pairing state than in an on-site pairing state .
We also obtain the general expressions of the tensor-to-scalar ratio , scalar spectral index .	We develop this model by using exponential potential , the characteristics of this model is calculated in great details .
We emphasize that SN Ia evolution differs in an important respect from the kind of evolution that has foiled some past projects in observational cosmology , and we outline empirical strategies that will take it into account .	The supporting role of physical models of SNe Ia also is discussed .
This method , first discussed by Tremaine & amp ; Weinberg in the context of external galaxies , requires projected positions , $ ( l , b ) $ , and line-of-sight velocities for a spatially complete sample of relaxed tracers .	If the local standard of rest ( LSR ) has a zero velocity in the radial direction ( $ u_ { \rm LSR } $ ) , then the quantity that is measured is $ \Delta V \equiv \Omega_p R_0 - V_ { \rm LSR } $ , where $ \Omega_p $ is the pattern speed of the non-axisymmetric feature , $ R_0 $ is the distance of the Sun from the Galactic centre and $ V_ { \rm LSR } $ is the tangential motion of the LSR , including the circular velocity .
This technique allowed to identify contributions of the Fe and Ti originating electronic states to the valence band .	Two valence states of iron Fe2+ and Fe3+ , detected on the base of XAS spectra , appeared to form quite different contributions to the valence band of SrTiO3 .
We define the mean extrinsic curvature for spaces with Minkowski signature and introduce the concept of mean torsion .	Its orthogonal projection defines the dual mean extrinsic curvature .
The genetic algorithm was run using the designed experiment on a set of 206 polychlorinated biphenyls searching on structure-activity relationships having known the measured octanol-water partition coefficients and a family of molecular descriptors .	The experiment shows that different selection and survival strategies create different partitions on the entire population of all possible genotypes .
Across a broad range of material types , the DDEC6 NACs reproduced electron transfer trends , core electron binding energy shift trends , and electrostatic potentials across multiple system conformations with excellent accuracy compared to other charge assignment methods .	Due to non-nuclear attractors , Bader 's quantum chemical topology could not assign NACs for some of these materials .
The phase field model obeys a Cahn -- Hilliard equation and is two-way coupled to the standard Navier -- Stokes equations .	Starting from this system of equations we have first performed a linear analysis from which we have analytically rederived the known gravity-capillary dispersion relation in the limit of vanishing mixing energy density and capillary width .
From the measured $ P_ { \infty } $ and $ S $ we obtain the critical exponents $ \beta_k $ and $ \gamma_k $ for $ k=2 $ and 3 .	Here $ \beta_k $ and $ \gamma_k $ are the critical exponents for $ P_\infty $ and $ S $ when the growth of clusters spontaneously breaks the $ Z_k $ symmetry of the $ k $ -partite graph ( Lau , Paczuski , and Grassberger , 2012 ) .
Was it Hubble , or Lema\^itre , or was it just the end result of a long series of investigations ?	In this article we summarise the main steps and contributions that led to one of the most exciting discoveries ever made , of which Lema\^itre was the principal architect .
It is analytically found that when ghost fields relax on the same time scale as the hydrodynamic ones , their major effect is a net enhancement of the fluid viscosity .	The bare fluid viscosity is recovered by letting ghost fields evolve on a much longer time scale .
We have performed a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation to study the emergence of a twisted magnetic flux tube from -20,000 km of the solar convection zone to the corona through the photosphere and the chromosphere .	The middle part of the initial tube is endowed with a density deficit to instigate a buoyant emergence .
A very long binary-lensing caustic crossing event , EROS-BLG-2000-5 , was found in the 2000 season and monitored by EROS .	EROS photometric data for this event are presented .
We present continuous , monochromatic star formation rate ( SFR ) indicators over the mid-infrared wavelength range of 6-70 micron .	We use a sample of 58 star forming galaxies ( SFGs ) in the Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey ( SSGSS ) at z & lt ; 0.2 , for which there is a rich suite of multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy from the ultraviolet through to the infrared .
In the last few decades many efforts have been made to understand the effect of spiral arms on the gas and stellar dynamics in the Milky Way disc .	One of the fundamental parameters of the spiral structure is its angular velocity , or pattern speed $ \Omega_p $ , which determines the location of resonances in the disc and the spirals ' radial extent .
We provide a clear numerical evidence that the relation between the exponent $ \tau $ of avalanche size distribution obtained by maximum likelihood estimation and the $ q $ value of appropriate q-Gaussian obeys the analytical result recently introduced by Caruso et al . [ Phys.Rev .	E \textbf { 75 } , 055101 ( R ) ( 2007 ) ] .
Particles representing the solution are moved according to their characteristic velocities .	Particle interaction is resolved locally , satisfying exact conservation of area .
First , we explain that its cohomology is trivial also in the Ramond sector .	Then , we show that the boundary state corresponding to it is identically zero .
Emission lines of HCO+ ( 1-0 ) , HCN ( 1-0 ) , and C2H ( 1-0 ) were simultaneously detected in most galaxies of our sample .	We also tentatively detected the rare isotopic species , H13CN , HC15N and H13CO+ in up to four galaxies ( IC 694 , NGC 3690 , NGC 4258 and NGC 6240 ) .
In these vacua both conformal invariance and baryonic symmetries are spontaneously broken .	We present a detailed discussion of the supergravity moduli space , which involves flat form fields on asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau manifolds , and match this to the gauge theory vacuum moduli space .
We give a detailed derivation of the way to make this supersymmetric string in the laboratory .	In particular , we discuss the presence of a fermionic bound state in the vortex core and the tuning of the laser beams needed to achieve supersymmetry .
In addition , we map the OCS J=18-17 line and complete complementary observations of several OCS lines at selected positions around Orion IRc2 ( the position selected for the survey ) .	We report the first detection of OCS v2 = 1 and v3 = 1 vibrationally excited states in space and the first detection of C3S in warm clouds .
In this paper we will show how ML techniques can be used to support knowledge acquisition for information extraction systems .	It is often very difficult to specify an explicit domain model for many information extraction applications , and it is always labor intensive to implement hand-coded heuristics for each new domain .
A proper 2-tone $ k $ -coloring of a graph is a labeling of the vertices with elements from $ \binom { [ k ] } { 2 } $ such that adjacent vertices receive disjoint labels and vertices distance 2 apart receive distinct labels .	The 2-tone chromatic number of a graph $ G $ , denoted $ \tau_2 ( G ) $ is the smallest $ k $ such that $ G $ admits a proper 2-tone $ k $ coloring .
In particular , the broadened widths of the profiles , together with large amplitude variations in the centroid velocity with elongation angle , indicate that a significant population of dust is on eccentric orbits .	In addition , the wide , flat-bottomed line profile toward the ecliptic pole indicates a broad distribution of orbital inclinations extending up to about 30\dg - 40\dg with respect to the ecliptic plane .
We show that the Cyg X-1 spectrum accumulated by OSSE , BATSE , and COMPTEL in 1991 -- 95 , as well as the HEAO-3 gamma1 and gamma2 spectra can be well fitted by our model .	The derived parameters are in qualitative agreement with the picture in which the spectral changes are governed by the mass flow rate in the accretion disc .
We provide a systematic treatment of color superconductivity in the instanton model .	We show that the structure of the superconductor depends on the number of flavors .
We use the concept of junction-tree solutions ( Chekuri et al. , FOCS 2006 ) that play an important role in solving the offline versions of the problem via a greedy subroutine -- an inherently offline procedure .	Our main technical contribution is in designing an online algorithm using only the existence of good junction-trees to reduce an MC-BB instance to multiple SS-BB sub-instances .
In the X-ray band , they offer the potential of probing accretion physics down to the event horizon .	Recent work has used frequency and energy-dependent time lags as a tool for studying relativistic reverberation around the black holes in several Seyfert galaxies .
Moreover , analytical and numerical descriptions are presented that do not only reproduce qualitative features but can also be used to accurately model and predict the characteristics of experimental systems .	Particular emphasis lies on temporal dissipative Kerr solitons with regard to optical frequency comb generation where they are of particular importance .
This is achieved by limiting ourselves to straight pieces of string , surrounded by locally flat sections of space-time .	Globally , however , the model is not finite , because solutions tend to generate infinite fractals .
Several tools exploit this fact to fingerprint and monitor users .	Often , though , these tools assume to access the entire traffic , including IP addresses and payloads .
For the applications of the three-dimensional dynamical systems , we investigate several special cases and give the exactly dynamical solutions in detail .	Furthermore , we proved that the dark energy density parameter $ \Omega_ { \phi } $ would obey the same differential equation not only for all the scalar models in this paper but also for all the non-coupled dark energy models under the GR frame .
The Polyakov-loop extended Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio ( PNJL ) model has the same properties as two-color QCD for $ { \cal C } { \mathbb Z } _ { 2 } $ symmetry and the pseudo-reality .	The nontrivial correlation between the chiral restoration and the deconfinement are investigated by introducing the entanglement vertex in the PNJL model .
We find that the spin signal detected in the 3T configuration is dominated by a bias-dependent spin detection sensitivity , which in turn is strongly correlated with charge-transport properties of the junction .	This results in a particularly strong enhancement of the detected spin signal in a region of increased differential resistance .
The matter content of the Standard Model admits a global symmetry due to the generational structure of the spectrum respected by all interactions except for fermion couplings to the Higgs doublet .	This symmetry is identified as the largest possible global symmetry of the free theory and extended to the case of massive neutrinos .
We give strong lower bounds on the complexity of SDD representations by relating SDD size to best-partition communication complexity .	We use this relationship to prove exponential lower bounds on the SDD size for representing a large class of problems that occur naturally as queries over probabilistic databases .
In this contribution I will show how these factors evolve with pseudorapidity and collision centrality .	We see a Cronin-like enhancement in d+Au collisions at midrapidity , going to a strong suppression at eta & gt ; = 2 .
Double $ J/\psi $ production on the order of 20-30 pb has been observed by the NA3 collaboration .	These $ \psi \psi $ pairs , measured in $ \pi^- N $ interactions at 150 and 280 GeV $ /c $ and in $ pN $ interactions at 400 GeV $ /c $ , carry a large fraction of the projectile momentum , $ x_ { \psi \psi } \geq 0.6 $ for the 150 GeV $ /c $ beam and $ \geq 0.4 $ at 280 GeV $ /c $ .
It was recently noted that there are apparent differences in properties of radio-quiet and radio-loud subsets .	In particular , average observed radio-loud pulsar is younger than radio-quiet one and is located at smaller galactic latitude .
Kramers-Kronig analysis is commonly used to estimate the optical properties of new materials .	The analysis typically uses data from far infrared through near ultraviolet ( say , 40 -- 40,000 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ or 5 mev -- 5 eV ) and uses extrapolations outside the measured range .
The results on the existence of a suitable Hilbert product are partial .	They were derived in collaboration with Abhay Ashtekar .
Electrically charged systems bound by a strong gravitational force can sustain a huge amount of electric charge ( up to 10^20C ) against Coulomb repulsion .	General relativistically such systems form a stable hydrostatic configuration both in the non-rotating and rotating cases .
and by Ta-Shma , suggest that quantum computers may have an exponential advantage in solving a wealth of linear algebraic problems , over classical algorithms .	Building on the quantum intuition of these results , we step back into the classical domain , and explore its usefulness in designing classical algorithms .
The amplitude of oscillations is strongly enhanced in some `` magic '' magnetic fields .	The wire cross-section S can be measured along with the Fermi surface cross-section , S_F .
The number of identity curling subsequences in a simple connected graph $ G $ is denoted $ ic ( G ) . $ We show that the curling number conjecture holds for the degree sequence of a simple connected graph $ G $ on $ n \geq 1 $ vertices .	We also introduce the notion of the compound curling number of a simple connected graph $ G $ and then initiate a study on the curling number of certain standard graphs like Jaco graphs and set-graphs .
An efficient scheme is introduced for a fast and smooth convergence to the thermodynamic limit with finite size cluster calculations .	This is obtained by modifying the energy levels of the non interacting Hamiltonian in a way consistent with the corresponding one particle density of states in the thermodynamic limit .
Monte Carlo simulations using semiempirical interatomic potential , first-principles total energy calculations , and experimental spectroscopy are used .	In order to obtain a general picture of the relation of the atomic interactions and properties of Fe-Cr alloys in bulk , surface , and interface regions several complementary methods has to be used .
This is a desirable property for modeling problems in computational auditory scene analysis , since distinct sound sources in the environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding magnitude spectrogram .	We propose inference and learning algorithms that leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement .
We describe the University of Sheffield system used in the TempEval-2 challenge , USFD2 .	The challenge requires the automatic identification of temporal entities and relations in text .
We show how a formal series expansion of the invariant measure of a Langevin dynamics numerical method can be obtained in a straightforward way using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff lemma .	We then compare Langevin dynamics integrators in terms of their invariant distributions and demonstrate a superconvergence property ( 4th order accuracy where only 2nd order would be expected ) of one method in the high friction limit ; this method , moreover , can be reduced to a simple modification of the Euler-Maruyama method for Brownian dynamics involving a non-Markovian ( coloured noise ) random process .
This signal is more prominent in the first-half of the Kepler data , and is not due to leakage of the rotating spot signal into our measurement of the transit depths , or due to unocculted starspots .	We investigate the suggestion that this signal could be due to an active region on the star , emitting enhanced ultraviolet or X-ray radiation leading to an increased mass loss rate of the planet ; we confirm that such a scenario could cause both modulation of the transit depths of KIC 12557548b , and small enough transit-timing variations that they might not be detected in the Kepler data .
A very related , but discrete problem ( studied separately in the past ) is the online Multimedia Content Delivery ( MCD ) problem on line networks , presented originally by Papadimitriu , Ramanathan , and Rangan .	An efficient content delivery was modeled as a low cost Steiner arborescence in a grid of network*time they defined .
We consider both semidiscrete triangulations with continuous time and explicit Euler schemes with time step small enough for the method to be stable .	We find sharp uniform bounds for the convergence rate as a function of the degree of smoothness which we conjecture .
We investigate the energy-momentum distribution for a metric exterior to a spherically symmetric black hole in the brane world by applying the Landau-Lifshitz and Weinberg prescriptions .	In both the aforesaid prescriptions , the energy thus obtained depends on the radial coordinate , the mass of the black hole and a parameter $ \lambda_ { 0 } $ , while all the momenta are found to be zero .
A neural-network based hadronic $ B $ -meson tagging method is used in this study .	The branching fraction of $ B^-\to p\bar p\ell^-\bar\nu_\ell $ is measured to be $ ( 5.8^ { +2.4 } _ { -2.1 } \textrm { ( stat .
In our analysis , we pursue the simplest physical description of the dominant features in the radiation , providing an interpretation of the waveforms in terms of an { \em implicit rotating source } .	This interpretation applies uniformly to the full wave train , from inspiral through ringdown .
Let \kappa \neq \omega_1 , and let us consider the following three statements : ( a ) there exists an algorithm A ( whose execution always terminates ) which takes as input a Diophantine equation D and returns the answer YES or NO which indicates whether or not the equation D has a solution in non-negative integers , if the solution set Sol ( D ) satisfies card ( Sol ( D ) ) & lt ; \kappa , ( b ) the function f_ { \kappa } is majorized by a computable function , ( c ) if a set M \subseteq N^n has a ( \kappa-1 ) -fold ( finite-fold , if kappa=\omega ) Diophantine representation , then M is computable .	We prove that ( a ) is equivalent to ( b ) and ( a ) implies ( c ) .
The United Nations regularly publishes projections of the populations of all the world 's countries broken down by age and sex .	These projections are the de facto standard and are widely used by international organizations , governments and researchers .
We present the discovery of four new transiting hot jupiters , detected mainly from SuperWASP-North and SOPHIE observations .	These new planets , WASP-52b , WASP-58b , WASP-59b , and WASP-60b , have orbital periods ranging from 1.7 to 7.9 days , masses between 0.46 and 0.94 M_Jup , and radii between 0.73 and 1.49 R_Jup .
A significant genuine three-pion BEC enhancement near threshold was observed having an emitter source radius of r_3 = 0.580 +/- 0.004 ( stat . )	+/- 0.029 ( syst . )
We construct an action of a polynomial ring on the colored sl ( 2 ) link homology of Cooper-Krushkal , over which this homology is finitely generated .	We define a new , related link homology which is finite dimensional , extends to tangles , and categorifies a scalar-multiple of the sl ( 2 ) Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant .
In this paper we wish to carry out the analytical expression which allows us to describe the super sonic nonlinear interstellar gas flow in rapidly rotating galaxy disk which is made by the spiral density wave .	One of characteristic parameters of theory is the amplitude of spiral density wave potential corresponding to separatrix , which separates super sonic flows from flows containing the jump from super sonic flows to subsonic .
Then we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the laws $ \mathbb { P } _x $ to converge weakly to the law of $ X^ { ( 0 ) } $ as $ x $ goes to 0 .	In particular , this answers a question raised by Lamperti [ Z. Wahrsch.Verw .
The detector setup is a pixelated detector from the Medipix/Timepix family with high-voltage post-acceleration capabilities .	The mass spectral and imaging performance of the system is tested with various benchmark samples and thin tissue sections .
For similar algebraic structures $ B_i $ , $ i\in I $ let $ \Pi ( B_i|i\in I ) $ and $ \Pi _ { \mathcal { D } } ( B_i|i\in I ) $ denote the direct product and the ultraproduct of $ B_i $ , respectively .	Let $ \mathcal { D } ^* $ denote the ultraproduct congruence on $ \Pi ( B_i|i\in I ) $ .
Despite the strong coupling between optical depth and temperature which determines a spectral shape insensitive to their precise values , moderate spectral changes are possible .	The spectral variability patterns can be used as diagnostics for coronal physics and should allow to determine whether the optical depth of the corona is dominated by e+e- pairs .
Weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) are amongst the most interesting dark matter ( DM ) candidates .	Many DM candidates naturally arise in theories beyond the standard model ( SM ) of particle physics , like weak-scale supersymmetry ( SUSY ) .
Clusters older than 1 Gyr show a spread in cluster core radii that increases with age , while the youngest clusters have relatively compact cores .	No evidence for post core collapse clusters was found .
In this paper , an experimental method is presented for investigating the ion wakefield which employs a new oscillation technique designed to perturb a two-particle vertical chain .	Using this technique , damped free fall oscillations are generated via an external DC bias to the lower electrode .
Based on the unique feature , we demonstrate that highly entangled photons can be produced and photonic controlled phase gate can be constructed .	In this construction , the scheme is symmetric for the probe and signal pulses .
We analyze the structure of the resulted four-dimensional dynamical system with the methods of the center manifold theory and the normal form theory .	It is shown that an initially expanding closed FRW universe , starting close to the Minkowski spacetime , can not avoid recollapse .
We study the associated field of multidimensional Laurent power series .	In the second part we use the resolution of singularities techniques to study the geometry near a complete flag of subvarieties and the Parshin 's residues .
We study the contribution to the entanglement entropy of ( 2+1 ) -dimensional conformal field theories coming from a sharp corner in the entangling surface .	This contribution is encoded in a function $ a ( \theta ) $ of the corner opening angle , and was recently proposed as a measure of the degrees of freedom in the underlying CFT .
Then , we obtained a spectrum in the H-band ( with SofI at the NTT ) of this companion showing that it has spectral type M1-3 , consistent with being a companion of HD 358623 A ( K7-M0 ) .	Also , a companion candidate with a 1 arcsecond offset being 2 mag fainter than HD 199143 is detected .
Our typical result shows that under some extra conditions , if the closed unit disc is complete $ K ' $ -spectral for $ \phi ( T ) $ for every $ \phi\in \Phi $ , then $ \overline\Omega $ is complete $ K $ -spectral for $ T $ for some constant $ K $ .	In particular , we prove that under a geometric transversality condition , the intersection of finitely many $ K ' $ -spectral sets for $ T $ is again $ K $ -spectral for some $ K\ge K ' $ .
This ratio decreases to only ~23 and 5 for x=0.20 and x=0.4 samples , respectively .	Further , the x=0.60 sample shows onset of a broad superconducting transition temperature ( Tconset ) at around 20 K without achieving the TcR=0 state down to 2 K. The TcR=0 state is observed in x = 0.80 and 1.00 samples at around 5 and 14 K , respectively .
A complete characterization of closed subgroups of powers of the symmetric group is obtained .	It is also shown that every AE ( 0 ) -group is Baire isomorphic to the product of Polish groups .
We introduce a theoretical model for the compaction of granular materials by discrete vibrations which is expected to hold when the intensity of vibration is low .	The dynamical unit is taken to be clusters of granules that belong to the same collective structure .
For small wavelength modes , the Green 's function for $ f_+ $ exhibits a remarkable transition from Lorentz to Galilean invariance , whereas for $ f_- $ such modes effectively do not propagate .	For both cases Lorentz invariance is recovered at long wavelengths .
In this paper we have shown that it is possible to induce particle production even if the mass term of a particle species is not varying in time .	Such particles are produced through the interactions with other fields , whose mass terms are varying due to a time-dependent background .
We illustrate our idea in an experimentally feasible circuit quantum electrodynamics scenario .	Due to the intrinsic competition with the atom-field coupling strength , we first demonstrate that this atom-atom interaction can exhibit a novel topological quantum interference effect arising from the instanton and anti-instanton tunneling paths .
We test this scheme in pressure-driven 2D Poiseuille flow of the nonlinear generalized Maxwell fluid .	In the steady state , comparison with an analytical solution shows good agreement .
We consider a hierarchical network that consists of mobile users , a two-tiered cellular network ( namely small cells and macro cells ) and central routers , each of which follows a Poisson point process ( PPP ) .	In this scenario , small cells with limited-capacity backhaul are able to cache content under a given set of randomized caching policies and storage constraints .
Web services are building blocks of interoperable systems .	Composing Web services makes the processes capable of doing complex tasks .
There are some curves which do not occur in the singularity theory .	In this article we describe the Casson invariant of A'Campo 's knots as a J^ { +/- } -type invariant of the immersed curves .
The most extreme starbursts occur in galaxy mergers , and it is now acknowledged that dynamical triggering has a primary importance in star formation .	This triggering is due partly to the enhanced velocity dispersion provided by gravitational instabilities , such as density waves and bars , but mainly to the radial gas flows they drive , allowing large amounts of gas to condense towards nuclear regions in a small time scale .
This very question has been addressed by B.DeWitt and others .	In this article we introduce Gromov 's $ \varepsilon $ -approximation topology on the above moduli space for a closed smooth manifold .
It is known that the $ k $ -faces of the permutohedron $ \Pi_n $ are labeled by ( all possible ) linearly ordered partitions of the set $ [ n ] =\ { 1 , ... , n\ } $ into $ ( n-k ) $ non-empty parts .	The incidence relation corresponds to the refinement : a face $ F $ contains a face $ F ' $ whenever the label of $ F ' $ refines the label of $ F $ .
Several phenomenological interacting forms are proposed and are fitted with observations in the literature .	In this paper we investigate the possible interaction in a way independent of specific interacting forms by use of observational data ( SNe , BAO , CMB and Hubble parameter ) .
The Cherenkov Telescope Array ( CTA ) is the next generation of ground-based very high energy gamma-ray instruments and is planned to be built on two sites ( one in each hemisphere ) in the coming years , with full array operation foreseen to begin 2020 .	The goal of performing high precision gamma-ray energy measurements while maximizing the use of observation time demands detailed and fast information about atmospheric conditions .
Historically , modelers have restricted themselves to water-rich planets with CO2 and H2O as the only important greenhouse gases .	More recently , some researchers have suggested broadening the definition to include arid , 'Dune ' planets on the inner edge and planets with captured H2 atmospheres on the outer edge , thereby greatly increasing the HZ width .
Previous works show strong winds exist in hot accretion flows around black holes .	Those works focus only on the region close to the black hole thus it is unknown whether or where the wind production stops at large radii .
The simulations , based on a relativistic quantum lattice Boltzmann method , permit to compute the transmission coefficient across the sample , thereby providing an estimate for the conductivity as a function of impurity concentration and strength of the potentials .	It is found that the conductivity loss due to impurities is significantly higher for wave-packets of massive particles , as compared to massless ones .
The typical Doppler parameters found for the Ly-alpha lines lie in the interval b=20\div30 km/s , corresponding to temperatures T & gt ; 24000K , with a fraction of the order 15 % in the range 10 & lt ; b & lt ; 20km/s .	These values are still consistent with models of low density , highly ionized clouds .
We give an algorithm to list all the chambers and other strata ( this is independent of $ d $ ) .	With the help of a computer , we obtain the list of all the chambers for $ m\leq 9 $ and all the strata when $ m\leq 8 $ .
In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching ' , in which we are given a domain theory , some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed , and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept .	The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory , such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples .
Based on this fundamental property for example the holonomy-flux *-algebra has been formulated .	A generalisation of the one-to-one correspondence between infinitesimal objects : connections and curvature and path based objects : holonomy maps and parallel transports is used to replace the configuration space of the theory .
Recent studies have shown that the distribution of satellite galaxies is preferentially aligned with the major axis of their central galaxy .	The strength of this alignment has been found to depend strongly on the colours of the satellite and central galaxies , and only weakly on the mass of the halo in which the galaxies reside .
Existing methods which claim to measure the reduced shears are not necessarily accurate to the second order when a point spread function ( PSF ) is present .	We show that the method of Zhang ( 2008 ) exactly measures the reduced shears at the second order level in the presence of PSF .
We consider current observational constraints on the presence of cool , optically thick disk material in quiescent black hole binaries , specifically focusing on a case study of the prototypical system A0620-00 .	Such material might be expected to be present theoretically , but is usually claimed to make a negligible contribution at optical and infrared wavelengths .
Here we present a class of systems which fail to follow this rule .	We show that for convex billiards of constant width with time reversal symmetry and `` almost '' chaotic dynamics the energy level distribution is of GUE-type .
We use the spin angular momentum representation to describe formally the nonlinear operators that produce the spin squeezing .	The quantitative and qualitatively characterization of the spin squeezing phenomena is performed through a squeezing parameter and squeezing angle developed for the two-mode BEC system , and , as well , by the Wigner quasi-probability distribution function .
The combinatorics is based on the finite pigeon hole principle and results in a descent lemma .	From the descent lemma one can prove Dickson 's lemma , then guess what the bound might be , and verify it by an appropriate proof .
Thermal properties are of great interest in modern electronic devices and nanostructures .	Calculating these properties is straightforward when the device is made from a pure material , but problems arise when alloys are used .
About 100 stars show an excess of mid-infrared light above that expected from their photospheric emission .	This is plausibly due to dust formation in mass flowing from these stars .
The study reveals that the damping of the medium has strong effect in the propagation of torsional wave .	Since every medium has damping so it is more realistic to use the damped wave equation instead of the undamped wave equation .
It has turned out to be an unusually fruitful idea , crossing boundaries between particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology .	An axion with mass of order $ 10^ { -5 } $ eV ( with large uncertainties ) is one of the leading candidates for the dark matter of the universe .

This upper limit exceeds the expected GRXE intensity in the GA direction by an order of magnitude , given the near-infrared ( NIR ) surface brightness of the Milky Way in this region and the standard hard X-ray-to-NIR intensity ratio for the GRXE , assuming stellar origin .	Based on the CGRO/EGRET surface brightness of the Galaxy above 100 MeV as a tracer of the cosmic-ray ( CR ) induced gamma-ray background , the expected GRXE flux in GA exceeds the measured 2 sigma upper limit by a factor of 4 .
This nonlocality is responsible for the deviation of the power law exponent from $ \alpha=1/\nu $ of the edge fluid .	There are gapless edge excitations described by chiral boson fields and the number of branches of chiral boson fields can be related to the polarization states of electrons in the bulk .
The method is the complex Langevin equation , which has been used previously to study complex Hamiltonians in statistical physics and in Minkowski space .	We compute the equal-time one-point and two-point Green 's functions in zero and one dimension , where comparisons to known results can be made .
Here we find that bearings can be perceived as physical realizations of complex networks of oscillators with asymmetrically weighted couplings .	Accordingly , these networks can exhibit optimal synchronization properties through fine tuning of the local interaction strength as a function of node degree [ Motter , Zhou , and Kurths , Phys.Rev .
Monte Carlo techniques provide superior accuracy , however , they often require large computation resources , which render them impractical for routine clinical use .	Track-repeating algorithms , for example the Fast Dose Calculator , have shown promise for achieving the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations for proton radiotherapy dose calculations in a fraction of the computation time .
In such frameworks , linear acyclic models are typically used to model the datagenerating process of variables .	Recently , it was shown that use of non-Gaussianity identifies a causal ordering of variables in a linear acyclic model without using any prior knowledge on the network structure , which is not the case with conventional methods .
Three 2-DOF parallel mechanism architectures dedicated to machining applications are studied in this paper .	The three mechanisms have two constant length struts gliding along fixed linear actuated joints with different relative orientation .
Remarkably , $ 2^ { \lfloor \log_2 { k } \rfloor + 2 } $ symmetric Boolean functions on $ 2k $ variables with maximum algebraic immunity are constructed , which is much more than the previous constructions .	Based on our construction , a lower bound of symmetric Boolean functions with algebraic immunity not less than $ d $ is derived , which is $ 2^ { \lfloor \log_2 { d } \rfloor + 2 ( k-d+1 ) } $ .
The observations span a period of about 12 years starting from mid-1996 ( the minimum of cycle 23 ) to early-2008 ( near minimum of cycle 24 ) , corresponding to a nearly complete solar activity cycle .	We demonstrate that the frequencies do vary in phase with the solar activity indices , however the degree of correlation differs from phase to phase of the cycle .
For unpolarized electrons there exist no persistent charge currents , but persistent spin currents .	We show that , in general , the magnitude of the persistent spin current in a ring depends on the direction of the direct current flow from one reservoir to another .
These data sets include expression microarrays for genes and microRNAs -- short , non-coding strands of RNA that downregulate gene expression through RNA interference -- as well as days_to_death and days_to_last_followup fields for each tumor sample .	Our aim is to develop a software tool that screens TCGA data sets for genes/miRNAs with functional involvement in specific cancers .
The domains being close to the walls are lamellar-ordered , where the hydrodynamic effects dominate .	The patterns in the bulk of the system are nearly isotropic , where the domain growth results mainly from the diffusion mechanism .
Part of our technical developments is a minimal chiral subtraction scheme within dimensional regularization , which leads to a manifest realization of the covariant chiral counting rules .	All SU ( 3 ) symmetry-breaking effects are well controlled by the combined chiral and large N_c expansion , but still found to play a crucial role in understanding the empirical data .
We also study the smooth and singular loci of the degenerate flag varieties .	We show that the Euler characteristic of the smooth locus is equal to the large Schr\ '' oder number and the Poincar\'e polynomial is given by a natural statistics counting the number of diagonal steps in a Schr\ '' oder path .
A new approach to the modular , complex systems analysis of nonlinear dynamics in cell cycling network transformations involved in carcinogenesis is proposed .

Further the observations of external galactic nuclei will allow unprecedented measurements of physical parameters ( i.e.structure and luminosity ) in these systems .	With the exception of a few 'self-referencing ' sources these faint-target observations will benefit from the available off-axis wavefront-correction system .
Our studies reveal that the end groups do not affect spin and charge velocities in any significant way , but change the amount of charge transported .	We have compared these push-pull systems with donor-acceptor substituted polymethine imine ( PMI ) , $ D- ( CHN ) _ { x } -A $ , systems in which besides electron affinities , the nature of $ p_ { z } $ orbitals in conjugation also alternate from site to site .
The pi-A isotherms and molefraction versus area per molecule studies indicate complete immiscibility of sample ( BQ ) and matrix ( PMMA or SA ) molecules .	This immiscibility may lead to the formation of microcrystalline aggregates of BQ molecules in the mixed LB films .
We demonstrate that the Dirac theory requires short-distance regularization for potentials which are more singular than 1/r .	The formalism is then applied to scattering off a smooth short-ranged potential .
Spatial ecological networks are widely used to model interactions between georeferenced biological entities ( e.g. , populations or communities ) .	The analysis of such data often leads to a two-step approach where groups containing similar biological entities are firstly identified and the spatial information is used afterwards to improve the ecological interpretation .
We propose and analyze a two-state valence-bond model of non-equilibrium solvation effects on the excited-state twisting reaction of monomethine cyanines .	Suppression of this reaction is thought responsible for environment-dependent fluorescence yield enhancement in these dyes .
Bose-Einstein condensation can happen either from the chiral symmetry broken phase or from the restored phase .	We show that the onset of the chiral phase transition is restricted in the area where there is no Bose-Einstein condensation .
We study biased { \em orientation games } , in which the board is the complete graph $ K_n $ , and Maker and Breaker take turns in directing previously undirected edges of $ K_n $ .	At the end of the game , the obtained graph is a tournament .
We compute their spectra using Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization and use the AdS/CFT correspondence to relate them to anomalous dimensions in the dual field theory at strong coupling , expressed as a series expansion in powers of 1/N .	These effects resemble those due to $ k $ -body forces between quarks in Hartree-Fock models of baryons at large $ N $ .

Nitrogen is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe , yet the gas-phase chemistry of N-bearing species remains poorly understood .	Nitrogen hydrides are key molecules of nitrogen chemistry .
Moreover , in the case of quartz GeO $ _2 $ and cristobalite GeO $ _2 $ , all O-Ge-O bond angles vary when the volume of the GeO $ _2 $ bulk changes from the equilibrium point , which causes further deformation of tetrahedra .	In contrast , the tilt angle formed by Si-O-Si in SiO $ _2 $ markedly changes .
This paper describes a connectionist model of the acquisition of morphology which is shown to exhibit transfer of this type .	The model treats the morphology acquisition problem as one of learning to map forms onto meanings and vice versa .
Usual quantum statistics is written in Fock space but it is not an algebraic theory .	We show that at a deeper level it can be algebraically formalized defining the different statistics as ( multi-mode ) coherent states of the appropriate ( but different from the usual ones ) Lie-Hopf groups .
Even more fascinating is its outstanding physical properties ; it is the hardest material known in the world with the highest thermal conductivity .	Meanwhile , when we turn to its electrical properties , diamond is a rather featureless electrical insulator .
At the relatively bright X-ray fluxes ( F_ { 2-10 keV } & gt ; 4x10^ { -15 } cgs ) and near-infrared magnitude probed by the present observations , the fraction of AGN ( i.e. , X-ray detected ) among the ERO population is small ( ~3.5 % ) ; conversely , the fraction of EROs among hard X-ray selected sources is much higher ( ~20 % ) .	The X-ray properties of EROs detected in our XMM-Newton observation indicate absorption in excess of 10^ { 22 } cm^ { -2 } in a large fraction of them .
In this paper , we formulate the problem of data association in smart camera networks as an Integer Programming problem by introducing a set of linking variables , and propose two distributed algorithms , namely L-DD and Q-DD , to solve the Integer Programming problem using dual decomposition technique .	In our algorithms , the original IP problem is decomposed into several sub-problems , which can be solved locally and efficiently on each smart camera , and then different sub-problems reach consensus on their solutions in a rigorous way by adjusting their parameters based on projected sub-gradient optimization .
We study the variant of the problem in which clients can enter and exit the highway at any point .	We provide an $ O ( n^3 ) $ -time algorithm that solves this variant , where $ n $ is the number of clients .
We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastable phases , the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by the parameters of the system .	With this model we can construct , for example , a system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable phases .

Using two Chandra observations we have derived estimates of the dust distribution and distance to the eclipsing high mass X-ray binary ( HMXB ) Cen X-3 using the energy-resolved dust-scattered X-ray halo .	By comparing the observed X-ray halos in 200 eV bands from 2-5 keV to the halo profiles predicted by the Weingartner & amp ; Draine interstellar grain model , we find that the vast majority ( about 70 % ) of the dust along the line of sight to the system is located within about 300 pc of the Sun , although the halo measurements are insensitive to dust very close to the source .
The unintegrated parton densities in a proton and in a photon are determined using the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin ( KMR ) prescription .	Additionally , we use the CCFM-evolved unintegrated gluon as well as valence and sea quark distributions in a proton .

Dispersion sum rules are considered within the ladder approximation of a field-theoretic model with OPE given by ordinary loop diagrams which are computable for any number of loops .	A correlator of two currents within the model complies with all requirements of standard QCD sum rules approach for fitting low-lying resonances such as fast convergence and good stability while the exact spectrum contains no resonance .
In the broadcasting part , as our resource initial state , we start with general two qubit state and consider specific examples like , non maximally entangled state ( NME ) , Werner like state ( WS ) , and Bell diagonal state ( BDS ) .	We apply both state dependent/ state independent cloners , both locally and non-locally , in each of these cases .
Moreover , strictly local minimum points of $ \frac { q^2 } { b } $ on the boundary can also give vortex solutions for the shallow water equation .	As a further study we construct vortex pair solutions as well .
Here an instance consists of a graph G = ( V , E ) , a positive cost function c : V- & gt ; Z^ { + } , a partition $ P_1 , ... , P_r $ of the edge set $ E $ , and a parameter $ k_i $ for each partition $ P_i $ .	The goal is to find a minimum cost set of vertices which cover at least $ k_i $ edges from the partition $ P_i $ .
Star-forming galaxies are predicted to contribute considerably to the cosmic gamma-ray background ( CGB ) as they are confirmed gamma-ray emitters and are the most numerous population of gamma-ray sources , although individually faint .	Even though the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope will be able to resolve few star-forming galaxies individually , their fractional contribution to the CGB should become far more significant than it was for past measurements of the CGB as many of the brighter , formerly unresolved sources will be resolved out .
The typical column densities of the cores are $ N ( H_2 ) \sim 3.8 \times 10^ { 21 } $ cm $ ^ { -2 } $ and the typical volume densities are $ n ( H_2 ) \sim 2 \times 10^3 $ cm $ ^ { -3 } $ .	They are therefore significantly less dense than many other samples obtained in other ways .
Let $ \A $ be an affine line arrangement in $ \C^2 , $ with complement $ \M ( \A ) . $ The twisted ( co ) homology of $ \M ( \A ) $ is an interesting object which has been considered by many authors , strictly related to the ( co ) homology of the Milnor fibre associated to the conified arrangement .	In this paper we give a vanishing conjecture of such homology of a different nature with respect to the known results : namely , we conjecture that if the graph of double points of the arrangement is connected then there is no nontrivial monodromy .

In the 80 years since the seminal Einstein , Podolsky , and Rosen ( EPR ) paper , physicists and philosophers have mused about the `spooky action at a distance ' aspect of quantum mechanics that so bothered Einstein .	In his formal analysis of EPR-type entangled quantum states , Bell ( 1964 ) concluded that any hidden variable theory designed to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics must necessarily be nonlocal and allow superluminal interactions .
We show that the functional vdW-DF2 gives a potential-energy curve , potential-well energy levels , and difference in lateral corrugation promisingly close to the results obtained by resonant elastic backscattering-diffraction experiments .	The backscattering barrier is found selective for choice of exchange-functional approximation .
We also introduce corrections to the scattering lengths that improve the accuracy of our quantum-defect model for higher order partial waves , a particularly important result for an accurate description of shape and Feshbach resonances at finite temperature .	The theory is applied to the system composed of a 40Ca+ ion and a Na atom , and compared to numerical coupled-channel calculations carried out using ab initio potentials .

Consider the extremal case where phi ( h ( X ) ) = t ( X ) .	In the situation where T_ { X } is unimodular , Kondo has determined the list of t ( X ) , as well as the actual realizations , and showed that t ( X ) alone uniquely determines the isomorphism class of X ( with phi ( h ( X ) ) = t ( X ) ) .
For the three-component model , numerical solution of the dressed energy equations confirm that the analytical expressions for the critical fields and the resulting phase diagrams at zero temperature are highly accurate in the strong coupling regime .	The results provide a precise description of the quantum phases and universal thermodynamics which are applicable to experiments with cold fermionic atoms confined to one-dimensional tubes .
We perform experimental investigations of osmotically driven flows in artificial microchannels by studying the dynamics and structure of the front of a sugar solution traveling in 200 um wide and 50-200 um deep microchannels .	We find that the sugar front travels with constant speed , and that this speed is proportional to the concentration of the sugar solution and inversely proportional to the depth of the channel .
Making the same assumption , the adjoint action of the unique inner-implementing representation U^A associated with A\subset B on the local observables in B is found to define net-endomorphisms of B .	This property is exploited for constructing from B a conformally covariant holographic image in 1+1 dimensions which proves useful as a geometric picture for the joint inclusion A\vee C_max \subset B .

We identify the `` catch-up phenomenon '' as a novel explanation for the slow convergence of Bayesian methods .	Based on this analysis we define the switch distribution , a modification of the Bayesian marginal distribution .
Consequently , HDF850.1 has become a test case of the possibility that the most violently star-forming objects in the universe are too red and/or distant to be seen in the deepest optical images .	Here we report the discovery of the host galaxy of HDF850.1 .
Mathematically , Fourier ptychographic ( FP ) reconstruction can be implemented as a phase retrieval optimization process , in which we only obtain low resolution intensity images corresponding to the sub-bands of the sample 's high resolution ( HR ) spatial spectrum , and aim to retrieve the complex HR spectrum .	In real setups , the measurements always suffer from various degenerations such as Gaussian noise , Poisson noise , speckle noise and pupil location error , which would largely degrade the reconstruction .
This is a novel application in the field of astronomy , because we are using such resources for data mining , and not just performing simulations .	Via a modified implementation of the NCSA cyberenvironment Data-to-Knowledge , we are able to provide improved classifications for over 100 million stars and galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , improved distance measures , and a full exploitation of the simple but powerful k-nearest neighbor algorithm .
The main elements of the system are blocks ( modeling cars ) , springs with unidirectional interactions ( modeling distance keeping interactions between neighbors ) , static and kinetic friction ( modeling inertia of drivers and cars ) and spatiotemporal disorder in the values of these friction forces ( modeling differences in the driving attitudes ) .	The traveling chain of cars correspond to the dragged spring-block system .
The B3LYP functional gives the top site as the preferred site .	This confirms results from cluster studies where it was suggested that the different splitting , dependent on the functional , between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital , could be the reason for this change of the adsorption site .
The question as to why most higher organisms reproduce sexually has remained open despite extensive research , and has been called `` the queen of problems in evolutionary biology '' .	Theories dating back to Weismann have suggested that the key must lie in the creation of increased variability in offspring , causing enhanced response to selection .
We show that there are two types of such Julia sets $ J_P $ .	The \emph { red dwarf } $ J_P $ are nowhere connected im kleinen and such that the intersection of all impressions of external angles is a continuum containing $ p $ and the orbits of all critical images .
At $ \tilde { T } =0.33 $ , we observe a transition between two patterns of behavior : For $ \tilde { T } =0.33-2.15 $ , we find that the heat capacity closely corresponds to that of a trapped normal Fermi gas of atoms with increased mass .	At low temperatures $ \tilde { T } =0.04-0.33 $ , the heat capacity clearly deviates from normal Fermi gas behavior .
techniques , to facilitate the rigorous analysis of electromagnetic ( EM ) fields radiated by sources embedded in tilted , cylindrically-layered geophysical media .	Our method addresses the major challenge in such problems of appropriately approximating the domain boundaries in the computational model while , in a full-wave manner , predicting the effects of tilting in the layers .
We use data from a particularly well-resolved simulation of accretion onto a non-spinning black hole to compute both the radiative efficiency of such a flow and its spectrum if all emitted light is radiated with a thermal spectrum whose temperature matches the local effective temperature .	This disk is geometrically thin enough ( H/r ~= 0.06 ) that little heat is retained in the flow .
Furthermore , we relax the independence assumption between the circular and linear components observed at the same time .	Such an assumption is generally used to alleviate the computational burden involved in the parameter estimation step , but it is hard to justify in empirical applications .
We use the ITU-T E-Model as the quality model and simplify its delay impairment function .	The proposed playout buffer algorithm finds the optimum playout delay using a closed-form solution that minimizes the sum of the simplified delay impairment factor and the loss-dependent equipment impairment factor of the E-model .
We study the conditions under which an almost Hermitian structure $ ( G , J ) $ of general natural lift type on the cotangent bundle $ T^*M $ of a Riemannian manifold $ ( M , g ) $ is K\ '' ahlerian .	First , we obtain the algebraic conditions under which the manifold $ ( T^*M , G , J ) $ is almost Hermitian .
This reliance on directionality has important implications for control layer procedures .	Initial access in particular can be significantly delayed due to the need for the base station and the user to find the proper alignment for directional transmission and reception .

We discuss here some of the implications of these results for our understanding of the initial state of the collision ( Color Glass Condensate ) and for the evolution in the final state ( Glasma and thermalized Quark Gluon Plasma ) .
They also satisfy a quintic relation , as the smallest closed relation .	We conjecture that the algebras $ F_ { d , n } $ support a Markov trace which allow to define polynomial invariants for unoriented knots in an analogous way that the Kauffman polynomial is derived from the BMW algebra .
We calculate the all sky O VII column density distributions for the haloes of three Milky Way like disc galaxies , resulting from cosmological high-resolution , N-body/gasdynamical simulations .	We perform calculations both including the disc gas and without it , so the disc contribution to the column density is quantified .
On the other hand , Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulations show that both the effective pair potentials and the correlation functions are accurately predicted by the RJM .	It is suggested that the lack of self-consistency in the thermodynamics of the RJM is a result of neglected electrostatic correlations between the counterions and coions .
Furthermore , for any generating probability measure on G , B ( X ) admits a unique stationary measure , and when the measure has finite logarithmic moment , it constitutes a compact metric model of the Poisson boundary .	We identify a dense G-delta subset of B ( X ) on which the action of G is Borel-amenable , and describe the relation of these two spaces to the Roller boundary .

A good cover in R^d is a collection of open contractible sets in R^d such that the intersection of any subcollection is either contractible or empty .	Motivated by an analogy with convex sets , intersection patterns of good covers were studied intensively .
There is currently much interest in the possible presence of intermediate-mass black holes in the cores of globular clusters .	Based on theoretical arguments and simulation results it has previously been suggested that a large core radius -- or particularly a large ratio of the core radius to half-mass radius -- is a promising indicator for finding such a black hole in a star cluster .
We compared RXTE data from a superburst with these spectra and found that the spectra predicted by previously published model atmospheres are strongly inconsistent with these high-precision measurements .	In contrast , a simple Bose-Einstein spectrum is fully consistent with the data , as are recently published model atmosphere spectra .

Q-Learning is a model free reinforcement learning method that used to learn the agents .	It is observed that under normal circumstances algorithm take more episodes to reach optimal Q-value due to its normal reward or sometime negative reward .
Geometry of the return map , frequency of UPOs visiting the same trajectory , length of the data set , strength of the noise and degree of nonstationarity affect the efficacy of the proposed method .	Results suggest that establishing determinism from unambiguous UPO detection is often possible in short data sets with significant noise , but derived dynamical properties are rarely accurate and adequate for controlling the dynamics around these UPOs .

We study the edge states for a quantum anomalous Hall system ( QAHS ) coupled with a spin-singlet s-wave superconductor through the proximity effect , and clarify the topological nature of them .	When we consider a superconducting pair potential induced in the QAHS , there appear topological phases with nonzero Chern numbers , $ i.e. $ , $ { \cal N } =1 $ and $ { \cal N } =2 $ , where Andreev bound states appear as chiral Majorana edge modes .

The inclusion of nonvalence degrees of freedom in the analysis of baryon magnetic moments explains extremely strong violation of the standard SU ( 6 ) symmetry-based quark-model prediction for the magnetic moment ratio $ R_ { \Sigma /\Lambda } = ( \Sigma^ { + } + 2\Sigma^ { - } ) / ( -\Lambda ) \simeq .23 $ , while the value $ R_ { \Sigma /\Lambda } ( SU ( 6 ) ) = 1 $ corresponds to the nonrelativistic quark model .	We also obtain $ F/D=.72 $ for the quark-current-baryon coupling $ SU ( 3 ) _ { f } $ ratio .

We consider a tight-binding model on the regular honeycomb lattice with uncorrelated on-site disorder .	We use two independent methods ( recursive Green 's function and self-consistent Born approximation ) to extract the scattering mean free path , the scattering mean free time , the density of states and the localization length as a function of the disorder strength .
We examine pulsar template generation with Bayesian methods .	We will contrast the classical generation mechanism of averaging intensity profiles with a new approach based on Bayesian inference .
In this droplets , magnetite crystals with a size of around 10-20 nm were observed .	These magnetite nanoparticles with superparamagnetic behaviour are arranged to larger aggregates .
Global Climate Models [ GCMs ] and Mesoscale Models [ MMs ] lack the resolution to predict PBL mixing which is therefore parameterized .	Here we propose to adapt the `` thermal plume '' model , recently developed for Earth climate modeling , to Martian GCMs , MMs , and single-column models .
Some observational characteristics in both $ \gamma $ -ray and radio bands , such as the $ \gamma $ -ray emission beams of Crab-like , Vela-like and Geminga-like , can be reproduced by numerical method .	It is predicted that the view angle $ \zeta $ should be larger than the inclination angle ( $ \zeta & gt ; \alpha $ ) , otherwise the $ \gamma $ -ray radiation will have little possibility to be observed .
One interesting possibility is presented by shear-free models in which the anisotropy emerges at the level of the curvature of the homogeneous spatial sections , whereas the expansion is dictated by a single scale factor .	We show that such models represent viable alternatives to describe the large-scale structure of the inflationary universe , leading to a kinematically equivalent Sachs-Wolfe effect .
Large energy gaps on the oblate side of the Nilsson diagrams are found to be related to the magic numbers for the oblate deformation of the harmonic-oscillator potential where the frequency ratios ( $ \omega_ { \perp } : \omega_ { z } $ ) are simple rational numbers .	In contrast , for the prolate deformation the magic numbers obtained from simple rational ratios of ( $ \omega_ { \perp } : \omega_ { z } $ ) of the harmonic-oscillator potential are hardly related to the particle numbers , at which large energy gaps appear in the Nilsson diagrams based on realistic Woods-Saxon potentials .
Unlike previously monitored Seyfert 1 galaxies , in which the X-ray continuum generally varies with a larger amplitude than the UV , in 3C 390.3 the UV continuum light-curve is similar in both amplitude and shape to the X-ray light-curve observed by ROSAT .	The UV broad emission-line variability lags that of the UV continuum by 35-70 days for Ly-alpha and CIV 1549 ; values larger than those found for Seyfert 1 galaxies of comparable UV luminosity .
In the linac , beam instability caused by the fluctuated amplitude and phase of SHBs has been observed .	The reason of the fluctuation is considered to be the multi-pacting in the SHB cavity .
Feynman 's answer was negative .	In this paper , we will revisit the same question for the discrete time Fourier transform uncertainty principle .
Here , we review in detail our recent results , following a similar approach to show the existence of infinitely-sheeted solutions for 2 d.o.f .	Hamiltonians which exhibit , upon perturbation , subharmonic bifurcations of resonant tori around an elliptic fixed point .
We obtain Br [ B- & gt ; chi_c1 ( direct ) X ] = ( 3.83+-0.31+-0.40 ) *10^-3 .	No statistically significant signal for chi_c2 production is observed in either case .
This problem is often used to model Sun -- Jupiter -- asteroid systems .	For the primaries ( Sun and Jupiter ) , we pick a realistic mass ratio $ \mu=10^ { -3 } $ and a small eccentricity $ e_0 & gt ; 0 $ .
In this paper , we first propose two correlated link-weight models , namely ( i ) the deterministic correlated model and ( ii ) the ( log-concave ) stochastic correlated model .	Subsequently , we study the shortest path problem and the min-cut problem under these two correlated models .
Such behaviour could arise if there were a deterministic relationship between the polarity of the poloidal magnetic field that threads the outflow and the sense of rotation of the outflow 's source .	Based on this interpretation , Countopoulos et al .
We perform the optimal analysis of the WMAP 5-year data for both of these parameters .	We find no evidence of non-Gaussianity , and we have the following constraints : -125 & lt ; f_NL^equil & lt ; 435 , -369 & lt ; f_NL^orthog & lt ; 71 at 95 % CL .
In this paper we extend this result to general graphs by proving that the cop has a winning strategy on $ G^ { 1/m } $ provided $ m \geqslant n/2 $ for all but a few small values of $ n $ ; this bound is best possible .	We also consider replacing the edges of $ G $ with paths of varying lengths .
Even for exactly parallel fields to the ab plane , transverse fields exist in the chiral state .	The chiral-nonchiral transition disappears when the magnetic field orientation is tilted within 1 degree from the ab plane .
Complementing the known corresponding expressions for entanglement and more general quantum correlations , we thus complete the quantitative hierarchy of Bures correlations for Bell-diagonal states .	We then explicitly calculate Bures correlations for two relevant families of states : Werner states and rank-2 Bell-diagonal states , highlighting the subadditivity which holds for total correlations with respect to the sum of classical and quantum ones when using Bures distance .
The gamma-ray excess observed from the Galactic Center can be interpreted as dark matter particles annihilating into Standard Model fermions with a cross section near that expected for a thermal relic .	Although many particle physics models have been shown to be able to account for this signal , the fact that this particle has not yet been observed in direct detection experiments somewhat restricts the nature of its interactions .
We investigate the confining phase vacua of supersymmetric $ Sp ( 2\NC ) $ gauge theories that contain matter in both fundamental and antisymmetric representations .	The moduli spaces of such models with $ \NF=3 $ quark flavors and $ \NA=1 $ antisymmetric field are analogous to that of SUSY QCD with $ \NF=\NC+1 $ flavors .
Here , by integrating a force-sensing micromechanical beam and an electrostatic actuator on a single chip , we demonstrate the Casimir effect between two micromachined silicon components on the same substrate .	A high degree of parallelism between the two near-planar interacting surfaces can be achieved because they are defined in a single lithographic step .
However , many interesting physical systems contain mixtures of particles with different masses .	Therefore , a generalization of the recent strong-coupling techniques would be highly desirable .
Here we have investigated the effect of this consideration on the average reflectivity in a completely general case .	It is shown that in some cases , especially in local minima of reflectivity vs. neutron wave number , this consideration can result in high enough differences such that it should be included in the interpretation of measured neutron specular reflectivity .
One such ideal measure , proposed by Granger himself , calculates the Bhattacharyya distance between the joint probability density function ( pdf ) and the product of marginal pdfs .	We call this measure the mutual dependence .
This class of data is based on functions which vary slowly in one direction .	The idea is that 2-D inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system with large data is globally well-posedness and we construct the 3-D approximate solutions by the 2-D solutions with a parameter .
In this article we present the first results of our adaptive optics survey of 200 ( mainly ) A-type stars in the nearby OB association Sco OB2 .	We report the discovery of 47 new candidate companions of Sco OB2 members .
We also obtain functional calculi results for restrictions to certain subspaces , for a larger range of $ p $ .	This provides a framework for obtaining $ L^p $ results on perturbed Hodge Laplacians , generalising known Riesz transform bounds for an elliptic operator $ L $ with bounded measurable coefficients , one Sobolev exponent below the Hodge exponent , and $ L^p $ bounds on the square-root of $ L $ by the gradient , two Sobolev exponents below the Hodge exponent .
We then prove that there exists a local test that allows one to verify entanglement generation , falsifying our hypothesis .	Crucially , we show that noise measurements can directly verify entanglement generation .
There is disagreement in the literature concerning La2Hf2O7 : Ce as it has been reported to show both bright as well as no Ce activated luminescence by different experimental groups .	We have performed first-principles electronic structure calculations of these compounds doped with Ce using the pseudopotential method based on the generalized gradient approximation in density functional theory .
Intuitively , a reduction in the quantumness requires an increase in the amount of classical computation , hence giving a `` quantum and classical tradeoff '' .	In this paper we present two results on this direction .
These flows are unstable under ultra low real frequency perturbations because of the unbounded mode amplification near the sonic horizon .	This results in a condensation of low frequency phonons which produces a spatially structured flow in the supersonic domain .
In contrast , electric charge neutrality in the less symmetric 2-flavor superconducting ( 2SC ) phase with ud pairing requires more electrons than the normal quark phase .	The free energy density cost of enforcing color and electric charge neutrality in the CFL phase is lower than that in the 2SC phase , which favors the formation of the CFL phase .
We study the ultra slow-roll inflationary dynamics in the presence of non-canonical kinetic terms of the scalar field , namely ultra slow-roll G-inflation .	We compute the evolution of the curvature perturbation and show that the primordial power spectrum follows a broken power law with an oscillation feature .
The charged particle multiplicity distribution of the gluon jets is presented , and is analyzed for its mean , dispersion , skew , and curtosis values , and for its factorial and cumulant moments .	The results are compared to the analogous results found for a sample of light quark ( uds ) jets , also defined inclusively .
So far , the answers produced by these implementations included infinitesimal and infinite numbers , which are hard to interpret in practice .	We introduce here a post-processing procedure to convert , for fixed parameters , all answers into standard real numbers .
In particular , we have found that it is possible to realize one-way transparent sheets which have the properties of a twist-polarizer in reflection or transmission when illuminated from the other side .	Also one-way transparent sheets with controllable co-polarized reflection and transmission from the opposite side are feasible .
These cells exhibit strain softening behavior under compression , which can be tuned by modifying their geometrical configurations or initial folded conditions .	We assemble these TMP cells into a cluster of origami-based metamaterials , and we theoretically model and numerically analyze their wave transmission mechanism under external impact .
We consider Dirac monopoles embedded into SU ( N ) gauge theory with theta-term for $ \theta = 4\pi M $ ( where $ M $ is half-integer for $ N = 2 $ and is integer for $ N & gt ; 2 $ ) .	Due to the theta - term those monopoles obtain the SU ( N ) charge and become the dyons .
We construct the multiscale representation for hierarchy of partition functions by means of the variational approach and multiresolution decomposition .	Numerical modeling shows the creation of various internal structures from fundamental localized ( eigen ) modes .
This 1+1 dimensional field theory may be viewed as the `` standard model '' for studying black hole physics .	Our analysis is adapted to the flat slice Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates .
Probabilistic interconvertability is used to define an equivalence relation between gates .	We show that this relation induces a finite number of classes , that we identify .
Phase diagrams of disease spreading for empirical complex networks are introduced .	A theoretical model of disease spreading on m-ary tree is investigated both analytically and in simulations .
Overall shape of the L-dwarf spectra is governed by the K I + Na I resonance line wings of the huge strength .	To fit lithium lines observed in spectra of the coolest dwarfs we used two additional suggestions : a ) there are some EXTRA depletions of molecular species absorbed in the optical spectra of L-dwarfs ; b ) there may be ( a few ? )
We propose a new detection technique in the plane based on an isotropic wavelet family .	This family is naturally constructed as an extension of the Gaussian-Mexican Hat Wavelet pair and for that reason we call it the Mexican Hat Wavelet Family ( MHWF ) .
We find a robust upper bound on the observed proton fraction of the UHECRs flux and we rule out a composition dominated by protons and He .	Acceleration and propagation effects lead to an observed composition that is different from the one at the source .
An important role in this paper is played by a class of noncommutative cones associated with positive linear maps , the Fourier type representation of their elements , and the constrained noncommutative Berezin transforms associated with these elements .	It is shown that there is a intimate relation between the similarity problems and the existence of positive invertible elements in these noncommutative cones and the corresponding Berezin kernels .
We discuss perturbative evolution of the polarized structure function g_1 in the ( x , Q^2 ) plane , with special regard to the small-x region .	We determine g_1 in terms of polarized quark and gluon distributions using coefficient functions to order alpha_s .
These new properties are referred to as the Strong Spectral Property and the Strong Multiplicity Property .	Finally , these ideas are applied to the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues associated with G , denoted by q ( G ) .
In combination with previously demonstrated single-qubit gates , CPHASE allows for arbitrary quantum computations .	The coupling of the NV spin to the cavity mode is based upon Raman transitions via the NV excited states and can be controlled with the laser intensities and relative phase .
A model is developed to study the effectiveness of innovation and its impact on structure creation and structure change on agent-based societies .	The abstract model that is developed is easily adapted to any particular field .
At redshift z=2.25 , the effects on the flux statistics are of a similar magnitude as the statistical uncertainties of published data sets .	The changes in the flux statistics are not due to differences in the temperature-density relation of the photo-ionised gas .
The sample contains O -- M , long-period variable ( LPV ) , C and S stars .	The spectra are flux-calibrated and telluric-corrected .
We do not find any phase transitions between the magnetic and non-magnetic phases .	The calculated structural , magnetic properties of cubic phase are in excellent agreement with experiments .
Various properties of $ i $ -symmetrizations are introduced and the relations between them investigated .	New expressions are provided for the Steiner and Minkowski symmetrals of a compact convex set which exhibit a dual relationship between them .
The quasi-stellar object ( QSO ) /merger Mrk 231 is arguably the nearest and best laboratory for studying QSO feedback .	It hosts several outflows , including broad-line winds , radio jets , and a poorly-understood kpc scale outflow .
Moreover , the theoretical properties of those existing methods are not well understood .	A faster and better characterized algorithm is desirable for the ultra high throughput data .
We show that the recent computation of the soft-virtual corrections to Higgs boson production at N $ ^3 $ LO [ 1 ] together with the universality structure of soft-gluon emission can be exploited to extract the general expression of the hard-virtual coefficient that contributes to threshold resummation at N $ ^3 $ LL accuracy .	The hard-virtual coefficient is directly related to the process-dependent virtual amplitude through a universal ( process-independent ) factorization formula that we explicitly evaluate up to three-loop order .
The factorization proof is not trivial because various kinds of divergences are intertwined in the collinear and soft parts at high orders .	We prescribe a method to disentangle the divergences in the framework of the soft-collinear effective theory .
A common and intuitive interpretation of this result is that the spontaneous emission rate is proportional to the probability that the electron and the hole are located at the same point or region in space , i.e.they must coincide spatially to recombine .	Here we show that this interpretation is not correct even loosely speaking .
For the BPS D-vortices , we show through exact calculations that the classical motion of randomly-distributed $ n $ D-vortices is governed by a relativistic Lagrangian of free massive point-particles .	When the head-on collision of two identical BPS D-vortices of zero radius is considered , it predicts either 90 $ { } ^ { \circ } $ scattering or 0 $ { } ^ { \circ } $ scattering equivalent to 180 $ { } ^ { \circ } $ scattering .
The default simplification does n't succeed in simplifying the denominator to 0.2 .	There is a rule that 0 is the result of 0 divided by anything that does n't simplify to either 0 or 0/0 .
The de-mixing matrix parameters are confined to a Stiefel manifold of tall , orthogonal matrices and we introduce a natural gradient variant of the algorithm which is appropriate to learning on this manifold .	For large input dimension the parameter trajectory of both algorithms passes through a sequence of unstable fixed points , each described by a diffusion process in a polynomial potential .
The system determining the gauge-invariant fluctuations of the metric induced by the scalar fluctuations of the brane is reduced to a set of Schr\ '' odinger-like equations for the Bardeen potentials and for the canonical normal modes of the scalar-tensor action .	Scalar , vector and tensor modes of the geometry are classified according to four-dimensional Lorentz transformations .
The location of M dwarfs in the V-K_s -- M_Ks color-magnitude diagram ( CMD ) has been shown to correlate with metallicity .	We demonstrate that previous empirical photometric calibrations of M dwarf metallicity exploiting this correlation systematically underestimate or overestimate metallicity at the extremes of their range .
We continue the study of the entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals in conformal field theories that we started in J . Stat.Mech . ( 2009 ) P11001 .	We compute Tr\rho_A^n for any integer n for the Ising universality class and the final result is expressed as a sum of Riemann-Siegel theta functions .
In this case , a lower bound for the minimum determinant is given by the minimum Hamming distance .	The description of the ring structure of the quotients suggests further optimization in order to improve the overall distribution of determinants .
The present paper , relying on the recently obtained noncommutativity effect on a static , spherically symmetric metric , considers from a new perspective the quantum amplitudes in black hole evaporation .	The general relativity analysis of spin-2 amplitudes is shown to be modified by a multiplicative factor F depending on a constant non-commutativity parameter and on the upper limit R of the radial coordinate .
The discretised theoretical distributions matching the empirical data from the Federal Reserve System ( FRS ) are deduced from a discretised seed which enjoys remarkable scaling laws .	In particular the tails of the distributions are very well reproduced .
In diffusive shock acceleration , the maximum particle energy depends on the energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient kappa .	Most work on shock acceleration has made the plausible assumption that kappa is proportional to the particle gyroradius , implying a wavelength-independent spectrum of MHD turbulence , where Kolmogorov or Kraichnan spectra might be more physically plausible .
We investigate polarization properties of neutral exciton emission in single self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots .	The in-plane shape and strain anisotropy strongly couple the heavy and light hole states and lead to large optical anisotropy with non-orthogonal linearly polarized states misaligned with respect to the crystallographic axes .
Speed is achieved with custom VLSI pattern recognition , linearized track fitting , pipelining , and parallel processing .	Testing and reliability are aided by built-in logic state analysis and test-data sourcing at each board 's input and output , a common inter-board data link , and a universal `` Merger '' board for data fan-in/fan-out .
( In this generalized setting , modularity is understood as 2-modularity in the sense of Lyubashenko . )	Our proof is based on an explicit description of the Hopf algebra structure of the coend of the center of C. Moreover we show that the dimension of C is invertible in K if and only if any object of the center of C is a retract of a `free ' half-braiding .
It has as corollary a summation formula of Slater .	From this formula new one-term evaluations of 2F1 ( -1 ) and 3F2 ( 1 ) are derived , by applying transformations in the Thomae group .
Proton and neutron separation energies have been calculated using the extended Bethe-Weizsacker mass formula .	This modified Bethe-Weizsacker mass formula describes minutely the positions of all the old and the new magic numbers .
An important example is the mixture Kalman filter , but other models and algorithms of practical interest fall in this category .	We study the asymptotic stability of such particle algorithms as time goes to infinity .
The vertex in one special chamber gives the same answer as that computed by the ordinary topological vertex .	We prove an identify expressing the non-commutative topological vertex of a toric Calabi-Yau manifold X as a specialization of the closed BPS partition function of an orbifold of X , thus giving a closed expression for our vertex .
The Geometrothermodynamics analysis does not provide a result in agreement with the usual method or by the specific heat .	We establish local and global thermodynamic stabilities of anti-RN-AdS solution through the specific heat and the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles .
The method uses ( approximate ) partial second-order ( curvature ) information , so that the algorithm performance is more robust when applied to highly nonseparable or ill conditioned problems .	We call the method Robust Coordinate Descent ( RCD ) .
After subtraction of the central cD star light of the HST image we found that only one object lying underneath has the expected properties of the fifth image associated to the tangential arc .	We improve the previous lens modelings of the central dark matter distribution of the cluster , using an isothermal model with a core ( IS ) and the NFW-like model with a cusp .
It is shown that this single assumption allows the variability of spike trains to have an arbitrary scale and various dependencies on the firing rate in the spike count statistics , as well as in the interval statistics , depending on the two parameters of the power function .	We also propose a statistical model for spike trains that exhibits the variance-to-mean power relationship , and based on this a maximum likelihood method is developed for inferring the parameters from rate-modulated spike trains .
However , the computing technologies that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystems research .	Here , we discuss how different computing technologies can contribute to providing the necessary self-organising features , including Multi-Agent Systems , Service-Oriented Architectures , and distributed evolutionary computing .
A plausible option , which does not rely on supersymmetry , is that the Higgs in fact has a much larger tree level quartic coupling than in the Standard Model , which is possible with an extended scalar sector .	We investigate in detail the minimal model with a new real singlet scalar which condenses and mixes with the Higgs .
We show that there is a region $ \Omega\subseteq ( 0,2\pi ) \times R^+ $ such that there exists at least one local minimizer of the Lagrangian action functional on the path space satisfying SPBC $ \ { q ( t ) \in H^1 ( [ 0 , T ] , $ $ ( \mathbf { R } ^2 ) ^4 ) | $ $ q ( 0 ) \in $ $ \mathbf { A } , q ( T ) \in $ $ \mathbf { B } \ } $ for any $ ( \theta , \mu ) \in \Omega $ .	The corresponding minimizing path of the minimizer can be extended to a non-homographic periodic solution if $ \theta $ is commensurable with $ \pi $ or a quasi-periodic solution if $ \theta $ is not commensurable with $ \pi $ .
Several interpretations have been formulated for this magnetic spacetime .	Up to now this solution has been considered as a two -- parameter self -- consistent field .
This allows a detailed examination of an important class of non-unital extreme points which can be characterized as having exactly two images on the Bloch sphere .	We also discuss a number of related issues about the images and the geometry of the set of stochastic maps , and show that any stochastic map on 2x2 matrices can be written as a convex combination of two `` generalized '' extreme points .
But the general problem of determining natural selection , when the number of neighbors varies , has remained open .	For arbitrary selection intensity , the problem is in a computational complexity class which suggests there is no efficient algorithm .
Monte Carlo simulations are powerful tools for understanding the effects of radiation interactions within detector devices allowing not only to evaluate typical estimates for experimental measurements and to serve as means for designing experiments but to provide additional information that are usually not easily accessible experimentally .	A simple numerical approach to describe the functioning of pixelated detectors is presented in this paper .
Moreover , we find an inequality between the warping function and the squared norm of the second fundamental form for such submanifolds .	Equality case is also discussed .
The findings as well as the normal state properties strongly suggest conventional BCS superconductivity , underlined by the BCS ratio 3.44 .	Detailed analysis of the charge carrier dynamics of the silicon substrate is also discussed .
However , even the highest resolution models do not quite achieve strict numerical convergence , due to the challenge of properly resolving small-scale burning and energy transport .	The lack of strict numerical convergence from these idealized configurations suggest that quantitative predictions of the ejected elemental abundances that are generated by binary white dwarf collision and merger simulations should be viewed with caution .
The use of a Fixman-Freire scheme scales down the computational complexity of our algorithm from $ O ( N_ { 1 } ^ { 2 } N_ { 2 } ^ { 2 } ) $ to $ O ( N_ { 1 } N_ { 2 } ) $ .The simulation of complementary strands of a few kbps yields results almost identical to the PS model .	For short strands of equal or unequal lengths , the binding displays a strong sensitivity to mutations .
Earthquake dynamics is the study of the interactions of plates ( solid disjoint parts of the lithosphere ) which produce seismic activity .	Over the last about fifty years many models have come up which try to simulate seismic activity by mimicking plate plate interactions .
The Casimir interaction free energy is derived from the zero temperature Casimir interaction energy via the Matsubara formalism .	In the high temperature region , the Casimir interaction is dominated by the term with zero Matsubara frequency , and it is known as the classical term since this term is independent of the Planck constant $ \hbar $ .
Then the principle may be called `` principle of geometricity . ''	In relation to coordinate transformations , there had been confusions around such concepts as symmetry , covariance , invariance , and gauge transformations .
The very broad wavelength coverage ( 2.4-197 micron ) obtained by combining observations made with the two spectrometers includes practically all of the flux emitted by the sources , and allows us to determine the emission and absorption features of the dense circumstellar dust shells .	Agreement between the fluxes obtained by the two instruments is generally very good ; the largest discrepancies are probably due to source variability .
Our sample only includes strongly irradiated planets , whose expanded atmospheres may be detectable via transit spectroscopy .	The simulations were performed with the PLUTO-CLOUDY interface , which couples a detailed photoionization and plasma simulation code with a general MHD code .
In this paper , we present a detailed discussion of the integrators in the spin tracking code gpuSpinTrack .	We have implemented orbital integrators based on drift-kick , bend-kick , and matrix-kick splits .
Using this technique , we calculate the neutron and proton radiative capture cross sections on $ ^ { 12 } $ C .	The results obtained are shown to be in good agreement with the available experimental data .
The potential is antisymmetric with respect to valleys , and some straightforward applications are found for Raman spectroscopy .	We show that a valley-antisymmetric potential broadens Raman $ D $ band but does not affect $ 2D $ band , which is already observed by recent experiments .
In the literature , these calculations were mainly reported for linear mixtures up to now .	They are more complex for nonlinear mixtures , due to dependencies between the considered quantities .
Hot ( T & gt ; 45K ) SEDs and cold ( T & lt ; 25K ) , cirrus-dominated SEDs are rare , with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such as M82 and cool spirals such as M51 .	We observe a luminosity-temperature ( L-T ) relation , where the average dust temperature of log [ L_IR/L_sun ] =12.5 galaxies is about 10K higher than that of their log [ L_IR/L_sun ] =10.5 counterparts .
If $ f\in L^'^ { \ , p } $ such that $ f $ is the distributional derivative of $ F\in L^p $ then the integral is defined as $ \int^\infty_ { -\infty } fG=-\int^\infty_ { -\infty } F ( x ) g ( x ) \ , dx $ , where $ g\in L^q $ , $ G ( x ) = \int_0^x g ( t ) \ , dt $ and $ 1/p+1/q=1 $ .	A norm is $ \lVert f\rVert'_p=\lVert F\rVert_p $ .
In particular , the Bailey chain technique , used for proving Rogers-Ramanujan type identities , has been generalized to integrals .	At the elliptic level it yields a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation as an integral operator with an elliptic hypergeometric kernel .
New methods are used to deal with semi-convection .	Different entropy gradient is used when adopting the Schwarzschild method and the Ledoux method which are used to confine the convective boundary and to calculate the turbulent quantities : $ \frac { \partial \overline { s } } { \partial r } =-\frac { c_ { p } } { H_P } ( \nabla-\nabla_ { \rm ad } ) $ when the Schwarzschild method is adopted and $ \frac { \partial \overline { s } } { \partial r } =-\frac { c_ { p } } { H_P } ( \nabla-\nabla_ { \rm ad } -\nabla_ { \mu } ) $ when the Ledoux method is adopted .
Experimental data are reproduced with a set of `` competing '' exchange energies closed to J1 = -12K , J2= -4K and Jd=15.6K , where Jd is the third neighbor exchange energy across the hexagon .	Strong constrains between these exchange energies are established .
We discuss the feasibility of detecting the cross-correlation between HI and CO molecular gas since such a cross-correlation has the advantage that it will be independent of systematics and most foregrounds in each of the 21-cm and CO $ ( 1-0 ) $ line experiments .	Additional instruments tuned to higher-order transitions of the CO molecule or an instrument operating with high spectral resolution at mm-wavelengths targeting 158 $ \mu $ m CII could further improve the reionization studies with molecular gas .
These represent slight deviations from spherical symmetry in terms of the relativistic multipole moments ( RMM ) we wish the solution to contain .	A Newtonian object referred to as a dumbbell can be used to describe these solutions in a simple form by means of the density of this object , since the physical properties of the relativistic solution are characterized by its behaviour .
showing that this is a macroscopic effect .	Being of a dynamic origin the currents can be destroyed by inelastic scattering , but we argue that the corresponding decay time can at low enough temperatures be large compared to all other time scales of the system .
Topological superconductivity could be realized in a type II , band-inverted , InAs/GaSb quantum well if it is in proximity to a conventional superconductor .	Here we report observations of the proximity effect induced giant supercurrent states in an InAs/GaSb bilayer system that is sandwiched between two superconducting tantalum electrodes to form a superconductor-InAs/GaSb-superconductor junction .
Cyclotron lines at energies $ \ge 100 $ keV in several Be-transient are predicted for future observations .	We suggest a new method of estimating distances to X-ray pulsars and their magnetic fields .
We present new limits on the annihilation cross section of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ( WIMPs ) based on the joint analysis of seven Milky Way dwarfs using a frequentist Neyman construction and Pass 7 data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope .	We exclude generic WIMP candidates annihilating into b-bbar with mass less than 40 GeV that reproduce the observed relic abundance .
The optical spectra of CdSe nanocrystals up to 55 A in diameter are analyzed in a wide range of energies from the fine structure of the low-energy excitations to the so-called high-energy transitions .	We apply a symmetry-based method in two steps .
Adopting this result , we explicitly calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentum tensors , $ & lt ; T^A_B & gt ; _ { Ren .	} $ , associated with massless fields .
We present a brief numerical study of the Darwin-Fowler method applied to the analysis of the energy partition of essembles of bosons and fermions .	We analyze the assertion of the existence of a `` strong maximum '' made in the original paper of Darwin and Fowler and other studies and show that although the presumed saddle point along the real axis of the grand canonical parameters may exist it can not , in general , be characterized as `` strong '' , in the sense of having much larger magnitude than the other points along the path of integration .
These TQFT 's are likely to describe the constant order contributions of the cyclotomic integer expansions of the Reshetikhin Turaev Ohtsuki theories .	Their modular structure is intimately related to the p-modular representation theory of the symmetric groups S_n .
The fact that many communities are online means that it is possible to extract information about these communities and the connections between their members much more easily using software tools , despite their potentially very large size .	The links between members of the community can be presented visually and often this can make patterns in the structure of sub-communities immediately obvious .
We formulate and solve the renormalization group flow equation for the scale-dependent thermodynamic potential in the presence of the gluonic background field at finite temperature and density .	We determine the phase diagram of the PQM model in the FRG approach and discuss its modification in comparison with the one obtained under the mean-field approximation .
In this atomic approach to the Fermi-Hubbard model the Hamiltonian is a direct result of the optical lattice potential created by interfering laser fields and short-ranged ultracold collisions .	It provides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system .
This paper describes an implementation of several corrections to dE/dx in order to take into account the deviations from the Bethe theory at low and high energies as well as the effect of a finite nuclear size at ultra-relativistic energies .	Special attention is paid to the transition energy region where the onset of the effect of a finite nuclear size is observed .
We consider a learning problem of identifying a dictionary matrix D ( M times N dimension ) from a sample set of M dimensional vectors Y = N^ { -1/2 } DX , where X is a sparse matrix ( N times P dimension ) in which the density of non-zero entries is 0 & lt ; rho & lt ; 1 .	In particular , we focus on the minimum sample size P_c ( sample complexity ) necessary for perfectly identifying D of the optimal learning scheme when D and X are independently generated from certain distributions .
Our calculations are based on using the variational Monte Carlo method with an accurate trial wave function depending on many variational parameters .	The calculations were extended also to include the HeH++ molecular ion .

We show that the divergence is not due to the continuum limit and formulate the conjecture that the divergent contributions come from regions where the action $ S $ is constant and therefore the interference factor $ e^ { -iS/\hbar } $ does not oscillate .	For most systems these regions have zero functional measure and thus give a null contribution to the path integral , but this is not the case for the massless oscillator .
As is well known , the evidence of varying fine structure constant $ \alpha $ was found in 1998 .	If $ \Lambda\propto\alpha^ { -6 } $ is right , it means that the cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ should be also varying .
The differential bremsstrahlung spectrum , where Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal destructive interference effects are fully accounted for , is calculated for three different cases : ( 1 ) a generalization of the incoherent Bertsch-Gunion solution for asymptotic on-shell jets , ( 2 ) initial-state energy loss of incoming jets that undergo hard scattering and ( 3 ) final-state energy loss of jets that emerge out of a hard scatter .	Our analytic solutions are given as an infinite opacity series , which represents a cluster expansion of the sequential multiple scattering .

We employ interactions from a resolution-scale dependent similarity renormalization group transformations and assess the validity of power counting estimates in medium-mass nuclei .
Perturbations are stable on one branch and ghost-like on the other .	An interesting effect uncovered in our analysis is a cosmological version of the Vainshtein screening mechanism : at early times , the galileon dynamics are dominated by self-interaction terms , resulting in its energy density being suppressed compared to matter or radiation ; once the matter density has redshifted sufficiently , the galileon becomes an important component of the energy density and contributes to dark energy .
A number of companies are trying to migrate large monolithic software systems to Service Oriented Architectures .

Cooperativity is a hallmark of proteins , many of which show a modular architecture comprising discrete structural domains .	Detecting and describing dynamic couplings between structural regions is difficult in view of the many-body nature of protein-protein interactions .
The sample is a mix of 74 % evolved horizontal branch stars and 26 % blue stragglers .	We estimate distances to the stars using observed colors , metallicities , and stellar evolution tracks .
The H3+ ion plays a key role in the chemistry of dense interstellar gas clouds where stars and planets are forming .	The low temperatures and high extinctions of such clouds make direct observations of H3+ impossible , but lead to large abundances of H2D+ and D2H+ which are very useful probes of the early stages of star and planet formation .
In this paper we propose a reliability analysis mechanism .	The proposed reliability analysis scheme overcomes the shortcomings of existing cooperative black hole attack using AODV routing protocol .
The absorption in the extremal D3-brane background is studied for a class of massless fields whose linear perturbations leave the ten-dimensional background metric unperturbed , as well as the minimally-coupled massive scalar .	We find that various fields have the same absorption probability as that of the dilaton-axion system , which is given exactly via the Mathieu equation .
The methods that we investigate include Taylor and asymptotic series computations , Gauss-Jacobi quadrature , numerical solution of differential equations , recurrence relations , and others .	We discuss the results of numerical experiments used to determine the best methods , in practice , for each parameter and variable regime considered .
Modern multivariate statistical methods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being increasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging , from cognitive state detection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis .	Multivariate pattern analysis methods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional signals , such as brain images , and outcomes of interest , such as the category of a stimulus , a type of a mental state of a subject , or a specific mental disorder .
The most pronounced structure is found in the energy dependence of { \KV } of net-proton distributions from the $ 0\sim5 % $ most central collisions within $ 0.4 & lt ; p_ { T } & lt ; 2 $ GeV/c and at mid-rapidity $ |y| & lt ; 0.5 $ .	At energies above 39 GeV , the values of { \KV } are close to unity and for energies below 39 GeV , it shows significant deviation below unity around 19.6 and 27 GeV , then a large increase above unity is observed at 7.7 GeV .
Many species show avoidance reactions in response to looming object approaches .	In locusts , the corresponding escape behavior correlates with the activity of the lobula giant movement detector ( LGMD ) neuron .
The existence of such particles is strongly motivated by theory , as they can simultaneously explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe , account for the pattern of neutrino masses and oscillations and provide a Dark Matter candidate .	Cosmological constraints on the properties of HNLs now indicate that the majority of the interesting parameter space for such particles was beyond the reach of the previous searches at the PS191 , BEBC , CHARM , CCFR and NuTeV experiments .
Then we show that the complex L-series of $ E^ { ( R ) } $ does not vanish at $ s=1 $ , and the full Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is true for $ E^ { ( R ) } $ .	Let $ l_0 $ be a prime number which is congruent to $ 3 $ modulo $ 4 $ , and is such that $ 7 $ splits in the field $ K = \mathbb Q ( \sqrt { -l_0 } ) $ .
Consider the category C ( A ) whose objects are functors from C to A , and whose morphisms are natural transformations .	Given a functor F : A -- & gt ; B one obtains an induced functor F_C : C ( A ) -- & gt ; C ( B ) .
We study the lattice effects on the simple holographic toy model ; massive U ( 1 ) gauge theory for the bulk action .	The mass term is for the U ( 1 ) gauge symmetry breaking in the bulk .
Relations linking the temporal or/and spectral properties of the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts ( hereafter GRBs ) to the absolute luminosity are of great importance as they both constrain the radiation mechanisms and represent potential distance indicators .	Here we discuss two such relations : the lag-luminosity relation and the newly discovered duration-luminosity relation of GRB pulses .
The current trend of multicore architectures on shared memory systems underscores the need of parallelism .	While there are some programming model to express parallelism , thread programming model has become a standard to support these system such as OpenMP , and POSIX threads .
In analogy with the ordinary case ( for symplectic forms on the plane ) we show that the moduli in the classification problem are analytic functions of 1-variable and that their number is exactly equal to the Milnor number of the corresponding boundary singularity .	Moreover we derive a normal form for the pair $ ( \omega , f ) $ involving exactly these functional invariants .
We call modules satisfying this condition Krull-Schmidt artinian .	We prove that all direct sum decompositions of Krull-Schmidt artinian modules refine into finite indecomposable direct sum decompositions and we prove that this condition is strictly stronger than the condition of a module admitting finite indecomposable direct sum decompositions .
( 2009 ) , we find that a strong baryonic wind is blown out along the original binary rotation axis within $ 100 $ ms after the merger .	We compute a lower limit on the expelled mass of $ 3.5 \times 10^ { -3 } M_ { \odot } $ , large enough to be relevant for heavy element nucleosynthesis .
The spectrum of cosmic rays ( CRs ) is affected by their escape from an acceleration site .	This may have been observed not only in the gamma-ray spectrum of young supernova remnants ( SNRs ) such as RX J1713.7-3946 , but also in the spectrum of CRs showering on the Earth .
We present a systematic derivation of a model based on the central moment lattice Boltzmann equation that rigorously maintains Galilean invariance of forces to simulate inertial frame independent flow fields .	In this regard , the central moments , i.e.moments shifted by the local fluid velocity , of the discrete source terms of the lattice Boltzmann equation are obtained by matching those of the continuous full Boltzmann equation of various orders .
In the main theorem of this paper we show that if T is a tilting S-module , then under certain homological conditions on M as an S-module , one can extend T to a tilting complex over A inducing a derived equivalence between A and another triangular matrix ring specified by ( S ' , R , M ' ) , where the ring S ' and the R-S'-bimodule M ' depend only on T and M , and S ' is derived equivalent to S. Note that no conditions on the ring R are needed .	These conditions are satisfied when S is an Artin algebra of finite global dimension and M is finitely generated as an S-module .
Following the approach introduced by Erez and Zamir , we show that lattice codes are optimal for the family of Gaussian broadcast channels where the source transmits a set of common messages to all receivers and each receiver has 'coded side information ' , i.e. , prior information in the form of linear combinations of the messages .	This channel model , which is an instance of the Gaussian version of index coding , is motivated by applications to multi-terminal networks where the nodes may have access to coded versions of the messages from previous signal hops or through orthogonal channels .
One of the most promising ways of improving the performance of deep convolutional neural networks is by increasing the number of convolutional layers .	However , adding layers makes training more difficult and computationally expensive .
We describe various approaches and their pros and cons on various examples .	As a side-result we give an elementary non-heuristic purely combinatoric derivation of Turing 's famous estimator .
( The previous one was also from 4U 1636-53 , and was observed with EXOSAT . )	From fits to time-resolved spectra , we find that this is not a radius-expansion burst , and that the same triple-peaked pattern seen in the X-ray light curve is also present in the bolometric light curve of the burst .
Indeed , a growing number of permeability inducing factors ( PIFs ) was shown to elicit signaling mechanisms culminating in VE-cadherin destabilization and global alteration of the junctional architecture .	Conversely , anti-PIFs protect from VE-cadherin disruption and enhance cell cohesion .
In recent years , the energy consumption of computing systems has increased and a large fraction of this energy is consumed in main memory .	Towards this , researchers have proposed use of non-volatile memory , such as phase change memory ( PCM ) , which has low read latency and power ; and nearly zero leakage power .
We analyze the critical points of this potential and present an analytic as well as several numerical finite-action solutions .	Apart from the Yang-Mills solutions that constitute $ SU ( m ) $ -equivariant instanton configurations , we construct periodic sphaleron solutions on $ S^1\times G/H $ and dyon solutions on $ i\mathbb R\times G/H $ .
We use the method of representing the vacuum energy in terms of the Jost function on the imaginary momentum axis .	Renormalization is carried out using the heat kernel expansion and zeta functional regularization .
The best strategy is to perform CTA observations within a few degrees of the Galactic Centre , with the Galactic Centre itself and the most intense diffuse emission regions removed from the analysis .	Assuming a cuspy dark matter density profile for the Milky Way , 500 hours of observations in this region provide sensitivities to and below the thermal cross-section of dark matter annihilations , for masses between a few hundred GeV and a few tens of TeV ; therefore CTA will have a significant chance of discovery in some models .
Time evolution of a nonequilibrium polariton condensate has been studied in the framework of a microscopic approach .	It has been shown that due to polariton-polariton scattering a significant condensate depletion takes place in a comparatively short time interval .
It has been customary to use data from the Oklo natural nuclear reactor to place bounds on the change that has occurred in the electromagnetic fine structure constant $ \alpha $ over the last 2 billion years .	Alternatively , an analysis could be based on a recently proposed expression for shifts in resonance energies which relates them to changes in both $ \alpha $ and the average $ m_q $ of the $ u $ and $ d $ current quark masses , and which makes explicit the dependence on mass number $ A $ and atomic number $ Z $ .
Analysis of experimental data shows that the metal -- insulator transition is possible in materials composed of atoms of only metallic elements .	Such a transition may occur in spite of the high concentration of valence electrons .
We consider the free boundary problem for the plasma-vacuum interface in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics ( MHD ) .	In the plasma region , the flow is governed by the usual compressible MHD equations , while in the vacuum region we consider the Maxwell system for the electric and the magnetic fields , in order to investigate the well-posedness of the problem , in particular in relation with the electric field in vacuum .
The interaction of two types of vesicle systems was investigated : micrometer-sized , giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) formed from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( POPC ) and submicrometer-sized , large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) formed from oleic acid and oleate , both in a buffered aqueous solution ( pH=8.8 ) .	Individual POPC GUVs were transferred with a micropipette into a suspension of oleic acid/oleate LUVs , and the shape changes of the GUVs were monitored using optical microscopy .
There are several dynamical features that can be identified in these simulations ; for supersonic galaxy motion , a leading bow-shock is present , and also a weak gravitationally focussed wake or tail behind the galaxy ( analogous to Bondi-Hoyle accretion ) .	For galaxies with higher mass-replenishment rates and a denser interstellar medium ( ISM ) , the dominant feature is a dense ram-pressure stripped tail .
We discuss the factorization of the differential cross section in the double soft gluon emission and small top-quark mass limit , both in Pair Invariant Mass ( PIM ) and One Particle Inclusive ( 1PI ) kinematics .	The factorization formulas can be employed in order to implement the simultaneous resummation of soft emission and small mass effects up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy .
Such a cascade of failures , triggered by a failure of a small faction of nodes in only one network , may lead to the complete fragmentation of all networks .	We introduce a model and an analytical framework for studying interdependent networks .
Extending the analysis of previous works on the subject of boundary conditions in ( supersymmetric ) Chern-Simons theory , we discuss in detail the field theory construction of a large class of Chern-Simons domain wall theories and its embedding in open string dynamics .	Finally , we exhibit how standard brane moves that result to 3d Seiberg duality , translate in our setup to a generalized level-rank duality in gauged-WZW models .
For many years , based on measurements over populations of cells it was believed that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop was the responsible for the existence of damped oscillations in the levels of p53 and Mdm2 after DNA damage .	However , recent measurements in individual human cells have shown that p53 and its regulator Mdm2 develop sustained oscillations over long periods of time even in the absence of stress .
Due to the interaction between the two particle species optical nonlinearities appear , leading to a quantum phase transition from Mott to superfluid phase .	Here , we address the Tavis-Cummings lattice model , which describes light-matter systems containing multiple atomiclike structures in each cavity .
We consider qualitative and quantitative verification problems for infinite-state Markov chains .	We call a Markov chain decisive w.r.t .
We have studied how the stellar entropy , pressure , radius , mean density , and orbital angular momentum vary when the star is evolved adiabatically , for a representative set of stars .	We have shown that the stellar orbits change with the stellar mean density .
The quantum vacua are described by a vanishing torsion in a gauge choice , underlying a geometric realization , on a non-BPS brane .	It is argued that the quantum Kerr vacua undergo tunneling and lead to a five dimensional Kerr black hole in Einstein vacuum .
The performance of the telescope system has been studied using the cosmic ray on the ground laboratory near CJPL .	Based on the underground experimental data taken from November 2010 to December 2011 in CJPL , which has effective live time of 171 days , the cosmic ray muon flux in CJPL is measured to be ( 2.0+-0.4 ) *10^ ( -10 ) / ( cm^2 ) / ( s ) .
Resonances can occur between the axion mass term and the plasma frequency term as well as between the plasma frequency term and the vacuum Cotton-Mouton shift .	Both resonances and non-resonant transitions could induce detectable features or even strong suppressions in finite energy intervals of gamma-ray spectra from active galactic nuclei .
In this paper , we present and discuss our design choices for the application programming interface ( API ) of the project .	In particular , we describe the simple and elegant interface shared by all learning and processing units in the library and then discuss its advantages in terms of composition and reusability .
In order to preserve the nonlinear nature of the obstruction , asymptotic expansions in the low-Froude or low-Bond number limits can be derived , but here , the solutions invariably predict a waveless surface at every order .	This is because the waves are in fact , exponentially small , and thus beyond-all-orders of regular asymptotics ; their formation is a consequence of the divergence of the asymptotic series and the associated Stokes Phenomenon .
Ontology is designed for storing information about rapidly spreading and changing diseases with incorporating existing disease taxonomies to genetic information of both humans and infectious organisms .	It further maps disease symptoms to diseases and drug effects to disease symptoms .
For particle numbers significantly larger than unity , the required angular momentum is very large and it can be obtained only for spinning frequencies extremely near to the deconfinement limit ; consequently , the required control on experimental parameters turns out to be far too stringent .	Here we propose to follow instead a dynamic path starting from the gas confined in a rotating ring .
However , this bound needs to be reinterpreted at microscopic scales , where molecular bio-motors and some artificial micro-engines operate .	As described by stochastic thermodynamics , energy transfers in microscopic systems are random and thermal fluctuations induce transient decreases of entropy , allowing for possible violations of the Carnot limit .
This method is based on the concept of entanglement witness .	We decompose the entanglement witness for each class of multipartite entanglement into nonlocal operations in addition to local measurements .
Our experiments in two-dimensional hole gas microdevices confirm this remarkable spin Hall effect phenomenology .	Achieving comparable levels of spin polarization by external magnetic fields would require laboratory equipment whose physical dimensions and operating electrical currents are million times larger than those of our spin Hall effect devices .
We identify several situations in which the restricted Schur polynomials do in fact account for the complete set of finite N constraints .	In these situations the restricted Schur polynomials and the generalized restricted Schur polynomials both provide good bases for the quiver gauge theory .
By using two-dimensional distributions of energy and polar angle , a detector without head-tail information with 6.3 times the statistics is found to achieve the same performance level as a full three-dimensional tracking dark matter detector .	Optimum operation orientations are obtained for various experimental configurations , with detectors that are space- or Earth-fixed , have head-tail capability or not , and use energy information or not .
We discuss the difference between the \textbf { k } -integrated and \textbf { k } -resolved analytical continuations , as well as describing the use of random numbers and pole residues to analyze the approximant .	It is found that the analytic properties of the approximant can be controlled by appropriate modifications , making it a robust and reliable tool for electronic structure calculations .
Using the Parkes radio telescope , we study the 21cm neutral hydrogen ( HI ) properties of a sample of galaxies with redshifts z & lt ; 0.13 extracted from the optical 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey ( 2dFGRS ) .	Galaxies at 0.04 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.13 are studied using new Parkes observations of a 42deg^2 field near the South Galactic Pole ( SGP ) .
Furthermore , we generalize the exact ( non-perturbative ) form of the steady state for just two Lindblad channels ( spin-up flipping on the left , and spin-down flipping on the right ) to an arbitrary ( asymmetric ) ratio of the spin flipping rates [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	107 , 137201 ( 2011 ) ] .

We find that for large particle number and increasing well separation , the condensation temperature evolves from the thermodynamic limit value T_c^ { ( 0 ) } ( N ) to T_c^ { ( 0 ) } ( N/2 ) .	The effects of adding a repulsive interaction between atoms has been examined resorting to the Gross-Pitaevskii-Popov procedure and it is found that the shift of the condensation temperature exhibits different signs according to the separation between wells .
Results are presented on the stability of the inversion procedure , including the optimal combination scheme , under the influence of data noise .	The method is applied to the simulated inversion of a double well system .

Quenched chiral perturbation theory leads to quantitative insight on the difference between quenched and unquenched QCD , and reveals clearly some of the diseases which are expected to plague quenched QCD .	Uses jnl.tex and epsf.tex for figure 3 .
We derive rotational widths using both velocity histograms and the Polyex model fit .	The final rotational width is measured at a radius containing 83 % of the total light as derived from I-band images .
Results : We propose and implement KDETREES , a nonparametric method of estimating distributions of phylogenetic trees , with the goal of identifying trees which are significantly different from the rest of the trees in the sample .	Our method compares favorably with a similar recently-published method , featuring an improvement of one polynomial order of computational complexity ( to quadratic in the number of trees analyzed ) , with simulation studies suggesting only a small penalty to classification accuracy .
In the limit of large N , time dependence of O ( N ) -singlet expectation values can be described by classical equations of motion in a one-dimensional potential well .	Time dependence of the perturbation is then described by a linear differential equation with time-dependent periodic coefficient .
Several factors are responsible of the deviations from the reconstructed value .	The main one is the multinucleon component of the neutrino interaction which in the case of Cherenkov detectors enters as a quasielastic cross section , increasing the mean neutrino energy which can differ appreciably from the reconstructed value .
At the SkL-to-paramagnet transition a narrow first-order peak is found that exhibits a strong frequency and magnetic field dependence .	Surprisingly , very similar dependence has been discovered for the first-order transition below the SkL phase , i.e.where the system enters the helical and conical state ( s ) , indicating similar processes across the order-disorder transition .
The IUFSU model is extended by including hyperons to study the neutron star in $ \beta $ equilibrium .	The effect of different hyperonic potentials , namely $ \Sigma $ and $ \Xi $ potentials , on the EoS and hence the maximum mass of neutron stars has been studied .
This new phenomenon could be very relevant in the case of exotic multiple horizon Nariai black holes and in the context of common grand unified theories .	This is clearly manifested in the case of the SO ( 10 ) GUT , that is here investigated in detail .
Even hypothesizing a new population of much dimmer and numerous Galactic point sources , the total observed X-ray flux can not be explained .	Therefore , we conclude that X-ray emission from the Galactic plane has truly diffuse origin .
Operators are defined for transmitting information ( forces and velocities ) between these two representations .	Most IB simulations represent their structures with piecewise-linear approximations and utilize Hookean spring models to approximate structural forces .
Experimentally , many new signals have been discovered that could be pointing towards the existence of tetraquarks , pentaquarks , and other exotic configurations of quarks and gluons .	Theoretically , advances in lattice field theory techniques place us at the cusp of understanding complex coupled-channel phenomena , modelling grows more sophisticated , and effective field theories are being applied to an ever greater range of situations .
During the course of first superoutburst period of positive superhumps decreased with extremely large $ \dot P = -1.5 \times 1.0^ { -4 } $ for SU UMa-like dwarf novae , confirming known behavior of MN Dra [ 1 ] .	Between the superoutbursts MN Dra displayed negative superhumps .
One is interested in obtaining metrics , for which it is not zero .	In this thesis we study the dependence of the zero sets of eigenspinors of the Dirac operator on the Riemannian metric .
In this paper we study the restriction of irreducible representations of $ G $ on $ E $ -vector spaces to $ P $ , where $ E $ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $ p $ .	We show that in a certain sense $ P $ controls the representation theory of $ G $ .
We present results from the first 2D and 3D simulations of the collapse of rotating stellar iron cores in general relativity employing a finite-temperature equation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during collapse .	We compare fully nonlinear and conformally flat spacetime evolution methods and find that the conformally flat treatment is sufficiently accurate for the core-collapse supernova problem .
Such processes have already produced large number of events at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) by now .	These processes can be background to the Higgs boson production and a number of beyond the standard model scenarios .
The discounting bias takes into account the fact that investment is paid upfront for future use ; the precautionary bias multiplies a type of risk aversion index by the local volatility .	Relying on the analytical forms , we discuss in detail the economic effects .
For these low concentrations , the impurity thus directly influences transport , either as homogeneously distributed defects or by concentration at the otherwise-unchanged grain boundaries .	For larger impurity concentrations , the continuing strong decrease in mobility is correlated with decreasing grain size , indicating an impurity-induced increase in the nucleation of grains during early stages of film growth .
We provide a non-perturbative and manifestly unitary framework that describes the cascade decay and yields the space-time evolution of the probabilities for sterile neutrinos , final states and the total number of events at a far detector .	The results are general , valid for Dirac or Majorana neutrinos and only input the total decay rates and branching ratios for the production and decay channels .
We also show infinitesimal rigidity of the action spectrum of $ \phi $ with respect to variations of $ \Omega $ .	Both results are obtained by showing that if $ G : M\to\mathbb R $ is any smooth function and $ \omega $ is any smooth 1-form on $ M $ such that $ G ( x ) +\omega_ { x } ( v ) $ integrates to zero along any closed orbit of $ \phi $ , then $ G $ must be identically zero and $ \omega $ must be exact .
The local models are type IIB orientifolds with D7 branes on a curved orientifold 7-plane , and matter realized by adding D3 branes on the orientifold plane .	The Higgs branches of the SO and USp theories can be matched with the moduli spaces of SO and USp instantons on the compact four-dimensional part of the D7 branes worldvolume .
We focus on the antisymmetric gravitomagnetic contribution due to the angular momentum of one of the stars of the pair .	Considering a pulsar as the source of the signals , the effect would be manifest both in the arrival times of the pulses and in the frequency shift of their Fourier spectra .
Proving that certain hom-functors are monoidal , and so take monoids to monoids , unifies classical convolution in algebra and Day convolution for categories .	Hopf bimonoids are defined leading to a lifting of closed structures .
A young ( & lt ; 0.5 Gyr ) main sequence stellar component is present and clustered in two centrally-located clumps , while older stars form a more extended disk or halo .	The colors of the main sequence require a relatively large extinction of A_V = 0.47 mag .
The high lying resonances are found to be not genuine as pointed out by Kato and Abe , and as such are discarded .	This discomfiture is due to the ( i ) shallow behavior of the Morse potential at the outer edge and ( ii ) inappropriate insertion of Coulomb tail used in that work .
It tries to find dividing lines , prove their consequences , prove `` structure theorems , positive theorems '' on those in the `` low side '' ( in particular stable and superstable theories ) , and prove `` non-structure , complexity theorems '' on the `` high side '' .	It has started with categoricity and number of non-isomorphic models .
In this paper , we explore the stability of an inverted pendulum under a generalized parametric excitation described by a superposition of $ N $ cosines with different amplitudes and frequencies , based on a simple stability condition that does not require any use of Lyapunov exponent , for example .	Our analysis is separated in 3 different cases : $ N=1 $ , $ N=2 $ , and $ N $ very large .
The light entering the front end is refocused with a compact arrangement of mirrors , which is fully contained within the cartridge .	The arrangement contains a grid to separate the polarizations and two beam splitters to combine each resulting beam with a local oscillator signal .
If there is accretion after neutron star formation , the atmosphere could be composed of light elements ( H or He ) ; if no accretion takes place or if thermonuclear reactions occur after accretion , heavy elements ( for example , Fe ) are expected .	Despite detailed searches , observations have been unable to confirm the atmospheric composition of isolated neutron stars .
However , model-independently , i.e.using only experimental constraint imposed by the limit on $ Br ( \eta\to\pi^+\pi^- ) $ it can be up to $ O ( 10 % ) $ .	We also explore various possible operators and we find that the tensor type operator , possibly arising from a nonzero CP violating electric dipole moment of the strange quark , can induce a sizable linear photon polarization .
We also show how the method gives a lower bound for for the mass of time-symmetric initial data sets for black holes with vectors and scalars in terms of the mass , $ |Z ( Q , P ) | $ of the double extreme black hole with the same charges .	I also give a lower bound for the area of an apparent horizon , and hence a lower bound for the entropy in terms of the same function $ |Z ( Q , P ) | $ .
To distinguish accreting binaries from chromospherically active objects we develop and explain criteria based on Halpha and HeI 5786,6678 emission line properties available in the literature .	The spectroscopic properties and photometric variability of all the objects are discussed and a classification of the source is given where possible .
The latter situation makes a state of propagation with two exactly reciprocal realizations .	In the quantum case , such a situation does not exist as an eigenstate because of the quantum tunneling between the two fibers .
However , in our empirical work we study the relative merits of all three paradigms to determine how best to combine them .	The paper concludes with two case studies .
We include an imposed pitch-angle scattering rate , which is meant to approximate the effects of high frequency plasma waves and/or velocity space instabilities .	We focus on plasma parameters similar to those found in the near-Earth solar wind , though most of our results are more broadly applicable .
Proton decay and especially its gauge mediated decay is sensitive also to those mixing angles which are non-relevant in the SM .	A model with realistic mass matrices and large rotations is presented..
This technique enables the SQUID magnetometery in high magnetic fields , up to 7 Tesla .	The main challenges and the calibration process are detailed .
The distribution of waiting time $ { \cal T } $ till the completion of the target task has the power law tail $ \sim 1/t^ { 1/2 } $ , resulting from a first-passage solution of an equivalent Wiener process .	Taking into account a diversity of time deficit parameters in a population of individuals , the power law tail is changed into $ 1/t^\alpha $ with $ \alpha\in ( 0.5 , \infty ) $ , including the well-known case $ 1/t $ .
The dependence of the quasi-Coulombic potential strength on the interaction distance are consistent with the QCD-motivated behaviour .	The $ q\bar q $ -separations are evaluated and the $ e^+e^- $ decay widths are estimated with the help of relativistic modification of the Van Royen-Weisskopf formula .
In this article , we take a model-independent approach , and discuss a number of possibilities for dark matter candidates which could potentially generate such a feature .	While we identify several scenarios which could lead to such a gamma-ray line , these models are each fairly constrained .
We have investigated the interaction of mitochondrial biophotons with microtubules from a quantum mechanical point of view .	Our theoretical analysis indicates that the interaction of biophotons and microtubules causes transitions/fluctuations of microtubules between coherent and incoherent states .
By adjusting the Monte Carlo attempt frequency , good agreement between simulated and experimental peak separations is achieved .	It is also found that the uniqueness of such a determination is dependent on the relative values of the adsorption/desorption and diffusion free-energy barriers .
Here , we present an optimized procedure to fabricate single-crystal , all-diamond scanning probes starting from commercially available diamond and show a highly efficient and robust approach for integrating these devices in a generic atomic force microscope .	Our scanning probes consisting of a scanning nanopillar ( 200 nm diameter , $ 1-2\ , \mu $ m length ) on a thin ( $ & lt ; 1\mu $ m ) cantilever structure , enable efficient light extraction from diamond in combination with a high magnetic field sensitivity ( $ \mathrm { \eta_ { AC } } \approx50\pm20\ , \mathrm { nT } /\sqrt { \mathrm { Hz } } $ ) .
Let M be the zero fiber of the corresponding moment map .	It is well known that the quotient M/K is a complex space in a natural way .
Using the same data sample , we have also extracted the mean multiplicities in semileptonic and nonleptonic decays .	We measure a mean of 7.82 +- 0.05 +0.21/-0.19 charged particles per $ B\bar { B } $ decay when both mesons decay semileptonically .
Flavor changing neutral current $ |\Delta B|=|\Delta S|=1 $ processes are sensitive to possible new physics at the electroweak scale and beyond , providing detailed information about flavor , chirality and Lorentz structure .	Recently the LHCb collaboration announced a $ 2.6 \sigma $ deviation in the measurement of $ R_K= { \cal { B } } ( \bar B \to \bar K \mu \mu ) / { \cal { B } } ( \bar B \to \bar K ee ) $ from the standard model 's prediction of lepton universality .
The first part is a systematic overview of the theory pertaining to propagation , plasma self-generation , energy/current-losses , and stability of such pulses .	The second part reviews the major full-scale propagation experiments which have been carried out , in atmospheric and outer-space plasmas , to assess the validity of theoretical models .
Our theory sheds new light on the magnitude of cross sections for scattering and extinction , and for instance on the emergence of structural chirality in the optical response of geometrically non-chiral scatterers like SRRs .	We apply the model to SRRs and discuss how to extract individual components of the polarizability matrix and extinction cross sections .
In our previous work , we focused basically on the discrepancy of fast Doppler motion without detectable motion in the image plane .	We now suggest an alternative scenario for the explosive events , based on our observations of spectral line tilts and bifurcated structure in some events .
Stochastic modeling of reaction networks is a framework used to describe the time evolution of many natural and artificial systems , including , biochemical reactive systems at the molecular level , viral kinetics , the spread of epidemic diseases , and wireless communication networks , among many other examples .	In this work , we present a novel multilevel Monte Carlo method for kinetic simulation of stochastic reaction networks that is specifically designed for systems in which the set of reaction channels can be adaptively partitioned into two subsets characterized by either `` high '' or `` low '' activity .
We compare these models with the corresponding C^2/Z_3 orbifold models , and find that all of these gauge backgrounds can be related to configurations of vacuum expectation values ( VEV 's ) of twisted and sometimes untwisted states .	Gauge groups and spectra are identical from both the orbifold and the smooth bundle perspectives .
I will argue that recent cosmic-ray data , most notably from the Pamela and Fermi satellites , indicate that previously unaccounted-for powerful sources in the Galaxy inject high-energy electrons and positrons .	Interestingly , this new source class might be related to new fundamental particle physics , and specifically to pair-annihilation or decay of galactic dark matter .
For the rational , elliptic and trigonometric r-matrices , we exhibit the links between three `` levels '' of Poisson spaces : ( a ) Some finite-dimensional spaces of matrix-valued holomorphic functions on the complex line ; ( b ) Spaces of spectral curves and sheaves supported on them ; ( c ) Symmetric products of a surface .	We have , at each level , a linear space of compatible Poisson structures , and the maps relating the levels are Poisson .

Spatially resolved spectroscopy shows that the data are consistent with intragroup gas being pressurized at the leading western edge of NGC 2276 due to the galaxy moving supersonically through the intragroup medium at a velocity ~850 km/s .	Detailed modelling of the gravitational potential of NGC 2276 shows that the resulting ram-pressure could significantly affect the morphology of the outer gas disc but is probably insufficient to strip large amounts of cold gas from the disc .
We show that given a radially symmetric nuclear charge , the ground state of Dirac-Fock solves this max-min problem for certain numbers of electrons .	But we also exhibit a situation in which the max-min level does not correspond to a solution of the Dirac-Fock equations together with its associated self-consistent projector .
Small-scale dark matter structure within the Milky Way is expected to affect pulsar timing .	The change in gravitational potential induced by a dark matter halo passing near the line of sight to a pulsar would produce a varying delay in the light travel time of photons from the pulsar .
A high-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer ( F-P ) was used to determine frequency changes during scanning .	Two multiple-distance-measurement analysis techniques were developed to improve distance precision and to extract the amplitude and frequency of vibrations .
We consider the response of etalons created by a combination of a conventional mirror and a metasurface , composed of a periodic lattice of metal scatterers with a resonant response .	This geometry has been used previously for perfect absorption , in so-called Salisbury screens , and for hybridization of localized plasmons with Fabry-Perot resonances .
Some of these identities have been useful in the study of Turner relaxation of annular magnetized plasma [ S.K.H.Auluck , Phys .	Plasmas , 16 , 122504 , 2009 ] , where quadratic integral quantities such as helicity and total energy were expressed as algebraic functions of the arbitrary constants of the general solution of Bessel 's equation , allowing their determination by a minimization procedure .
The intensity variation due to CME interaction reported in [ 1 ] is confirmed by expanding the investigation to all the large SEP events of solar cycle 23 .	The large SEP events are separated into two groups , one associated with CMEs running into other CMEs , and the other with CMEs running into the ambient solar wind .
In this paper , we show how different MKL algorithms can be understood as applications of either regularization on the kernel weights or block-norm-based regularization , which is more common in structured sparsity and multi-task learning .	We show that these two regularization strategies can be systematically mapped to each other through a concave conjugate operation .
We derive a refined version of $ \Gamma $ that incorporates the finite lifetime of X-ray sources and the dynamical evolution of clusters .	With it we find we are able to explain the few clusters that lie off the $ N_X $ -- $ \Gamma $ correlation , and resolve the discrepancy between observed GC core radii and the values predicted by theory .

A method based on Mach-Zehnder interferometry is employed to achieve high measurement precision and consistency , yielding a maximal value of absorption coefficient of 0.2 dB/ { \mu } m when graphene is located directly on top of the waveguide .	The results agree with theoretical model utilizing the universal ac conductivity in graphene .
The first is continuous in time , where one uses data to infer a model in the form of stochastic differential equations , which are then discretized for numerical solution .	The second is discrete in time : the model one infers is a parametric representation of a time series that can be directly used for computation .

Early considerations indicated that conditions on RD planets would be inimical to life , as their Habitable Zones ( where liquid water could exist ) would be so close as to make planets tidally locked to their star .	This was thought to cause an erratic climate and expose life forms to flares of ionizing radiation .
While the green valley is defined using optical U-B colors , we find that using a green valley sample defined using NUV-R colors does not change the results .	Using HST/ACS imaging , we study several quantitative morphological parameters including CAS , B/T from GIM2D , and Gini/M_20 .

Given nontrivial finite transitive permutation groups $ L_1 $ and $ L_2 $ with $ L_1 $ not semiprimitive , we construct an infinite family of rank two amalgams of permutation type $ [ L_1 , L_2 ] $ and Borel subgroups of strictly increasing order .	As an application , we show that there is no bound on the order of edge-stabilisers in locally $ [ L_1 , L_2 ] $ graphs .
Then we explicitly display the forms of the remaining terms in the EOS , commenting on the use of experiment and electronic structure theory to evaluate them .	We also construct an EOS for Aluminum and compare the resulting Hugoniot with data up to 5 Mbar , both to illustrate our method and to see whether the approximation of neglecting anharmonicity et al .
Our argument can be extended to prove a lower bound of Omega ( \sqrt { nD } ) rounds for broadcasting in radio networks of radius D. This resolves one of the open problems posed in [ 29 ] , where in the authors proved a lower bound of $ \Omega ( n^ { 1/4 } ) rounds for broadcasting in constant diameter networks .	We prove the new lower $ \Omega ( \sqrt { n } ) $ bound for a special family of radius 2 networks .
We compare their observed and absolute K magnitudes as well as their R-K colours with those of other distant sources detected in various optical , near-infrared , mid-infrared and submillimeter deep surveys .	We find that the GRB host galaxies , most of them lying at 0.5 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.5 , exhibit very blue colours , comparable to those of the faint blue star-forming sources at high redshift .

We find that Globular Clusters could have contributed at most a small fraction of the current vertical energy of the disk , as they could heat the whole disk to { $ \sigma $ } $ _ { z } $ = 5.5kms $ ^ { { \rm - } { \rm 1 } } $ ( c.f .	the observed 18 and 39 kms $ ^ { { \rm - } { \rm 1 } } $ for the thick and thin disks respectively ) .
The carriers near E_F have mainly the Te ( 1 ) 5p character , with the negligible contribution from Ce 4f states to the CDW formation .	The supercell ( shadow ) bands and the corresponding very weak FS 's are found to arise from band-folding due to the interaction with Ce-Te ( 2 ) layers .
In addition to the previous calculations we use a Coulomb potential derived from a realistic proton density distribution in nucleus , improve the precision of the numerical routines used to solve the Dirac equations and to integrate the PSF expressions , and use recently reported Q-values .	These ingredients proved to be important , leading in many cases to significant differences as compared to the present available PSF values , which are discussed as well .
We here extend the SUBFIND algorithm for substructure identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation .	This allows , in particular , the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies , and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars , dark matter , and hot and cold gas .

Classical wireless communications can be invoked to unlock the quantum encryption process thereby allowing for any deployment scenario regardless of the channel conditions .	Quantum geo-encryption can also be used to realize quantum-computing instructions that can only be implemented at a specific location , and allow for a specified geographical data-route through a distributed network .
In this paper , we show that efficient separated sum-of-exponentials approximations can be constructed for the heat kernel in any dimension .	In one space dimension , the heat kernel admits an approximation involving a number of terms that is of the order $ O ( \log ( \frac { T } { \delta } ) ( \log ( \frac { 1 } { \epsilon } ) +\log\log ( \frac { T } { \delta } ) ) ) $ for any $ x\in\bbR $ and $ \delta \leq t \leq T $ , where $ \epsilon $ is the desired precision .
As a default choice , we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5 , which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression .	Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors .
In this work we investigate how efficiently galactic winds can provide an intense and widespread `` seed '' magnetisation .	This may be used to explain the magnetic fields observed today in clusters of galaxies and in the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) .

Numerical simulations with the coupled-NLS model with $ 2 \le N \le 4 $ show stable oscillatory dynamics of soliton amplitudes at short-to-intermediate distances , in agreement with predictions of the predator-prey model .	Furthermore , the main destabilizing mechanism at long distances is due to generation of radiative sidebands , where the sidebands for a given channel form at the frequencies of solitons in the neighboring channels .
For tractable classes such as Gaussian graphical models , this leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved .	We show that our method results in an improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed networks for synthetic data .
Depending on the mass loss rate , the disc produces either long outbursts , a cycle of one long outburst followed by two short outbursts , or only short outbursts .	The course of the transfer rate dominates the shape of the outbursts because the mass accreted during an outburst cycle roughly equals the mass transferred from the secondary over the outburst interval .
We discuss here how the presence of an SMB will affect the BLRs of AGNs and what the observational consequences might be .	We review previous claims of SMBs based on broad line profiles and find that they may have non-SMB explanations as a consequence of a complex BLR structure .
Using deprojected 16 clusters and 12 groups from the literature , we find that $ K\propto r^ { 0.96\pm0.01 } $ , consistent with the mean power-law index $ ( 0.9\mbox { -- } 1.1 ) $ of previous studies .	A similarly good fit is given by a $ \tau\propto r^ { 0.72\pm0.01 } $ ratio between cooling and free-fall times .
We report results from a search for gravitational waves produced by perturbed intermediate mass black holes ( IMBH ) in data collected by LIGO and Virgo between 2005 and 2010 .	The search was sensitive to astrophysical sources that produced damped sinusoid gravitational wave signals , also known as ringdowns , with frequency $ 50\le f_ { 0 } /\mathrm { Hz } \le 2000 $ and decay timescale $ 0.0001\lesssim \tau/\mathrm { s } \lesssim 0.1 $ characteristic of those produced in mergers of IMBH pairs .
Complete descriptions of the Lie symmetries of a class of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with gradient-dependent diffusivity in one and two space dimensions are obtained .	A surprisingly rich set of Lie symmetry algebras depending on the form of diffusivity and source ( sink ) in the equations is derived .
We measure the electron escape-rate from surface-acoustic-wave dynamic quantum dots ( QDs ) through a tunnel barrier .	Rate-equations are used to extract the tunnelling rates , which change by an order of magnitude with tunnel-barrier gate voltage .
The gravitational field produced by relativistic domain walls can be exactly solved in both sides of the correspondence , and thus provides one further check of it .	We show in the two sides that for the most symmetric case , the wall motion does not lead to particle production of the CFT fields .
In particular we show how to interpret insertion of supercharges on the boundary state as sources of non-universal spin effects in D-brane potentials .	In this way we find for a generic ( D ) p-brane , potentials going like $ v^ { 4-n } /r^ { 7-p+n } $ corresponding to interactions between the different components of the D-brane supermultiplet .
Traditionally , RNA-seq experiments are mathematically averaged -- they sequence the mRNA of individuals from different treatment groups , hoping to correlate phenotype with differences in arithmetic read count averages at shared loci of interest .	Alternatively , the tissue from the same individuals may be pooled prior to sequencing in what we refer to as a biologically averaged design .
Direct and indirect searches of the Higgs boson suggest that 113 GeV $ \lesssim m_H \lesssim $ 170 GeV is likely .	With the LEP era over and the Tevatron Run II search via $ p\bar p \to WH+X $ arduous , we revisit a case where $ WH $ or $ ZH + $ jets could arise via strong $ b^\prime\bar b^\prime $ pair production .
We calculate $ \kappa $ in leading order lattice perturbation theory and simulations on $ 120^3\times 6,8 $ lattices with $ a & lt ; 0.1 $ fm .	In the temperature range $ 2T_\mathrm { c } -10T_\mathrm { c } $ we find $ \kappa=0.36 ( 15 ) T^2 $ .
Here we investigate the feasibility of using such a survey to detect planets in M31 .	We estimate the efficiency of detecting signals for events induced by planetary systems as a function of planet/star mass ratio and separation , source type and background M31 surface brightness .
The results are UD functions $ \Phi^ { ( L ) } , $ where $ L $ is the number of loops .	They play an important role in N=4 supersymmetic Yang-Mills theory .
The matrix is normalized so that the average spacing between consecutive eigenvalues is of order $ 1/N $ .	We study the connection between eigenvalue statistics on microscopic energy scales $ \eta\ll1 $ and ( de ) localization properties of the eigenvectors .
The CERN-SPS accelerator has been operated from May 10th to May 24th 2012 , with a tightly bunched-beam structure to allow the velocity of neutrinos to be accurately measured on an event-by-event basis .	LVD has detected 48 neutrino events , associated to the beam , with a high absolute time accuracy .
We describe some overlooked features of how the cosmological horizon responds to the black hole evaporation .	The presence of a black hole depresses the entropy of the cosmological horizon by an amount proportional to the geometric mean of the entropies of the black hole and cosmological horizons .
The CXB spectrum differs from the integration of the spectra of individual sources , calling for a large population , undetected so far , of strongly obscured Compton thick AGN .	Such objects are predicted by unified models , which attribute most of the AGN diversity to their inclination on the line of sight , and play an important role for the understanding of the growth of black holes in the early Universe .
Its coherence length is about 22 times longer than that of the input laser pulses .	It is a classical analogue to the large difference between the one- and two-photon coherence lengths of entangled photon pairs .
Moreover , moments corresponding to these weight functions can be explicitly computed .	Finally , a particular example containing all classical discrete symmetric orthogonal polynomials is studied in detail .
The use of relative distances destroys the symmetry property of the original C-S model , which was the key for the various recent studies of C-S flocking behavior .	To this end , we introduce here a new framework to analyze the phenomenon of flocking for a rather general class of dynamical systems , which covers systems with non-symmetric influence matrices .
This discrete model can be viewed as a \emph { minimal } ratchet model .	We extend our previous work on this model , by further investigating the constraints imposed by the Fluctuation Theorem on the operation of a molecular motor far from equilibrium .
The meaning of transverse density is explained using coordinate space variables , allowing us to identify a true mean-square transverse size directly related to the form factor .	We show that the rest-frame charge distribution is generally not observable because of the failure to uphold current conservation .
Jets are defined using the inclusive k_T algorithm .	Single- and multi-differential cross sections are measured as functions of jet transverse energy E_T^jet and pseudorapidity \eta^jet in the domain 5 & lt ; E_T^jet & lt ; 75 GeV and -1 & lt ; \eta^jet & lt ; 2.5 .
To the end , a spatial-dependent azimuthal multiplicity-correlation pattern is suggested .	It shows clearly in the pattern that there are two kinds of interactions at the early stage of Au + Au collisions at $ \sqnn=200 $ GeV generated by RQMD with hadron re-scattering and AMPT with string melting .
We revisit in more detail a model for element abundance fractionation in the solar chromosphere , that gives rise to the `` FIP Effect '' in the solar corona and wind .	Elements with first ionization potential below about 10 eV , i.e.those that are predominantly ionized in the chromosphere , are enriched in the corona by a factor 3-4 .
Then , pairwise conditional Granger causality analysis is carried out with data measured from substructural DOFs to evaluate the information loss when measurements from all DOFs are not available .	This analysis allows selecting those accelerometers that can be suppressed minimising the information loss .
We search for galaxies which have large ( Y-J ) colours ( the `` Y-drops '' ) on account of the Lyman-alpha forest absorption , and with ( J-H ) colours inconsistent with being low-redshift contaminants .	We identify 24 candidates at redshift z~8-9 ( 15 are robust and a further 9 more marginal but consistent with being high redshift ) over an area of ~50 square arcminutes .
We present an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) Cycle 0 survey of 126 submillimeter sources from the LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter Survey ( LESS ) .	Our 870 micron survey with ALMA ( ALESS ) has produced maps ~3X deeper and with a beam area ~200X smaller than the original LESS observations , doubling the current number of interferometrically-observed submillimeter sources .

Future superconducting radio frequency ( SRF ) cavities , as part of Project X at Fermilab , will be cooled to superfluid helium temperatures by a cryogenic distribution system supplying cold supercritical helium .	To reduce vapor fraction during the final Joule-Thomson ( J-T ) expansion into the superfluid helium cooling bath , counter-flow , plate-fin heat exchangers will be utilized .
Unusual metallic states involving breakdown of the standard Fermi-liquid picture of long-lived quasiparticles in well-defined band states emerge at low temperatures near correlation-driven Mott transitions .	Prominent examples are ill-understood metallic states in $ d $ - and $ f $ -band compounds near Mott-like transitions .
The asymptotic behaviour of the solutions is investigated .	The asymptotic form of the metric near the initial singularity has a spatially varying Kasner form .
The compactified dimension guarantees that the geodesic curve closes in $ u $ .	The effective 2D ( $ t $ and $ u $ ) nature of the metric ensures that spacetime is flat , therein satisfying all the classical stability conditions as expressed by the energy conditions .
By using the ALFA adaptive optics system at the 3.6m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory we detected a faint red star in the apparent vicinity of FU Ori , the prototype of the FUor outburst stars .	Independent confirmation of the detection is obtained from archival PUEO/CFHT images .
In this paper a new block-structure method is presented for the solution of the well-known from gravity theory matrix system of equations g { ij } g { jk } =delta { i } { k } ( with respect to the unknown covariant components g { ij } and by known contravariant ones g { jk } ) by transforming this matrix system into a linear algebraic system of equations in the general N-dimensional case .	Although powerful computer methods exist for the solution of this problem for a given ( fixed ) dimension of the matrices g { ij } and especially for numerical elements of g { ij } , the structure of the obtained linear algebraic system in the general N-dimensional case and for arbitrary elements of g { ij } ( functions ) has not been known .
This temperature is much greater than its virial value and the hot cloud expands at roughly the sound speed ( ~0.1c ) , after which it begins to accelerate on a parsec scale to relativistic velocities .	In earlier work , the emission from the extended jet has been modeled successfully using nonthermal synchrotron self-Compton processes , with a self-absorbed inner core .
For quadratics , the we prove that this recursive structure is equivalent to a Diophantine identity involving the product of two binary quadratic forms .	We show that this identity may be transformed into geometric terms , relating each integer factorization $ an^2+bn+c=pq $ to a lattice point of the conic section $ aX^2+bXY+cY^2+X-nY=0 $ , and vice versa .
Central to the emergence of minority dynamics is the introduction of the notion of price expectations for the agents .	This leads to the possibility of an agent not participating in the market for some time steps .
Theory predicts that doping the surface of the graphene effectively alters the electronic structure , thus promoting propensity towards Cooper pair instability .	Here we report the emergence of superconductivity at 7.4 K in Li-intercalated few-layer-graphene ( FLG ) .
First , using a fixed point iteration scheme , we numerically integrate the equation to find solitary waves .	It is found that these solutions are well approximated by a truncated series of hyperbolic secants .
Let P be a projective A-module of rank n=dim A - 1 with trivial determinant .	We define an abelian group called the `` Euler class group of A '' , denoted by E ( A ) .
In general , the non-commutativity affects the usual conservation law of the tensor as well as its transformation properties ( gauge covariance instead of gauge invariance ) .	It is known that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be achieved by a redefinition involving another star-product .
It has a sharp cutoff on the high latitude side .	Distance , velocity , and proper motion measurements are consistent with previous orbit fits .
The time evolution of various multi-layer shell systems -- -comprised by large number of shells thereby mimicking the behavior of a thick shell making it possible to study the formation of acoustic singularities -- -is analyzed numerically and compared in certain cases to the corresponding Newtonian time evolution .	The analytic setup is chosen such that the developed code is capable of following the evolution even inside the black hole region .
We have determined precisely the stability region of various crystallographic phases at room temperature for ( 1-x ) Bi ( Ni1/2Ti1/2 ) O3-xPbTiO3 .	Structural transformation from pseudo-cubic to tetragonal phase is observed via phase coexistence region demarcating the morphotropic phase boundary region .
Sterile neutrinos with sub-electron volt ( eV ) masses have recently received serious attention due to the tantalizing hints from reactor neutrino experiments as well as cosmology .	While the nine year old Wilkinson Mass Anisotropy Probe experiment suggests the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom to be $ N_ { \text { eff } } = 3.84 \pm 0.40 $ , recently reported Planck collaboration results show more preference towards the standard three light neutrino scenario $ N_ { \text { eff } } = 3.30^ { +0.54 } _ { -0.51 } $ .
At the same time , the usual Landau diamagnetism results for the total magnetic moment .	The origin of this dramatic temperature dependence is seen to be in the multiple reflection of electron waves by the boundary confining potential , which becomes important once the coherence length of electrons gets longer than the system length .
Ultimately , we derive 3 decoupled complex equations governing 3 complex scalars .	One of these is a new Regge-Wheeler ( RW ) equation generalized for LRS space-times , whereas the remaining two are new generalizations of the Bardeen-Press ( BP ) equations .
In the present paper , we extend the results to the case of an evaluation of quantum spin networks of arbitrary valency at a fixed root of unity .

Heuristics are crucial tools in decreasing search effort in varied fields of AI .	In order to be effective , a heuristic must be efficient to compute , as well as provide useful information to the search algorithm .
This contrasts with the original proof of Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch , which contains two non-constructive arguments .	Our method is based on the Dehman-Lebeau Egorov approach to treat the high-frequencies , and the optimal unique continuation stability result of the authors for the low-frequencies .
From the beginning of the theory , the question whether the concept of configuration equivalence coincides with the concept of group isomorphism was posed .	We negatively answer this open question by introducing two non-isomorphic , solvable and hence amenable groups which are configuration equivalent .

It suffers from a low reddening ( E ( B-V ) =0.15 ) , lies at a distance of 5 kpc from the Sun and 1 kpc from the galactic plane , and its heliocentric systemic velocity is close to +22 km/sec .	The difference between the radial velocity of the optical absorption spectrum and that of the Ha emission is unusually small for a carbon Mira .
In order to validate the code , two different tests have been performed : one against a special Taylor shock-like analytic solution , the other against published results on a High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) system , both with satisfactory results .	The code , available under an open source license , is written for parallel execution on a Graphics Processing Unit ( GPU ) , thus improving performance by a factor of over 60 when compared to the standard serial execution finite volume code CLAWPACK 4.6.1 , which has been used as reference for the implementation logic as well .
It is important because already existed objects of a new phase comsume vapor in non-linear manner and form an effective non-linear behavior of external conditions .	To describe kinetics in this situatrion one can use a method proposed here .

A singular interaction is said to be present if for some subset of individuals there is a unique minimal sufficient cause .	Empirical and counterfactual conditions are given for sufficient cause interactions and singular interactions between an arbitrary number of causes .
The key elements of the approach are the tree representation of clusters and their coalescence , and the Horton-Strahler scheme for cluster ranking .	Accordingly , the evolution of percolation model is considered as a hierarchical inverse cascade of cluster aggregation .
For the previously least well known parameter we find $ \tilde \kappa_ { e- } ^ { ZZ } = ( -1.9 \pm 5.2 ) \times 10^ { -15 } $ .	Within the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory , our measurement restricts the isotropy violation parameter $ \beta -\delta -\frac 12 $ to $ ( -2.1\pm 1.9 ) \times 10^ { -10 } $ , corresponding to an eightfold improvement with respect to previous non-rotating measurements .
The equivalent widths range from about 0 to 30 \AA in absorption for early-O to mid-B stars .	The purpose of this library is the prediction of the underlying stellar Lyman-alpha absorption in stellar populations of star-forming galaxies with nebular Lyman-alpha emission .
We are interested in the error introduced by a finite element discretisation of these problems .	In contrast to several recent works on the analysis of standard nodal finite element discretisations , we consider here mass-conservative lowest order Raviart-Thomas mixed finite elements .
Our findings corroborate experimental data on spatial chromosomal arrangement in human nuclei , from fibroblast and lymphocyte cell lines , thereby establishing that human genome constrains chromosomal arrangement .	We propose that this unified theory , which requires no additional experimental input , may be extended to other eukaryotic species with annotated genomes to infer their constrained self-organized spatial arrangement of chromosomes .

Here we demonstrate theoretically that the domain wall of this ferromagnet , which carries edge current , is charged and can be controlled by the external electric field .	The chirality and relative stability of the Neel wall and Bloch wall depend on the position of the Fermi energy as well as the form of the coupling between the magnetic moments and orbital of the host TI .
To tackle these two challenges , we propose a novel thresholded multivariate principal component analysis ( PCA ) method for multi-channel profile monitoring .	Our proposed method consists of two steps of dimension reduction : It first applies the functional PCA to extract a reasonable large number of features under the normal operational ( in-control ) state , and then use the soft-thresholding techniques to further select significant features capturing profile information in the out-of-control state .
All of the galaxies have previously been imaged from the ground in UBVI .	A catalogue of structural parameters , photometry and comments based on visual inspection of the clusters is compiled and used to investigate correlations between cluster structure , environment , age and mass .
A Lagrangian description is moreover the natural setting to study decoupling of high-energy physics .	RG flow affects the boundary interactions .
The stepping motion that occurs within a relatively short time scale ( ~100 microsec ) is , however , beyond the resolution of current experiments , therefore a basic understanding to the real-time dynamics within the 8-nm step is still lacking .	For instance , the rate of power stroke ( or conformational change ) , that leads to the undocked-to-docked transition of neck-linker , is not known , and the existence of a substep during the 8-nm step still remains a controversial issue in the kinesin community .
Clustering analysis is one of the data mining applications and K-means clustering algorithm is the fundamental algorithm for modern clustering techniques .	K-means clustering algorithm is traditional approach and iterative algorithm .

We review some of the basic features of the Kazakov-Migdal model of induced QCD .	We emphasize the role of $ Z_N $ symmetry in determining the observable properties of the model and also argue that it can be broken explicitly without ruining the solvability of induced QCD in the infinite $ N $ limit .
Their accretion rates are an order of magnitude higher than expected from the correlation between mass and accretion rates measured from the UV excess , which is applicable if these wide planetary mass companions formed by protostellar core fragmentation .	The high accretion rates and large separation from the central star demonstrate the presence of massive disks around these objects .
However , this work depends on some assumptions concerning the renormalization group and various properties of the dot obeying Random Matrix Theory predictions at scales of the order of the Thouless energy .	In this work we test the validity of those assumptions by considering a particular ballistic dot , the Robnik-Berry billiard , numerically .
However , a lot remains to be learned about the effect of varying glycerol concentration and temperature on the dynamics of water .	We have studied the effect of concentration and temperature on the hydrogen bonded network formed by water molecules .
Here we focus on a prototype scenario with inflaton , \phi , and iso-inflaton , \chi , fields interacting during inflation via the coupling g^2 ( \phi-\phi_0 ) ^2\chi^2 .	Since several previous investigations have hinted at the presence of localized `` glitches '' in the observed primordial power spectrum , which are inconsistent with the simplest power-law model , it is interesting to determine the extent to which such anomalies can be explained by this simple and well-motivated model .
This article concerns properties of mixed $ \ell $ -adic complexes on varieties over finite fields , related to the action of the Frobenius automorphism .	We establish a fiberwise criterion for the semisimplicity and Frobenius semisimplicity of the direct image complex under a proper morphism of varieties over a finite field .
When distances between solitons are large they are particles subject to the mutual interaction .	The dual formulation of the model is derived to explain the sign of the statistical interaction .
We study spin $ \frac12 $ hadronic states in quenched lattice QCD to search for a possible $ S=+1 $ pentaquark resonance .	Simulations are carried out on $ 8^3\times 24 $ , $ 10^3\times 24 $ , $ 12^3\times 24 $ and $ 16^3\times 24 $ lattices at $ \beta $ =5.7 at the quenched level with the standard plaquette gauge action and the Wilson quark action .
The branching fraction for this decay can be substantially enhanced in new physics models .	The kinematics of the tau from the signal B decay are inferred from the K+ , mu , and other B in the event , which is fully reconstructed in one of a variety of hadronic decay modes , allowing the signal B candidate to be fully reconstructed .
No current model mimics all facets of a system as complex as an x-ray binary .	However , a modern theory should qualitatively reproduce -- or at the very least not fundamentally disagree with - all of Cygnus X-1 's most basic average properties : energy spectrum ( viewed within a broader framework of black hole candidate spectral behavior ) , power spectrum ( PSD ) , and time delays and coherence between variability in different energy bands .
We show that many universal and ultrahomogeneous structures allow a concise description ( called here a finite presentation ) .	Extending classical work of Rado ( for the random graph ) , we find a finite presentation for each of the following classes : homogeneous undirected graphs , homogeneous tournaments and homogeneous partially ordered sets .
Are giant flares in magnetars viable sources of gravitational radiation ?	Few theoretical studies have been concerned with this problem , with the small number using either highly idealized models or assuming a magnetic field orders of magnitude beyond what is supported by observations .
New observational facilities are becoming increasingly capable of observing reflected light from transiting and directly imaged extrasolar planets .	In this study , we provide an analytic framework to interpret observed phase curves , geometric albedos , and polarization of giant planet atmospheres .
Single-particle states with mixed isospin and broken parity build up an intrinsic Slater determinant which is then charge and parity projected .	By minimizing the energy of this many-body state with respect to the parameters of the single-particle states and projecting afterwards on angular momentum ground state energies are obtained that are systematically lower than corresponding Hartree-Fock results .
Considering a system consists of N homogeneous agents .	Their behaviors are determined by the returns from their production .
We analyze the partition function of the Ising model on graphs of two different types : complete graphs , wherein all nodes are mutually linked and annealed scale-free networks for which the degree distribution decays as $ P ( k ) \sim k^ { -\lambda } $ .	We are interested in zeros of the partition function in the cases of complex temperature or complex external field ( Fisher and Lee-Yang zeros respectively ) .
We review the application of the method of adiabatic regularization to the Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields in order to renormalize the expectation value of the current and derive a finite coupled set of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the system .	Three time scales are involved in the problem and therefore caution is needed to achieve numerical stability for this system .
The long-range interaction is calculated using the tree algorithm and integrated with the constant-timestep leapfrog integrator .	The short-range term is calculated directly and integrated with the high-order Hermite scheme .
In this article , we first develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when two SDEs are compared , assuming the time domain expands .	Using this we then develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when systems of SDEs are compared , assuming that the number of equations in each system , as well as the time domain , increase indefinitely .
Several junctions are made on a single-domain crystal of CVD graphene and feature the same contact width of ~9 $ \mu $ m but vary in length from 400 to 1000 nm .	As the carrier density is tuned with the gate voltage , the critical current in the these junctions spans a range from a few nA up to more than $ 5\mu $ A , while the Thouless energy , ETh , covers almost two orders of magnitude .
These results do not support the suggestion by MacAlpine et al .	( 1994 ) that these knots might be moving rapidly away from the Crab pulsar due to a collimated wind .
For the Dirac operator , B\ '' ar and Schopka conjectured a limit of unity for the determinant ( [ BS ] ) , i.e.\lim_ { n\to\infty } \det ( D , S^n_ { \mathrm { can } } ) =1 .	We prove their conjecture rigorously , giving asymptotics , as well as a pattern of inequalities satisfied by the determinants .
Such a system can be viewed as a model for a many-body localized system brought into contact with a small bath of a comparable number of degrees of freedom .	We numerically and analytically study the effect of interactions on this system and find that generically , the entire system delocalizes .
Simple models suggest that the 18 micron flux is well approximated by two contiguous annuli of mid-infrared-emitting dust from 2-4 and 4-8 AU with a 3:1 flux ratio for the annuli , respectively .	We consider two scenarios for the collisions that must be resupplying the dust population : ( 1 ) continuous `` steady state '' grinding of planetesimals , and ( 2 ) an isolated cataclysmic collision .
Everybody knows that when a liquid is heated , its temperature increases until the moment when it starts to boil .	The increase in temperature then stops , all heat being used to transform the liquid into vapor .
We assume that the anomalous X-ray emission is caused by the decay of a toroidal or tangled up field that does not partake in the spin down of the star .	We find that we can explain the observed properties , such as the period and field distributions and the Period - Period derivative diagram , if we suitably parametrise the time evolution of the anomalous X-ray luminosity as an exponentially decaying function of time .
We consider the non-forward solution of the BFKL equation at high energy and large momentum transfer and estimate the total and differential cross section for the process $ \gamma \gamma \to V_1 V_2 $ , where $ V_1 $ and $ V_2 $ can be any two vector mesons ( $ V_i = \rho , \omega , \phi , J/\Psi , \Upsilon $ ) .	A comparison between our predictions and previous theoretical results obtained at Born level or assuming the Pomeron-exchange factorization relations is presented .
We present results from a low resolution ( R~300 ) near-infrared spectroscopic variability survey of actively accreting T Tauri stars ( TTS ) in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region .	Paschen and Brackett series H I recombination lines were detected in 73 spectra of 15 classical T Tauri systems .
Concrete , a mixture formed by mixing cement , water , and fine and coarse mineral aggregates is used in the construction of nuclear power plants ( NPPs ) , e.g. , to construct the reactor cavity concrete that encases the reactor pressure vessel , etc .	In such environments , concrete may be exposed to radiation ( e.g. , neutrons ) emanating from the reactor core .
The length of the throat is related to the amount of entanglement between modes on either side of the horizon .	So it is natural to try to relate the black hole Meissner effect to entanglement .
Absorption spectra were taken under different rotational angles after 24 h after irradiation and we fitted the spectra using Lorentzian functions .	There were two dominant absorption peaks at approximately 586 nm ( green ) and 634 nm ( red ) .

The distance from a given position toward one or more destinations , exits , and way points is a more or less important input variable in most models of pedestrian dynamics .	Except for the special case when there are no obstacles in a concave scenario -- i.e.each position is visible from any other -- the calculation of these distances is a non-trivial task .
Equilibrium states of a system at zero external field and fixed $ P $ and $ T $ are described by points in three-dimensional space with coordinates $ \eta $ , the order parameter , $ T $ , the temperature and $ \phi $ , the thermodynamic potential .	These points form the so-called zero field curve in the $ ( \eta , T , \phi ) $ space .
We devise a Monte-Carlo based , optimized filter match method to extract the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ( SZ ) signature of a catalog of 116 low-redshift X-ray clusters from the first year data release of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) .	We detect an over-all amplitude for the SZ signal at the ~ 8-sigma level , yielding a combined constraint of f_ { gas } h = 0.08 +/- 0.01 ( ran ) +/- 0.01 ( sys ) on the gas mass fraction of the Intra-Cluster Medium .
We compare results obtained with three different families of Skyrme parameterizations whose tensor terms have been adjusted on properties of spherical nuclei : ( i ) TIJ interactions proposed in the first paper of this series [ T. Lesinski et al. , Phys.Rev .	C 76 , 014312 ( 2007 ) ] which were constructed through a complete readjustment of the rest of the functional ( ii ) parameterizations whose tensor terms have been added perturbatively to existing Skyrme interactions , with or without readjusting the spin-orbit coupling constant .
Here it is shown that the entire range from 5.7 to 7.5 is well described by a power series of the lattice spacing $ a $ times the lambda lattice mass scale $ \Lambda_L $ , using asymptotic scaling in the 2-loop and 3-loop approximations for $ a\Lambda_L $ .	In both cases identical ratios for gradient flows versus deconfinement observables are obtained .
In recent years advanced technologies such as SOA and Cloud computing have been evolved to address integration problems .	The Clouds enormous capacity with comparable low cost makes it an ideal platform for SOA deployment .
Then , within the Higher Tamm-Dancoff Approximation ( HTDA ) , which explicitly conserves the particle number , we calculate the same properties starting from the HFBCS solutions .	The HTDA treatment of the ground-state correlations is converged within a n-particle-n-hole expansion using up to n=4 particle-hole excitations of the pair type ( in the sense of Cooper pairs ) .
This limit falls into a general class of two-dimensional systems of driven linear SDEs which have stationary measures on gradients .	Taking the number of particles to infinity we demonstrate Gaussian free field type fluctuations for the stationary measure .

Time resolved I-band photometry has been obtained with the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope , while a 3 ks Chandra observation provided contemporaneous X-ray coverage .	We found an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux of 1x10^-13 erg cm-2 s-1 which implies that the source was in quiescence at the time of the optical observations .
In 1878 , Jordan showed that a finite subgroup of GL ( n , C ) contains an abelian normal subgroup whose index is bounded by a function of n alone .	Previously , the author has given precise bounds .
The plasmon dispersion of the extrinsic ( doped ) system displays a minimum at finite temperature before it crosses over to the superlinear intrinsic behavior at higher temperature , implying that the high-temperature plasmon is a universal feature of Dirac liquids irrespective of doping .	This striking characteristic temperature dependence of intrinsic Dirac plasmons along with the logarithmic renormalization is a unique manifestation of the three-dimensional relativistic Dirac nature of quasiparticle excitations and serves as an experimentally observable signature of three-dimensional Dirac materials .
We consider various forms of the SCET result , which correspond to different choices of the soft scale mu_s that characterizes this approach .	We derive a master formula that relates the SCET resummation to the QCD result for any choice of mu_s .
We place an upper limit on the current star formation rate of ~2.5 x 10^-3 M_sun/yr .	The extended HI disk shows regular rotation ( v_rot = 51 +/- 8 km/s ) , and at a column density of ~5.0 x 10^19 atoms/cm^2 can be traced out to over six times the Holmberg radius of the stellar component ( radius at mu_B = 26.6 mag/arcsec^2 ) .
A tilt grain boundary of a top graphene sheet in graphene multilayers leads to a twist between consecutive layers and generates superstructures ( Moir\'e patterns ) on one side of the boundary .	Our results demonstrate that the twisting changes the electronic spectra of Bernal graphene bilayer and graphene trilayers dramatically .
The achievement of sustained nuclear fusion in magnetically confined plasma relies on efficient confinement of high-energy ions produced by the fusion reaction .	Such particles can excite Alfven Eigenmodes ( AEs ) , which significantly degrade their confinement and threatens the vacuum vessel of future reactors .
To comprehend the role of such ices in the chemistry and evolution of dense molecular clouds and comets , it is necessary to understand the freeze-out , potential surface reactivity , and desorption mechanisms of such molecular systems .	Consequently , there is a real need from within the astronomical modelling community for accurate empirical molecular data pertaining to these processes .
It was previously shown that magnetic sources were responsible for the quantization of several mass-splittings in Mac Gregor 's model .	The existence of a 70-MeV quantum was postulated by Mac Gregor and was shown to fit the Nambu empirical mass formula mn = ( n/2 ) 137me , n a positive integer .
We announce the discovery of a quasar behind the disk of M31 , which was previously classified as a remarkable nova in our neighbour galaxy .	The paper is primarily aimed at the outburst of J004457+4123 ( Sharov 21 ) , with the first part focussed on the optical spectroscopy and the improvement in the photometric database .
Two different scenarios have been invoked to explain its X-ray properties : wind-wind interaction and magnetic wind confinement .	Yet , HD 93250 shows absolutely constant radial velocities over time scales of years suggesting either a single star , a binary system seen pole-one or a very long period and/or highly eccentric system .
With this goal in mind , here for the first time we obtain fully explicit bounds for the number of rational points near planar curves .	Further , introducing a perturbational approach we bring the smoothness condition imposed on the curves down to $ C^1 $ ( lowest possible ) .
The gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters hosting active galaxies is a complex combination of diffuse and point-like emission with different spectral and spatial properties .	We discuss the case of the Perseus cluster containing the radio-galaxy NGC 1275 that has been detected as a bright gamma-ray source by the Fermi-LAT experiment .
Afterwards a term in the action that softly violates the detailed balance condition has been considered with the attempt of obtaining a more realistic theory in its IR-limit .	This term is proportional to $ \omega R^ { ( 3 ) } $ , where $ \omega $ is a constant parameter and $ R^ { ( 3 ) } $ is the spatial Ricci scalar .
Combinatorial methods are developed to find the cluster coordinates for moduli space of flat connections which is describing the Coulomb branch of higher rank N=2 theories derived by compactifying six dimensional ( 2,0 ) theory on a punctured Riemann surface .	The construction starts with a triangulation of the punctured Riemann surface and a further tessellation of all the triangles .
The continuous G-deformations preserving the product of principal curvatures of surface with boundary are considered in this article .	The equations of deformations which are obtained in this paper reduce to the nonlinear boundary-value problem .
Frame-invariance is investigated in complete generality , referring to any automorphic transformation in space-time , in accord with the spirit of general relativity .	A main result of the new geometric theory is the assessment of frame-invariance of space-time electromagnetic differential forms and induction laws and of their spatial counterparts under any change of frame .
We argue that the trace structure of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action can be fixed by demanding that the action be linearised by certain energy-minimising BPS-like configurations .	It is shown how instantons in D4-branes , SU ( 2 ) monopoles and dyons in D3-branes , and vortices in D2-branes are all BPS states of the action recently proposed by Tseytlin .
The estimator is based on the idea of a conforming reconstruction of the discrete diffusive flux , that can be computed using local information only .	It is offline/online decomposable and can thus be efficiently used in the context of model reduction .
The solutions have the form of the pairs of the Landau quantization levels due to the spinor-type wave functions .	The energy levels depend on amplitudes of the magnetic and electric fields , on the g-factor { g-h } , and on the parameter of nonparabolicity C. The dependences of two energy levels in any pair on the Zeeman parameter { Z_h } = { g_h } { m_h } /4 { m_0 } , where { m_h } is the hole effective mass , are nonmonotonous and without intersections .
The self-calibration method exploits the theoretical fact that the $ EB $ and $ TB $ cross-spectra of the CMB vanish in the standard cosmological model , so any detected $ EB $ and $ TB $ signals must be due to systematic errors .	However , this assumption neglects the fact that polarized Galactic foregrounds in a given portion of the sky may have non-zero $ EB $ and $ TB $ cross-spectra .
Accordingly , a multiple-bifurcation of the quantum groundstate fidelity is shown to occur as the transverse magnetic field varies from the symmetry phase to the broken-symmetry phase , which means that a multiple-bifurcation point corresponds to a critical point .	A ( dis- ) continuous behavior of quantum fidelity at phase transition points characterizes a ( dis- ) continuous phase transition .
The comparisons are restricted to basic assumptions and approximations made in each case and the calculation methodology used .	Emergent underlying similarities between apparently disparate methods brought about by the approximation schemes are exposed .
Kinematic signatures of the outflow are visible in both the CO and HI emission : both tracers show a minor axis velocity gradient and together they show double peaked profiles , consistent with a hot outflow bounded by a cone made of a mix of atomic and molecular gas .	Combining our CO and HI data with observations of the dust continuum , we study the changing properties of the cold outflow as it leaves the disk .
A uniquely $ k $ -colorable graph $ G $ is edge-critical if $ G-e $ is not a uniquely $ k $ -colorable graph for any edge $ e\in E ( G ) $ .	Mel'nikov and Steinberg [ L. S. Mel'nikov , R. Steinberg , One counterexample for two conjectures on three coloring , Discrete Math .
In the SO ( 10 ) GUT framework , we impose the D-parity realization below GUT scale .	These two conditions makes our model more restrictive and predictive .
The associated tiling can be viewed as a substitution tiling .	We use the substitution rule for this tiling and apply the algorithm of \cite { AL } to check overlap coincidence .
Such a superconductor is expected to be topological , thereby supporting topologically protected gapless Majorana-Weyl edge modes .	Such modes manifest themselves in chiral dissipationless edge currents , which we exhibit and investigate in the context of our construction .
We first review the work of the Syracuse group , which uses an effective chiral Lagrangian approach , on meson-meson scattering .	An illustration providing evidence for the existence of a strange scalar resonance of mass around 900 MeV is given .
For the first time , the low-energy level structure of the N=19 , 30Na ( Tz = 4 ) , is obtained from beta-delayed gamma spectroscopy using fragment-beta-gamma-gamma coincidences .	The level structure clearly displays `` inversion '' , i.e. , intruder states with mainly 2p2h configurations displacing the normal states to higher excitation energies .
We consider associative ( resp .	Poisson ) R-deformations of the structure sheaf O_X .
We compute the bispectrum for the galaxy distribution in the IRAS QDOT , 2Jy , and 1.2Jy redshift catalogs for wavenumbers 0.05 & lt ; k & lt ; 0.2 h/Mpc and compare the results with predictions from gravitational instability in perturbation theory .	Taking into account redshift space distortions , nonlinear evolution , the survey selection function , and discreteness and finite volume effects , all three catalogs show evidence for the dependence of the bispectrum on configuration shape predicted by gravitational instability .
It also provides a natural formalism in which to relate the hole argument to the problem of time in classical and quantum gravity .	In this paper , we examine the connection between these two much discussed problems in the foundations of spacetime theory along two interrelated lines .
We characterize the latter type completions as the ones for which the ideal of the 'hypersurface at infinity ' is radical .	Moreover , we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the collection of minimal associated primes of the latter ideal and the unique minimal collection of semidegrees needed to define the corresponding degree like function .
The objective of this paper is to quantify the uncertainties that makes the decision more realistic , generic and extendable to application domain .	In this paper various reliability parameters ( such as mean time between failures , expected number of failures , reliability , availability etc . )
The present analysis is based on a total sample of 1995 events of CNGS neutrino interactions , which corresponds to an almost doubled sample with respect to the previously published result .	Four clear { \nu } e events have been visually identified over the full sample , compared with an expectation of 6.4 +- 0.9 events from conventional sources .
We report some recent progress in the computation of the n-point correlation functions of conserved currents in a class of four dimensional conformal field theories with higher spin symmetry .	Global conformal invariance leads to very strong constraints on both the general form and the singularity structure of the correlation functions of conserved currents .
These codes mainly use the super matrices .	These codes can be realized as a special type of concatenated codes .
In order to obtain a reliable value of the axial mass , bins with large contribution from small momentum transfer are eliminated from the analysis .	It is shown that the best fit axial mass value becomes smaller as the momentum transfer cut is more restrictive .
The $ ( q , r ) $ -Eulerian polynomials are the $ ( \maj- $ $ \exc , \fix , \exc ) $ enumerative polynomials of permutations .	Using Shareshian and Wachs ' exponential generating function of these Eulerian polynomials , Chung and Graham proved two symmetrical $ q $ -Eulerian identities and asked for bijective proofs .
Such findings can be interpreted as an evidence for an additional nonthermal pressure in the outskirts of these clusters .	This nonthermal component may be due to turbulence stirred by residual bulk motions of extragalactic gas infalling into the cluster .
The combined calculations provide a more reliable estimate of the odd-even splitting of the potentials than previously found , suggesting a rather moderate role for this splitting in deuteron-nucleus scattering generally .	The approximate parity-independence of the deuteron optical potentials is shown to arise from the nontrivial interference between antisymmetrization and channel coupling to the deuteron breakup channels .
However , there are some subtleties in the calculation of Hawking radiation , and particularly is the so-called factor of 2 problem during calculating the Hawking temperature .	The most popular opinion on this problem is that it is just a problem of the choice of coordinates .
We investigate the transition radiation on a periodically deformed interface between two dielectric media .	Under the assumption that the dielectric permittivities of the media are close , a formula is derived for the spectral-angular distribution of the radiated energy in the general case of non-static profile function for the separating boundary .
Within the framework on non-extensive thermostatistics we revisit the recently advanced q-duality concept .	We focus our attention here on a modified q-entropic measure of the spatial inhomogeneity for binary patterns .
In this second paper we discuss and clarify how the relation of the electrons to the above objects can be used in a program for evaluation of finite-energy few-electron spectral functions .	As a first step , here we characterize the dominant holon and spinon microscopic physical processes that originate more than 99 % of the few-electron spectral weight .
At the second vertex , a strong color field is assumed to play the role of particle production , which depend on the momentum transferred from the first vertex .	The wave function of the nucleon quarks are determined using the variation method and relevant boundary conditions are applied to calculate the deep inelastic cross sections of the virtual diagram .
On the other hand , it is shown that no finite set of moves exists , even in type A , for arbitrary crystal graph intervals .	In fact , it is shown that there are relations of arbitrarily high degree amongst crystal operators that are not implied by lower degree relations .
A new type of quasi-two-dimensional complex plasma system was observed which consisted of monodisperse microspheres and their binary agglomerations ( dimers ) .	The particles and their dimers levitated in a plasma sheath at slightly different heights and formed two distinct sublayers .
We introduce the notion of numerical ( strong ) peak function and investigate the denseness of the norm and numerical peak functions on complex Banach spaces .	Let $ A_b ( B_X : X ) $ be the Banach space of all bounded continuous functions $ f $ on the unit ball $ B_X $ of a Banach space $ X $ and their restrictions $ f|_ { B_X^\circ } $ to the open unit ball are holomorphic .
We completely classify definite multiplicity spaces for generic tensor products of $ \mathfrak { sl } _2 $ Verma modules .

The query complexity of our algorithm is linear in the separation number of the skeleton graph of the manifold and the size of its boundary .	As a corollary we get an $ O ( \sqrt { n } ) $ deterministic query algorithm for the black-box version of the problem { \bf 2D-SPERNER } , a well studied member of Papadimitriou 's complexity class PPAD .
The spread of a set of points is the ratio between the longest and shortest pairwise distances .	We show that in the worst case , the Delaunay triangulation of n points in R^3 with spread D has complexity Omega ( min { D^3 , nD , n^2 } ) and O ( min { D^4 , n^2 } ) .

They proved that all isometries of V over a field F of characteristic not 2 have determinant 1 if and only if V has no orthogonal summands of odd dimension ( the case of characteristic 2 was also considered ) .	Their proof is based on Riehm 's classification of bilinear forms .
Double peaked broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei are generally considered to be formed in an accretion disc .	In this paper , we compute the profiles of reprocessing emission lines from a relativistic , warped accretion disc around a black hole in order to explore the possibility that certain asymmetries in the double-peaked emission line profile which can not be explained by a circular Keplerian disc may be induced by disc warping .
This means that tetrad components of $ R , \nabla R , \nabla^ { ( 2 ) } R $ are constant , and that essential coordinates first appear as components of $ \nabla^ { ( 3 ) } R $ .	Covariant derivatives of orders 4,5,6 yield one additional invariant each , and $ \nabla^ { ( 7 ) } R $ is needed for invariant classification .
Motivated by these experiments , considerable theoretical efforts have recently been devoted to reexamine the interplay between Kondo screening and magnetic interactions in Kondo lattice systems .	A local quantum critical picture has emerged , in which magnetic interactions suppress Kondo screening precisely at the magnetic quantum critical point ( QCP ) .
The second author has recently introduced the Sylvester coloring conjecture , which states that for any cubic graph $ G $ one has : $ S\prec G $ .	Here $ S $ is the Sylvester graph on ten vertices .
We have observed an isotropic superconducting gap along the hole-like Fermi surface with the gap size Delta of ~4 meV ( 2Delta/kBTc~7 ) , demonstrating the strong-coupling nature of the superconductivity .	The observed similarity of low-energy electronic excitations between iron-chalcogenide and iron-arsenide superconductors strongly suggests that common interactions which involve Q~ ( pi , pi ) scattering are responsible for the superconducting pairing .
The ternary and quaternary films were grown at 620 C. Different alloy compositions were obtained by varying the Al and Ga fluxes .	The alloy composition was measured by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy ( EDX ) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry ( RBS ) .
Certain singularities of the G_2 manifolds are related to fixed points of these isometries ; there are two combinations of Killing vectors that possess co-dimension four fixed points which yield upon compactification only intersecting D6-branes if one also identifies two parameters .	Two of the remaining parameters are quantized and we argue that they are related to the number of D6-branes , which appear in three stacks .
The necessary step towards the interpretation of such spectra is to study the line formation in sufficiently realistic 3D MHD models and comparison of the synthetic spectra with observations .

In the high temperature undistorted phase , we find good agreement with the recently proposed centrosymmetric space group Pmmn .	On the other hand , the detailed analysis of the electronic excitations detected in the optical conductivity , provides direct evidence for a charge disproportionated electronic ground-state , at least on a locale scale : A consistent interpretation of both structural and optical conductivity data requires an asymmetrical charge distribution on each rung , without any long range order .
We prove an analogue of the Lefschetz ( 1,1 ) Theorem characterizing cohomology classes of Cartier divisors ( or equivalently first Chern classes of line bundles ) in the second integral cohomology .	Let $ X $ be a normal complex projective variety .
In particular , it predicts a phase transition between species coexistence and biodiversity loss in the infinite-size limit and , in finite populations , a nonmonotonic dependence of the mean fixation time on the migration rate .

Given a random ( or deterministic ) subset X of D one can define the scaling dimension of X using either Lebesgue measure or this random measure .	We derive a general quadratic relation between these two dimensions , which we view as a probabilistic formulation of the KPZ relation from conformal field theory .
Yet inferring one from the other appears difficult .	Indeed , such an inference would need detailed information about customer behavior , and might be clouded by modes of behavior such as herding ( following popularity ) or elitism , where customers avoid popular products .
We find that this expansion is only consistent for tachyon fields which are polynomials .	In that case , we show that the theory is renormalized by normal ordering the interaction .
In order to claim that one has experimentally tested whether a noncontextual ontological model could underlie certain measurement statistics in quantum theory , it is necessary to have a notion of noncontextuality that applies to unsharp measurements , i.e. , those that can only be represented by positive operator-valued measures rather than projection-valued measures .	This is because any realistic measurement necessarily has some nonvanishing amount of noise and therefore never achieves the ideal of sharpness .
In the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model , a bino-like LSP can be as light as a few GeV and satisfy WMAP constraints on the dark matter relic density in the presence of a light CP-odd Higgs scalar .	We study upper bounds on the direct detection cross sections for such a light LSP in the mass range 2-20 GeV in the NMSSM , respecting all constraints from B-physics and LEP .
The structure of $ [ [ R ] ] $ reflects the symmetry of the quasicrystal .

Semiconductor quantum dots ( QDs ) in photonic nanocavities provide monolithic , robust platforms for both quantum information processing and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) .	An inherent feature of such solid-state cavity QED systems is the presence of electron-phonon interactions , which distinguishes these systems from conventional atomic cavity QED .
The near-field part is typically approximated by special quadrature rules like the Sauter-Schwab technique that can handle the singular integrals appearing in the diagonal and near-diagonal matrix elements .	Since computing one element of the matrix requires only a small amount of data but a fairly large number of operations , we propose to use GPUs to handle vectorizable portions of the computation : near-field computations are ideally suited for vectorization and can therefore be handled very well by GPUs .
Thus , when we prepare a BEC in a magnetic sublevel $ m=0 $ , thermally and quantum-mechanically excited atoms in the $ m=1 $ and $ -1 $ states feel the Lorentz-like foces in the opposite directions .	This is the origin for the emergence of the the spin Hall effect .

In this paper we establish global Lp regularity properties of Fourier integral operators .	The orders of decay of the amplitude are determined for operators to be bounded on $ L^p ( \Rn ) $ , $ 1 & lt ; p & lt ; \infty $ , as well as to be bounded from Hardy space $ H^1 ( \Rn ) $ to $ L^1 ( \Rn ) $ .
First , the inflaton perturbation must account for much more than $ 10\ % $ of the curvature perturbation $ \zeta $ , which barring fine-tuning means that it accounts for practically all of it .	It follows that a curvaton-like mechanism for generating $ \zeta $ requires an alternative to slow roll such as k-inflation .

Initial discrepancies in the comparisons indicated the need for improvement of several of the analytical estimates .	As an example , we found that the fourth-order Runge-Kutta/Predictor-Corrector method was slow but accurate , and that it passed all the benchmarks it was tested against , often to the sub-part per billion level .
Besides static capillary forces , fluctuation -- induced forces caused by thermally excited capillary waves arise at fluid interfaces .	For the specific choice of a spatially fixed three -- phase contact line , the asymptotic behavior of the fluctuation -- induced force is determined analytically for both the close -- distance and the long -- distance regime and compared to numerical solutions .

The research on human cognition has recently benefited from the use of the mathematical formalism of quantum theory in Hilbert space .	However , cognitive situations exist which indicate that the Hilbert space structure , and the associated Born rule , would be insufficient to provide a satisfactory modeling of the collected data , so that one needs to go beyond Hilbert space .

As a test case we show that a halo dwarf of 0.85 Msun with an extended overshooting envelope starting with an initial abundance of A ( Li ) = 2.74 would burn Li completely , but an accretion rate of the type 1e-8xe^ { -t/3e6 } Msun yr $ ^ { -1 } $ would restore Li to end with an A ( Li ) = 2.31 .	A self-regulating process is required to produce similar final values in a range of different stellar masses to explain the PopII Spite plateau .

Vela 's broadband gamma-ray spectrum is equally well fit with both the exponential cut-off and the double power law shapes .	In the broadband double power-law fits , for a typical Fermi spectrum of a bright \gamma-ray pulsar , most of the errors accumulate due to the arbitrary parametrization of the spectral roll-off .
The reduced spectra were fitted with a multicomponent model in order to isolate the contributions of various continuum and emission-line components .	We present light curves of broad emission lines and the AGN continuum , and measurements of the broad H-beta line widths in mean and root-mean square ( rms ) spectra .

It is shown that ( P_h -I ) /h converges for small h to a second order elliptic differential operator L on compactly supported functions and that the Markov chain process associated to P_h converges to a diffusion with infinitesimal generator L. Both P_h and L are selfadjoint ( densely ) defined on the space L2 ( H , { \eta } ) of square-integrable functions over the ( lower ) half-space H in R^m , where { \eta } is a stationary measure .	This measure 's density is either ( post-collision ) Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution or Knudsen cosine law , and the random processes with infinitesimal generator L respectively correspond to what we call MB diffusion and ( generalized ) Legendre diffusion .
Evidence for the violation of positivity by quarks and transverse gluons in the covariant gauge is collected , and it is argued that this is one manifestation of confinement .	We summarise the derivation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations ( DSEs ) of QED and QCD .
To have a better understanding of ion and electron data from experiments derived from laser-irradiated clusters , one needs to simulate cluster dynamics on such long timescales for which the molecular dynamics approach becomes inefficient .	We therefore propose a two-step Molecular Dynamics-Hydrodynamic scheme .

Classical and quantum dynamics of a harmonic oscillator in a monochromatic wave is studied in the exact resonance and near resonance cases .	This model describes , in particular , a dynamics of a cold ion trapped in a linear ion trap and interacting with two lasers fields with close frequencies .
The majority of the approaches to the automatic recovery of a panoramic image from a set of partial views are suboptimal in the sense that the input images are aligned , or registered , pair by pair , e.g. , consecutive frames of a video clip .	These approaches lead to propagation errors that may be very severe , particularly when dealing with videos that show the same region at disjoint time intervals .
Testing heteroscedasticity of the errors is a major challenge in high-dimensional regressions where the number of covariates is large compared to the sample size .	Traditional procedures such as the White and the Breusch-Pagan tests typically suffer from low sizes and powers .
We use the recently proposed scattering states numerical renormalization group ( SNRG ) approach to calculate $ I ( V ) $ and the differential conductance through a single molecular level coupled to a local molecular phonon .

We study the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff ( DMT ) for the slow fading interference channel with a relay ( ICR ) .	We derive four inner bounds on the DMT region : the first is based on the compress-and-forward ( CF ) relaying scheme , the second is based on the decode-and-forward ( DF ) relaying scheme , and the last two bounds are based on the half-duplex ( HD ) and full-duplex ( FD ) amplify-and-forward ( AF ) schemes .
The performance is good both asymptotically , since the belief propagation thresholds approach capacity , as well as for finite lengths , since degree-2 variables that result in high error floors can be completely avoided .	However , to realize the promised good performance , one needs large blocklengths .
Considering the full three-dimensional motion , we point out that the built-in dynamics can facilitate switching without requiring any asymmetry in potential landscape even in the presence of thermal noise .	With experimentally feasible parameters , we theoretically demonstrate such intriguing possibility in electric field-induced magnetization switching of a magnetostrictive nanomagnet .

At the transition to jamming , we observe finite-size effects in a variety of quantities describing the flow and the density correlations , but only if the maximum speed $ V_ { \text { max } } $ is larger than a certain value .	A finite-size scaling analysis of several order parameters shows universal behavior , with scaling exponents that depend on $ V_ { \text { max } } $ .
We estimate the time delay from the light curves using three different techniques : the chi-squared analysis of Press , Rybicki , & amp ; Hewitt ( 1992a , b ) , the dispersion analysis of Pelt et al .	( 1994 , 1996 ) , and the locally normalized discrete correlation function of Leh\'ar et al . ( 1992 ) .

Using the combined inversion I invert for horizontal flows in the upper 10 Mm of the solar convection zone .	The flows connected with supergranulation seem to be coherent only in the upper ~5 Mm depth , deeper down there is a hint on change of convection scales towards structures larger than supergranules .
We show that a prolate cloud oriented perpendicular to its orbital plane naturally produces a spread in angular momenta in the gas which can translate into misaligned discs as is seen in the young stars orbiting Sagittarius A* .	A turbulent or otherwise highly structured cloud is necessary to avoid cancelling too much angular momentum through shocks at closest approach .

The approach considers the total free energy of a system as a functional of a local electronic Green function which is probed in the region of interest .	Since we have a variety of notions of locality in our formulation , our method is manifestly basis -- set dependent .
I hesitated for a long time before giving shape to these notes , originally intended for preliminary reading by the attendees to the Summer School `` New paths towards quantum gravity '' ( Holbaek Bay , Denmark , May 2008 ) .	At the end , I decide against just selling my mathematical wares , and for a survey , necessarily very selective , but taking a global phenomenological approach to its subject matter .
A contribution of the ultrapower characterization was that it involved sorting out the global theory , and introducing nonforking , seminal for the development of stability theory .	Prior to the present paper , there had been no such characterization of an unstable class .
A complex structure in pseudorapidity and azimuth is observed at both collision energies .	Results are compared to Pythia 8 and Herwig++ as well as to the AMBT2B , DW and Perugia 2011 tunes of Pythia 6 .
This family was recently obtained by performing a complete gauge fixing adapted to cylindrical symmetry .	In the present work , we find boundary conditions that ensure that the metric arising from this gauge fixing is well defined and that the resulting reduced system has a consistent Hamiltonian dynamics .
We find a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point in the Einstein-Hilbert action .	The fixed point connects with the perturbative infrared domain through finite renormalisation group trajectories .
In addition , the LFI instrument generates the so called housekeeping data by sampling regularly the on-board sensors and registers .	The housekeeping data provides information on the overall health status of the instrument and on the scientific data quality .
Here I show , based on a first-principles lattice-dynamical analysis , that their relationship is much more intimate than previously thought , and their consistent simultaneous treatment is crucial for obtaining correct physical answers .	In particular , I identify a gauge invariance in the theory , whereby the energies associated to strain-gradient elasticity and flexoelectrically induced electric fields are individually reference-dependent , and only when summed up they yield a well-defined result .
This paper addresses collision avoidance , by describing a method that contributes to achieving a requisite increase in orbit prediction accuracy .	Batch least-squares differential correction is applied to the publicly available two-line element ( TLE ) catalog of space objects .
It is capable to describe the Lagrangian diffusion and dispersion of temporally and spatially correlated clouds of particles .	Although the model neglects intermittent corrections , we show that pair and tetrad dispersion results nicely compare with Direct Numerical Simulations of statistically isotropic and homogeneous $ 3D $ turbulence .
Despite the fact that two of our IGC candidates have integrated colors redder than the mean of the M87 globular cluster system , we propose that all of the objects are metal-poor with [ M/H ] & lt ; -1 .	We show that the tidal radii of our intracluster globulars are all larger than the mean for Milky Way clusters , and suggest that the clusters have undergone less tidal stress than their Galactic counterparts .
The real ( dissipative ) magnetoconductance changes sign as a function of frequency for low enough density of electrons .	The signal observed at frequency below the mean level spacing corresponds to a negative magnetoconductance , which is opposite to the weak localization seen in connected systems , and becomes positive at higher frequency .
Context .	The study of the snow line is an important topic in several domains of astrophysics , and particularly for the evolution of proto-stellar environments and the formation of planets.Aims .

While a wide range of approaches have met varying levels of success , most IDS 's rely on having access to a database of known attack signatures which are written by security experts .	Nowadays , in order to solve problems with false positive alters , correlation algorithms are used to add additional structure to sequences of IDS alerts .
The star has an ionised wind and using the Br gamma hydrogen recombination emission we assess the mass-loss on spatial scales of order 1 au .	We present new VLT Interferometer AMBER data which are combined with all other AMBER data in the literature .
In this article we investigate the counting statistics of rare quantum trajectories of an undriven system undergoing a pure relaxation process , namely , Markovian exciton transport .	We find that dynamical crossovers occur in systems with a minimum of three interacting molecules , and are strongly activated by exciton delocalization and interference .
The pre-shock magnetic field increases from 5 .	10^ { -6 } gauss in the surrounding ISM to ~8 .
Of more direct physical interest is the commutator of finite mass fields , obtained by smearing the string fields with appropriate wave functions .	This is shown to vanish at spacelike separations , reproducing the usual point particle field theory result .
As a consequence we find out a Kouchnirenko type formula for the Milnor number $ ( C,0 ) $ .	Our results provide a geometrical approach to Abhyankar 's straight line conditions and its consequences .
We show a generic phase transition in the system : when hipsters are too slow in detecting the trends , they will keep making the same choices and therefore remain correlated as time goes by , while their trend evolves in time as a periodic function .	This is true as long as the majority of the population is made of hipsters .
The Boltzmann equations are formulated in the inertial frame with collision terms being evaluated to the zeroth order of v/c .	A basic set of neutrino reactions for three neutrino species is implemented together with a realistic equation of state of dense matter .
An effective action is obtained for the $ N=1 $ , $ 2D- $ induced supergravity on a compact super Riemann surface ( without boundary ) $ \hat\Sigma $ of genus $ g & gt ; 1 $ , as the general solution of the corresponding superconformal Ward identity .	This is accomplished by defining a new super integration theory on $ \hat\Sigma $ which includes a new formulation of the super Stokes theorem and residue calculus in the superfield formalism .
Formally , the frozen mode regime is not a resonance , in a sense that it is not particularly sensitive to the size and shape of the photonic crystal .	The frozen mode regime is more robust and powerful , compared to any known slow-wave resonance .
Owing to the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor , both a production of radion in $ \gamma \gamma $ collision and its decay to gluon pair are enhanced sizably .	We find that the photon collider has a sensitivity for discovering the radion in low-mass region up to $ \Lambda_\phi\sim 3 { \rm TeV } $ , where $ \Lambda_\phi $ is a scale parameter which suppresses the interactions of radion to the Standard Model particles .
Combined with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) simulation , we recover the projected root-mean-square velocity ( V_rms ) field of the stellar component , and investigate constraints on the stellar mass-to-light ratio , M^*/L , and the fraction of dark matter f_ { DM } within 2.5 effective radii ( R_e ) .	We find that the enclosed total mass within 2.5 R_e is well constrained to within 10 % .
introduce a general framework to prove duality theorems between special decompositions and their dual combinatorial object .	They thus unify all known ad-hoc proofs in one single theorem .
This thesis is concerned with the application of operadic methods , particularly modular operads , to questions arising in the study of moduli spaces of surfaces as well as applications to the study of homotopy algebras and new constructions of 'quantum invariants ' of manifolds inspired by ideas originating from physics .	We consider the extension of classical 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories to Klein topological quantum field theories which allow unorientable surfaces .
We explore this formulation further in this paper .	An action for a fluid of relativistic particles ( with and without spin ) is given in terms of the Lorentz and Poincare ( or de Sitter ) groups .
These expressions are obtained by matching wave functions at the interfaces between the regions , where quasiparticles have constant but different potential energies .	It is shown that for an $ U_0 $ high barrier and low-energy electrons and holes , the mode transmission of charge carriers in this type of ribbons is described by the textbook formula , where the constant barrier is replaced by an effective , energy-dependent barrier , $ U_0\to U ( E ) $ .
Several bright OB stars in W40 - visible at optical , infrared , or cm wavelengths - are providing the ionizing flux that heats the HII region .	The known stellar component of W40 is dominated by a small number of partly or fully embedded OB stars which have been studied at various wavelengths , but the lower mass stellar population remains largely unexamined .
While the local anisotropy contribution peaks at low multipoles , for reasonable models of the mass and velocity distributions associated with local super structures we find that the amplitude of temperature anisotropies is at most at a level of 10 $ ^ { -2 } $ $ \mu $ K and is substantially smaller than primordial fluctuations .	It is extremely unlikely that the momentum density of local mass concentrations is responsible for any of the large angular scale anomalies in WMAP data .
The primary motivations for DOSNs are privacy and autonomy from big brotherly service providers .	The promise of decentralization is complete freedom for end-users from any service providers both in terms of keeping privacy about content and communication , and also from any form of censorship .

In this paper , we resolve both the global and the local non-global minimizers of ( p-RS ) for $ p & gt ; 2 $ with necessary and sufficient optimality conditions .	Moreover , we prove a parallel result of Mart\ ' { \i } nez \cite { Mar } that the ( p-RS ) for $ p & gt ; 2 $ , analogous to the trust region subproblem , can have at most one local non-global minimizer .
When doing inference in ProbLog , a probabilistic extension of Prolog , we extend SLD resolution with some additional bookkeeping .	This additional information is used to compute the probabilistic results for a probabilistic query .
The crossover temperature $ T_c $ corresponding to the maximal magnetization decays with system size , approximately as the inverse of the W Lambert function .	The observed phenomenon can be understood as an interplay between the thermal fluctuations and the presence of the first cluster determined by initial conditions .
We microscopically analyze the boundary problem for the continuous Bogoliubov-de Gennes-Dirac ( BdGD ) equations and derive the Green functions for normal and superconducting graphene layers .	Importing the idea used in tight-binding ( TB ) models of a microscopic hopping that couples different regions , we are able to set up and solve an algebraic Dyson 's equation describing a graphene-superconductor junction .
The method has been tested with a detector made of a continuous LSO-scintillator of dimensions 42x42x10 cubic mm and optically coupled to the compact large area position sensitive photomultiplier H8500 from Hamamatsu .	The mean resolution in all non-trivial moments was found to be smaller than 5 % but their direct use as estimates for the three-dimensional photoconversion position turned out to be unsuitable .
Several approaches are discussed how to understand the solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Poisson equation when the Dirichlet data are non-smooth such as if they are in $ L^2 $ only .	For the method of transposition ( sometimes called very weak formulation ) three spaces for the test functions are considered , and a regularity result is proved .
With a goal to produce giant magnetic moment in Mn $ _ { 13 } $ cluster which will be useful for practical applications , we have considered the structure and magnetic properties of pure Mn $ _ { 13 } $ cluster and substitutionally doped it with X = Ti , V , Cr , Fe , Co , Ni atom to produce Mn $ _ { 12 } $ X clusters .	We find that Ti and V substitutions in Mn $ _ { 13 } $ cluster are the most promising in terms of gaining substantial binding energy as well as achieving higher magnetic moment through ferromagnetic alignment of atom-centered magnetic moments .
Qualitative features of the mean-field theory of superconductivity in a strongly disordered systems of fermions with short-range attraction are discussed .	In this limit the effective theory is entirely bosonic , and I consider both the artificial infinite-range limit , and the more realistic case of `` nearest neighbor '' hopping of bosons between localized states .
The exact consideration of thermodynamics is extended including a random Lorentzian transverse field .	The presented results are used to study the Peierls instability in a quantum spin chain .
Such a task is BosonSampling : obtaining a distribution of n bosons scattered by some linear-optical unitary process .	Here we test the central premise of BosonSampling , experimentally verifying that the amplitudes of 3-photon scattering processes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a 6-mode integrated optical circuit .
The Twelf system exploits the correspondence between formulas and types to give specifications in LF a logic programming interpretation .	By interpreting particular arguments as input and others as output , specifications can be seen as describing non-deterministic functions .

} $ ( 2014 ) , which contains a ( non-unity ) prefactor on the advection term , previously unaccounted for in all studies .	Specifically , we present three separate 2D DNS : one that is doubly-periodic , one that is singly-periodic , and one that is non-periodic ( i.e.no-slip is imposed at the lateral boundaries ) .
This permits a general procedure to be given for the preparation of pseudo-pure states on any number of spins , subject to the limitations imposed by the loss of signal from the selected subensemble .	The preparation of a single pseudo-pure state is demonstrated by carbon and proton NMR on 13C-labeled alanine .
Such a source is a necessary stage towards building the neutrino factories and muon colliders which are being considered at present .	The CERN Neutrino Factory could deliver muon beams with intensities 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than available now , with large freedom in the choice of the time structure .
In particular , a three-dimensional Stokes flow interacts across a boundary interface with a two-dimensional mechanical plate equation .	In the case that the PDE plate component is rotational inertia-free , one will have that solutions of this fluid-structure PDE system exhibit an exponential rate of decay .
We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDs including the reprocessing of radiation by dust .	The model , which is the same as that in Baugh et al .
Recent studies have indicated that the emission of gravitational waves at the merger of two black holes gives a kick to the final black hole .	If the supermassive black hole at the center of a disk galaxy is kicked but the velocity is not large enough to escape from the host galaxy , it will fall back onto the the disk and accrete the interstellar medium in the disk .
Some pulsars have their maximum observable energy output in the gamma-ray band , offering the possibility of using these high-energy photons as probes of the particle acceleration and interaction processes in pulsar magnetospheres .	After an extended hiatus between satellite missions , the recently-launched AGILE mission and the upcoming Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) will allow gamma-ray tests of the theoretical models developed based on past discoveries .
The growth rate of spatial Fourier modes is described qualitatively by the results of a linear stability analysis [ D.P .	Barkey , R.H. Muller , and C.W .
Moreover , we remind that this classical Cosmology did not solve the enigma of the nature of dark matter , nor the enigma of its invisibility , nor the enigma of the constancy of the curve of velocities of stars in a galaxy .	Consequently it appears that a new Cosmology , alternative to the classical Cosmology , is necessary , at least in the field of dark matter .
To measure the transverse emittance of the H- beam , a method based on photo-detachment is proposed .	This system will operate using a pulsed laser with light delivered via an optical fibre and subsequently focused through a thin slice of the H- beam .
Here foundations are considered as a theory that provides means ( concepts , structures , methods etc . )	for the development of whole mathematics .
We find a residual correlation of ongoing star formation with environment , indicating that even galaxies with similar morphologies , stellar masses , and mean stellar ages have lower star formation rates in denser environments .	Thus , the current star formation gradient in clusters is not just another aspect of the morphology-density , stellar mass-density , or mean stellar age-density relations .
We confirm the presence of a curvature of the spectrum $ \sim \exp { \sqrt { k\rho_e } } $ over the broad frequency range $ \sim [ 10,100 ] $ Hz , indicating the presence of a dissipation .	Analysis of seven spectra under different plasma conditions show clearly the presence of a quasi-universal power-law spectrum at MHD and ion scales .
The subsequent hadronization process for heavy quarks is calculated with a fragmentation plus recombination model .	We find significant contribution from gluon radiation to heavy quark energy loss at high $ p_T $ ; the recombination mechanism can greatly enhance D meson production at medium $ p_T $ .
The case $ n=4 $ was considered in [ GT ] where the authors prove that $ X $ is a Killing vector field while the manifold $ V^4 $ is isometric to the quotient of $ M^2\times ( R^2 , g_F ) \times R $ by the flow along the corresponding Killing field .	Following an approach of [ GT ] we consider the next case $ n=5 $ and obtain the same result under the assumption that the set of zeros of $ X $ is not empty .
In this paper , we advocate the vision of Software-Defined Middleboxes ( SDM ) to realize abstraction and centralization for middleboxes .	We further propose OpenFunction , an SDM reference architecture and a network function abstraction layer .

Non-conformally flat non-compact solutions to the supergravity-type I equations of motion with non-zero flux and non-constant dilaton are found in dimensions 7 and 8 .
Gauge symmetry is preserved for all terms inside the Lagrangian , except for the viscous term .	The transition mechanism from point particle field to fluid field , and vice versa , is discussed .
In contrast , if the pair interaction is screened by background charges ( Yukawa OCP ) the thermodynamic state depends , in addition , on the range of the interaction via the screening parameter $ \kappa $ .	How to determine in this case an effective coupling parameter has been a matter of intensive debate .
We first show that such derivation $ \delta $ generates a ( 1,1 ) -tensor field ( we denote it by $ R $ ) .	Then , we show that the supercommutation of $ d $ and $ \delta $ ( which is a natural , essentially necessary condition to get a $ d\delta $ -lemma ) is equivalent to vanishing of the Nijenhujis torsion of $ R $ .
We study the thermodynamic properties of spin systems on small-world hypergraphs , obtained by superimposing sparse Poisson random graphs with p-spin interactions onto a one-dimensional Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions .	We use replica-symmetric transfer-matrix techniques to derive a set of fixed-point equations describing the relevant order parameters and free energy , and solve them employing population dynamics .
We prove that the Cotton tensor is the obstruction to local conformal flatness in dimension $ 3 $ .	Finally we discuss the link between Chern-Simons invariants , the eta invariant , and the central value of the Selberg zeta function .
Recently the BaBar experiment reported the first observation of the exclusive semileptonic decay B - & gt ; D tau nu , finding an approximately 2-sigma disagreement with the Standard-Model prediction for the ratio R ( D ) =BR ( B- & gt ; D tau nu ) /BR ( B- & gt ; D l nu ) , where l=e , mu .	We compute this ratio of branching fractions using hadronic form factors computed in unquenched lattice QCD and obtain R ( D ) = 0.316 ( 12 ) ( 7 ) , where the errors are statistical and total systematic , respectively .
We find that all three components have values which are comparable with the previously reported ones for the stochiometric compound KFe $ _2 $ As $ _2 $ .	Our data for C ( T , H ) and resistivity rho ( T , H ) can be interpreted in favor of the dominant orbital contribution to the pair-breaking mechanism at low fields , while Pauli limiting effect dominates at high fields , giving rise to a gapless superconducting state with only the leading non-zero gap .
However , if it is very close to the cosmological apparent horizon size , the accretion is suppressed due to general relativistic effects .	In any case , it soon gets smaller than the cosmological horizon and thereafter it can be approximated as an isolated vacuum solution with decaying mass accretion .
The significant number of red giant branch ( RGB ) stars present in the outer part of our images ( r & gt ; 16.5 ' ) indicates that the galaxy is actually more extended than previously estimated .	A comparison of the color-magnitude diagrams ( CMDs ) as a function of galactocentric distance shows a clear gradient in the age of its population , the scale length increasing with age , while we find no evidence of a metallicity gradient from the width of the RGB .
Optical spectroscopy of objects matched to X-ray point sources confirms a total of 27 AGN within the five structures , and we find that their host galaxies tend to be located away from dense cluster cores .	More than 36 % of host galaxies are located in the `green valley ' , which suggests they are a transitional population .
We analyze the family of underlying markets from the perspective of large financial markets .	More precisely , we show the existence of a strong asymptotic arbitrage ( SAA ) when the scaling factor converges to zero .
This does not permit one to fulfil the initial condition .	So , the function obtained from the Schr\ '' odinger equation can not be the evolution operator kernel .
The calculations shown here are a follow-up of the work of Favier et al .	( 2012 ) where the instability developed in a weakly magnetized atmosphere , consisting of a uniform field oriented in a different direction from the unstable layer below .
We introduce hermiticity as a new symmetry and show that when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical level , quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stay physically acceptable .	To show this , we calculated the effective potential of the ( $ g\phi^ { 4 } +h\phi^ { 6 } $ ) $ _ { 1+1 } $ model up to first order in $ g $ and $ h $ couplings which is sufficient as the region of interest has finite correlation length for which mean field calculation may suffice .
Based on theoretical stellar evolution models , the host star has a mass and radius of 1.47 +- 0.12 M_sun , and 1.500 +- 0.050 R_sun , respectively .	Spectroscopic observations made with Keck-I/HIRES during a partial transit event show the Doppler shadow of HAT-P-57b moving across the average spectral line profile of HAT-P- 57 , confirming the object as a planetary system .
The linear confinement of quarks in a class of these theories using gravity duals that capture the logarithmic runnings of the coupling constants in the IR and strongly coupled asymptotic conformal behavior in the UV was studied in our previous work .	We also extended the theories to high temperatures and argued the possibilities of meltings and suppressions of heavy quarkonium states .
The nonlinear $ \sigma $ - $ \omega $ - $ \rho $ hadronic mean-field approximation with or without vacuum fluctuation corrections and strange quark matter defined by MIT-bag model are employed to examine properties of hadron- ( strange ) quark hybrid stars .	We have found that hadron- ( strange ) quark hybrid stars become more stable in high density compared to pure hadronic and strange quark stars .
We show that the phenomena is governed in both cases by a power-law regime but the critical exponents depend on the type of bifurcation and may also depend on the numerical experiment set-up .	Differences and similarities between the two cases are also discussed .
We show that the Schmidt number is an almost equivalent measures to the von Neumann entanglement entropy when the delocalization of clusters occurs in the entire system but it shows different behaviors in a partially delocalized state containing localized clusters and delocalized ones .	It means that the R\'enyi-2 entanglement entropy , which relates to the Schmidt number , is found to be almost equivalent to the von Neumann entanglement entropy for the full delocalized cluster system but it is less sensitive to the partially delocalized cluster system than the von Neumann entanglement entropy .
We propose a fast method for the problem that combines two ideas : a novel algorithm of proved small time complexity for computing spliced alignments of a transcript against a genome , and an efficient algorithm that exploits the inherent redundancy of information in a cluster of transcripts to select , among all possible factorizations of EST sequences , those allowing to infer splice site junctions that are highly confirmed by the input data .	The EST alignment procedure is based on the construction of maximal embeddings that are sequences obtained from paths of a graph structure , called Embedding Graph , whose vertices are the maximal pairings of a genomic sequence T and an EST P. The procedure runs in time linear in the size of P , T and of the output .
To make 3D non-LTE radiative transfer computationally feasible it is crucial to have a model atom with as few levels as possible while retaining the main physical processes .	We here develop such a model atom and we study the general formation properties of the C II lines .
A qualitative introduction to friction is presented by proposing exploration of different kind of materials in order to suggest which aspects can be relevant and which interaction is involved .	Different quantitative experiments are proposed for studying Leonardo 's laws for friction .
To reproduce this feature , we propose an adaptive network model driven by social recommending .	Artificial agent-based simulations of this model highlight a `` good get richer '' mechanism where users with broad interests and good judgments are likely to become popular leaders for the others .
STAR 's measurements of directed flow ( $ v_1 $ ) for pions , kaons ( charged and $ K_s^0 $ ) , protons and antiprotons for Au + Au collisions at $ \sqrtsNN = 200 $ GeV are presented .	Negative $ v_1 ( y ) $ slope is observed for pions , antiprotons , protons and kaons .
We find that embedded bars in resonant coupling are unlikely to increase the inflow , but for certain gas parameters in a single bar , inflow to the center develops in a spiral shock , similar to the patterns observed in nuclear discs of real galaxies .	The spiral pattern persists for very weak non-axisymmetries of the potential .
In the work two ways of evolutionary interpretation of entropy model for correspondence matrix calculation are proposed .	Both approaches based on the stochastic chemical kinetic evolution under the detailed balance condition .
The ALFALFA maps reveal an extended HI envelope around the NGC 3166/9 group core , which we mosaic at higher resolution using six GMRT pointings spanning ~1 square degree .	A thorough search of the GMRT datacube reveals eight low-mass objects with gas masses ranging from 4x10^7 to 3x10^8 M_sol and total dynamical masses up to 1.4x10^9 M_sol .
Of phenomenological relevance is an analysis of the spectra of tau lepton decay on the energy interval [ 0 , M_tau ] and the low-energy hadron production in e+ e- annihilation .	General arguments are given for the calculability of such moments in perturbation theory using both a finite-order analysis and infinite resummation on the contour .
We study the dynamics of Nambu -- Goto strings with junctions at which three strings meet .	In particular , we exhibit one simple exact solution and examine the process of intercommuting of two straight strings , in which they exchange partners but become joined by a third string .
The use of a physical nuclear equation of state allows us to include the effects of neutrino emission .	For low neutron star to black hole mass ratios the neutron star transfers mass to the black hole during a few cycles of orbital decay and subsequent widening before finally being disrupted , whereas for ratios near unity the neutron star is already distroyed during its first approach .
This unique system shows a very extended trimodal horizontal branch ( HB ) , but no other clues for multiple populations have been detected in its colour-magnitude diagram ( CMD ) .	Based on high-resolution spectroscopic observations of 16 red giant stars , we derived the abundances of a large variety of alpha , p-capture , iron-peak , and n-capture elements .
Classical solutions describing charged dilaton black holes accelerating in a background magnetic field have recently been found .	They include the Ernst metric of the Einstein-Maxwell theory as a special case .
Very much like the ubiquitous quantum interference of a single particle with itself , quantum interference of two independent , but indistinguishable , particles is also possible .	This interference is a direct result of quantum exchange statistics , however , it is observed only in the joint probability to find the particles in two separated detectors .
The integrable close and open chain models can be formulated in terms of generators of the Hecke algebras .	In this review paper , we describe in detail the Bethe ansatz for the XXX and the XXZ integrable close chain models .
In this paper we examine the evolution via disk accretion .	We consider a limiting case of `` cold '' disk accretion , whereby most of the stellar photosphere can radiate freely with negligible backwarming from the accretion flow , and the accreting material settles onto the star with the same specific entropy as the photosphere .
Chiral effective field theory complements numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) on a space-time lattice .	It provides a model-independent formalism for connecting lattice simulation results at finite volume and a variety of quark masses to the physical world .
Main objective is the study of the antimatter component : antiprotons ( 80 MeV-190 GeV ) , positrons ( 50 MeV-270 GeV ) and search for antimatter with a precision of the order of $ 10^ { -8 } $ ) .	The experiment , housed on board the Russian Resurs-DK1 satellite , was launched on June , 15 2006 in a $ 350\times 600 km $ orbit with an inclination of 70 degrees .
We also establish clearly defined values for the smoothness parameter in the relation , finding its value to be at least 0.88 at all redshifts in our simulations .	From our results , obtained by linking the simulation boxes back to source redshifts of 4 , we are able to observe the formation of structure in terms of the computed shear , and also note that the major contributions to the shear come from a very broad range of redshifts .
Although there are many algorithmic and visual techniques to analyze graphs , none of the existing approaches is able to present the structural information of graphs at large-scale .	Hence , this paper describes StructMatrix , a methodology aimed at high-scalable visual inspection of graph structures with the goal of revealing macro patterns of interest .
Using existing measurements of primordial deuterium abundance we find very weak indications that such a signature might exist , but the paucity of measurements precludes any firm conclusion .	We also examine existing quasar absorption spectra data that are sensitive to variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio , mu , and x = ( alpha^2 mu g_p ) for spatial variation .
Motivated by advances in near-infrared ( NIR ) adaptive optics imaging and mm-wave interferometry , we explore the observational signatures of GI in disks , using hydrodynamical and Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to synthesize NIR scattered light images and mm dust continuum maps .	Spiral arms induced by GI , located at disk radii of hundreds of AUs , are local overdensities and have their photospheres displaced to higher altitudes above the disk midplane , arms therefore scatter more NIR light from their central stars than inter-arm regions , and are detectable at distances up to 1 kpc by Gemini/GPI , VLT/SPHERE , and Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO .
The multi-term Boltzmann equation framework accounting for coherent scattering enables the inclusion of the full anisotropy in the differential cross-section arising from the interaction and the structure factor , without an a priori assumption of quasi-isotropy in the velocity distribution function .	The model , which contains no free parameters and accounts for both coherent scattering and liquid phase screening effects , was found to reproduce well the experimental drift velocities and characteristic energies .
This result has applications in different contexts , such as in Composite Higgs scenarios and theories for the Early Universe .	We work out an example of inflation based on a non-compact coset which makes predictions which are consistent with the current observational data .
These photons and nucleons produced within our Supergalactic halo may easily propagate to earth and initiate super-GZK air showers .	Here we show that the probability for each neutrino flavor at its resonant energy to annihilate within the halo of our Supergalactic cluster is likely within an order of magnitude of 1 % , with the exact value depending on unknown aspects of neutrino mixing and relic neutrino clustering .
Firstly , we show that in the initial state of the algorithm only the amplitude of the basis state corresponding to the solution affects the running time of the algorithm , while other amplitudes do not .	Using this property , if we know a priori probability about the location of the solution before search , we can modify the adiabatic evolution to make the algorithm faster .
It is known that under the property of quasimonotonicity time-delayed systems become monotone , and some remarkable properties have been reported for such systems .	These include , for example , the fact that for linear systems global asymptotic stability of the undelayed system implies global asymptotic stability for the delayed system under arbitrary bounded delays .
For illustration of these notions and the properties we use the explicitly constructed \textit { Lax semigroups } .	We demonstrate that for a general smooth bounded convex domain $ \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^d $ the corresponding { Dirichlet-to-Neumann } semigroup $ \left\ { U ( t ) : = e^ { -t \Lambda_ { \gamma , \partial\Omega } } \right\ } _ { t\geq0 } $ in the Hilbert space $ L^2 ( \partial \Omega ) $ belongs to the \textit { trace-norm } von Neumann-Schatten ideal for any $ t & gt ; 0 $ .
We consider the inverse problem of estimating the shape profile of an unknown deposit from a set of eddy current impedance measurements .	The measurements are acquired with an axial probe , which is modeled by a set of coils that generate a magnetic field inside the tube .
A pure quantum VQ encoding algorithm with probability of success near 100 % has been proposed , that performs operations 45sqrt ( N ) times approximately .	In this paper , a hybrid quantum VQ encoding algorithm between classical method and quantum algorithm is presented .
The charge ordered state is stabilized so as to relax the geometrical frustration in the spin degrees of freedom .	We also discuss the distortion of the lattice structure caused by the charge ordering .
The visual extinction increases by Delta A_V ~ 10 mag over a distance of 15 arcsec from the cluster core .	Extinction maps reveal a low-extinction cavity in the densest parts of Arches ( R & lt ; 5 arcsec ) , indicating the depletion of dust due to stellar winds or photo-evaporation .
We have studied the composition-induced metal-to-insulator transitions of cation substituted Lithium Titanate , in the forms Li1+xTi2-xO4 and LiAlyTi2-yO4 , utilising a quantum site percolation model , and we argue that such a model provides a very reliable representation of the noninteracting electrons in this material if strong correlations are ignored .	We then determine whether or not such a model of 3d electrons moving on the Ti ( corner-sharing tetrahedral ) sublattice describes the observed metal-to-insulator transitions , with the critical concentration defined by the matching of the mobility edge and the chemical potential .
The latter is employed to quantize the field in the framework of Dimock .	Finally , the resulting algebra of observables is shown to satisfy the wave equation with the usual canonical commutation relations .
As the angular rotation frequency $ \Omega $ is increased , the oscillation frequency $ \omega $ of the $ r $ -modes in the thin envelopes deviates appreciably from the asymptotic frequency $ \omega=2m\Omega/l^\prime ( l^\prime+1 ) $ defined in the limit of $ \Omega\to 0 $ , where $ \omega $ is the frequency observed in the corotating frame of the star , and $ m $ and $ l^\prime $ are the indices of the spherical harmonic function $ Y_ { l^\prime } ^m $ representing the angular dependence of the modes .	We find that the fundamental $ r $ -modes in the convective models are destabilized by strong nuclear burning in the convective region .
The dominant absorption feature in OH+ arises from a main component seen in CH+ ( that with the highest CH+/CH column density ratio ) , while OH follows CN absorption .	This distinction provides new constraints on OH chemistry in these clouds .
Mainly , on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) fifth year , the data indicates that more than 90 % of the total energy density of the universe is dark .	Here we discuss the impact of these phenomena imprint on gravitational and quantum field theory 's standard history .
We show that any bipartite quantum state of rank four is distillable , when the partial transpose of the state has at least one negative eigenvalue , i.e. , the state is NPT .	For this purpose we prove that if the partial transpose of a two-qutrit NPT state has two non-positive eigenvalues , then the state is distillable .
Motivated to measure the QED vacuum birefringence and to detect pseudoscalar-photon interaction , we started to build up the Q & amp ; A experiment ( QED [ Quantum Electrodynamics ] and Axion experiment ) in 1994 .	In this talk , we first give a brief historical account of planet hunting and dark matter evidence .
Here , we consider the growth of a network by preferential attachment from which nodes are simultaneously removed due to an SIR epidemic .	We show that increased infectiousness increases the prevalence of the disease and simultaneously causes a transition from scale-free to exponential topology .
This is achieved by integrating out auxiliary field components of the double metric in an iterative procedure that induces an infinite number of higher-derivative corrections .	As an application we prove that , to first order in $ \alpha ' $ and to all orders in fields , the deformed gauge transformations are Green-Schwarz-deformed diffeomorphisms .
The estimations of the sound velocity in the gas and the approximate pattern of cooling caused by the longitudinal expansion are also presented .

However , with the upcoming encounter of New Horizons at the Pluto-Charon system , sensitivity to detection of a possible Charon atmosphere will increase by orders of magnitude .	In particular , it has long been planned for New Horizons to use its Alice ultraviolet spectrograph during solar occultation observations of Charon on July 14 , 2015 , for this purpose .
It remains a direct gap semiconductor under strain and the bandgap size can be tuned in a wide range as large as 1 eV .	Interestingly , for biaxial strain , a band crossing effect occurs at the valence band maximum close to a 8\ % strain , leading to a dramatic increase of the hole effective mass .

In a large part of the still allowed parameter space the $ K $ factor of the supersymmetric theory is close to the one of the Standard Model .	However , for the case where one of the top squarks is light , a deviation of more than 5 % in the next-to-next-to-leading order prediction of the cross section can be observed where at the same time the predicted Higgs boson mass has a value of about 125 GeV .
A diagnostic package is derived from the concept of specific available enthalpy , leading to the definition of a local and complete energy cycle .	It is useful to understand the transformations of energy occurring at any particular pressure level or pressure layer of a limited area domain .
The angular power spectrum of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich ( SZ ) effect is calculated in the $ \Lambda $ CDM cosmological model with the aim of investigating its detailed dependence on the cluster population , gas morphology , and gas evolution .	We calculate the power spectrum for three different mass functions , compute it within the framework of isothermal and polytropic gas distributions , and explore the effect of gas evolution on the magnitude and shape of the power spectrum .
degrees ( 2.1 x 10^5 comoving Mpc at z=2.23 ) in these fields .	The BzK colours of the emitters suggest that at least 80 % of our sample are likely to be H-alpha emitters ( HAEs ) at z=2.23 .
Motivated by dark-photon $ \bar { \gamma } $ scenarios extensively considered in the literature , we explore experimentally allowed models where the Higgs boson coupling to photon and dark photon $ H\gamma\bar { \gamma } $ can be enhanced .	Correspondingly , large rates for the $ H\to \gamma\bar \gamma $ decay become plausible , giving rise to one monochromatic photon with $ E^ { \gamma } \simeq m_H/2 $ ( i.e. , more than twice the photon energy in the rare standard-model decay $ H\to \gamma Z\to\gamma\bar\nu\nu $ ) , and a similar amount of missing energy .
In this paper we study the problem of the existence of a least-action principle for invertible , second-order dynamical systems , discrete in time and space .	We show that , when the configuration space is finite , a least-action principle does not exist for such systems .
The constantly increasing demand for interactive broadband satellite communications is driving current research to explore novel system architectures that reuse frequency in a more aggressive manner .	To this end , the topic of dual satellite systems , in which satellites share spatial ( i.e.same coverage area ) and spectral ( i.e.full frequency reuse ) degrees of freedom is introduced .
With analytical methods , we obtain the exact expression for the critical chemical potential as $ \mu_ { c } = 1 + \sqrt { 1+m^2 } $ , which has also been generalized to higher dimensions as $ \mu_c \thickapprox a + \sqrt { m^2-m_ { BF } ^2 } $ in this work .	Around the phase transition points , we find a correspondence between the value of the scalar field at the tip and the scalar operator at infinity .
Relaxation is essential to attain the steady state and also to the spin accumulation , but has been considered to be harmful for the intrinsic SHE ( ISHE ) .	These issues are examined quantitatively on two types of 2D models , i.e. , ( a ) Rashba model for $ n $ -type GaAs , and ( b ) Luttinger model for $ p $ -type GaAs .
It is related via dimensional reduction to another remarkable 4d action describing the N=2 supersymmetric extension of the Born-Infeld-Nambu-Goto action with two real scalars .	Both actions are the Goldstone actions associated with partial ( 1/2 ) spontaneous breaking of extended supersymmetry having 16 supercharges down to 8 supercharges .

By means of two alternative superanalytic approaches , the coset method and the graded eigenvalue method , we derive the two-level correlation function $ X_2 ( r ) $ and the number variance $ \Sigma^2 ( r ) $ .	The graded eigenvalue approach leads to an expression for $ X_2 ( r ) $ which is valid for all values of the parameter $ \lambda $ governing the strength of the GUE admixture on the unfolded scale .
It is proposed that a critical test of which theory is correct is the dependence of $ T_c $ on hole doping : the hole mechanism predicts that $ T_c $ will drop rapidly to zero as holes are added , while the electron-phonon mechanism appears to predict increasing $ T_c $ for a substantial range of hole doping .	Furthermore , the hole mechanism and electron-phonon mechanism differ qualitatively in their predictions of the effect on $ T_c $ of change in the $ B-B $ distances .
Topological insulators ( TIs ) are a recently discovered class of materials having insulating bulk electronic states but conducting boundary states distinguished by nontrivial topology .	So far , several generations of TIs have been theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed , all based on inorganic materials .
However , most stochastic processes hide their memory in higher-order temporal correlations .	Information measures -- -specifically , divergences in the mutual information between a process ' past and future ( excess entropy ) and minimal predictive memory stored in a process ' causal states ( statistical complexity ) -- -provide a different way to identify long memory in processes with higher-order temporal correlations .
We find that the electron-scattering optical depth and 21-cm differential brightness temperature are strongly anti-correlated , allowing optical depth estimates based entirely on redshifted 21-cm measurements .	This should help isolate the CMB polarization fluctuations that are due to reionization , allowing both cleaning of the patchy reionization polarization signal as a contaminating source of confusion to other signals and a measurement of the primordial quadrupole that would be measured at various locations in the universe at the epoch of reionization .
At a radius of 50 kpc , we find that at least 55 per cent of the clusters in our sample exhibit signs of mild cooling [ t ( cool ) & lt ; 10 Gyr ] , while in the central bin at least 34 per cent demonstrate signs of strong cooling [ t ( cool ) & lt ; 2 Gyr ] .	These percentages are nearly identical to those found for luminous , low-redshift clusters of galaxies , suggesting little evolution in cluster cores since z~0.4 and that heating and cooling mechanisms may already have stabilised by this epoch .

A relational database is said to be uncertain if primary key constraints can possibly be violated .	A repair ( or possible world ) of an uncertain database is obtained by selecting a maximal number of tuples without ever selecting two distinct tuples with the same primary key value .
The very high quality of the photometry and the good phase coverage enable us to obtain accurate Fourier decomposition of the ligh curves .	As a consequence we confirm that the so-called s-Cepheids are overtone pulsators and represent about 30 $ \ % $ of our sample , whereas the Classical Cepheids are fundamental pulsators .
The freedom from orbitals and from the Hartree integral makes the proposed approximation numerically highly efficient .	The total energies obtained for confined two-dimensional systems are in a good agreement with the standard local-density approximation within density-functional theory , and considerably more accurate than the Thomas-Fermi approximation .
In contrast , Jupiter-like and less massive Saturn-like giant planets are able to survive through the base of the convection zone of a 1.22 solar-mass star .	Although strongly dependent on details of planetary interior models , partial or total dissolution of giant planets can result in significant enhancements in the metallicity of host stars with masses between about 1.0 and 1.3 solar masses .

In Fe pnictide ( Pn ) superconducting materials , neither Mn- nor Cr- doping to the Fe site induces superconductivity , even though hole carriers are generated .	This is in strong contrast with the superconductivity appearing when holes are introduced by alkali metal substitution on the insulating blocking layers .
It has been designed according to semantic web and W3C recommendations employing SKOS standard models and Linked Data to publish the thesauri as a whole in machine-understandable format .	The outcome is a powerful framework satisfying the requirements of modularity and openness for further thesaurus extension and updating , interlinking among thesauri , and exploitability from other systems .

Large quantities of information usually require large material bases .	Conventional wisdom has it that human long-term memory locates within brain tissue , and so might be expected to scale with brain size which , in turn , depends on cranial capacity .
We apply a model in which the two-level system , characterized by a direction in space , is coupled to the strain field of the phonon via a tensor of coupling constants .	The structure of the tensor of coupling constants is similar to the structure of the tensor of elastic stiffness constants , in the sense that they are determined by the same symmetry transformations .
Such polar QP-40 burst activities were found to correlate well with arrivals of high-speed solar winds at Jupiter .	We advance the physical scenario that the inner radiation belt ( IRB ) within ~2-3 Jupiter 's radius , where ralativistic electrons are known to be trapped via synchrotron emissions , can execute global QP-40 magnetoinertial oscillations excited by arrivals of high-speed solar winds .
As a novel branch of visual saliency , co-saliency detection refers to discovery of the common and salient foregrounds existed in two or more relevant images , and can be more widely used in many computer vision tasks .	The existing co-saliency detection algorithms mainly consist of three components : extracting effective features to represent the image regions , exploring the informative cues or factors to characterize co-saliency , and designing effective computational framework to formulate co-saliency .
Although scale-invariant non-Gaussianity ( often described by the $ f_ { NL } $ formalism ) is currently best constrained by the CMB , single-field models with changing sound speed can have strongly scale-dependent non-Gaussianity .	Such models could evade the CMB constraints but still have important effects at scales responsible for the formation of cosmological objects such as clusters and galaxies .
In the model , both ions interact with several resonant modes .	When one of these modes dominates , the acceleration rate is reduced considerably .
We find that supersymmetry on the Coulomb branch is dynamically broken as a consequence of the strong dynamics of SU ( 2 ) gauge symmetry while the supersymmetric vacuum on the Higgs branch remains .	We also estimate the lifetimes of the local minima on the Coulomb branch .
Utilizing the kinetic energy spectrum of the molecules in solution , the demon can send `` hotter '' molecules to a higher gravitational potential at the expense of their own energies .

When the population is composed of two different group of \ $ -traders , they show an anti-imitative behavior .	However , when they interact with minority or majority players the \ $ -population imitates the usual behavior of these players .
Here we show that it is possible to describe all of these effects in a unified way , mapping each system onto a simple resonator model .	Such description provides a thorough understanding of the phenomena , explains all the main features of their complex behaviour , and enables to control the system via the resonator parameters : eigenfrequencies , Q-factors , and coupling coefficients .
We obtain global material parameters , directly measurable with spectroscopic ellipsometry and distinguishable from mere wave parameters , by using the generalized dispersion equation for uniaxial crystals along with existing homogenization methods .	Our method is analytically and experimentally verified for Ag/SiO2 planar metamaterials with varying number of layers and compared to the effective medium theory .
This fact leads to introduce the notion of universal $ \alpha $ -central extension .	Classical results as the existence of a universal central extension of a perfect Hom-Lie algebra remains true , but others as the central extensions of the middle term of a universal central extension is split only holds for $ \alpha $ -central extensions .
In supersymmetric theories the charged sleptons of different generations may oscillate amongst themselves while they decay .	In the case of three generation oscillations , superpartner production at the LHC and NLC may lead to an observable $ CP $ -violating signal $ N ( e^+\mu^- ) - N ( \mu^+e^- ) $ .
Here we present a SED catalog of 413 X-ray ( \xmm ) selected type 1 ( emission line FWHM $ & gt ; 2000 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) AGN with Magellan , SDSS or VLT spectrum .

A nanometer-thin-cell ( in the direction of laser beam propagation ) has been elaborated with the thickness of the atomic vapor column varying smoothly in the range of $ L = \unit [ 50-1500 ] { nm } $ .	The cell allows one to study the behavior of the resonance absorption over the $ D_1 $ line of potassium atoms by varying the laser intensity and the cell thickness from $ L = \lambda / 2 $ to $ L = 2 \lambda $ with the step $ \lambda/2 $ ( $ \lambda =\unit [ 770 ] { nm } $ is the resonant wavelength of the laser ) .
We also propose the idea of Layered Fault Tolerant Specification ( LFTS ) to make the method extensible to dependable systems .	The principle is layering the specification , for the sake of clarity , in ( at least ) two different levels , the first one for the normal behavior and the others ( if more than one ) for the abnormal .
Within the framework of the Kondo-Heisenberg model , we analyse the effect of charge fluctuation on the modulated spin liquid ( MSL ) and antiferromagnetic ( AF ) orders which were established in a previous publication .	We discuss the emergence of two quantum critical lines separating the coexisting Kondo-MSL and Kondo-MSL-AF phases .
Since this model changes the evolution of the universe , we should not a priori expect the Cardassian age to be the same as the WMAP Friedmann derived result of 13.7 +/- 0.2 Gyrs .	However , in the subset of Cardassian models we consider , we discover that the age of the universe varies from 13.4 - 13.8 Gyr over the range of parameter space we explore , a result close to that of the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter model .
The model can provide the marginally better fit to available Higgs signals data than SM , which requires the Higgs couplings with gauge bosons , $ u\bar { u } $ and $ d\bar { d } $ to be properly suppressed , and favors ( 1 & lt ; \theta_d & lt ; 2 , 0.5 & lt ; \theta_l & lt ; 2.2 ) for $ m_h= $ 125.5 GeV and ( 0.5 & lt ; \theta_d & lt ; 2 , 0.5 & lt ; \theta_l & lt ; 2.2 ) for $ m_H= $ 125.5 GeV .	However , these Higgs couplings are allowed to have sizable deviations from SM for ( $ m_h= $ 125.5 GeV , 125.5 $ \leq m_H\leq $ 128 GeV ) and ( 125 GeV $ \leq m_h\leq $ 125.5 GeV , $ m_H= $ 125.5 GeV ) .
We report a measurement of $ CP $ violating asymmetries in $ B^0 ( \overline { B } ^0 ) \to K^+ K^- K^0_S $ decays with a time-dependent Dalitz approach .	This analysis is based on a data sample of $ 657\times 10^6 $ $ B\overline { B } $ pairs accumulated at the $ \Upsilon ( 4S ) $ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $ e^+e^- $ collider .
Most content on social networks is difficult to model because the modes and motivation of human expression are diverse and incompletely understood .	We introduce content transfer , an information-theoretic measure with a predictive interpretation that directly quantifies the strength of the effect of one user 's content on another 's in a model-free way .
Wind energy is becoming a top contributor to the renewable energy mix , which raises potential reliability issues for the grid due to the fluctuating nature of its source .	To achieve adequate reserve commitment and to promote market participation , it is necessary to provide models that can capture daily patterns in wind power production .

For instance , we prove that an inverse monoid $ S $ is of type $ FP_ { \infty } $ , if and only if it contains a minimal idempotent and its maximum group image is of the same type .	Regarding cohomological dimensions , we show that the cohomological dimension of a free Clifford monoid and that of its maximum group image agree and are equal to one .
We find that the anisotropic cosmic birefringence signal from any parity-violating processes is consistent with zero .	The Faraday rotation from anisotropic cosmic birefringence can be compared with the equivalent quantity generated by primordial magnetic fields if they existed .

We investigate a simple arrangement of coupled harmonic oscillators which brings out some interesting effects concerning creation of entanglement .	It is well known that if each member in a linear chain of coupled harmonic oscillators is prepared in a `` classical state '' , such as a pure coherent state or a mixed thermal state , no entanglement is created in the rotating wave approximation .
The theoretical curve obtained for Q^2 dependence of pion form factor is in a good agreement with existing experimental data .	To calculate NLO corrections for double spectral densities we developed an effective computational technic .
We explore an alternative prior for nonparametric Bayesian clustering -- the uniform process -- for applications where the `` rich-get-richer '' property is undesirable .	We also explore the cost of this process : partitions are no longer exchangeable with respect to the ordering of variables .
Escort mean values ( or $ q $ -moments ) constitute useful theoretical tools for describing basic features of some probability densities such as those which asymptotically decay like { \it power laws } .	They naturally appear in the study of many complex dynamical systems , particularly those obeying nonextensive statistical mechanics , a current generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs theory .
We consider the linear stability problem for the static kink in 2D Klein-Gordon field taking into account spatially localized $ \mathcal { PT } $ -symmetric perturbation .

The demand for petroleum dependent chemicals and materials has been increasing despite the dwindling of their fossil resources .	As the dead-end of petroleum based industry has started to appear , today 's modern society has to implement alternative energy and valuable chemical resources immediately .
For the first time , we combine host galaxy observations with geometric measurements of quasar illumination using blue-band HST observations and [ OIII ] integral field unit observations probing the quasar winds .	The HST images reveal bright merger signatures in about half the galaxies ; a significantly higher fraction than in comparison inactive ellipticals .
Using these results the approach then provides a safe , convenient and unbiased way of comparing experiment to theoretical models which avoids any built-in model dependent assumptions .	We apply the method to three classes of perturbative $ Z ' $ boson benchmark models : $ E_6 $ models , left-right symmetric models and sequential standard models .

Spectra from the Keck HIRES instrument of the Lyman alpha forests in the lines of sight to the A and C components of the gravitationally lensed QSO Q1422+231 were used to investigate the structure of the intergalactic medium at mean redshift z = 3.3 on sub-kpc scales .	We measured the cross-correlation amplitude between the two Lyman alpha forests for a mean transverse separation of 120 pc , and computed the RMS column density and velocity differences between individual absorption systems seen in both lines of sight .
We report our search for variability in the H-alpha emission line of the recurrent novae T CrB with time resolution 10-15 minutes .	This is comparable with the time scale of the photometric flickering observed in this object .
In this case , the amplitude of the SSCS increases as the number of the subtracted photons gets larger .	For example , two-photon subtraction from a squeezed vacuum state of 6.1dB can generate a SSCS of $ \alpha=1.26 $ , while in the case of the four-photon subtraction a SSCS of a larger amplitude $ \alpha=1.65 $ is obtained under the same condition .
We are developing a consistent method to combine tree-level event generators for hadron collision interactions with those including one additional QCD radiation from the initial-state partons , based on the limited leading-log ( LLL ) subtraction method , aiming at an application to NLO event generators .	In this method , a boundary between non-radiative and radiative processes necessarily appears at the factorization scale ( mu_F ) .
This establishes a direct connection between the well-known Torrey 's slow diffusion result and the fast diffusion result .	We also perform free induction decay measurements on spin-exchange optically polarized $ ^3 $ He gas with different diffusion constants .

The linear mixed model for the analysis of longitudinal data is particularly well-suited for the estimation of , inference about , and interpretation of both population and subject-specific trajectories for ABPM data .	Subject-specific trajectories are of great importance in ABPM studies , especially in clinical research , but little emphasis has been placed on this dimension of the problem in the statistical analyses of the data .
Problems dealing with the ability to take an action that affects the states of state-dependent communication channels are of timely interest and importance .	Therefore , we extend the study of action-dependent channels , which until now focused on point-to-point models , to multiple-access channels ( MAC ) .

Firstly , we show that , for arbitrary $ 0 & lt ; R & lt ; 1 $ and $ \epsilon & gt ; 0 $ ( $ \epsilon $ and $ R $ are independent ) , if $ 0 & lt ; \frac { n } { m } \leq \epsilon $ , then with high probability a random rank metric code in $ F_ { q } ^ { m\times n } $ of rate $ R $ can be list-decoded up to a fraction $ ( 1-R-\epsilon ) $ of rank errors with constant list size $ L $ satisfying $ L\leq O ( 1/\epsilon ) $ .
The coarsening of catalytically-active metal clusters is often accelerated by the presence of gases through the formation of mobile intermediates , though the exact mechanism through which this happens is often subject to debate .	We use scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM ) to follow the CO induced coalescence of Pd adatoms supported on the Fe3O4 ( 001 ) surface at room temperature .
Strikingly , their explosion sites also mark them out as distinct from other SN types .	Their galactocentric offset distribution is strongly skewed to very large offsets ( around one third are offset greater than 20 kpc ) , meaning they do not trace the stellar light of their hosts .

We show that for not few cardinals lambda & lt ; mu there is a superlimit model in K_lambda .	Moreover , our main result is that we can find a good lambda-frame s categorical in lambda such that K_s subseteq K_lambda .
Specifically , Mallat considered so-called scattering networks based on semi-discrete shift-invariant wavelet frames and modulus non-linearities in each network layer , and proved translation invariance ( asymptotically in the wavelet scale parameter ) and deformation stability of the corresponding feature extractor .	The purpose of this paper is to develop Mallat 's theory further by allowing for general convolution kernels , or in more technical parlance , general semi-discrete shift-invariant frames ( including Weyl-Heisenberg , curvelet , shearlet , ridgelet , and wavelet frames ) and general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities ( e.g. , rectified linear units , shifted logistic sigmoids , hyperbolic tangents , and modulus functions ) , as well as pooling through sub-sampling , all of which can be different in different network layers .
These fields result in a determinant free of all cutoffs .	Consider the one-loop effective action , the logarithm of the determinant , and subtract off the renormalization dependent second-order term .
Here we carry out a set of numerical simulations of a stratified , turbulently stirred , radiatively cooled medium , which uncover a fundamental transition at a critical one-dimensional turbulent velocity of ~ 35 km/s .	At turbulent velocities below ~35 km/s , corresponding to temperatures below 300,000 K , the medium is stable , as the time for gas to cool is roughly constant as a function of temperature .
The model fit of the two independent observations provides an upper limit on the distance of the system for different effective temperatures of the primary .	In addition , an upper limit on the combined flux of the disk and the donor in the infrared region wherein the contribution of the primary is negligible is also determined .
Mutated XSS attack generation depends on the analysis of attack vectors and the structural learning mechanism .	For the kernel of the learning mechanism , we use a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) as the structure of the attack vector model to capture the implicit manner of the attack vector , and this manner is benefited from the syntax meanings that are labeled by the proposed tokenizing mechanism .
Observations of high redshift type Ia supernovae ( SNe ) will enable us to probe the structure of galaxy halos and the composition of dark matter .	The future prospects for this field are briefly discussed here .
The same ratios obtained from optically thin plasma atomic databases such as MEKAL , Chianti , and APEC are found to be discrepant , however , we find no convincing proof for resonance line scattering .	Optical depths are basically identical for all kinds of stellar coronae and we conclude that identical optical depths are more probable when effects from resonant scattering are generally negligible .
An award value depends on the number of times the game is played .	The random sample mean is discussed as a universal award .
Such research requires advances in optical techniques for the delivery of light through brain tissue with high spatial resolution .	The tissue causes distortions of the wavefront of the incoming light which broadens the focus , thereby reducing the intensity and resolution especially in techniques requiring focal illumination .
The amplitudes for boson-boson and fermion-boson interactions are calculated in the second order of perturbation theory in the Lobachevsky space .	An essential ingredient of the used model is the Weinberg 's $ 2 ( 2j+1 ) $ component formalism for describing a particle of spin $ j $ , recently developed substantially .
With the aid of published kinematic data definite galaxy members are identified and the width in J-K of the colour-magnitude diagram is shown to be consistent with an old population of stars with a large range in metal abundance .	We identify two Asymptotic Giant Branch variables , both carbon Miras , with periods of 189 and 554 days , respectively , and discuss their ages , metallicities and mass loss as well as their positions in the Mira period-luminosity diagram .
There is no significant systematic difference in the lithium abundances of high- and low-alpha halo stars .	For the large majority of stars with masses 0.7 & lt ; M/M_sun & lt ; 0.9 and heavy-element mass fractions 0.001 & lt ; Z & lt ; 0.006 , the Li abundance is well fitted by a relation A ( Li ) = a0 + a1 M + a2 Z + a3 M Z , where a0 , a1 , a2 , and a3 are constants .
This framework can be used to construct an N = 1 MSSM on the IR brane , reminiscent of the original Randall-Sundrum model .	In addition , we use our framework to study strongly-coupled scenarios of supersymmetry breaking mediated by gauge forces .
\ ] We consider a class of infinite randomly weighted trees related to the Poisson-weighted infinite tree , and determine precisely which trees in this class have linear growth almost surely .	We then apply this characterization to obtain new results concerning the event of explosion in infinite randomly weighted spherically-symmetric trees , answering a question of Pemantle and Peres .
KPD 1930+2752 is a short-period pulsating subdwarf B ( sdB ) star .	It is also an ellipsoidal variable with a known binary period just over two hours .
The laser path was oriented in longitudinal as well as transverse geometries with respect to the atoms flow .	The enhancement of beam purity and the feasibility for in-source laser spectroscopy were investigated in off-line and on-line conditions .
Planets on eccentric orbits have a higher geometric probability of transiting their host star .	By application of Bayes ' theorem , we reverse this logic to show that the eccentricity distribution of transiting planets is positively biased .
In particular , this allows equations and rewrite rules to be specified between graphs .	Particular computational models can then be encoded as an axiomatic set of such rules .
On the one hand , there exists no limit to the mass for a given maximal mass-density inside the body .	On the other hand , each model permits a quasistationary transition to the extreme Kerr black hole .
In the strong field limit we demonstrate the existence of ( almost ) non-spreading states which remain localized on the lattice region populated initially and show coherent Bloch oscillations with fractional revivals in the momentum space ( so called quantum carpets ) .	With decreasing field , the dynamics becomes irregular , however , still confined in configuration space .
The effect of kick velocity to newly born pulsars on the distribution of $ \gamma $ -ray bursters is examined in the context of a disk origin model and a halo model of $ \gamma $ -ray bursters .	The conversion formula from a 2-dimensional velocity distribution function to a 3-dimensional distribution function is derived and applied to reproduce the distribution function of the kick velocity of radio pulsars .
Recent study of the analogous He-4 system has shown that the effect of heterogeneity is to yield a density of states N ( E ) that is qualitatively different from the one-dimensional ( 1D ) form of N ( E ) that would occur for an ideal set of identical channels .	In particular , the functional form of N ( E ) is that of a 4D gas near the very lowest energies and a 2D gas at somewhat higher energies .
More specifically , we consider Radon numbers for $ P_3 $ -convexity in trees .	Tverberg 's theorem states that every set of $ ( k-1 ) ( d+1 ) -1 $ points in $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ can be partitioned into $ k $ sets with intersecting convex hulls .
We perform the Painlev\'e test and analyse the possibility of deriving the B\ '' acklund transformation from the singularity analysis of the complex Sine-Gordon equation .	We make use of the analysis using the known relations for the Painlev\ ' { e } equations to construct explicit formulae in terms of the Umemura polynomials which are $ \tau $ -functions for rational solutions of the third Painlev\ ' { e } equation .
Of particular interest is the test of hydrodynamic models which predict a universal , apparent decrease of the extent of the system with increasing transverse mass mT as a consequence of the strong radial flow in heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies .	This contribution presents a study of correlations for protons and { \Lambda } particles in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt ( sNN ) = 2.76 TeV measured with ALICE .
In addition to the previously known example of Sher25 , there are two newly-discovered Galactic analogs of SN1987A 's ringed nebula .	Of these three Galactic analogs around blue supergiants , two ( Sher25 and SBW1 ) have chemical abundances indicating that they have not been through a red supergiant phase , and the remaining ringed bipolar nebula surrounds a luminous blue variable ( HD168625 ) .
Such band matrices appear as monodromy operators in the study of certain quantum dynamical systems .	These doubly infinite matrices essentially depend on an infinite sequence of phases which govern their spectral properties .
3 ) We present the general structure of superamplitudes on the Coulomb branch .	For example , the n-point `` MHV-band '' superamplitude is proportional to a Grassmann polynomial of mixed degree 4 to 12 , which is uniquely determined by supersymmetry .
Depending on the 2DEG conductance tuned by the gate voltage , the QPT is single ( corresponding to the long range phase coherence in the whole array ) or double ( one related to local phase coherence , the other one to the array ) .	By retrieving the coherence length critical exponent \nu , we show that the QPT can be `` clean '' or `` dirty '' according to the Harris criteria , depending on whether the phase coherence length is smaller or larger than the island size .
We present an analysis of the highly variable accreting X-ray pulsar 3A 1954+319 using 2005-2009 monitoring data obtained with INTEGRAL and Swift .	This considerably extends the pulse period history and covers flaring episodes in 2005 and 2008 .
$ G_ { 23 } $ does not mix vectors and spinors , but mismatch of the spinor and vector fields occurs .	Hence , electro magnetic ( EM ) wave emitted from galaxies transformed by the five transformations would not be detected by EM detectors in our galaxy , and the source would be regarded as dark matter .
The model corresponds to a very fast acceleration of the wind particles , and the line luminosity of about 2900 ( d/1.6 kpc ) ^2 solar luminosities to the mass-loss rate of around ( 1-2 ) x 10E-4 solar masses per year .	During days 10-30 the broad component shrank to FWZI = 1800 km/s .
Social network based trust relationships present a critical foundation for designing trustworthy systems , such as Sybil defenses , secure routing , and anonymous/censorshipresilient communications .	A key issue in the design of such systems , is the revelation of users ' trusted social contacts to an adversary-information that is considered sensitive in today 's society .
Here we present a survey of 25 such evolved massive stars ( 16 B [ e ] SGs , 6 LBVs , 2 YHGs , and 1 Peculiar Oe star ) , observed in the K-band with the Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observation in the Near-Infrared ( SINFONI ; R = 4500 ) on the ESO VLT UT4 8 m telescope .	The sample can be split into two categories based on spectral morphology : one group includes all of the B [ e ] SGs , the Peculiar Oe star , and two of the LBVs , while the other includes the YHGs and the rest of the LBVs .
We used an integral field unit to observe EELRs around two samples of of radio loud AGNs with similar radio properties but different orientations : a sample of quasars and a sample of radio galaxies .	A morphological comparison suggests a scenario where the three-dimensional EELR gas distribution follows rough biconical shapes with wide opening angles .
Universal algebra and clone theory have proven to be a useful tool in the study of constraint satisfaction problems since the complexity , up to logspace reductions , is determined by the set of polymorphisms of the constraint language .	For classifications where primitive positive definitions are unsuitable , such as size-preserving reductions , weaker closure operations may be necessary .
Also , we investigate the vertical structure of inhomogeneous solar photosphere and consider penetration of granules from convective region into upper layers of stable atmosphere .	The microturbulent velocity appears to be minimal at the bottom of overshooting convection region and increases sharply through superadiabatic layer and upper photosphere .
Although the approach yielded optimal speed-up in the PRAM model , we require additional techniques to optimize cache-misses in an oblivious setting .	Under a mild assumption on input and number of processors our algorithm will have optimal time and cache misses with high probability .
We review the results of the 1988 multi-wavelength campaign on the late-type eclipsing binary YY Geminorum .	Observations include : broad-band optical and near infra-red photometry , simultaneous optical and ultraviolet ( IUE ) spectroscopy , X-ray ( Ginga ) and radio ( VLA ) data .
The calculated energies are then substituted by experimental energies , where available , to improve the accuracy of the line lists .	The { \it ab initio } DMC is used without refinement to generate Einstein A coefficients .
We consider a paramagnetic solution without spin-orbit interaction as a function of volume for the face-centered cubic ( fcc ) unit cell .	We span unit-cell volumes ranging from 10 % greater than the equilibrium volume of the $ \delta $ phase to 90 % of the equivalent for the $ \alpha $ phase of Pu .
These schemes are tested in a perturbed Minkowski and the Schwarzschild space-time .	In those examples we find advantages of the strongly hyperbolic formulations over the ADM system presented in [ arXiv:0807.0734 ] .
We discuss the conditions under which an anomaly occurs in conductance and localization length of Anderson model on a lattice .	Using the ladder hamiltonian and analytical calculation of average conductance we find the set of resonance conditions which complements the $ \pi $ -coupling rule for anomalies .
The results , especially for the constraints on the components of the universe , clearly show that constraints from standard candles at different redshifts have different degeneracy orientations , thus standard candles with a wide redshift distribution can self break the degeneracy and improve the constraints significantly .	As a result of this , even with the current level of tightness of known luminosity relations , gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) can give comparable tightness of constraint with type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) on the components of the universe as long as the redshifts of the GRBs are diversifying enough .
Special classes of signals are also investigated , in order to improve the information-disturbance trade-off .	Extension to higher dimensional signals ( qudits ) is straightforward .
In this paper we propose a general framework in which to model belief change .	We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge and plausibility : an agent believes p if he knows that p is more plausible than its negation .
Using Hartree-Fock mean-field theory , we show that interaction-driven insulating phases with non-trivial topological invariants ( Chern number or $ Z_2 $ invariant ) exist for an experimentally reasonable range of parameters .	These phases occur at filling fractions which involve either Dirac points or quadratic band crossing points in the non-interacting limit .
However , it is unclear whether additional sources of energy , such as the recombination energy of the envelope , play an important role .	Here we report the discovery of the second and third longest orbital period post-common envelope binaries ( PCEBs ) containing white dwarf ( WD ) primaries , i.e.SDSSJ121130.94-024954.4 ( Porb = 7.818 +- 0.002 days ) and SDSSJ222108.45+002927.7 ( Porb = 9.588 +- 0.002 days ) , reconstruct their evolutionary history , and discuss the implications for the energy budget of CE evolution .
To study such terminal behavior of stochastic processes , a natural and direct way is to align the processes using failure events as time origins .	This paper studies backward stochastic processes counting time backward from failure events , and proposes one-sample nonparametric estimation of the mean of backward processes when follow-up is subject to left truncation and right censoring .
From the Montague 's point of view , the meaning of an idea can be considered as particular extensions in different possible worlds .	In this paper we analyze the minimal intensional semantic enrichment of the syntax of the FOL language , by unification of different views : Tarskian extensional semantics of the FOL , modal interpretation of quantifiers , and a derivation of the Tarskian theory of truth from unified semantic theory based on a single meaning relation .
The measurements used to validate the model and characterize its uncertainty are derived primarily from a dedicated photon radiation pressure actuator , with cross-checks provided by optical and radio frequency references .	We describe how the gravitational-wave readout signal is calibrated into equivalent gravitational-wave-induced strain and how the statistical uncertainties and systematic errors are assessed .
Observations consisting of measurements on relationships for pairs of objects arise in many settings , such as protein interaction and gene regulatory networks , collections of author-recipient email , and social networks .	Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold .
These results were extended by McQuillan in his proof of the Green-Griffiths conjecture for entire curves on such surfaces .	In this work , we study hyperbolic properties of minimal surfaces of general type with minimal $ c_1^2 $ , known as Horikawa surfaces .
Results are obtained with a load ratio of R = -1 for three different loadings : tension , torsion and combined tension-torsion .	The critical defect size determined is 400 \pm 100 \mum in A356-T6 under multiaxial loading .
The implications of N=1 superconformal symmetry for four dimensional quantum field theories are studied .	Superconformal covariant expressions for two and three point functions of quasi-primary superfields of arbitrary spin are found and connected with the operator product expansion .
When an electron hits the barrier from an oblique direction , its spin-up and spin-down states have different energies due to the spin-orbit interaction and the fact that the system has a structural inversion asymmetry .	When the electron is reflected in an elastic spin-conserving process , incoming and outgoing angles are the same .
We measure the extent of SNP clustering as the ratio between the variance of SNPs found in bins of length $ l $ , and the mean number of SNPs in such bins , $ \sigma^2_l/\mu_l $ .	For a uniform SNP distribution $ \sigma^2_l/\mu_l=1 $ , for clustered SNPs $ \sigma^2_l/\mu_l & gt ; 1 $ .
It is postulated that the `` building blocks '' of the universe are not `` particles '' but are holistic wave-entitities which act and interact with other wave-entities as one would expect from waves .	A new approach to model the free electron is presented .
In this paper we test the validity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .	For each group we compute two statistics , $ { \cal R } $ and $ { \cal S } $ , which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group members .
In particular , we examine approximate methods and analyses of ( e , e ' ) reactions developed by Traini et al .	using a high energy approximation of the distorted waves and phase shifts due to Lenz and Rosenfelder .
In multi-cloud environment , task scheduling has attracted a lot of attention due to NP-Complete nature of the problem .	Moreover , it is very challenging due to heterogeneity of the cloud resources with varying capacities and functionalities .
Before we combine actions and probabilities two very obvious questions should be asked .	Firstly , what does `` the probability of an action '' mean ?
Indistinguishable quantum states interfere , but the mere possibility of obtaining information that could distinguish between overlapping states inhibits quantum interference .	Quantum interference imaging can outperform classical imaging or even have entirely new features .
We propose a `` centrifugal barrier mechanism '' as an alternative to the previously suggested `` fountain mechanism '' for explaining the flat metallicity profiles of dIrrs and flat , rotating dEs .	While only flattening the dark-matter halo has little influence , the addition of angular momentum slows down the infall of gas , so that star formation ( SF ) and the ensuing feedback are less centrally concentrated , occurring galaxy-wide .
A second order phase transition occurs between these two phases , with associated spontaneous symmetry-breaking in the dipole phase .	This model allows us to go beyond the general theory of marginal ensemble equivalence through the notion of Goldstone modes .
This paper deals with the detection problem of extragalactic point-sources in multi-frequency , microwave sky maps that will be obtainable in future cosmic microwave background radiation ( CMB ) experiments with instruments capable of very high spatial resolution .	With spatial resolutions that can be of order of 0.1-1.0 arcsec or better , the extragalactic point-sources will appear isolated .
I present forecasts for the ability of a suite of possible SKA HI surveys to detect deviations from GR by reconstructing the cosmic expansion and growth history .	SKA Phase 1 intensity mapping surveys can achieve sub-1\ % measurements of $ f\sigma_8 $ out to $ z\approx 1 $ , with an SKA1-MID Band 2 survey out to $ z \lesssim 0.6 $ able to surpass contemporary spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as DESI and Euclid in terms of constraints on modified gravity parameters if challenges such as foreground contamination can be tackled effectively .
One way that an anthropic selection mechanism may be manifest in a physical theory involves multiple domains in the universe with different values of the physical parameters .	If this mechanism is to be relevant for understanding the small observed value of the cosmological constant , it may involve a mechanism by which some contributions to the cosmological constant can be fixed at a continuous range of values in the different domains .
We explore two models for the secondary property , namely subhalo assembly time and local dark matter density around each subhalo .	The model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation functions are compared with the recent results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
Here we present studies of fluctuations in facial electromyography ( fEMG ) and electrodermal activity ( EDA ) massive time series and changes of such signals in the course of emotional stimulation .	Zygomaticus major ( ZYG , `` smiling '' muscle ) activity , corrugator supercilii ( COR , `` frowning '' bmuscle ) activity , and phasic skin conductance ( PHSC , sweating ) levels of 65 participants were recorded during experiments that involved exposure to emotional stimuli ( i.e. , IAPS images , reading and writing messages on an artificial online discussion board ) .
By reinvestigating this small $ \tan\beta $ region , we find that the indirect constraints like $ \Delta\rho $ , $ b\to s \gamma $ , $ \Delta M_ { B_d } $ , $ R_b $ , $ \epsilon_K $ , and the perturbativity of running top Yukawa coupling are rather weak to be $ \tan\beta & gt ; 0.5 $ .	The current heavy Higgs search results are shown to put more significant bounds .
The asymptotic results can be applied to assess patterns of marginal densities or regression functions via the construction of simultaneous confidence bands for which one can perform goodness-of-fit tests .	As an application , we construct simultaneous confidence bands for drift and volatility functions in a dynamic short-term rate model for the U.S. Treasury yield curve rates data .
We consider an open quantum system which contains unstable states .	The time evolution of the system can be described by an effective non-hermitian Hamiltonian H_ { eff } , in accord with the Wigner -- Weisskopf approximation , and an additional term of the Lindblad form , the socalled dissipator .
We develop well-balanced central schemes on overlapping cells for the Saint-Venant shallow water system and its variants .	The main challenge in deriving the schemes is related to the fact that the Saint-Venant system contains a geometric source term due to nonflat bottom topography and therefore a delicate balance between the flux gradients and source terms has to be preserved .
Managing , querying , storing , and mining moving objects were the key research directions .	This extensive interest in moving objects is a natural consequence of the recent ubiquitous location-aware devices , such as PDAs , mobile phones , etc. , as well as the variety of information that can be extracted from such new databases .
This sedimentary basin is 3000m wide and 350m deep .	Since the seismic hazard is significant in this area , the depth of the basin and the strong impedance ratio raise the need for an accurate estimation of seismic motion amplification .
This paper investigates the influence of magneto-centrifugally driven or simply magnetic winds of rapidly-rotating , strongly-magnetized T Tauri stars in causing the inward or outward migration of close-in giant planets .	The azimuthal ram pressure of the magnetized wind acting on the planet tends to increase the planet 's angular momentum and cause outward migration if the star 's rotation period $ P_* $ is less than the planet 's orbital period $ P_p $ .
The Rossby number , which is related to the dynamo process , shows an observational correlation with activity .	It represents the ratio between the rotation period of the star and the local convective turnover time .
SKIRT employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical processes including scattering , absorption and emission by the dust .	The code features a wealth of built-in geometries , radiation source spectra , dust characterizations , dust grids , and detectors , in addition to various mechanisms for importing snapshots generated by hydrodynamical simulations .
However , existing work on this problem make inherent assumptions about the data that are impractical in day-to-day enterprise data management scenarios .	Further , application of existing anonymization schemes on enterprise data could lead to adversarial attacks in which an intruder could use information fusion techniques to inflict a privacy breach .
Our results are twofold .	First , we identify a large class of quantum Hamiltonians describing systems of qubits for which the adiabatic evolution can be efficiently simulated on a classical probabilistic computer .
We derive properties of this process and propose an extended model which generalises the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to the class of continuous-time ARMA ( CARMA ) processes .	The model is illustrated by fitting it to empirical rainfall data on both daily and hourly time scales .
A substantial fraction of the resistance drop with voltage can be ascribed to variations of the density of states and the barrier transmission with the bias .	However , we found that the anomaly observed at zero bias and the magnetoresistance behavior at very small voltages , point to the contribution of inelastic magnon-assisted tunneling .
Unfortunately , many applications in nonlinear optics are severely hindered by the small response of conventional materials .	Metallic nanostructures partially alleviate this situation , as the large light enhancement associated with their localized plasmons amplifies their nonlinear response to record high levels .
It contains a single chiral supermultiplet T and a single U ( 1 ) vector multiplet U , gauging an axionic shift symmetry .	Both supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry are spontaneously broken , with the spin-3/2 , spin-1 and spin-1/2 masses sliding along a classical flat direction , with a single real massless scalar in the spectrum .
As a byproduct we settle a question of Hough and the late Simion on the divisibility of the 4-Catalan numbers .	We also prove that \binom { p^qn+1 } { n } , p^q & lt ; =99999 , is squarefree for n sufficiently large ( explicit ) , and with the help of the generalized Catalan numbers we find the set of possible exceptions .
Based on this platform , we present a 128-channel TDC which is implemented in a single Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA using a shifted clock sampling method .	In this concept each input signal is continuously sampled by 16 flip-flops using equidistant phase-shifted clocks .
It is augmented by an implementation of the protocol SOME/IP ( -SD ) and an connector to the middleware Gamma V. The middleware is used to configure the network by initialization .	Additionally data , which is sent over the network , can be changed on the fly .
In particular , the effect of an external magnetic field is examined .	It is found that a nonzero magnetic field introduces instability in a $ ^ { 23 } $ Na condensate .
We furthermore show that quantum anomalies do not block the invariance requirement .	This invariance constraint applies to the entire spectrum of states , from the vacuum to the excited states ( should they exist ) , and is in that sense much stronger than the usual Poincare invariance requirement of the Minkowski vacuum alone .
The reduces the search time for adding new points .	The algorithm belongs to the family of swept hull algorithms .
The study is based on jet-multiplicity related observables .	The observables are obtained to high jet resolution scales with the JADE , Durham , Cambridge and cone jet finders , and compared with the predictions of various QCD and Monte Carlo models .
We constrain those two LECs by a fit to the A=3 system binding energy and investigate sensitivity of 4He , 6Li , 10,11B and 12,13C properties to the variation of the constrained LECs .	We identify a preferred choice that gives globally the best description .
When the energy scale is above the string scale or Planck scale a number of interesting phenomena occur , namely , production of stringy states , p-branes , string balls , black hole , etc .	In this work , we systematically study the production cross sections of black holes , string balls , and p-branes at hadronic supercolliders .
Thus , the merger rate depends critically upon whether or not the BH is retained by the cluster after the merger .	Results from numerical relativity suggest that kick imparted to a ~7 M_sun BH after it merges with a NS will greatly exceed the cluster 's escape velocity .
Only observers that do n't change of position can detect them .	Thus , to relate quantities measured by observers in different G potentials they must be previously transformed after Lorenz and G transformations derived from experiments .
Tensors have found application in a variety of fields , ranging from chemometrics to signal processing and beyond .	In this paper , we consider the problem of multilinear modeling of sparse count data .
We also compare the results with the previous calculations based on the Kompaneets operator .	We solve the radiation transfer equation together with the hydrostatic equilibrium equation accounting exactly for the radiation pressure by electron scattering .
The diffusive motion of a colloidal particle trapped inside a small cavity filled with fluid is reduced by hydrodynamic interactions with the confining walls .	In this work , we study these wall effects on a spherical particle entrapped in a closed cylinder .
We find that even for halos not undergoing major mergers the mass accretion rates are plausibly sufficient to account for the high star formation rates observed in z~2 disks .	On the other hand , the fraction of major mergers in the Millennium Simulation is sufficient to account for the number counts of submillimeter galaxies ( SMGs ) , in support of observational evidence that these are major mergers .
We have performed a search for variable stars in the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822 using wide-field multi-epoch VI photometry down to a limiting magnitude $ V $ $ \sim $ 22 .	Apart from the Cepheid variables in this galaxy already reported in an earlier paper by Pietrzynski et al .
All highest weight representations are proved to be irreducible : There are thus no singular vectors in the extended theory .	This has interesting structural consequences .
After subtracting the stellar contribution , we find that the pure-ISM integrated spectra generally show blueshifted NaD profiles , indicating neutral gas outflow velocities V in the range 65-260 km/s .	Excluding galaxies with AGNs , V shows a dependency with the SFR of the type V \propto SFR^0.15 ( in rather good agreement with previous results ) .
Strong parton energy loss has been observed in central nucleus-nucleus collisions as evidenced by the a large suppression of the yield of high pT hadrons as compared to the expected yield based on measurements in p+p collisions .	Moreover , measurements of back-to-back correlations of charged hadrons suggest that jet shapes are strongly modified modified by the medium .
We present high quality long slit spectra along the major and minor axes out to 1.5 effective radius ( $ R_e $ ) of the massive galaxy NGC4636 taken by Hobby-Eberly Telescope ( HET ) .	Using Fourier Correlation Quotient ( FCQ ) method , we measured the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution along the axes .
The behaviour of the resulting system of o.d.e .	's is examined analytically and numerical solutions presented .
Herein , we perform in vitro and in vivo radiosensitization studies of 4.8 , 12.1 , 27.3 , and 46.6 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles .	In vitro results show that all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can cause a significant decrease in cancer cell survival after gamma radiation .
The presence of the CIV absorption feature , indicating that the rest-frame UV-optical SED is dominated by OB stars , is used to select objects for which the intrinsic , unattenuated spectrum has a well-established shape .	Comparison of this intrinsic spectrum with the observed broadband photometric SED then permits derivation of the wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation .
In nonadditive systems , some of the above properties can be violated .	It is pointed out that the shape-dependence of the entropy density in a nonadditive system results in the violation of the Gibbs-Duhem equation .
These data allowed us to derive accurate mean K-band magnitudes for 52 fundamental ( RR_ { ab } ) and 24 first overtone ( RR_ { c } ) RR Lyrae stars .	Using this sample of RR Lyrae stars , we find that the slope of the K-band Period Luminosity ( PLK ) relation ( -2.33 \pm 0.08 ) agrees quite well with similar estimates available in the literature .
It was shown , that for small thermalisation time , two loop rate contribute substantially to high $ p_T $ photons .	We argue that for extremely short thermalisation time scale , the higher loop contribution should not be neglected .
Here , sparse Big Data is a set of $ n $ vectors in $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ , where each vector has $ O ( 1 ) $ non-zeroes entries , and $ d\geq n $ .	E.g. , adjacency matrix of a graph , web-links , social network , document-terms , or image-features matrices .
In particular , we provide bulk constructions that correctly reproduce all semiclassical Virasoro blocks that are known explicitly from conformal field theory computations .	The results revolve around the use of geodesic Witten diagrams , recently introduced in arXiv:1508.00501 , evaluated in locally AdS $ _3 $ geometries generated by backreaction of heavy operators .
The galaxy pairs are selected to have velocity differences & lt ; 300 km/s , projected separations ( rp ) & lt ; 80 kpc/h , mass ratios between 0.1 and 10 , and robust measurements of star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities .	We match the galaxies in total stellar mass , redshift , and local density to a set of 10 control galaxies per pair galaxy .
We introduce a model for ionic electrodiffusion and osmotic water flow through cells and tissues .	The model consists of a system of partial differential equations for ionic concentration and fluid flow with interface conditions at deforming membrane boundaries .
The said criterion identifies a state as classical if a suitably defined JQP of the eigenvalues of spin components in suitably chosen three or two orthogonal directions is non-negative .	In agreement with other approaches , the JQP based criterion leads to the result that all non-factorizable pure states of two spin-1/2s are non-classical .
Initial transients of wetting and non-wetting phases that evolve before steady-state has occurred , undergo a cross-over where every initial patterns are broken up .	For flow dominated by capillary effects with capillary numbers in order of $ 10^ { -5 } $ , we find that around a critical saturation of non-wetting fluid the non-wetting clusters of size $ s $ have a power-law distribution $ n_s \sim s^ { -\tau } $ with the exponent $ \tau = 1.92 \pm 0.04 $ for large clusters .
The results show that the saturation density is improved and the equation of state becomes softer as compared to corresponding Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations .	Using the Bonn A potential , nuclear matter is predicted to saturate at an energy per nucleon of -- 15.30 MeV and a density equivalent to a Fermi momentum of 1.38 fm $ ^ { -1 } $ , in excellent agreement with empirical information .
This thesis focuses on DW manipulation and DW-based devices in spin-valve ( SV ) tracks .	In comparison to monolayer tracks , the SV track enables more sensitive and versatile measurements , as well as an electronic output of DW-based devices , of crucial interest to applications .
The diagonal composite order breaks the SU ( 2 ) channel symmetry , and the symmetry-restoring collective mode couples with magnetic field .	On the other hand , the off-diagonal or superconducting composite order breaks the gauge symmetry of conduction electrons , and the collective mode couples with charge excitations near the zone boundary .
This article presents a probabilistic generative model for text based on semantic topics and syntactic classes called Part-of-Speech LDA ( POSLDA ) .	POSLDA simultaneously uncovers short-range syntactic patterns ( syntax ) and long-range semantic patterns ( topics ) that exist in document collections .
We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ( GMRT ) HI 21cm emission images of the z=0.009 damped Lyman-alpha ( DLA ) absorber towards the QSO HS 1543+5921 .	The DLA has been earlier identified as a low surface brightness galaxy SBS 1543+593 at an impact parameter of ~ 400 pc to the QSO line of sight .
In this paper , based on weakly dependent sample , we investigate the single-index prediction ( SIP ) model which is robust against deviation from the single-index model .	The single-index is identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of the response variable , regardless of whether the prediction function is a genuine single-index function .
Possibilities for enhancing the signal over background in Pentaquark searches are investigated by examining predictions for detailed momentum and angular distributions in multiparticle final states .	General model-independent predictions are presented as well as those from two models : a loosely bound $ D_ { s } ^-N $ molecule and a strongly-bound five-quark system .
The Hamiltonian is determined by a choice of graph that specifies the geometry in which the particles move and interact .	We prove that approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on a graph at fixed particle number is QMA-complete .
Next generation surveys will observe the large-scale structure of the Universe with unprecedented accuracy .	This will enable us to test the relationships between matter over-densities , the curvature perturbation and the Newtonian potential .
Hyperbolic metamaterials may be used to model a 2+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime in which the role of time is played by one of the spatial coordinates .	When a metamaterial is built and illuminated with a coherent extraordinary laser beam , the stationary pattern of light propagation inside the metamaterial may be treated as a collection of particle world lines , which represents a complete history of this 2+1 dimensional spacetime .
Moreover , there are not only transverse but also longitudinal couplings between the external magnetic fields and the SFQs when the inversion symmetry of potential energy is broken .	The longitudinal coupling would induce some new phenomena in the SFQs .
In addition to spherically-symmetric mass-ejection events , we consider planetary dynamics under the influence of an expanding disk .	In order to have survived , we suggest that the present planets in NN Ser must have had semi-major axes $ \ , { } ^ & gt ; _ { \sim } \ , 10 $ AU and high eccentricity values which is in conflict with current observations .
But what about words not contained in the supervised training data ?	When such unseen words are encountered at test time , they are typically represented by either their initial vectors or a single unknown vector , which often leads to errors .
Our results lead to the conclusion that both measures can drop by an arbitrary amount when only a single qubit of a local system is lost .	This property is known as `` locking '' and has previously been observed for other correlation measures , such as the accessible information , entanglement cost and the logarithmic negativity .
Our results cover all the matrix elements required to estimate the partial lifetimes of ( proton , neutron ) $ \to $ ( $ \pi , K , \eta $ ) + ( $ { \bar \nu } , e^+ , \mu^+ $ ) decay modes .	We point out the necessity of disentangling two form factors that contribute to the matrix element ; previous calculations did not make the separation , which led to an underestimate of the physical matrix elements .
In this paper , the authors devise a scheme , A Novel Adaptive Channel Allocation Scheme ( ACAS ) where the number of guard channel ( s ) is adjusted automatically based on the average handoff blocking rate measured in the past certain period of time .	The handoff blocking rate is controlled under the designated threshold and the new call blocking rate is minimized .
The layered data is encoded by means of Prioritized Random Linear Coding ( PRLC ) in order to be resilient to channel loss while respecting the unequal levels of importance in the data , and data blocks are transmitted simultaneously in order to reduce decoding delays and improve the delivery performance .	We formulate the optimal coding and scheduling decisions problem in our novel framework with the help of Markov Decision Processes ( MDP ) , which are effective tools for modeling adapting streaming systems .
The X-ray spectrum can be fit with a thermal model including an absorption component that partially covers the source .	Most of the equivalent width of the iron fluorescent line in this model can be explained as a combination of reprocessing in a dense absorber plus reflection off a white dwarf surface , but it is likely that the continuum is partially seen in reflection as well .
In order to build a model of pit , parameters that characterize a geometry of edges of pit , such as a curvature radius and a slope angle of edge , should be included , because the magnetic field is enhanced at an edge of a pit .	A shape of the bottom of the pit is not important , because the magnetic field attenuates at the bottom .
We discuss two formulae , the classical Gabrielov-Gelfand-Losik formula based on investigation of configuration spaces and the local combinatorial formula obtained by the author in 2004 .	The latter formula is based on the notion of a universal local formula introduced by the author and on the usage of bistellar moves .
This allows us to realize the Newton-Hooke groups and their Bargmann type central extensions as subgroups of the isometry groups of the pp-wave spacetimes .	The extended Schrodinger type conformal group is identified and its action on the equations of motion given .
In fact , these two profiles provide two different insights of the shower : the electromagnetic component gives a measurement of the energy and the strength of the neutral pion channel ; while the muonic profile , being intimately related with the charged mesons decays , can be used as a direct probe for the high energy hadronic interactions .	In this work we explore the interplay between the electromagnetic and muonic profiles , by analysing their phenomenologic behaviour for different primary masses and energies , zenith angles , and also different high energy hadronic interaction models .
These results allow us to apply properadic methods for computing formulae for a homotopy transfer of a unimodular Lie 1-bialgebra structure on an arbitrary complex to the associated quantum master function on its cohomology .	It is proven that in the category of quantum BV manifolds associated with the homotopy theory of unimodular Lie 1-bialgebras quasi-isomorphisms are equivalence relations .
The model of a bicycle is a unit segment AB that can move in the plane so that it remains tangent to the trajectory of point A ( the rear wheel is fixed on the bicycle frame ) ; the same model describes the hatchet planimeter .	The trajectory of the front wheel and the initial position of the bicycle uniquely determine its motion and its terminal position ; the monodromy map sending the initial position to the terminal one arises .
The metering platform features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation of the current measurement unit .	The suggested design can switch loads , offers a variable sampling frequency , and provides measurement data such as active power , reactive and apparent power .
We construct their self-interactions and interactions with standard model fields .	Using the Weinberg sum rules , opportunely modified to take into account the walking behavior of the underlying gauge theory , we find interesting relations for the spin-one spectrum .
In particular we find that the G-phase is stable for low electron doping as seen in experiments .	We find good agreement with the experimentally observed magnetic phase diagrams of electron-doped manganites ( $ x & gt ; 0.5 $ ) such as Nd $ _ { 1-x } $ Sr $ _ { x } $ MnO $ _ { 3 } $ , Pr $ _ { 1-x } $ Sr $ _ { x } $ MnO $ _ { 3 } $ , and Sm $ _ { 1-x } $ Ca $ _ { x } $ MnO $ _ { 3 } $ .
The logistic loss function is often advocated in machine learning and statistics as a smooth and strictly convex surrogate for the 0-1 loss .	In this paper we investigate the question of whether these smoothness and convexity properties make the logistic loss preferable to other widely considered options such as the hinge loss .
Then , the process of generating hash function based on the \linebreak topological chaos is detailed .	Finally it is shown how some tools coming from the domain of \linebreak topological chaos can be used to measure quantitatively and qualitatively some desirable properties for hash functions .
The bondage number $ b ( G ) $ of a graph $ G $ is the smallest number of edges whose removal from $ G $ results in a graph with larger domination number .	An orientable surface $ \mathbb { S } _h $ of genus $ h $ , $ h \geq 0 $ , is obtained from the sphere $ \mathbb { S } _0 $ by adding $ h $ handles .
We use the coupled cluster method to high orders of approximation in order to calculate the ground-state phase diagram of the XXZ spin- $ s $ kagome antiferromagnet with easy-plane anisotropy , i.e.the anisotropy parameter $ \Delta $ varies between $ \Delta=1 $ ( isotropic Heisenberg model ) and $ \Delta=0 $ ( $ XY $ model ) .	We find that for the extreme quantum case $ s=1/2 $ the ground state is magnetically disordered in the entire region $ 0 \le \Delta \le 1 $ .
Dihadron azimuthal angle correlations relative to the reaction plane have been investigated in Au + Au collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } $ = 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model ( AMPT ) .	Such reaction plane azimuthal angle dependent correlations can shed light on path-length effect of energy loss of high transverse momentum particles propagating through the hot dense medium .
The second type of coseismic event , the transient magnetic signal starts simultaneously with the offset event and reaches amplitude of 0.8 nT in the total magnetic field .	The signal is local one , in the sense that its form differs from the signals of ionospheric/magnetospheric origin confirmed ( indirectly ) by additional magnetic field data in Italy and Central Europe .
We particularly stress the conditions that must be fulfilled for successful driving .	Specifically , we discuss the roles of chemical peculiarity and strong magnetic field on the oscillation modes and what separates these pulsators from delta Scuti and Am-type stars .
We use numerical simulations in a Lambda CDM cosmology to model density profiles in a set of 16 dark matter haloes with resolutions of up to 7 million particles within the virial radius .	These simulations allow us to follow robustly the formation and evolution of the central cusp over a large mass range of 10^11 to 10^14 M_sun , down to approximately 0.5 % of the virial radius , and from redshift 5 to the present .
The spectral energy distribution of the ionizing radiation is taken from appropriate model atmospheres .	Both stellar components contribute to the ionization : the `` cool '' one provides the bulk of hydrogen ionization , and the `` hot '' one is responsible for the presence of the most highly charged ions , which explains why previous attempts to model the nebula experienced difficulties .
Later , Zhang ( 1994 ) generalized this to graphs with no $ K_5 $ -minor .	In this paper we propose a conjecture involving signed graphs which contains all of these results .
Presented in this paper is a derivation of a 2D catalytic reaction-based model to solve combinatorial optimization problems ( COPs ) .	The simulated catalytic reactions , a computational metaphor , occurs in an artificial chemical reactor that finds near-optimal solutions to COPs .
It is shown that there occurs a phase-transition-like behavior in the time-averaged population imbalance between the ground and excited states .	The application of the suggested technique to realistic experimental conditions is analyzed and it is shown that the considered effect can be realized for experimentally available condensates .
Fixing the mass of the latter to its central value from the LHC and taking 40 & lt ; =tanbeta & lt ; =50 , we find a relatively wide allowed parameter space with -11 & lt ; =A_0/M_ { 1/2 } & lt ; =15 and mass of the lightest sparticle in the range ( 0.09-1.1 ) TeV .	This sparticle is possibly detectable by the present cold dark matter direct search experiments .
However , beyond the concept of the system itself , the uncommon map ( despite its simplicity ) is the main innovative part of the system .	The uncommon map helps to determine interest-points in a context-free manner .
These data , together with models of the spectral energy distribution , suggest a compact disk around GQ Lup A with mass $ \sim 3 $ M $ _ { Jup } $ , perhaps truncated by tidal forces .	There is no evidence for a gap or hole in the disk that might be the signature of an additional inner companion body capable of scattering GQ Lup B out to $ \sim100 $ AU separation from GQ Lup A .
We discuss the reliability of CSSR , its data requirements , and its performance in simulations .	Finally , we compare our approach to existing methods using variablelength Markov models and cross-validated hidden Markov models , and show theoretically and experimentally that our method delivers results superior to the former and at least comparable to the latter .
There is great interest in hybrid organic-inorganic materials such as metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs ) .	The compounds [ C ( NH $ _ { 2 } $ ) $ _ { 3 } $ ] M ( HCOO ) $ _ { 3 } $ , where M=Cu $ ^ { 2+ } $ or Cr $ ^ { 2+ } $ are Jahn-Teller ( JT ) active ions , are MOF with perovskite topology which crystallizes in polar space group Pna2 $ _ { 1 } $ .
The resulting renormalized EMT is covariantly conserved and agrees with the Allen-Folacci result in the de Sitter limit , when the expansion is exactly linearly exponential in time .	We analytically show that the EMT tensor of the inflaton fluctuations grows initially in time , but saturates to the value H^2 H ( 0 ) ^2 , where H is the Hubble parameter and H ( 0 ) is its value when inflation has started .
This leads to a natural suppression of these masses relative to the $ Q=2/3 $ quarks , as well as the generation of quark mixing angles , both long-standing challenges for ETC theories .	Standard-model-singlet neutrinos are assigned to ETC representations that provide a similar suppression of neutrino Dirac masses , as well as the possibility of a realistic seesaw mechanism with no mass scale above the highest ETC scale of roughly $ 10^3 $ TeV .
We review ( mainly ) quantum effects in the theories where gravity sector is described by metric and dilaton .	The one-loop effective action for dilatonic gravity in two and four dimensions is evaluated .
Time synchronization and out-of-time background rejection results are presented from the Cosmic Run At Four Tesla and LHC beam runs taken in the Autumn of 2008 .	The inter-channel synchronization is measured to be within 2 ns .
The sub-dominant mode is anisotropic throughout , but in a scale-independent way ( at higher frequencies ) .	There are two distinct subranges exhibiting different scalings within what is normally considered the inertial range .
( Here $ a \ge 1 $ is the ratio of the area of the large axis to that of the smaller axis . )	The structure of the graph of $ c ( a ) $ is surprisingly rich .
We find that in the case of perpendicular scattering ( the incident neutron beam is perpendicular to the applied magnetic field ) if twice the cross section along the direction orthogonal to both the field and the neutron beam is subtracted from the cross section along the field direction , the result has only a third-order contribution ( the lower-order terms are canceled ) .	This difference does not depend on the amplitude of the exchange inhomogeneities and provides a separate gateway for a deeper analysis of the sample 's magnetic structure .
Very high quality light curves are now available for thousands of detached eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanet systems as a result of surveys for transiting exoplanets and other large-scale photometric surveys .	I have developed a binary star model ( ELLC ) that can be used to analyse the light curves of detached eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanet systems that is fast and accurate , and that can include the effects of star spots , Doppler boosting and light-travel time within binaries with eccentric orbits .
We present electronic transport characteristics of ternary alloy Cd1-xZnxS nanowire networks in the dark and under white light illumination .	Compared to the negligible dark current , we observed a photocurrent enhancement up to 4 orders of magnitude at intensity of 460 mW/cm2 .
The approach is based on the recently developed by the authors spectrally accurate method for causality characterization that employs SVD-based causal Fourier continuations .	The time delay extraction is constructed by incorporating a linearly varying phase factor to the system of equations that determines Fourier coefficients .
The simulations model a cluster of 4000 stars , and we consider separately cases in which the disks have fixed radii of 100 AU and 10 AU .	In the former case , depending on a star 's position and orbit in the cluster over 10^7 years , UV photoevaporation removes at least 0.01 Msol from its disk , and can remove up to 1 Msol .
One of the most central and controversial element of quantum mechanics is the use of non zero vectors of a Hilbert space ( or , more generally , of one dimension subspaces ) for representing the state of a quantum system .	In particular , the question whether such a representation is complete has been debated since almost the early days of quantum mechanics .
A 3D two-magnon density of states now gradually extends to higher temperatures T\leq 60K compared with pure CuGeO_3 .	This effect is more pronounced in the case of off-chain substitutions ( Si ) for which a N\'eel state occurs over a larger substitution range , starting at very low concentrations .
We prove that if a family of metrics , $ g_i $ , on a compact Riemannian manifold , $ M^n $ , have a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound and converge to $ g_\infty $ smoothly away from a singular set , $ S $ , with Hausdorff measure , $ H^ { n-1 } ( S ) = 0 $ , and if there exists connected precompact exhaustion , $ W_j $ , of $ M^n \setminus S $ satisfying $ \diam_ { g_i } ( M^n ) \le D_0 $ , $ \vol_ { g_i } ( \partial W_j ) \le A_0 $ and $ \vol_ { g_i } ( M^n \setminus W_j ) \le V_j where \lim_ { j\to\infty } V_j=0 $ then the Gromov-Hausdorff limit exists and agrees with the metric completion of $ ( M^n \setminus S , g_\infty ) $ .	Recall that in the prior work with Sormani the same conclusion is reached but the singular set is assumed to be a submanifold of codimension two .
I derive the MRD using a Richardson-Lucy inversion method , assuming a fixed mass of the Am primary and randomly distributed orbital inclinations .	Using the large sub-sample of double-lined spectroscopic binaries , I show that this methodology is indeed perfectly adequate .
We prove two Liouville-type uniqueness theorems for solutions of this system , and use these to give an alternative proof of the classification of compact locally conformally flat Hermitian surfaces first proved by Pontecorvo .	We also give a classification of non-degenerate quadrics in CP^3 under the action of the conformal group .
A propability amplitude for the propagation of these solutions is calculated which can be applied in a One-Boson-Exchange Potential ( OBEP ) .	Using proper normalization as an alternative to the usual renormalization scheme one obtains amplitudes with the same momentum dependence as the conventional Feynman-propagators multiplied with the form factors of the Bonn-B OBEP .
Time of flight measurement from different astronomical sources set current limits on the energy scale of possible LIV to $ & gt ; 0.01 M_ { pl } $ ( for n=1 models ) and $ & gt ; 10^ { -9 } M_ { pl } $ ( for n=2 ) .	According to current models Gamma-Ray Bursts ( GRBs ) are accompanied by bursts of high energy ( $ \gsim 100 $ TeV ) neutrinos .
The main message of these papers is that , given a family of predictors , we are able to build a new predictor that predicts the series as well as the best predictor in the family , up to a remainder of order $ 1/\sqrt { n } $ .	It is known that this rate can not be improved in general .
Osborne and A.~Provenzale , { \sl Physica D } { \bf 35 } , 357 ( 1989 ) . ]	I will discuss the relevance of this observation to the practical estimation of dimension from a time series , and in particular I will argue that a good dimension algorithm need not be trapped by this anomalous fractal scaling .
Compared to the inhomogeneous phase with the alternating layer structure , our ferromagnetic phase turns out to be unfavored .	However , once an axial vector meson condensation is taken into account in our simplest model , the ferromagnetic energy density is lowered significantly , which still leaves some room for a possible realization of a QCD ferromagnetic phase and ferromagnetic magnetars .
Finally , we study a model given by a Lagrangian 4-form quadratic in non-metricity .	Thus , we seek Schwarzschild-type solutions because of its observational success and obtain some sets of solutions .
This ratio depends on the neutrino energy , density profile of the sources and on the oscillation parameters .	The largely unknown flux normalization drops out of our calculation and only affects the statistics .
This extends a previous result giving a weaker central limit theorem ( CLT ) for these systems .	Our result relies on the fact that the Lee-Yang zeros of the generating function for $ \ { E ( k ; J ) \ } $ -- - the probabilities of there being exactly $ k $ points in $ J $ -- - all lie on the negative real $ z $ -axis .
First , we argue that such instabilities must drastically modify the `` bottom-up '' thermalization scenario for heavy-ion collisions .	Second , we discuss conditions for the existence of instabilities in a more general context than previously treated in the QCD literature .
In particular , we conjecture that the measured value of the mixing angles for a given process depends on the number of unobservable flavor states at the energy of the process .	We provide a covariant implementation of such conjecture , draw its consequences in a two neutrino family approximation and compare these findings with current experimental data .
The aim is to identify the conditions for the locally and temporally controlled spin switching .	Analytical and full numerical calculations show the possibility of stochastic control if the underlying semi-classical dynamics is chaotic .
We find that the tack energy is larger in the parallel alignment than the isotropic case by over a factor of two .	The tack energy for the perpendicular alignment can be 50 % less than the isotropic case .
In contrast , A-terms receive highly suppressed gravity mediated contributions .	Under certain conditions , the same conclusion is valid for gaugino masses , which like A-terms , are then determined by anomalies .
In order to study the extent , origin and fate of the intergalactic molecular gas and its relation to the formation of stars outside galaxies and Tidal Dwarf Galaxies ( TDGs ) , we mapped with the IRAM 30m antenna carbon monoxide ( CO ) towards several regions of the IGM in SQ .	In two star forming regions ( SQ A and B ) , situated in very different environments , we detected unusually large amounts of molecular gas ( $ 3.1 \times 10^9 $ \msun and $ 7 \times 10^8 $ \msun , respectively ) , covering an extended area ( between 15 and 25 kpc ) .
The idea that there are any large-scale trends in the evolution of biological organisms is highly controversial .	It is commonly believed , for example , that there is a large-scale trend in evolution towards increasing complexity , but empirical and theoretical arguments undermine this belief .
Optimized geometries are found by using a mix of classical-quantum semiempirical computations .	According with the simulations results , the local curvature of the nanoribbons increases at the defect sites , specially for a higher number of half-twists .
In this paper , we investigate the noncommutative KKLMMT D3/anti-D3 brane inflation scenario in detail .	Incorporation of the brane inflation scenario and the noncommutative inflation scenario can nicely explain the large negative running of the spectral index as indicated by WMAP three-year data and can significantly release the fine-tuning for the parameter $ \beta $ .
We study a two-orbital spin model to describe ( pi,0 ) stripe antiferromagnetism in the iron pnictides .	The `` double-spin '' model has an on-site Hunds 's coupling and inter-site interactions extending to second neighbors ( inter- and intra-orbital ) on the square lattice .
The quality of the approximation may be controlled to arbitrary precision through a parameter \epsilon & gt ; 0 .	We provide theoretical results which quantify , in terms of \epsilon , the ABC error in approximation of expectations of additive functionals with respect to the smoothing distributions .
The nuclear medium nevertheless affects the mesonic decays of charm hypernucleus because the nuclear mean fields modify the masses of the charm hyperon .	In the present communication we present results of a first investigation of the effects of finite baryon density on different weak mesonic decay channels of the $ \Lambda^+_c $ baryon .
In these applications , an area $ a ( r ) $ is assigned to each rectangle $ r $ , and the actual area of $ r $ in $ \mathcal { L } $ is required to be $ a ( r ) $ .	Moreover , some applications require that we use combinatorially equivalent rectangular layouts to represent multiple area assignment functions .
Space resolved concentrations of helium He metastable atoms in an atmospheric pressure radio-frequency micro-plasma jet were measured using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy .	The spatial profile of metastable atoms in the volume between the electrodes was deduced for various electrode gap distances .
The radiation from the former is the Hawking 's original one .	Though the the latter has been often regarded as the same phenomena as the former , the result here suggests it is not ; its radiation has a temperature twice as high as the Hawking temperature .
However , we find hardly any ( & lt ; 5 per cent ) down-bending disc breaks ( truncations , Type II ) in our S0s and many cases ( ~20 per cent ) where no exponential component was observed .	We also find no evidence for an environmental dependence on the disc scalelength or break strength ( outer-to-inner scalelength ratio ) , implying that the galaxy environment does not affect the stellar distribution in S0 stellar discs .
The main aim of this paper is , however , to generalise this corrected result to derive formulae of Hopf type for the n-fold Cech derived functors of the lower central series functors Z_k .	The paper ends with an application to algebraic K-theory .
An analysis of these quantities has so far been confined to the PhD thesis of Stefan Glasauer ( 1995 ) .	We rederive the results from this thesis with novel streamlined proofs and expand them in several ways .
Further , it is shown that the dynamics of the extents of flow exhibit cooperative behavior .	Further , we provide the conditions under which the dynamics of the extents of reaction exhibit cooperative behavior .
The optical spectra are dominated by the narrow ( full width at half-maximum ~1000 km s^-1 ) Balmer lines distinctive of a Type IIn SN with P Cygni profiles .	Contrarily , the photometric evolution resembles more that of a Type IIP SN with a large drop in luminosity at the end of the plateau phase .
This is the first attempt to construct detailed X-ray spectra of clusters of galaxies from the results of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations and simulate X-ray observations in order to study velocity fields of the intracluster medium ( ICM ) .	The hydrodynamic simulations are based on the recently proposed tsunami model , in which cluster cores are affected by bulk motions of the ICM and turbulence is produced .
We analytically demonstrate on a realistic model system that this mechanism can be realized by applying an external random force to the system .	In other words , we find a new fluctuation theorem for the entropy production of a partial system , in the limit of weak coupling .
We calculate the top polarization and the effects of these anomalous couplings on it at two centre-of-mass ( cm ) energies , 8 TeV and 14 TeV .	As a measure of top polarization , we look at decay-lepton angular distributions in the laboratory frame , without requiring reconstruction of the rest frame of the top , and study the effect of the anomalous couplings on these distributions .
The scaling limit of the SAW has a natural parameterization and SLE has a standard parameterization using the half-plane capacity .	These two parameterizations do not correspond with one another .
The cyclic polytope $ C ( n , d ) $ is the convex hull of any $ n $ points on the moment curve $ { ( t , t^2 , ... , t^d ) : t \in \reals } $ in $ \reals^d $ .	For $ d ' & gt ; d $ , we consider the fiber polytope ( in the sense of Billera and Sturmfels ) associated to the natural projection of cyclic polytopes $ \pi : C ( n , d ' ) \to C ( n , d ) $ which `` forgets '' the last $ d'-d $ coordinates .
Three-qubit quantum gates are crucial for quantum error correction and quantum information processing .	We generate policies for quantum control procedures to design three types of three-qubit gates , namely Toffoli , Controlled-Not-Not and Fredkin gates .
The geometric-mean method is often used to estimate the spatial resolution of a position-sensitive detector probed by tracks .	It calculates the resolution solely from measured track data without using a detailed tracking simulation and without considering multiple Coulomb scattering effects .
In the present letter we extend these results to a system which is out of equilibrium and evolves to a stationary state according to a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation .	By means of time-scale conversion , it is shown that there exists a `` correspondence '' among the self-similar solutions of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations associated with the different Tsallis formalisms .
In this communication , we show that the resonances can be derived by shifted Gaussian functions , whereas the unspecific nuclear interaction compounds can be represented by an error function , which also provides the asymptotic behavior .	The energy shifts can be interpreted in terms of necessary domains of energy to excite typical nuclear processes .
We contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates various datasources in the design of algorithmic traders .	This allows us to derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading strategies .
The next-to-minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model ( NMSSM ) is one of the most favored supersymmetric models .	After an introduction to the model , the Higgs sector and the neutralino sector are discussed in detail .
We present our catalog of U , B , V , and I stellar photometry of the central 18 sq .	degree area of the Small Magellanic Cloud .
We present a passively mode-locked , tunable soliton Ho : fiber ring oscillator , optimized for seeding of Ho : YLF amplifiers .	The oscillator is independently tunable in central wavelength and spectral width from 2040 nm to 2070 nm and from 5 nm to 10 nm , respectively .
We give a detailed account and extensions of a holographic flavor superconductivity model which we have proposed recently .	The model has an explicit field theory realization as strongly coupled N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter at finite temperature and finite isospin chemical potential .
It establishes sums of squares polynomial representations characterizing robust solutions and exact SDP-relaxations of robust SOS-convex programs under various commonly used uncertainty sets .	In particular , the results show that the polytopic and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets , that allow second-order cone re-formulations of robust quadratically constrained programs , continue to permit exact SDP-relaxations for a broad class of robust SOS-convex programs .
Let $ V $ be a real finite dimensional representation of a compact Lie group $ G $ .	It is well-known that the algebra $ \mathbb R [ V ] ^G $ of $ G $ -invariant polynomials on $ V $ is finitely generated , say by $ \sigma_1 , ... , \sigma_p $ .
Sources with the largest near-IR magnification factors also tend to be the most compact , consistent with the size bias predicted from simulations and pre- vious lensing models for sub-millimeter galaxies .	For four new sources that also have high-resolution sub-mm maps , we test for differential lensing between the stellar and dust components and find that the 880 um magnification factor ( u_880 ) is ~1.5 times higher than the near-IR magnification factor ( u_NIR ) , on average .
Following a first study of the central regions of M32 that illustrated the power of integral-field spectroscopy ( IFS ) in detecting and measuring the [ O III ] { \lambda } 5007 emission of PNe against a strong stellar background , we turn to the very nuclear PN population of M31 , within 80 pc of its centre .	We show that PNe can also be found in the presence of emission from diffuse gas and further illustrate the excellent sensitivity of IFS in detecting extragalactic PNe through a comparison with narrowband images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope .
They further introduce a convolution diagram which conjecturally gives the tensor product multiplicity [ Braverman A. , Finkelberg M. , Private communication , 2008 ] .	In this paper , we develop the theory for the branching in quiver varieties and check this conjecture for $ G=\SL ( l ) $ .
We present the results of high-resolution optical spectroscopy , low-resolution near-IR spectroscopy and near-infrared speckle interferometry of the massive young stellar object candidate V645 Cyg , acquired to refine its fundamental parameters and the properties of its circumstellar envelope .	Speckle interferometry in the $ H $ - and $ K $ -bands and an optical spectrum in the range 5200 -- 6680 \AA with a spectral resolving power of $ R $ = 60 000 were obtained at the 6-m telescope of the Russian Academy of Sciences .
The role of the 4-form field in the theory of BPS branes in 5d is clarified .	We describe arguments suggesting that the effective 4d description of the universe in the ekpyrotic scenario ( hep-th/0103239 ) should lead to contraction rather than expansion of the universe .
Close to maximum power , the maximum gain in efficiency scales as a square root of relative loss in power and this scaling is universal for broad class of systems .	For the low-dissipation engines , we calculate the maximum gain in efficiency for an arbitrary fixed power .
Here we present a population synthesis study of the cooling sequence of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae .	In particular , we study the distribution of effective temperatures , the shape of the color-magnitude diagram , and the corresponding magnitude and color distributions .
One of the most interesting is its relation to the coordinate on the quantum moduli space $ u= & lt ; \tr \phi^2 & gt ; $ that results into recursion equations for the coefficients of the prepotential due to instantons .	In this work we show , with an explicit multi-instanton computation , that this relation holds true at arbitrary winding numbers .
Two important issues in quantum cosmology -- the problem of time and the role of boundary conditions -- are discussed at some length .	Finally , I discuss how classical spacetime can be recovered as an approximate notion .

In this paper we present this software infrastructure with its advantage and disadvantage .	The exercises are part of a software system named LOGOMON .
In this paper , we generalize the index notion for the nonlinear case .	One of the difficulties for nonlinear case , is its dependence on the exact solution which motivates us to give an important warning to whom want to solve DAEs using numerical methods such as Runge-Kutta , multistep or collocation methods .
We have measured the flux dependence of both real and imaginary conductance of $ GaAs/GaAlAs $ isolated mesoscopic rings at 310 MHz .	The rings are coupled to a highly sensitive electromagnetic superconducting micro-resonator and lead to a perturbation of the resonance frequency and quality factor .
We identify four dispersion relations : ion-Bernstein waves , oblique whistler waves , oblique Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron waves , and a zero-frequency mode .	The energy partition and frequency broadening are evaluated for these modes .
12 , used in this work as a comparison cluster .	From analysis of its CMD , we obtain estimates for the metallicity and reddening of ESO 121-SC03 : [ Fe/H ] = -0.97 +/- 0.10 and E ( V-I ) = 0.04 +/- 0.02 , in excellent agreement with previous studies .
Following Dyson 's analogy between the quantum field theory and the 19th-century chemistry-both explain how but not why-one could also establish an analogy between atomic physics and string theory .	Atomic physics was needed to answer the question why in chemistry , string theory is trying to answer the question why in the standard model .
We develop a consistent perturbation theory in quantum fluctuations around the classical evolution of a system of interacting bosons .	The zero order approximation gives the classical Gross-Pitaevskii equations .
Four-wave mixing ( 4WM ) is a known source of intense non-classical twin beams .	It can be generated when an intense laser beam ( the pump ) and a weak laser beam ( the seed ) overlap in a $ \chi^ { ( 3 ) } $ medium ( here cesium vapor ) , with frequencies close to resonance with atomic transitions .
These are the maps whose restriction to any triple of distinct points in $ \mathbb { D } $ yields interpolation data that are only just solvable .	We find a large class of such maps ; they are rational of degree at most 4 .
Construction of a color-magnitude diagram and isochrone fitting yields an age of tau = 100 000 000 yrs , a reddening E ( B-V ) = 0.1 and a distance modulus of 18.4 mag .	Our data covers the mass range 0.75 & lt ; m & lt ; 5.1 solar masses .
We show that an elastic description of the pinned Wigner crystal provides an excellent framework to obtain most of the physically relevant observables .	Using such a description , we compute the static and dynamical properties .
We make an extensive numerical study of a two dimensional nonconservative model proposed by Olami-Feder-Christensen to describe earthquake behavior .	By analyzing the distribution of earthquake sizes using a multiscaling method , we find evidence that the model is critical , with no characteristic length scale other than the system size , in agreement with previous results .
The resummation follows from the principal of maximum conformality ( PMC ) and assigns a unique scale for the running coupling at each perturbative order .	The final result is independent of the initial choices of renormalization scheme and scale , in accordance with the principles of the renormalization group , and thus eliminates an unnecessary source of systematic error in physical predictions .
The comments of Guseinov on our recent paper ( Czech.J .	Phys. , 52 ( 2002 ) 1297 ) have been analyzed critically .
Then we describe how networks are modeled to investigate problems related to network protocols .	Finally , we present some of the tools used to generate graph for representing practical networks .
We also assert that these formulas are the `` best possible '' , in that they do not hold in general for other highest weight modules in a very precise sense .	The proofs of the results in this note are included in an updated copy ( Version 3 ) of the paper arxiv:1301.1140 .
We present deep optical photometry of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) 041006 and its associated hypernova obtained over 65 days after detection ( 55 R-band epochs on 10 different nights ) .	Our early data ( t & lt ; 4 days ) joined with published GCN data indicates a steepening decay , approaching F_nu ~t^ { -0.6 } at early times ( & lt ; & lt ; 1 day ) and F_nu ~t^ { -1.3 } at late times .
In order to avoid the pitfalls of plug-in methods that estimate each sample density independently with respect to the Lebesgue measure , we make direct inference on the two distributions simultaneously from a joint prior , i.e. , the coupled binary partition prior .	Our prior leverages on the class of piecewise constant functions built upon binary partitions of the domain .
The Australia Telescope Compact Array ( ATCA ) was used to observe these sources with 2 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth from 1.1 to 3.1 GHz .	This allowed us to spectrally resolve the polarization structure of spatially unresolved radio sources , and by fitting various Faraday rotation models to the data , we conclusively demonstrate that two of the sources can not be described by a simple rotation measure ( RM ) component modified by depolarization from a foreground Faraday screen .
We consider relationship between the reflection coefficients of plane and rough surfaces for linearly polarized waves .	Certain polarization properties of reflected waves and polarization invariants , in particular at incident angle of forty five degrees , allow finding amplitude and phase characteristics of reflected waves .
In recent numerical simulations \citep { matsubayashi07 , lockmann08 } , it has been found that the eccentricity of supermassive black hole ( SMBH ) - intermediate black hole ( IMBH ) binaries grows toward unity through interactions with stellar background .	This increase of eccentricity reduces the merging timescale of the binary through the gravitational radiation to the value well below the Hubble Time .
Galactic magnetic arms have been observed between the gaseous arms of some spiral galaxies ; their origin remains unclear .	We suggest that magnetic spiral arms can be naturally generated in the interarm regions because the galactic fountain flow or wind is likely to be weaker there than in the arms .
We study the entanglement of families of Unruh modes in the Bell states $ |\Phi^\pm\rangle =1/\sqrt { 2 } ( |00\rangle\pm|11\rangle ) $ and $ |\Psi^\pm\rangle=1/\sqrt { 2 } ( |01\rangle\pm|10\rangle ) $ shared by two accelerated observers and find fundamental differences in the robustness of entanglement against acceleration for these states .	States $ \Psi^\pm $ are entangled for all finite accelerations , whereas , due to the Unruh effect , states $ \Phi^\pm $ lose their entanglement for finite accelerations .
Standard tests , in 1D plane parallel geometry and in the frame of the two-level atom model , with monochromatic scattering , are discussed .	Rates of convergence between the previously mentioned iterative schemes are compared , as well as their respective timing properties .
Here , we perform a theoretical and experimental investigation of the magnetoimpedance effect for the thin film geometry in a wide frequency range .	We calculate the longitudinal magnetoimpedance for single layered , multilayered or exchange biased systems from an approach that considers a magnetic permeability model for planar geometry and the appropriate magnetic free energy density for each structure .
Inconsistencies in the experimental $ B $ values are observed in both the isotopes from different experiments performed using the same techniques .	The present calculations are carried out using an all order relativistic many-body theory considering only single and double excitations in the coupled-cluster ansatz .
To this end , we study the clumps and cores appearing in the region of central collapse in a numerical simulation of the formation , evolution , and subsequent collapse of a dense cloud out of a transonic compression in the diffuse atomic ISM .	The clumps have sizes $ \sim 1 $ pc , masses of several hundred $ M_\odot $ , and three-dimensional velocity dispersions $ \sim 3 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ , in agreement with typical observed values for such structures .
New mass sum rules of remarkable accuracy are presented .	As shown in decuplet case , the approach accounts for effects highly nonlinear in SU ( 3 ) -breaking .
Van der Waals density functional theory is integrated with analysis of a non-redundant set of protein-DNA crystal structures from the Nucleic Acid Database to study the stacking energetics of CG : CG base-pair steps , specifically the role of cytosine 5-methylation .	Principal component analysis of the steps reveals the dominant collective motions to correspond to a tensile 'opening ' mode and two shear 'sliding ' and 'tearing ' modes in the orthogonal plane .
This is one of two papers in which we report the detection of structure in the cosmic infrared background ( CIB ) between 1.25 - 2.2 micron through the use of data from the Two Micron Sky Survey ( 2MASS ) .	This paper concentrates on data assembly , analysis and the estimate of the various foreground contributions ; the companion paper ( Kashlinsky , Odenwald , Mather , Skrutskie , Cutri 2002 , hereafter KOMSC ) presents the cosmological results for the CIB fluctuations and their implications .
A partial algebra construction of Gr\ '' atzer and Schmidt from `` Characterizations of congruence lattices of abstract algebras '' ( Acta Sci.Math .	( Szeged ) 24 ( 1963 ) , 34-59 ) is adapted to provide an alternative proof to a well-known fact that every finite distributive lattice is representable , seen as a special case of the Finite Lattice Representation Problem .
Every astrophysical object ( dark or not ) is a gravitational lens , as well as a receiver/observer of the light from sources lensed by other objects in its neighborhood .	For a given pair of source and lens , there is a thin on-axis tubelike volume behind the lens in which the radiation flux from the source is greatly increased due to gravitational lensing .
In this situation , the standard slow-roll approach used to determine the behavior of the primordial cosmological perturbations can not longer be used .	We present a generic method , based on the uniform approximation , to analytically derive the primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations .
In the interstellar medium atoms heavier then hydrogen which start the diffusive shock acceleration ( DSA ) are never fully ionized at the moment of injection .	We will show that electrons in the atomic shells are stripped during the acceleration process , when the atoms already move relativistically .
We analyze a series of numerical integrations , each involving the 4 migratory giant planets and 400 test particles distributed throughout trans-Neptunian space , to measure efficiencies of capture as functions of migration speed .	Snapshots of the spatial distribution of resonant KBOs reveal that Twotinos cluster +/- 75 degrees away from Neptune 's longitude , while Plutinos cluster +/- 90 degrees away .
A single-spin asymmetry in the azimuthal distribution of neutral pions relative to the lepton scattering plane has been measured for the first time in deep-inelastic scattering of positrons off longitudinally polarized protons .	The analysing power in the sin ( phi ) moment of the cross section is 0.019 +/- 0.007 ( stat . )
The work within the Geometrothermodynamics programme rests upon the metric structure for the thermodynamic phase-space .	Such structure exhibits discrete Legendre symmetry .
The associated dust polarization exhibits more complex structures than seen at lower angular resolution .	We analyze the inferred morphologies of the plane-of-sky magnetic field ( B_bot ) in the SMA1 to SMA4 cores and in the envelope using the SMA-Ext and SMA-SubC data .
The exact renormalization group ( RG ) fixed-point map and perturbation static expressions match the corresponding expressions for the dynamics of iterates .	The time evolution is universal in the RG sense and the non-extensive entropy $ S_ { Q } $ associated to the fixed-point map is maximum with respect to that of the other maps in its basin of attraction .
Inspired by the condensed matter analogues of black holes ( a.k.a .	dumb holes ) , we study Hawking radiation in the presence of a modified dispersion relation which becomes super-luminal at large wave-numbers .
The optical contrast $ C $ of a single graphene layer on any of those substrates is determined by calculating the optical properties of a two-dimensional metallic sheet on the surface of a dielectric , which yields values between $ C= $ ~- 1.5 % ( G/TiO $ _2 $ ) and $ C= $ ~- 8.8 % ( G/CaF $ _2 $ ) .	This contrast is in reasonable agreement with experimental data and is sufficient to make identification by an optical microscope possible .
The identification and analysis of bound objects , halos , is one of the most important steps in drawing useful physical information from simulations .	In the advent of larger and larger simulations , a reliable and parallel halo finder , able to cope with the ever-increasing data files , is a must .
During the later Paleolithic , technologies increase not only in terms of diversity but also in their complexity and interdependence .	As Mesoudi and O'Brien ( 2008 ) have shown , selection broadly favors social learning of information that is hierarchical and structured , and multiple studies have demonstrated that teaching within a social learning environment can increase fitness .
We derive the exact analytical result for the tunneling density of states in the case of arbitrary single-particle energy spectrum .	We find that , similar to the case of the isotropic exchange , the tunneling density of states as a function of energy has the maximum due to a finite value of the total spin of the ground state near the Stoner instability .
These systems arise in ergodic mean-field game theory , and describe Nash equilibria of games with a large number of agents aiming at aggregation .	We show how the dimension of the state space , the behavior of the coupling and the Hamiltonian at infinity affect the existence and non-existence of regular solutions .
The problem of SIC-POVM existence is formulated in terms of symbols of operators associated with a star-product quantization scheme .	We show that SIC-POVMs ( if they do exist ) must obey general rules of the star product , and , starting from this fact , we derive new relations on SIC-projectors .
The X-ray morphology is varied , but in general closely matches the radio structure until the first sharp radio bend .	In the sources with optical data as well as X-ray detections we rule out simple synchrotron models for X-ray emission , suggesting these systems may instead be dominated by inverse Compton ( IC ) scattering .
The daughter nuclei density distributions are folded with a realistic density dependent M3Y effective interaction supplemented by a zero-range pseudo-potential .	The density dependence parameters of the interaction are extracted from the nuclear matter calculations .
For all four fragments , we give characterizations in terms of rankers .	In particular , we generalize the notion of a ranker to infinite words in two possible ways .
We study parametrized field theories , which are a class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories without gravity .	We find that the Hamiltonian for parametrized field theories vanishes on shell even in the presence of a boundary and under a variety of boundary conditions .
Consider the category of g^-modules at the critical level , on which the action of the Iwahori subalgebra integrates to algebraic action of the Iwahori subgroup I .	We study the action on this category of the convolution functors with the `` central '' sheaves on the affine flag scheme G ( ( t ) ) /I .
At a mesoscopic level it respects an , again suitable adapted , version of the Lighthill-Whitham model , which belongs to the fluid-dynamical approach to the problem .	At a macroscopic level the model seems to display a continuous transition from a fluid phase to a jammed phase when varying the density of the spheres ( the amount of cars in a city-like scenario ) and a discontinuous jump when varying the connectivity of the underlying network .
Accurate solutions can be systematically derived by decomposing the exponential in a product form .	For time-reversible equations , such as the Hamilton or the Schr\ '' odinger equation , it is immaterial whether or not the decomposition coefficients are positive .
In this short article we characterize the critical behavior of Stavskaya 's PCA by means of Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis .	The critical exponents of the model are calculated and indicate that its phase transition belongs to the directed percolation universality class of critical behavior , as it would be expected on the basis of the directed percolation conjecture .
We study the set -- theoretic combinatorics underlying the following two algebraic phenomena .	( 1 ) A subgroup G leq Z^omega exhibits the Specker phenomenon iff every homomorphism G to Z maps almost all unit vectors to 0 .
We also establish a ( complex ) renormalization invariant relating these parameters .	The qualitative features of the physical parameters ' renormalization are clearly illustrated in vector field plots .
Bismuth chalcogenides Bi $ _2 $ Se $ _3 $ and Bi $ _2 $ Te $ _3 $ are semiconductors , which can be both thermoelectric materials ( TE ) and topological insulators ( TI ) .	Lattice defects arising from vacancies , impurities , or dopants in these materials are important in that they provide the charge carriers in TE applications and compromise the performance of these materials as TIs .
Under natural geometric assumptions on the cone points , we prove the existence of a logarithmic resonance-free region for the cut-off resolvent .	The estimate also applies to the exterior domains of non-trapping polygons via a doubling process .
In this short review article , we outline , using flavor-dependent sleptons as an example , how flavor can affect both searches for supersymmetry , and future measurements aimed at understanding the nature of any new discoveries .	If the production cross-sections for supersymmetry are relatively low , as indicated by the fact that it has not revealed itself yet in standard searches , the usual assumptions about the superpartner spectra need re-thinking .
The Schwarzschild metric and Kerr Metric of Einstein field equation shows that the spatial differential of time gauge is the gravity field .	For pure time displacement field , when its spatial differentials are commutative , conservative fields can be established .
Consequently , pre-MS clusters and their active stars are systematically older and more massive than often reported .	Cluster ages derived with the lithium depletion boundary technique are erroneously young by $ \sim 15 $ % and $ 10 $ % at $ 30 $ and $ 100 $ Myr respectively , if 50 % spotted stars are interpreted with un-spotted models .
The publicly available EIS-DEEP optical-NIR data for the AXAF ( Chandra ) Deep Field have been used to construct samples of Extremely Red Objects ( EROs ) using various single-band and multi-band color criteria .	In this work we define as EROs objects with colors consistent with passively evolving elliptical galaxies at z $ \geq $ 1 .
While the former is classically related to the reference configuration , magnetization is defined in the deformed configuration instead .	We discuss the existence of energy minimizers without relying on higher-order deformation gradient terms .
We establish two-sided estimates for the transition densities of such processes in $ C^ { 1 , \eta } $ open sets when $ \eta \in ( \alpha/2 , 1 ] $ .	In particular , our result includes ( relativistic ) symmetric stable processes and finite-range stable processes in $ C^ { 1 , \eta } $ open sets when $ \eta \in ( \alpha/2 , 1 ] $ .
The tracking error is measured using the recently proposed OSPA metric for tracks , adopted as the only known mathematically rigorous metric for measuring the distance between two sets of tracks .	A comparative analysis is presented under various conditions .
For $ \gamma=1 $ , we obtain new models which flow in the infrared to 2d N= ( 4,4 ) conformal models and we show that the classical moduli spaces are given by intersecting cotangent weighted complex projective spaces containing the small instanton singularity , discussed in [ 17 ] , as a leading special case .	We also make comments regarding the d $ 2d N=4 conformal Liouville description of the Higgs branch throat by following the analysis of [ 18 ] .
For the innermost radius of this calorimeter , radiation doses at shower-max are expected to reach 100 MRad per year , primarily due to minimum-ionizing electrons and positrons that arise in the induced electromagnetic showers of e+e- `beamstrahlung ' pairs produced in the ILC beam-beam interaction .	However , radiation damage to calorimeter sensors may be dominated by hadrons induced by nuclear interactions of shower photons , which are much more likely to contribute to the non-ionizing energy loss that has been observed to damage sensors exposed to hadronic radiation .
The weighted $ L^2 $ setting allows us to cover some singular cases , such as optimal stopping for stochastic equations with degenerate diffusion coefficient .	As an application of the theory , we consider the pricing of American-style contingent claims .
His model assumes that there is a finite-state Markov process X that drives the economy in discrete time .	Many authors extended his model to a continuous-time setting with a Markov diffusion process X with state space R. Unfortunately , the continuous-time model fails to recover an objective measure from a risk-neutral measure .
We show that , ( 1 ) due to its growth in time this network displays a scale-free feature in that the probability of the number of links at a node obeys a power-law distribution , and ( 2 ) as a result of performance optimization of the program the network has a small-world structure .	We believe that these features are generic for large computer programs .
We find that both the ghost propagator and the Coulomb potential are insensitive to the Gribov problem or the details of the residual gauge fixing , even if the Coulomb potential is evaluated from the A0 -- propagator instead of the Coulomb kernel .	In particular , no signs of scaling violations could be found in either quantity , at least to well below the numerical accuracy where these violations were visible for the gluon propagator .
We study the class of nearest neighbor Z^d shifts of finite type which have topological entropy very close to this maximum , and show that they have many useful properties .	Specifically , we prove that for any d , there exists beta_d such that for any nearest neighbor Z^d shift of finite type X with alphabet A for which log |A| - h ( X ) & lt ; beta_d , X has a unique measure of maximal entropy .
Applications of muon pair production process in electromagnetic showers to the very high energy gamma-ray astronomy is discussed .	It is shown that , although this process dominates over conventional pion and kaon decay above a few TeV in photon-initiated showers and provides a distinctive signature of photon-induced event ( muon pair ) , it is practically impossible to discriminate such events statistically from the background of muon pairs produced in the hadronic EAS .
It discusses key ideas that lead to the definition of MSP fields and how moduli of stable maps to the quintic and that of 5-spin curves appear in the moduli of MSP fields .	It also explains some properties of the moduli of MSP fields such as the cosection localisation , the properness of the degeneracy locus , and a torus action on the moduli..
Network inference approaches are widely used to shed light on regulatory interplay between molecular players such as genes and proteins .	Biochemical processes underlying networks of interest ( e.g.gene regulatory or protein signalling networks ) are generally nonlinear .
Here , for the first time , we propose and experimentally demonstrated bilayer structure to achieve simultaneously independent manipulation of multi-physics field ( dc electric fields and thermal ) by directly solving the dc electric/ thermal field equations .	This structure is composed of two layers : the outer layer is made of isotropic and homogeneous material , while the inner layer is fan-shape layer .
This is a fundamental issue in many queueing systems , including crowdsourcing systems and wireless networks .	We consider a system with multiple queues and servers , where the servers have queue-dependent , but unknown , service rates .
The effects of measurement non-ideality are also investigated .	Our findings have important implications for precision local electrical measurements .
We propose a technique for engineering momentum-dependent dissipation in Bose-Einstein condensates with non-local interactions .	The scheme relies on the use of momentum-dependent dark-states in close analogy to velocity-selective coherent population trapping .
Here we show that it is possible to choose a suitable variable such that all the data can be fitted by the same Tsallis distribution ( with the same , energy independent value of the q-parameter ) .	Thus they exhibit q-scaling .
We consider the cotangent bundle $ T^*F_\lambda $ of a $ GL_n $ partial flag variety , $ \lambda= ( \lambda_1 , ... , \lambda_N ) $ , $ |\lambda|=\sum_i\lambda_i=n $ , and the torus $ T= ( \C^\times ) ^ { n+1 } $ equivariant K-theory algebra $ K_T ( T^*F_\lambda ) $ .	We introduce K-theoretic stable envelope maps $ \Stab_ { \sigma } : \oplus_ { |\lambda|=n } K_T ( ( T^*F_\lambda ) ^T ) \to\oplus_ { |\lambda|=n } K_T ( T^*F_\lambda ) $ , where $ \sigma\in S_n $ .
As a pivot model , we assume that the spectrum of the primordial perturbations depends also on their directionality ( rather than just on the magnitude of their momentum , as in the standard case ) .	We explicitly compute the correlation matrix for the temperature anisotropies in the simpler case in which there is a residual isotropy between two spatial directions .
The data archive is now sufficiently large that it can be used to investigate instrumental properties and the variability of astronomical sources .	This paper describes the automated calibration and reduction scheme used to process the archive data with particular emphasis on `jiggle-map ' observations of compact sources .
Many Active Galactic Nuclei ( AGN ) are surrounded by gas which absorbs the radiation produced by accretion onto the central black hole and obscures the nucleus from direct view .	The dust component of the gas greatly enhances the effect of radiation pressure above that for Thomson scattering so that an AGN which is sub-Eddington for ionized gas in the usual sense can appear super-Eddington for cold dusty gas .
Our results reveal that although this property of TD does not shows up for pure states and for some particular classes of mixed states , it is present in a non-negligible fraction of the regarded density operators .	Hence , even though the percentage of quartets of states leading to the NMuTP drawback of TD and its strength decrease as the system 's dimension grows , this property of TD must be taken into account before using it as a figure of merit for distinguishing mixed quantum states .
Context .	Observations of cataclysmic variables in globular clusters appear to show a dearth of outbursts compared to those observed in the field .
We give criteria which specify exactly when A has real rank zero , and exactly when A has the Property ( SP ) : every nonzero hereditary subalgebra of A contains a nonzero projection .	Specifically , A has real rank zero if and only if the natural map from K_0 ( A ) to the continuous affine functions on the tracial state space has dense range , A has the Property ( SP ) if and only if the range of this map contains strictly positive functions with arbitrarily small norm .
We implement a new algorithm for listing all maximal cliques in sparse graphs due to Eppstein , L\ '' offler , and Strash ( ISAAC 2010 ) and analyze its performance on a large corpus of real-world graphs .	Our analysis shows that this algorithm is the first to offer a practical solution to listing all maximal cliques in large sparse graphs .
studied the Raman spectra of misoriented bilayer graphene .	They found that the blueshift of 2D band of misoriented graphene relative to that of single layer graphene shows a strong dependence on the excitation laser energy .
As a consequence , the authors obtain the Fefferman-Stein decomposition of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $ \dot { F } ^0_ { \infty , \ , q ' } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ .	Finally , the authors give an explicit example to show that $ \dot { F } ^0_ { 1 , \ , q } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ is strictly contained in $ \mathrm { WE } ^ { 1 , \ , q } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ and , by duality , $ \mathrm { WE } ^ { \infty , \ , q ' } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ is strictly contained in $ \dot { F } ^0_ { \infty , \ , q ' } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ .

The critical boundary separating these phases is calculated on the parameter space of the system , given by the intensity of the mass media influence and the number of options per cultural attribute .	Counterintuitively , mass media can induce cultural diversity when its intensity is above some threshold value .
This paper considers the scenario of an intended multi-input single-output channel overheard by multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers .	Specifically , we address the transmit covariance optimization for secrecy-rate maximization ( SRM ) of that scenario .
Magnetic clouds ( MCs ) are `` magnetized plasma clouds '' moving in the solar wind .	MCs transport magnetic flux and helicity away from the Sun .
We prove these by applying a recent version of converse theorems of Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro to analytic properties of certain $ L $ -functions obtained from the method of Eisenstein series ( Langlands-Shahidi method ) .	As a consequence , we prove the bound 5/34 for Hecke eigenvalues of Maass forms over any number field and at every place , finite or infinite , breaking the crucial bound 1/6 ( see below and Section 7 and 8 ) towards Ramanujan-Petersson and Selberg conjectures for $ GL_2 $ .
We study the meson mass inequality quantitatively and define a susceptibility which allows us to systematically analyze the inequality .	In the generalized Gross-Neveu model limit , we derive an analytic expression for this susceptibility .
The scattering transformation developed by Mallat is put into the perspective of field theory .	It is shown to be a simultaneous transformation of the field and the `` time '' parameter explicitly used in the definition of path integrals central to the Lagrangian approach and in the definition of the `` time '' ordered products used in the Hamiltonian ( or canonical ) approach .
We discuss the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra for the superstring sigma-model on AdS_5 x S^5 .	We find the canonical su ( 2|2 ) ^2 invariant S-matrix satisfying the standard Yang-Baxter and crossing symmetry equations .
Software architecture is defined as the process of a well-structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements , as well as improving the quality attributes of the system such as readability , Reliability , maintainability , and performance .	It involves a series of design decisions that can have a considerable impact on the systems quality attributes , and on the overall success of the application .
When isolating the trion state , we observed changes in the Raman A1g intensity and an enhanced feature on the low energy side of the E12g peak .	Photoluminescence and optical reflectivity measurements confirm the existence of the prepared trion state .
Plasmonics has established itself as a branch of physics which promises to revolutionize data processing , improve photovoltaics , increase sensitivity of bio-detection .	A widespread use of plasmonic devices is notably hindered ( in addition to high losses ) by the absence of stable and inexpensive metal films suitable for plasmonic applications .
These equations form the basis for future systematic tests of alternative gravity theories .	Our treatment is covariant and generalizes the classic Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon result for spinning ( extended ) test bodies .
In most cases this HI is distributed in large ( up to 190 kpc ) and massive ( up to M ( HI ) ~ 10^10 M ( sun ) ) disk- or ring-like structures , that show fairly regular rotation around the host galaxy .	This suggests that in these systems a major merger did occur , but at least several Gyr ago .
It is found that when heavily squashed , the DWNT will become an insulator-coated metallic wire , and the conductance near the Fermi level has been significantly changed by the radial squash .	Specially , several resonance conductance peaks appear at some energies in the conduction band of the squashed DWNT IMJ .
No direct cosmological observables are normally traceable to this period of reheating .	Indirect bounds can however be derived .
The search yields 100 z~3 ( U-dropout ) QSO candidates with 19 & lt ; r ' & lt ; 22 over 11.7 deg^2 in the ELAIS-N1 ( EN1 ) and ELAIS-N2 ( EN2 ) fields of the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic ( SWIRE ) Legacy Survey .	The z~3 selection is reliable , with spectroscopic follow-up of 10 candidates confirming they are all QSOs at 2.83 & lt ; z & lt ; 3.44 .
It is found that the combination of the models put into use here capture modestly well the trends of the data on some important observables .	Some limitations of the approach would also be pointed out in the end .
We additionally show how our new procedure can be used to identify the components where non-stationarities occur and indicate possible extensions of this innovative approach .	We conclude with an extensive simulation study , which shows finite sample properties of the new method and contains a comparison with existing approaches .
The larger-than-nucleon masses of the two heavy quarks allow for a more reliable application of the Born-Oppenheimer-like approximation of the LAMP .	With the absence of quark-level Pauli Exclusion Principle repulsive effects , the appearance of a bound state is unsurprising .

Such behavioral equivalences are cast in a hierarchy , which is helpful to verify behavioral equivalence of two agents .

We determined the spatial orientation of the Algol AB close pair orbital plane using optical interferometry with the CHARA Array , and radio interferometry with the European VLBI Network ( EVN ) .	We found the longitude of the line of nodes for the close pair being $ \Omega_1=48\deg\pm2\deg $ and the mutual inclination of the orbital planes of the close and the wide pairs being $ 95\deg\pm3\deg $ .
Yukawa potentials may be long ranged when the Debye screening length is large .	In computer simulations , such long ranged potentials have to be taken into account with convenient algorithms to avoid systematic bias in the sampling of the phase space .
Eighteen stars have been discovered in the Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg H-Alpha ( MASH ) PN survey sample , and we have also uncovered 14 confirmed and candidate [ WR ] s and WELS among the CSPNe of previously known PNe .	Spectral classifications have been undertaken using both the Acker & amp ; Neiner and Crowther , De Marco & amp ; Barlow schemes .
These two methods differ in the order in which optimization and passage to the limit are performed .	When optimizing first , the asymptotic problem is usually referred to as a mean-field game .
Recently , Sherstov \cite { She09b } and independently Shi-Zhu \cite { SZ09b } developed conditions on the inner function $ g $ which imply that the quantum communication complexity of $ f \comp g^n $ is at least the approximate polynomial degree of $ f $ .	We generalize both of these frameworks .
Specifically , we use the union of a novel type of simple volume primitives , which are spheres and the convex hulls of two or three spheres , to approximate a given 3D shape .	We compute such a volume approximation based on a new method for medial axis simplification guided by Hausdorff errors .
The cold dark matter ( CDM ) cosmology , which is the standard theory of the structure formation in the universe , predicts that the outer density profile of dark matter halos decreases with the cube of distance from the center .	However , so far not much effort has examined this hypothesis .
The repulsive Coulomb force poses severe challenges when describing $ ( d , p ) $ reactions for highly charged nuclei as a three-body problem .	Casting Faddeev-AGS equations in a Coulomb basis avoids introducing screening of the Coulomb force .
45 ( 2012 ) , 405301 , 13 pages ] have given a number of distinct sets of three-qubit observables , each furnishing a proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem .	Here it is demonstrated that two of these sets/configurations , namely the $ 18_ { 2 } - 12_ { 3 } $ and $ 2_ { 4 } 14_ { 2 } - 4_ { 3 } 6_ { 4 } $ ones , can uniquely be extended into geometric hyperplanes of the split Cayley hexagon of order two , namely into those of types $ { \cal V } _ { 22 } ( 37 ; 0 , 12 , 15 , 10 ) $ and $ { \cal V } _ { 4 } ( 49 ; 0 , 0 , 21 , 28 ) $ in the classification of Frohardt and Johnson [ Comm .
The performance of cloud radio access network ( C-RAN ) is constrained by the limited fronthaul link capacity under future heavy data traffic .	To tackle this problem , extensive efforts have been devoted to design efficient signal quantization/compression techniques in the fronthaul to maximize the network throughput .
The width of $ P $ is defined as $ w ( P ) =min\ { x\in \mathbb { Z } ^n\setminus\ { 0\ } : \ : max_ { x \in P } x^\top u - min_ { x \in P } x^\top v \ } $ .	Let $ \Delta ( A ) $ and $ \delta ( A ) $ denote the greatest and the smallest absolute values of a determinant among all $ r ( A ) \times r ( A ) $ sub-matrices of $ A $ , where $ r ( A ) $ is the rank of a matrix $ A $ .
We introduce quantum information engines that extract work from quantum states and a single thermal reservoir .	They may operate under three general conditions : i/ Unitarily Steered evolution ( US ) ; ii/ Irreversible Thermalization ( IT ) and iii/ Isothermal Relaxation ( IR ) , and hence are called USITIR machines .
We propose a new model which explains the recent acceleration and the past deceleration .	Furthermore , the new model also gives a decelerated universe in the future .
By introducing a certain positive harmonic function $ h $ in $ U $ , related to harmonic measure , we are able to give the first detailed description of this dynamical behaviour .	Using this new technique , we show that , for sufficiently large $ n $ , the image domains $ U_n=f^n ( U ) $ contain large annuli , $ C_n $ , and that the union of these annuli acts as an absorbing set for the iterates of $ f $ in $ U $ .
Phys. , v. 52 , p. 082303 ( 2011 ) ) , the Dirac equation in an arbitrary electromagnetic field was shown to be generally equivalent to a fourth-order equation for just one component of the four-component Dirac spinor function .	This was done for a specific ( chiral ) representation of gamma-matrices and for a specific component .
In this paper the shape of such droplets is investigated within the spherical model of a lattice gas .	We show that in this case the droplet boundary is always diffusive , as opposed to sharp , and find the corresponding density profiles ( droplet shapes ) .
There are many different formulations of relativistic elasticity .	Most of them are only concerned with formal questions rather than questions regarding the PDE point of view .
We also establish the monotonicity of the front and , in the bistable case , its behavior at infinity .	In contrast with the classical bistable interior reaction model , its behavior at the side of the invading state is of power type , while at the side of the invaded state its decay is exponential .
Second , we apply a hierarchical clustering method .	The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a specific application area , and works across application area boundaries .
Extending the analysis of hep-th/0504128 , we obtain a formal expression for the coupling between brane matter and the radion in a Randall-Sundrum braneworld .	This effective theory is correct to all orders in derivatives of the radion in the limit of small brane separation , and , in particular , contains no higher than second derivatives .
We study the warm-tachyon inflationary universe model with viscous pressure in high-dissipation regime .	General conditions which are required for this model to be realizable are derived in the slow-roll approximation .
This feature of the transmission line can be used to perform phase matching in a degenerate four-wave mixing process which can be utilized for parametric amplification of a weak signal in the presence of a strong pump .	Numerical simulations of the TWPA design have shown that with tuning , phase matching can be achieved and an exponential gain as a function of the transmission line length can be realized .
In addition we show that the axial U ( 1 ) anomaly becomes invisible in susceptibilities of scalar and pseudo scalar mesons , suggesting that the 2nd order chiral phase transition with the O ( 4 ) scaling is not realized in 2 flavor QCD .	Possible lattice artifacts when non-chiral lattice Dirac operator is employed are briefly discussed .
Presently , the metric of arbitrarily shaped , rotating , oscillating and arbitrarily moving N bodies of finite extension is only known for the case of slowly moving bodies in the post-Newtonian approximation , while the post-Minkowskian metric for arbitrarily moving celestial objects is known only for pointlike bodies with mass-monopoles and spin-dipoles .	As one more step towards the aim of a global metric for a system of N arbitrarily shaped and arbitrarily moving massive bodies in post-Minkowskian approximation , two central issues are on the scope of our investigation : ( i ) We first consider one extended body with full multipole structure in uniform motion in some suitably chosen global reference system .
Using the mentioned estimate we show that , unlike the Hofer norm , the spectral norm is C^0-continuous on surfaces .	We also present applications of the above results to the theory of Calabi quasimorphisms and improve a result of Entov , Polterovich and Py .
However , state-of-the-art methods to estimate occupancy and classify activity require infrastructure and/or wearable sensors which suffers from lower acceptability due to higher cost .	Encouragingly , with the advancement of the smartphones , these are becoming more achievable .
Algorithms combining soft thresholding with gradient descent are proposed for minimizing this new functional .	Numerical tests validate our approach .
Until now , this has been difficult to investigate on a large scale , but the huge volume of data available from online location-based social services now makes it possible to examine the friendships and mobility of many thousands of people , and to investigate the relationship between meetings at places and the structure of the social network .	In this paper , we analyze a large dataset from Foursquare , the most popular online location-based social network .
For small values of alpha , the function is close to exponential for all times , irrespective of beta .	The function is also close to an exponential when beta is near unity , irrespective of alpha .
Here we explore the orbital evolution of planets around binaries undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism .	We show that planets may survive and become misaligned from their host binary , or may develop erratic behavior in eccentricity , resulting in their consumption by the stars or ejection from the system as the binary decays .
The composition of ultra-high energy ( UHE ) cosmic rays E & gt ; 10^17 eV is still unknown .	The observation of UHE photons would extend the observed electromagnetic spectrum to highest energy and open a new channel for multimessenger observations in the universe .
The theory is quantized a la spin-foam by implementing the analogue of the simplicial constraints for the broken phase of the Spin ( 4 ) SO ( 4 ) symmetry .	A natural 4D extension of the theory is shown .
A complete optical multi-color afterglow light curve of XRF020903 obtained from archived data and photometric results in literature showed an achromatic brightening around 0.7 days .	An off-axis jet model with a large observing angle ( 0.21 rad , which is twice the jet opening half-angle , $ \theta_ { jet } $ ) can naturally describe the achromatic brightening and the prompt X-ray spectral properties .
We find that one of the hole-like Fermi surfaces is missing around the Gamma point compared to the case of LaFeAsO .	Analysis using the maximally-localized-Wannier-function technique indicates that the xy orbital becomes more localized as the As-Fe-As angle decreases .
From the absorption dichroism spectra measured in the azo-dye films that are prepared from the azo-dye derivative with polymerizable terminal groups ( SDA-2 ) we obtain dependence of the dichroic ratio on the irradiation dose .	We also measure the polar and azimuthal anchoring strengths in nematic liquid crystal ( NLC ) cells aligned by the azo-dye films and derive the anchoring strengths as functions of the dichroic ratio .
We study the optimization of nonperturbative renormalization group equations truncated both in fields and derivatives .	On the example of the Ising model in three dimensions , we show that the Principle of Minimal Sensitivity can be unambiguously implemented at order $ \partial^2 $ of the derivative expansion .
The main ones are the ocurrence of aliases and the additional bodies - the planets f and g - announced in Vogt et al.2010 .	Any dynamical study of exoplanets requires the good knowledge of the orbital elements and the investigations involving the planet g are particularly interesting , since this body would lie in the Habitable Zone ( HZ ) of the star GJ581 .
We compute the trace of the Polyakov loop and its two-point correlator near the transition .	We find a behavior similar to the one observed near the thermal deconfinement transition in the corresponding pure Yang-Mills ( YM ) theory in lattice studies ( whenever available ) .
From the molecular Hamiltonian , using and discussing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation , we arrive to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations for the electronic problem .	Special emphasis is placed in the most relevant mathematical aspects of the theoretical derivation of the final equations , as well as in the results regarding the existence and uniqueness of their solutions .
Anomalies can be viewed as arising from the cohomology of the Lie algebra of the group of gauge transformations and also from the topological cohomology of the group of connections modulo gauge transformations .	We show how these two approaches are unified by the transgression map .
We study implications of N=4 superconformal symmetry in three dimensions , thus extending our earlier results in arXiv:1503.04961 devoted to the N=1,2,3 cases .	We show that the three-point function of the supercurrent in N=4 superconformal field theories contains two linearly independent forms .
By using the above information theoretic observables it is possible to detect changes in the spatial structure of the ground states as the critical point is approached .	It is further possible to quantify the scaling behavior of the information theoretic observables in the vicinity of the critical point .
Propagating star formation can however occur as expanding shells collide , enhancing the density and triggering new cloud and star formation .	By controlling the momentum injection per massive star and the specific star formation rate in dense gas , we find that the negative effects of high turbulence outweigh the positive ones , and in net feedback reduces the fraction of dense gas and thus the overall star formation rate .
secure multi-party computation is widely studied area in computer science .	It is touching all most every aspect of human life .
We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of the core of IC 2497 , the galaxy associated with Hanny 's Voorwerp and hosting a fading AGN .	We find extended soft X-ray emission from hot gas around the low intrinsic luminosity ( unobscured ) AGN ( $ L_ { \rm bol } \sim 10^ { 42 } -10^ { 44 } $ erg s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) .
Here it is developped such a reinvestigation starting with a revaluation of the main elements of TIHR .	So one finds that all the respective elements are troubled by insurmountable defects .
Aim of this work is to calculate explicitly the result of the experiment of superposition of a mirror in the Michelson photon cavities interferometric device proposed by Marshall , Simon , Penrose and Bownmeester , as expected within a recently proposed model of non-unitary self-gravity inducing localization .	As for other proposals of modifications of Quantum Mechanics in a non-unitary sense , aimed to account for both unitary evolution and irreversible collapse , like in the famous Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber and Pearle 's models , it turns out that , for the experimental parameters proposed , no effect is detectable at all .
We interpret it as HI Lyman break at z = 2.067+/-0.025 indicating the presence of a cloud with a HI column density log ( HI ) & gt ; 18 on the line-of-sight to the OT .	This value is conservatively a lower limit to the GRB redshift .
When the flow field effectively escorts the system along a near-equilibrium path , the free energy estimate converges efficiently and accurately .	We illustrate our method on a model system , and discuss the general applicability of our approach .

We study the response of isovector orbital magnetic dipole ( IOMD ) transitions to the quadrupole-quadrupole ( $ Q \cdot Q $ ) interaction , to the isospin-conserving pairing interaction ( ICP ) and to combinations of both .	We find qualitatively different behaviours for transitions in which the final isospin differs from the initial isospin versus cases where the two isospins are the same .
We demonstrate a high-frequency generator operating at ~200GHz based on flipping a semifluxon in a Josephson junction of moderate normalized length .	The semifluxon spontaneously appears at the $ \pi $ discontinuity of the Josephson phase artificially created by means of two tiny current injectors .
A class of homogeneous isotropic space-time models including pseudo-Euclidean space as a special case is considered .	Such a model is chosen , where the particle motion is described in the most adequate way .
Here , we analyze an alternative decomposition , which conserves SU ( 2 ) spin invariance , but requires the use of complex numbers .	We show that this algorithm gets rid of the very large fluctuations observed in imaginary time displaced correlation functions of quantities which do not commute with the z-component of the total spin .
At infinite N the theory is solved exactly .	The phases and phase transitions are worked out for finite and infinite short-distance cutoffs .
A numerical evaluation of the perturbation sum using bound states up to n=200 yields ground state tensor polarizabilities which are in good agreement with experimental values , thereby bridging the 40-year-old gap between experiments and theory .	We have further found that the tensor polarizabilities of the two ground state hyperfine manifolds have opposite signs , in disagreement with an earlier derivation .
We report on observations of CO ( 1-0 ) emission from the chemically young starburst galaxy Mrk 109 .	These observations were part of a study to constrain the O2/CO ratio in metal-deficient galaxies , which were motivated by theoretical work that suggests the possible enhancement of the O2/CO ratio in chemically young systems .
The calculated defect free energy of formation is remarkably low , consistent with the high defect concentrations reported experimentally .	A dynamic structural instability is identified for certain higher defect concentrations .
For YbIr2Si2 and YbRh2Si2 , renormalized band calculations yield two bands of opposite character .	In YbRh2Si2 these two bands almost compensate each other .
In order to describe this evolution we use a method developed in Stepinski and Valageas which , using a series of simplifying assumptions , is able to simultaneously follow the evolution of gas and solid particles for up to $ 10^7 { \rm yr } $ .	Then , the distribution of planetesimals obtained after $ 10^7 { \rm yr } $ is used to study the migration rate of a giant planet through the migration model introduced in \cite { DP1 } .
Lattice simulations have demonstrated that a background ( electro ) magnetic field reduces the chiral/deconfinement transition temperature of quantum chromodynamics for eB & lt ; 1 GeV^2 .	On the level of observables , this reduction manifests itself in an enhancement of the Polyakov loop and in a suppression of the light quark condensates ( inverse magnetic catalysis ) in the transition region .
It mainly depends on the observations and it is free of uncertainties in neutrino flux , interaction cross section etc .	In this paper we demonstrate that the method is sensitive to a region of oscillation parameter space that explains all the features of atmospheric neutrino data in the Super-Kamiokande detector ; the limiting factor being the statistical strength of the KGF observations .
In quantum gravity theories Planckian behavior is triggered by the energy of { \it elementary } particles approaching the Planck energy , $ E_P $ , but it 's also possible that anomalous behavior strikes systems of particles with total energy near $ E_P $ .	This is usually perceived to be pathological and has been labelled `` the soccer ball problem '' .
This completes previous works of other authors that have studied the same configurations .	The solutions depend on the coupling constant alpha of the ( partial_i ln N ) ^2 term .
The proof is based on a representation of surfaces in 4-space by marked graphs , links with double intersections in 3-space .	We construct a finitely presented semigroup whose central elements uniquely encode all isotopy classes of 2-dimensional links .
We explore the physically motivated conditions that give rise to the observed steep disc-reflection emissivity profiles .	We perform a set of simulations based on the configuration of a possible future high-resolution X-ray mission .
We present the electroweak and flavour structure of a model with a warped extra dimension and the bulk gauge group SU ( 3 ) x SU ( 2 ) _L x SU ( 2 ) _R x P_LR x U ( 1 ) _X .	The presence of SU ( 2 ) _R implies an unbroken custodial symmetry in the Higgs system allowing to eliminate large contributions to the T parameter , whereas the P_LR symmetry and the enlarged fermion representations provide a custodial symmetry for flavour diagonal and flavour changing couplings of the SM Z boson to left-handed down-type quarks .
This is very different from the behavior in continuum .	Bragg scattering and coupling between angular and radial motion are believed to make this stability possible .
For each channel , we take into account of the interaction between the external particle and every possible charmed baryon in the triplet , sextet , and excited sextet .	We use dimensional regularization and modified minimal subtraction to get rid of the divergences in the loop-diagram corrections .

Our Monte Carlo simulations find a ground state entropy intermediate to that of spin ice on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices , suggesting that trillium spin ice is highly frustrated .	To motivate the search for trillium spin ice , we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and structure factor .
We study the effects of hard core ( HC ) interactions between different species of particles on two-species branching annihilating random walks with one offspring ( BAW $ _2 $ ( 1 ) ) .	The single-species model belongs to the directed percolation ( DP ) universality class .
In 2007 , F { \ '' u } rer proved that there exists $ K\textgreater { } 1 $ and an algorithm performing thisoperation in $ O ( n \cdot \log n \cdot K^ { \log^* n } ) $ .	Recent work by Harvey , van der Hoeven , and Lecerf showed that this complexity estimate can be improved in order to get $ K=8 $ , andconjecturally $ K=4 $ .
In this paper we provide a detailed convergence analysis for an unconditionally energy stable , second-order accurate convex splitting scheme for the Modified Phase Field Crystal equation , a generalized damped wave equation for which the usual Phase Field Crystal equation is a special degenerate case .	The fully discrete , fully second-order finite difference scheme in question was derived in a recent work [ 2 ] .
We show that as a result of this qualitative difference from single-layer graphene , short-range ( or screened Coulomb ) interactions are marginally relevant .	We use renormalization group to study their effects on low-energy properties of the system , and show that the two quadratic Fermi points spontaneously split into four Dirac points , at zero temperature .
We analyse the kinematics of disc stars observed by the RAVE survey in and beyond the Solar neighbourhood.We detect significant overdensities in the velocity distributions using a technique based on the wavelet transform.We find that the main local kinematic groups are large scale features , surviving at least up to ~1 kpc from the Sun in the direction of anti-rotation , and also at ~700 pc below the Galactic plane.We also find that for regions located at different radii than the Sun , the known groups appear shifted in the velocity plane .	For example , the Hercules group has a larger azimuthal velocity for regions inside the Solar circle and a lower value outside .
My thesis deals with a fundamental question of high energy gamma-ray astronomy .	Namely , I studied the cut-off shape of the Crab pulsar spectrum to distinguish between the leading scenarios for the pulsar models .
We also find that , when expressed in units of the dynamical length scale of the theory , the dimensionful coupling g^2 is proportional to 1/N at large N. We confirm that these theories are indeed confining in the limit N \to \infty .	We describe preliminary calculations in 3+1 dimensions which indicate that the same will be true there .
However , there is not a clear agreement about where the boundaries between regions are , and where exactly the utilization knee is located .	An open debate about knees in performance curves was undertaken at least 20 years ago .
The aim is to have a parton shower algorithm for which the full analytic form of the probability distribution for all branchings is known .	For these parton shower algorithms it is therefore possible to calculate the probability for a given event to be generated , providing the potential to reweight the event after the simulation .
We present the spectrophotometric properties of a sample of 141 emission-line galaxies at redshifts in the range $ 0.2 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.0 $ with a peak around $ z\in [ 0.2,0.4 ] $ .	The analysis is based on medium resolution ( $ R\_ { \mathrm { s } } =500-600 $ ) , optical spectra obtained at VLT and Keck .
The equivariant gauge fixing introduces constant ghost fields as moduli of the model .	We study the parameter- and moduli- space perturbatively .
Here we include beneficial mutations and obtain exact expressions for the frequency distribution at all times using an eigenfunction expansion method .	We find that the stationary distribution is non-Poissonian and related to the Bessel function of the first kind .
Fast Congestion Notification ( FN ) is one of the proactive queue management mechanisms that practices congestion avoidance to help avoid the beginning of congestion by marking or dropping packets before the routers queue gets full ; and exercises congestion control , when congestion avoidance fails , by increasing the rate of packet marking or dropping .	Technically , FN avoids the queue overflows by controlling the instantaneous queue size below the optimal queue size , and control congestion by keeping the average arrival rate close to the outgoing link capacity .
The agents are initially randomly distributed according to a certain proportion $ \rho_c ( 0 ) $ of cooperators .	Each agent does not have memory of previous behaviors and plays the PD with eight nearest neighbors and then copies the behavior of who had the greatest payoff for next generation .
In January 22 , 2002 , KamLAND started the data-taking .	The KamLAND detector is a complicated system which consists of liquid scintillator , buffer oil , spherical balloon and so on .
Structural and electronic properties of the alpha- and gamma-phases of cerium sesquisulfide , Ce2S3 , are examined by first-principles calculations using the GGA+U extension of density functional theory .	The strongly correlated f-electrons of Ce are described by a Hubbard-type on-site Coulomb repulsion parameter .
The data are compared with calculations based on the distorted wave impulse approximation ( DWIA ) using shell-model wave functions .	Significant differences between the experimental and theoretical results are observed for all three spin-dependent $ ID_i $ at momentum transfers of $ q \gtrsim 0.5 { \rm fm } ^ { -1 } $ , suggesting the existence of nuclear correlations beyond the shell model .
The X-ray variations on short ( hours ) , medium ( months ) , and long ( years ) time scales have been explored .	We detected 303 distinct X-ray sources by analysing six EPIC/pn observations ; 194 of them are members of the cluster .
In this work , a facile preparation process of red-emission quantum dot films and simulation algorithm for fitting this film with two commercial LED flat lamps to the optimized performance are developed .	Based on the algorithm , one lamp improves from cold-white light ( 8669 K ) with poor color rendition ( $ R_ { a } =72 $ ) and luminous efficacy ( 85 lm/W ) to warm-white light ( 2867 K ) with $ R_ { a } =90.8 $ and $ R_ { 9 } =74.9 $ , and the other reaches $ R_ { a } =93\sim95 $ .
D { \bf 70 } , 104007 ( 2004 ) ] proposed a new formulation for 3+1 numerical relativity .	Einstein equations result , according to that formalism , in a coupled elliptic-hyperbolic system .
We show that a single counting quantifier strictly between exists^1 : =exists and exists^n : =forall ( the domain being of size n ) already affords the maximal possible complexity of QCSPs ( which have both exists and forall ) , being Pspace-complete for a suitably chosen template .	Next , we focus on the complexity of subsets of counting quantifiers on clique and cycle templates .
We believe it to be a quite general , albeit subtle phenomenon .	Indeed , the practical problem in uncovering an underlying discrete scale invariance is that standard ensemble averaging procedures destroy it as if it was pure noise .
The shock front separates the inner X-ray emitting , hot region , where gas is almost in hydrostatic equilibrium but with small radial infall ( $ \sim 100 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) being left , from the outer cool region .	Gas inside the shock is strongly compressed and heated by shock so that X-ray luminosity rapidly rises in the early stage .
This alters the behaviour of the model considerably .	We determine the phase diagram of this model by means of transfer matrix calculations and Monte Carlo simulations .
Also , 10-fold cross-validation and sets of performance metrics were used to evaluate the baseline predictive performance of the classifiers .	The comparative analysis shows that the Naive Bayes performed best with accuracy of 97.4 % , Multilayer Perceptron came out second with accuracy of 96.6 % , and J48 came out the worst with accuracy of 93.5 % .
In this paper , we mainly focus on the efficient signal-time coding design .	We first derive an explicit iterative algorithm to estimate the maximum number of available codes given the code length of signal-time coding , and then present an iterative construction method of codebooks .
We provide a control algorithm that combines the two hybrid controllers to accomplish the stabilization task .	The algorithm consists of a hybrid supervisor that , based on the values of plant 's outputs and ( norm ) state estimates , selects the hybrid controller that should be applied to the plant .
We introduce the Global Spin Model to study the static and dynamic properties of the ultracold fermionic gas near the broad Feshbach resonance .	We show that the problem of molecular production , in a single-mode approximation , is reduced to the linear Landau-Zener problem for operators .
However , known QSH materials ( e.g.HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb quantum wells ) exhibit very small energy gap and only work at low temperature , hindering their applications for room temperature devices .	Based on the first-principles calculations , we predict a novel family of QSH insulators in monolayer tantalum carbide halide TaCX ( X = Cl , Br , and I ) with unique rectangular lattice and large direct energy gaps larger than 0.2 eV , accurately , 0.23 $ - $ 0.36 eV .
We study the phenomenon of real space condensation in the steady state of a class of mass transport models where the steady state factorises .	The grand canonical ensemble may be used to derive the criterion for the occurrence of a condensation transition but does not shed light on the nature of the condensate .
Using $ ( k , m ) $ -CDS can tolerate the failure of $ \min\ { k-1 , m-1\ } $ nodes .	In this paper , we study Minimum Weight $ ( 1 , m ) $ -CDS problem ( $ ( 1 , m ) $ -MWCDS ) , and present an $ ( H ( \delta+m ) +2H ( \delta-1 ) ) $ -approximation algorithm , where $ \delta $ is the maximum degree of the graph and $ H ( \cdot ) $ is the Harmonic number .
These `` spin Hurwitz numbers '' , recently studied by Eskin , Okounkov and Pandharipande , are interesting in their own right .	By the authors ' previous work , they are also related to the Gromov-Witten invariants of Kahler surfaces .
The impact of the 't Hooft mixing term on the restoration of the chiral symmetry on the light and strange sectors is studied and the critical temperature dependence on the magnetic field strength of the chiral strange transition is analyzed .	It is shown that the s quark is much less sensitive to the magnetic field than the light quarks .
For this , we estimate the rate of repeating microlensing eventstoward the Galactic bulge field based on standard models of dynamical and physical distributions of Galactic matter combined with models of binary separation and mass function .	From this , we find that the total number of repeating events expected to be detected from $ \sim 4 $ -year space-based surveys will be $ \sim 200 $ -- 400 , that is $ \sim 40 $ -- 50 times higher than the rate of current surveys .
When the right and the left handed Weyl points are separated in energy , they give rise to a non-dissipative charge current along the direction of a uniform applied magnetic field , even in the absence of an external electric field .	This effect is known as the chiral magnetic effect and is a hallmark of the underlying chiral anomaly of the Weyl fermions .
It has been argued that this theory is stable up to a critical value of the `t Hooft coupling but is unstable beyond that point .	We suggest that from the gauge theory point of view the development of instability is associated with singularity in the dimension of the operator corresponding to the tachyon field via the AdS/CFT map .
LE analyses are complemented by nonlinear FE analysis .	The Riks method available in Abaqus/Standard , coupled with the Concrete Damaged Plasticity ( CDP ) model is used to simulate the degradation of concrete surrounding both DTR the traditional cylindrical dowels .
An emergent algebra A over a uniform idempotent right quasigroup X is a collection of operations such that each operation emerges from X , meaning that it can be realized as a combination of the operations of the uniform irq X , possibly by taking limits which are uniform with respect to a set of parameters .	Two applications are considered : we prove a bijection between contractible groups and distributive uniform irqs ( uniform quandles ) and that some symmetric spaces in the sense of Loos may be seen as uniform quasigroups with a distributivity property .
Therefore , if we reduce CNFSAT to HornSAT , we must make such partially ordered set in HornSAT .	But CNFSAT have correlations of each clauses , the partially ordered set is not in polynomial size .
Under an infinite sequence of generalized local linear growth and Lipschitz conditions , the well-posedness of an adapted 4-tuple strong solution is proved over a suitably constructed topological space .	Second , we consider a unified system of FB-SDEs , a special form of the FB-SPDEs , however , with skew boundary reflections .
Due to this the frequency of parametric resonance becomes time dependent , making the reheating process especially effective .	All fields including the gravitational field are initially simplified by expanding each in terms of the respective homogeneity or inhomogeneity .
When q = e^ { 2 pi i/ ( N+K ) } , the observables of the 2d U ( N ) qYM theory can be expressed as a sum over a finite subset of U ( N ) representations .	When N and K are odd , the qYM theory exhibits N & lt ; -- & gt ; K duality , provided q = e^ { 2 pi i/ ( N+K ) } and theta = 0 mod 2 pi / ( N+K ) .
In the present study we show evidence of QW resonance states in Fe QW up to12 nmthick and at room temperature in fully epitaxial doubleMgAlOxbarrier magnetic tunnel junctions .	The electron phase coherence displayed in this QWis of unprecedented quality because ofa homogenous interface phase shift due to the small lattice mismatch at the Fe/MgAlOx interface .

Employing artificial-star tests , we develop a simple method that can efficiently measure the probabilities of stellar blends and superpositions from the observed stellar catalog .	We create synthetic color-magnitude diagrams matching the fundamental parameters of NGC 1818 , with different binary fractions and mass-ratio distributions .
We study this transition in detail and find universal qualitative features for the above class of theories which has holographic dual descriptions .	We also obtain analytical results for mutual information in the specific regime of the parameter space .
An explicit computation demonstrates that the regularized Jacobian $ Tr\ \Delta J\exp -\cR /M^2 $ for $ M^2\rightarrow \infty $ is the variation of a local counterterm , which we give .	This is a direct proof at the level of path integrals that there is no BRST anomaly .
The limit metric gives rise to a tree structure decomposition , where each node in the tree represents a limit metric of a subsequence at that stage while the edge of the tree structure represents the neck on the process of blowing up .	We also show that the number of the nodes which have more than three edges attached is finite .
The data have been taken with the Plastic-Ball detector set-up for 4.9 GeV p + Au collisions at the Berkeley BEVALAC and for 200 $ A\cdot $ GeV/ $ c $ p- , O- , and S-induced reactions on different nuclei at the CERN-SPS .	The yield of protons at backward rapidities is found to be proportional to the target mass .
The semi-inclusive cross section for producing slow protons in charged current deep inelastic ( anti- ) neutrino scattering on protons and neutrons is calculated as a function of the Bjorken $ x $ and the proton momentum .	The standard hadronization models based upon the colour neutralization mechanism appear to underestimate the rate of slow proton production on hydrogen .
We describe the tropicalizations of theta functions and use them to generalize the dual pairing between the character and cocharacter lattices .	We use this to describe generalizations of dual cones , Newton and polar polytopes , Minkowski sums , and finite Fourier series expansions .
Here we assume that the local calibration between the 8 $ \mu $ m emission and the dust SED shape and metallicity applies at high redshifts and that our LAEs have low metallicities as suggested by previous studies .	The inferred escape fractions of Ly $ \alpha $ , $ 16 $ -- $ 37 % $ , and UV continuum , $ \ge 44 % $ , are higher than the cosmic averages at the same epoch .
We present a computer simulation model that is a one-to-one copy of a quantum eraser experiment with photons ( P. D. D. Schwindt { \sl et al . } , Phys.Rev .	A 60 , 4285 ( 1999 ) ) .
In the high temperature regime the temperature change on adiabatic demagnetization was found to be consistent with previously published entropy versus temperature curves .	At low temperatures ( T & lt ; 0.4 K ) cooling by adiabatic demagnetization was followed by an irreversible rise in temperature that persisted after the removal of the applied field .
To ensure the quality of QCD sum rule analysis , contributions of up to dimension nine are calculated to test the convergence of operator product expansion ( OPE ) .	We find that the two-quark condensate $ & lt ; \bar { q } q & gt ; $ is very large and makes the standard OPE convergence ( i.e.the perturbative at least larger than each condensate contribution ) happen at very large values of Borel parameters .
From a purely observational point of view , we show that is not possible to discard values of the coupling constant in the unphysical region $ \epsilon & lt ; 0 $ .	We show that the uncoupled case , $ \epsilon=0 $ , is in better agreement with the data than any of coupled models in the physical region .
From pulsating stars to transiting exoplanets , the search for periodic signals in K2 data , Kepler 's 2-wheeled extension , is relevant to a long list of scientific goals .	Systematics affecting K2 light curves due to the decreased spacecraft pointing precision inhibit the easy extraction of periodic signals from the data .
A common approach for characterizing the syntax of these complex syllable sequences is to use transition probabilities between the syllables .	This is equivalent to the Markov model , in which each syllable is associated with one state , and the transition probabilities between the states do not depend on the state transition history .
The characteristics of the Kr-83m source are analyzed and shown to be appropriate for a low background liquid xenon detector .	Introduction of Kr-83m allows for quick , periodic calibration of low background noble liquid detectors at low energy .
Approximation algorithms for this problem were developed by Guha and Munagala by rounding a linear program that couples the various alternatives together .	In this paper we present an index for this problem , which we call the ratio index , which also guarantees a constant factor approximation .
The ability to control such individual information carriers in trapped ultracold atomic Fermi gases is a novel theme in quantum information science .	However , fermionic atoms are neutral and thus are difficult to manipulate .
The computational complexity of MCMC methods for the exploration of complex probability measures is a challenging and important problem .	A challenge of particular importance arises in Bayesian inverse problems where the target distribution may be supported on an infinite dimensional space .
In this work we present a new family of options ( mirror options ) specially crafted to satisfy the necessities of aggressive speculators .	The main ideas behind mirror options are : 1 ) A product that can be adjusted by the holder to agree with his/her market view at any time during its life .

Strong magnetic activity is expected for the late-type component ( a G dwarf star and post-T Tauri Star candidate ) .	The system is unresolved in the ROSAT image .
We justify our method by intuitive examples and the matrix perturbation theory .	We then show how this approach can be extended to handle missing data , thus yielding an efficient and general subspace clustering algorithm .
As an example , we argue that such screening mass can result from strong localization of the vector mediators .	The proposed dark energy mechanism could be experimentally verified through cosmological observations by the Euclid experiment , as well as by studying properties of dark photons and sterile neutrinos .
We show that there exists a subspace of $ B ( H ) $ which is isometric to $ \ell_2 $ and completely isometric to its antidual in the sense of the theory of operator spaces recently developed by Blecher-Paulsen and Effros-Ruan .	Moreover this space is unique up to a complete isometry .
A comparison between the predicted and the observed number of lensed radio sources allows a determination of the current value of Omega-Lambda .	If there are six strongly lensed sources in this sample , our 95 % confidence upper limit on Lambda in a flat universe is 0.79 .
Using magnetic force microscopy , the reversible preparation of a Landau state with four magnetic domains separated by N\'eel domain walls is confirmed .	A local spin-wave excitation using a microstructured antenna is realized in one of the domains .
We examine whether the magnetorotational instability ( MRI ) can serve as a mechanism of angular momentum transport in circumplanetary disks .	For the MRI to operate the ionization degree must be sufficiently high and the magnetic pressure must be sufficiently lower than the gas pressure .
QCPU is standard and easy-assemble because it only has two kinds of basic elements and two auxiliary elements .	QCPU and its realizations are scalable , that is , they can be connected together , and so they can construct the whole quantum network to implement the general quantum algorithm and quantum simulating procedure .
We convert the FUV and V-band photometry , along with Halpha photometry , into radial star formation rate profiles that are sensitive to timescales from 10 Myrs to the lifetime of the galaxy .	We also compare the stellar distributions , surface brightness profiles , and star formation rate profiles to HI-line emission maps , gas surface density profiles , and gas kinematics .
The s-wave interaction is usually the dominant form of interactions in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates ( BECs ) .	Recently , Feshbach resonances have been employed to reduce the strength of the s-wave interaction in many atomic speicies .
A data collector subsequently attempts to recover the original data object by accessing each of the nodes independently with some constant probability .	By using an appropriate code , successful recovery occurs when the total amount of data in the accessed nodes is at least the size of the original data object .
Spectroscopy in the X-ray band , with both ROSAT and ASCA , reveal absorption by the warm absorber but little or no neutral absorption expected to accompany the dust responsible for the optical reddening .	The dusty warm absorber solution to this discrepancy is discussed and photoionization models of such warm absorbers are constructed .
We use synthetic star formation and metal enrichment histories predicted by the { \sc galform } galaxy formation model to investigate the precision with which various colours $ ( m_ { a } -m_ { b } ) $ can alone be used as diagnostics of the stellar mass-to-light ratio .	As an example , we find that , at $ z=0 $ , the { \em intrinsic } ( B $ _ { f435w } - $ V $ _ { f606w } $ ) colour can be used to determine the intrinsic rest-frame $ V $ -band stellar mass-to-light ratio ( $ \log_ { 10 } \Gamma_ { V } =\log_ { 10 } [ ( M/M_ { \odot } ) / ( L_ { V } /L_ { V\odot } ) ] $ ) with a precision of $ \sigma_ { lg\Gamma } \simeq 0.06 $ when the initial mass function and redshift are known beforehand .
The degrees of freedom ( DoF ) of the multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) Interference Broadcast Channel ( IBC ) with 2 cells and 2 users per cell are investigated when only delayed channel state information is available at the transmitter side ( delayed CSIT ) .	Retrospective Interference Alignment has shown the benefits in terms of DoF of exploiting delayed CSIT for interference , broadcast and also for the IBC .
We will prove a decomposition for Wasserstein geodesics in the following sense : let $ ( X , d , m ) $ be a non-branching metric measure space verifying $ \mathsf { CD } _ { loc } ( K , N ) $ or equivalently $ \mathsf { CD } ^ { * } ( K , N ) $ .	We prove that every geodesic $ \mu_ { t } $ in the $ L^ { 2 } $ -Wasserstein space , with $ \mu_ { t } \ll m $ , is decomposable as the product of two densities , one corresponding to a geodesic with support of codimension one verifying $ \mathsf { CD } ^ { * } ( K , N-1 ) $ , and the other associated with a precise one dimensional measure , provided the length map enjoys local Lipschitz regularity .
Electromagnetic counterparts may be crucial for a confident gravitational-wave detection as well as for extraction of astronomical information .	Yet BHNS star pairs are notoriously dark and so inaccessible to telescopes .
This leads to the observation of half integer quantum hall effect and the absence of localization .	The latter is attractive for graphene-based field effect transistors .
In a single-molecule junction , these degeneracies are lifted by various symmetry-breaking effects .	We study quantum transport through such nanostructures with an almost degenerate spectrum .
Distributed over five months , the RXTE observations were designed to search for long X-ray modulations over a few months .	These observations indeed suggest the presence of a long cycle with P = 226 days and an amplitude of a factor of two .
The physical model is based on conservation laws of mass and momentum at the working surface as explained by Mendoza et al . ( 2009 ) .	The hydrodynamical description of the working surface is parametrised by the initial velocity and mass injection rate at the base of the jet .
We discuss the role of a class of higher dimensional operators in 4D N=1 supersymmetric effective theories .	The Lagrangian in such theories is an expansion in momenta below the scale of `` new physics '' ( $ \Lambda $ ) and contains the effective operators generated by integrating out the `` heavy states '' above $ \Lambda $ present in the UV complete theory .
We explore a more general class of models based on the addition to the action of terms proportional to $ R_ { \mu\nu } \ , \Box^ { -2 } R^ { \mu\nu } $ and $ C_ { \mu\nu\rho\sigma } \ , \Box^ { -2 } C^ { \mu\nu\rho\sigma } $ , where $ C_ { \mu\nu\rho\sigma } $ is the Weyl tensor .	We find that the term $ R_ { \mu\nu } \ , \Box^ { -2 } R^ { \mu\nu } $ does not give a viable background evolution .
The leading order of $ \T $ is proportional to the identity operator .	Knowing the operator $ \T $ one can renormalize spin-foam 's edge self-energy by computing the amplitude of sum of a series of edges with increasing number of vertices and bubbles .
However , a systematic study of the ice phases in nanoconfinement is hampered by the computational cost of simulations at very low temperatures .	Here we develop a coarse-grained model for a water monolayer in hydrophobic nanoconfinement and study the formation of ice by Mote Carlo simulations .
This allows a simultaneous analysis based on the posterior probability of each model .	Inference is performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo - a Gibbs sampler with Metropolis-Hastings steps for a class of parameters .
We also show that , at a sufficiently large temperature , the open string vacuum becomes stable .	Building upon this observation and previous work by Horowitz , Maldacena and Strominger , we formulate a microscopic brane-antibrane model for the non-extremal black three-brane in ten dimensions ( as well as for the black two- and five-branes in eleven dimensions ) .
We show numerical results which are compatible with present experimantal data for the charmless B-meson decays .	Specailly we predict the possibility of large direct CP violation effects in $ B^0 \to \pi^ { + } \pi^ { - } $ $ ( 23\pm7 % ) $ and $ B^0\to K^ { + } \pi^ { - } $ $ ( -17\pm5 % ) $ .
In general these Vekua equations are bicomplex .	However we show that the whole theory of pseudoanalytic functions without modifications can be applied to these equations under a certain not restrictive condition .
We distinguish three semantics for counter reachability games , according to what happens when a counter value would become negative : the edge is either disabled , or enabled but the counter value becomes zero , or enabled .	We consider the problem of deciding the winner in counter reachability games and show that , in most cases , it has the same complexity under all semantics .
to allow different weighting of the event counts registered within the smoothing region .	For each individual pixel the algorithm increases the smoothing scale until the signal-to-noise ratio ( s.n.r . )
This paper introduces a new and ubiquitous framework for establishing achievability results in \emph { network information theory } ( NIT ) problems .	The framework uses random binning arguments and is based on a duality between channel and source coding problems .
It is based on the proposition that the mean field can be obtained as an energy average .	Moreover , it is assumed that the matrix elements of the residual interaction , obtained after the average interaction is removed , are random with the average value of zero .
The `isolato ' hypothesis states that one of a pair of spin- $ { 1 } / { 2 } $ particles can be in `isolato ' mode in which the spin- $ { 1 } / { 2 } $ particle shuts itself from any external interactions , and hence it can never be detected .	As a result of this , data rejection is made ; Bell 's inequality is violated , although the model is genuinely local .
These systems and their performance have been reported on elsewhere .	The ultimate success of such a system , however , depends significantly upon the efficiency of selective event retrieval .
Using daily price changes instead , we find evidence of a significant GARCH component .	These results suggest that microstructure elements have a considerable influence on the return generating process .
For the intermediate values of the interaction expected to hold in the iron pnictides , we find a metallic low moment state characterized by antiparallel orbital magnetic moments .	The anisotropy of the interorbital hopping amplitudes is the key to understanding this low moment state .
We give an alternative proof of their result by constructing a certain Shintani datum .	We also propose a refinement of Gross 's leading term conjecture by using the theory of Shintani data .
The converse for each result is based on developing a novel rank-ratio inequality that characterizes the maximum ratio between the dimensions of received linear subspaces at the two multiple-antenna receivers .	The achievability of the linear sum DoF is based on a three-phase strategy , in which during the first two phases only the transmitter with fewer antennas exploits delayed CSIT in order to minimize the dimension of its signal at the unintended receiver .
Because of the long Fermi wavelength of itinerant electrons , the quantum limit of elemental bismuth ( unlike most metals ) can be attained with a moderate magnetic field .	The quantized orbits of electrons shrink with increasing magnetic field .
We calculate the so-called hard spectator corrections in $ { \cal O } ( \alpha_s ) $ in the leading-twist approximation to the decay widths for $ B \to K^ { * } \gamma $ and $ B \to \rho \gamma $ decays and their charge conjugates , using the Large Energy Effective Theory ( LEET ) techniques .	Combined with the hard vertex and annihilation contributions , they are used to compute the branching ratios for these decays in the next-to-leading order ( NLO ) in the strong coupling $ \alpha_s $ and in leading power in $ \Lambda_ { \rm QCD } /M_B $ .
One-particle se lf-energies and the density of states in the vicinity of the pairing transition point are presented .	Within the Green function approach model calculations are p erformed using the thermodynamic $ T $ matrix in ladder approximation .
These weighted multiplicities appear naturally in the Selberg trace formula , and in particular their mean square plays an important role in the study of statistics of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the surface .	In the case of the modular domain , E. Bogomolny , F. Leyvraz and C. Schmit gave a formula for the mean square , which was rigorously proved by M. Peter .
In this case the orbit of any point looks like a tree .	In the study of $ m $ -transformations we are interested in the properties of the trees .
The fluctuating signal is enhanced in a magnetic field H [ 2-4 ] .	Recently , a feature was detected in the thermal conductivity at a field 22 T ( called HK here ) and interpreted as the low-T limit of a mean-field Hc2 ( T ) curve [ 5 ] .
UV radiation from white dwarfs can efficiently clear Galactic globular clusters ( GCs ) of their intra-cluster medium ( ICM ) .	This solves the problem of the missing ICM in clusters , which is otherwise expected to build up to easily observable quantities .
Rev A \textbf { 59 } , 1829 ( 1999 ) ] .	We focus on a generalization of the HBB protocol to $ n $ communication parties thus including $ n $ -partite GHZ states .

The search features novel background suppression and prediction methods , including a dedicated top quark pair reconstruction algorithm .
Models for the evolution of the integrated energy spectrum of primary cosmic ray electrons in clusters of galaxies have been calculated , including the effects of losses due to inverse Compton ( IC ) , synchrotron , and bremsstrahlung emission , and Coulomb losses to the intracluster medium ( ICM ) .	The combined time scale for these losses reaches a maximum of ~3e9 yr for electrons with a Lorentz factor ~300 .
The polarizabilities are measured via direct spectroscopy on the second-stage transition .	Several states have tensor and scalar polarizabilities that exceed the values that might be expected from the known energy levels of barium by more than two orders of magnitude .
Such a formulation does not fully capture the goal of the allocation , which is to minimize the traffic between registers and memory .	Linear scan has been proposed as an alternative to graph coloring , but in essence , it can be viewed as a greedy algorithm for graph coloring : coloring the vertices not in the order of their degrees , but in the order of their occurence in the program .
The bulk of VO work in Europe is ensured by the national VO initiatives and those of intergovernmental agencies .	VO activities at the European level coordinate the work in support of the three `` pillars '' of the Virtual Observatory : support to the scientific community , take-up by the data providers , and technological activities .
Using coherent-state techniques , we prove a sampling theorem for Majorana 's ( holomorphic ) functions on the Riemann sphere and we provide an exact reconstruction formula as a convolution product of $ N $ samples and a given reconstruction kernel ( a sinc-type function ) .	We also discuss the effect of over- and under-sampling .
Lung tumor motion due to respiration poses a challenge in the application of modern three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy .	Direct tracking of the lung tumor during radiation therapy is very difficult without implanted fiducial markers .
We employ MIPS 24 $ \mu $ m data to identify infrared galaxies in the Extended Groth Strip ( EGS ) .	We use a local density indicator to probe the environment on few Mpc scales and a group member catalog , both of which make use of the DEEP2 spectroscopic redshift catalog , to quantify the environment of these galaxies .
We study the quasi-normal modes ( QNM ) of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole in an asymptotically Anti-de Sitter ( AdS ) spacetime .	Some of the electromagnetic modes do not oscillate , they only decay , since they have pure imaginary frequencies .
A fluctuating feature of the SDW ordering is also seen below the $ T_ { SDW } $ .	We further performed high-pressure NMR studies on NaFeAs , and found that the $ T_ { SDW } $ increases by $ \sim $ 7 K and the magnetic moment increases by 30 % under 2.5 GPa pressure .
At least four of these stars have large rotational velocities ( $ v \sin i $ $ \gtrsim $ 170 $ \mathrm { km~s^ { -1 } } $ ) and are expected to be oblate .	These interferometric measurements , the stars ' observed photometric energy distributions , and $ v \sin i $ values are used to computationally construct model oblate stars from which stellar properties ( inclination , rotational velocity , and the radius and effective temperature as a function of latitude , etc . )
An attempt to classify Bell inequalities for qubits is made , a weaker result ( classification with respect to Jevons group ) is obtained .	The fractal structure of the classification is shown .
Maxwell 's equations are cast in the form of the Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation .	The Lanczos propagation method is used in combination with the fast Fourier pseudospectral method to solve the initial value problem .
In our endeavour to build a pilot-wave theory of massless fermions , which would be relevant for the study of quantum non-equilibrium in the early universe , we are naturally led to Weyl spinors and to particle trajectories which give meaning to the `zig-zag ' picture of the electron discussed recently by Penrose .	We show that a positive-energy massive Dirac electron of given helicity can be thought of as a superposition of positive and negative energy Weyl particles of the same helicity and that a single massive Dirac electron can in principle move luminally at all times .
The Kondo effect is ascribed to a singlet-triplet transition in the ground state of the dot .	At the transition , the low-temperature conductance approaches the unitary limit .
The accuracy of the free energy reaches $ 10^ { -26 } $ .	Basing on these accurate data , we determine exact expansions of the critical free energy , internal energy and specific heat .
The key result is that 54.55 % +/- 0.89 % of games can be completed ( by a patient player ! )	but that the remaining 45.45 % result in non-terminating cycles .
We compare our non-factorized analysis with the usual factorized analysis based on the peaking approximation in the calculation of the cross section for the heavy meson pair production .	We also discuss the higher helicity contribution to the cross section .
We study the process of multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of load balancing in a distributed system , without use of either central coordination or explicit communication .	We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing , important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents .
As a general feature of the first-order phase transitions of matter consisting of many species of charged particles , there appears a mixed phases with geometrical structures called `` pasta '' due to the balance of the Coulomb repulsion and the surface tension between two phases .	The equation of state ( EOS ) of mixed phase is different from the one obtained by a bulk application of the Gibbs conditions or by the Maxwell construction due to the effects of the non-uniform structure .
A construction of integrable hamiltonian systems associated with different graded realizations of untwisted loop algebras is proposed .	Such systems have the form of Euler - Arnold equations on orbits of loop algebras .
It consists in a stochastic flow that acts over a solution of a differential equation and produces another solution of the same equation .	In the ordinary case , we give necessary conditions in order to obtain such symmetries .
By applying a magnetic field , we induce ground state transitions and identify the corresponding quantum numbers by comparison with few-body calculations .	In addition to atomic-like states , we find novel `` molecular-like '' phases .
The effectiveness of the mapping is explored , and we show that all considered quantities are in qualitative , and in some cases quantitative , agreement .	The thermal conductivity of the considered S=1 model is found to be strongly influenced by the underlying effective description .
In particular , the real locus of the Schubert curve is naturally a covering space of $ \mathbb { RP } ^1 $ , with $ \omega $ as the monodromy operator .	We provide a local algorithm for computing $ \omega $ without rectifying the skew tableau , and show that certain steps in our algorithm are in bijective correspondence with Pechenik and Yong 's genomic tableaux , which enumerate the $ K $ -theoretic Littlewood-Richardson coefficient associated to the Schubert curve .
Our method relies on the master Lagrangian approach to deal with dual theories .	The master Lagrangians turn out to be the NC versions of the so-called affine Toda model coupled to matter fields ( NCATM $ _ { 1,2 } $ ) , in which the Toda field $ g $ belongs to certain subgroups of $ GL ( 3 ) $ , and the matter fields lie in the higher grading directions of an affine Lie algebra .
The inverse see-saw mechanism is an interesting alternative to the canonical one once it leads to tiny neutrino masses with the advantage of being testable at TeV scale .	However , this last mechanism suffers from an issue of naturalness concerning the scale responsible for such small masses , namely , the parameter $ \mu $ that is related to lepton number violation and is supposed to be at the keV scale , much lower than the electroweak one .
Certain features of orientifolded NS-branes -such as their existence- were assumed in the original construction , which have not been verified directly .	However , those features fit very well together with the properties of the relevant field theories , and subsequently yielded the known dualities .
The need for { \em measuring } the differential luminosities is stressed .	We show that , in a large variety of processes , the yield of weak vector bosons is much higher than at the \epm mode but unfortunately , the cross sections are dominated by the transverse modes .
Namely , $ \mathbb { G } ( i , j ) = \pi_j \left ( \sum_ { k \in V } \pi_k H ( k , j ) - H ( i , j ) \right ) $ where $ \pi_i $ is the stationary distribution at vertex $ i $ and $ H ( i , j ) $ is the expected hitting time for a random walk starting from vertex $ i $ to first reach vertex $ j $ .	This formula also holds for the digraph Laplace operator .
Entropy production retains its usual form as a sum of products of fluxes and forces and Onsager 's symmetry principle is proven to hold for the average nanosystem if it is valid for the macroscopic ensemble , by two methods .	The first one provides expressions that relate the coefficients of the two systems .
When the factors are polynomial in other commuting operators then we show that , in a suitable sense , generically factorisations algebraically yield decompositions .	In the case of operators on a space over an algebraically closed field this boils down to elementary algebraic geometry arising from the polynomial formula for the orginal operator .
We discuss both the elastic and rapid-thermalization limits , where the rate of inelastic scattering in the dot is either small or large compared with the elastic transition rate , respectively .	In the elastic limit , we find several cases where a closed solution for the conductance is possible , including the case of a constant exchange interaction .
Driving the optical cavity by means of the coin-field interaction time and the initial quantum coin state , we determine two types of modification of the asymptotic behavior of the QRW .	In the first one the limit distribution is robustly reproduced up to a scaling , while in the second one the quantum features of the walk , exemplified by enhanced diffusion rate , are washed out and Gaussian asymptotics prevail .
With these moment conditions , we obtain the exact self-normalized tail probabilities for $ x $ up to $ x=o ( n^ { 1/4 } ) $ .	Consequently under some conditions for the third moment , the self-normalized moderate deviation probabilities in ( 2 ) hold uniformly in a $ x $ range which is related to the moments with order between 3 and 4 .
In the paper we discuss possible approaches to the problem of the rigorous derivation of quantum kinetic equations from underlying many-particle dynamics .	For the description of a many-particle evolution we construct solutions of the Cauchy problems of the BBGKY hierarchy and the dual BBGKY hierarchy in suitable Banach spaces .
The goal of this work is to find an appropriate criterion to analyze statistical tests in this setting .	A suitable model for analysis is the high-dimensional model in which both $ n $ and $ m $ increase to infinity , and $ n=o ( m ) $ .
The motivation for this is the bijection between parabolic orbits in the nilradical of a parabolic subgroup of SL_n and certain Delta-filtered modules for the Auslander algebra of k [ T ] /T^n as found by Hille and Roehrle and Bruestle et al .	Under this bijection , the Richardson orbit ( i.e.the dense orbit ) corresponds to the Delta-filtered module without self-extensions .
In this paper , we assume that the matched gallery images should not only be similar to the probe , but also be similar to each other , under suitable metric .	We express this assumption with a fully connected CRF model in which each node corresponds to a gallery and every pair of nodes are connected by an edge .
We discuss the problem of the separation of total correlations in a given quantum state into entanglement , dissonance , and classical correlations using the concept of relative entropy as a distance measure of correlations .	This allows us to put all correlations on an equal footing .
We discuss possible detection of these effects by Gaia .	Observations of the photocenter variability in two AGNs , SDSS J121855+020002 and SDSS J162011+1724327 have been reported and discussed .
Accurate and precise values of radii and masses of stars are needed to correctly estimate properties of extrasolar planets .	We examine the effect of uncertainties in stellar model parameters on estimates of the masses , radii and average densities of solar-type stars .
Depending on the chaotic or integrable nature of the underlying classical dynamics , on the thermodynamic function considered , and on temperature , we find that the probability distributions are dominated either ( i ) by the local fluctuations of the single-particle spectrum on the scale of the mean level spacing , or ( ii ) by the long-range modulations of that spectrum produced by the short periodic orbits .	In case ( i ) the probability distributions are computed using the appropriate local universality class , uncorrelated levels for integrable systems and random matrix theory for chaotic ones .
We study the spherical collapse model in dark energy cosmologies , in which dark energy is modelled as a minimally coupled scalar field .	We first follow the standard assumption that dark energy does not cluster on the scales of interest .
The 4-500keV energy range is used to constrain the underlying continuum and the reflection at higher energies .	We first investigate the data by applying a phenomenological model that consists of the sum of an exponentially cutoff power law and relativistically smeared reflection .
Samples of simulated clusters include star formation with supernovae feedback , radiative cooling , and simulation in the adiabatic limit at three different redshifts , z = 0.0 , 0.10 , and 0.25 .	The optical sample contains 208 ACO clusters within redshift , $ z \leq 0.25 $ .
The calculations are performed within an effective chiral model with quark-meson interactions , belonging to the same universality class as QCD .	We confront mean-field thermodynamics with the functional renormalization group approach , where fluctuations are properly taken into account .
The mathematical representation of an idealized waywiser consists of a choice of symmetric space called a { \em model space } and represents the `wheel ' of the idealized waywiser .	The geometry of a manifold is then completely characterized by a pair of variables $ \ { V^A ( x ) , A^ { AB } ( x ) \ } $ , each of which admit simple interpretations : $ V^A $ is the point of contact between the waywiser 's idealized wheel and the manifold whose geometry one wishes to characterize , and $ A^ { AB } =A_\mu^ { \phantom { \mu } AB } dx^\mu $ is a connection one-form dictating how much the idealized wheel of the waywiser has rotated when rolled along the manifold .
We build a penalty for choosing the number of change-points in the kernel-based method of Harchaoui and Capp { \'e } ( 2007 ) .	This penalty generalizes the one proposed by Lebarbier ( 2005 ) for one-dimensional signals .
We give a formula expressing it by a single term of multiple integrals .	In particular , we explicitly derive the emptiness formation probability ( EFP ) .
By examining the possible activity of the magnetic fields of accretion disks we conclude that indeed main sequence stars might accrete mass at very high rates , up to ~0.01 Mo/yr for solar type stars , and up to ~1 Mo/yr for very massive stars .	We speculate that magnetic fields amplified in such extreme conditions might lead to the formation of massive bipolar outflows that can remove most of the disk 's energy and angular momentum .
We show that the present knowledge of gluon distributions does not allow to make a precise predictions for $ c \bar c $ production at LHC , in particular at forward rapidities .	In this paper we study production of $ c \bar c $ pairs including several subleading mechanisms .
The dynamical degrees of a rational map $ f : X\dashrightarrow X $ are fundamental invariants describing the rate of growth of the action of iterates of $ f $ on the cohomology of $ X $ .	When $ f $ has nonempty indeterminacy set , these quantities can be very difficult to determine .
The relation between flow and density is an essential quantitative characteristic to describe the efficiency of traffic systems .	We have performed experiments with single-file motion of bicycles and compare the results with previous studies for car and pedestrian motion in similar setups .
We study augmented quasiclassical equations of superconductivity with the Lorentz force , which is missing from the standard Ginzburg-Landau and Eilenberger equations .	It is shown that the magnetic Lorentz force on equilibrium supercurrents induces finite charge distribution and the resulting electric field to balance the Lorentz force .
This result holds more generally .	This condition , uniformly separated in modulus , allows the set where the distortion is large to accumulate densely on the boundary but does not allow a component to run out to the boundary .
We believe that one can have serious reservations as to whether heavy ion collisions ( e.g.100 GeV/n Au + 100 GeV/n Au ) can lead to Thermal and Chemical equilibrium over large regions ( particularly if it is assumed this happens whenever QGP is produced at RHIC-that is if it is produced ) .	It is at present not clear that the collision dynamics and times available will lead to this .
This Lasso-type approach for GLMMs should be mainly used as variable screening method to reduce the number of variables below the sample size .	We then suggest a refitting by maximum likelihood based on the selected variables only .
It is often possible to obtain or infer multiple types of relations from the same set of nodes , such as observed friend connections , inferred links via semantic comparison , or relations based off of geographic proximity .	These edge sets can be represented by one multi-layer network .
The discovery of superconductivity in the 122 iron selenide materials above 30 K necessitates an understanding of the underlying magnetic interactions .	We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetic and semiconducting Ce $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 2 } $ FeSe $ _ { 2 } $ composed of chains of edge-linked iron selenide tetrahedra .
Shuffling is the process of arranging data elements into a random permutation .	The sequence S as an aggregation of N data elements , there are N !
We show that the Macdonald polynomials are invariant with respect to the bar involution defined abstractly on the representations of quantum groups .	We also prove that the Macdonald scalar product coincides with the abstract Kashiwara form .
Note that $ r $ depends on both halo mass and age .	In this new approach , some of the objects which were initially considered low-mass peaks belong to regions with higher overdensities .
One more power series related to the Riemann Xi function and the Riemann hypothesis is considered .	Some roots of the polynomial connected with the power series are studied .
First , we need to understand what synthesis models actually compute : we show that a synthetic stellar population with fixed physical parameters ( age , metallicity , star formation history , initial mass function and size of the system ) can only be described in terms of probability distributions ( i.e.there is an intrinsic dispersion in any model ) .	Second , we need to identify and characterize the coverage in the parameter space of the models ( i.e.the combinations of input parameters that yield meaningful models ) and the different sources of systematic errors .
For 1 and 2 dimensions , it is found that the decay of R ( t ) depends on one of two classes of initial configuration .	For a subcritical initial state , R ( t ) \sim t^ { -\theta } , where the persistence exponent \theta can be expressed in terms of a known universal exponent .
When particle-hole symmetry is broken electron ( hole ) pockets are formed around the Fermi surface .	The superconducting ground state emerges from the pairing of nodal quasi-particles mediated by acoustic phonons via a piezoelectric coupling .
Their archetype , { \delta } Cephei , is an important calibrator for this relation .	In this paper , we show that { \delta } Cephei is a spectroscopic binary based on newly-obtained high-precision radial velocities .
Electronic structure calculations from first-principles are employed to design some new half-metallic fully-compensated ferrimagnets ( or as they are widely known half-metallic antiferromagnets ) susceptible of finding applications in spintronics .	Cr $ _2 $ MnZ ( Z= P , As , Sb , Bi ) compounds have 24 valence electrons per unit cell and calculations show that their total spin moment is approximately zero for a wide range of lattice constants in agreement with the Slater-Pauling behavior for ideal half-metals .
From the color-magnitude diagram K versus ( J-K ) we selected the standard candles corresponding to red clump giants and used the information of their proper motions to build a map of the vertical motions of our Galaxy .	We derived the kinematics of the warp both analytically and through a particle simulation to fit these data .
Channel conductance measurements can be used as a tool to study thermally activated electron transport in the sub-threshold region of state-of-art FinFETs .	Together with theoretical Tight-Binding ( TB ) calculations , this technique can be used to understand the evolution of source-to-channel barrier height ( Eb ) and of active channel area ( S ) with gate bias ( Vgs ) .
This has been deduced from experimental low temperature data in the tunneling regime as well as from the vanishing isotope effect in diffusion in glasses and undercooled liquids .	In molecular dynamics simulations of glasses one observes that both low frequency resonant vibrations and atomic jumps are centered on more than 10 atoms which , in densely packed materials , form chainlike structures .
We propose a two-phase transmission scheme , that reserves a certain portion of each coherence block for channel estimation , and the remainder of the coherence block for correlated source generation .	The resulting secret-key involves contributions of both channel sequences and source sequences , with the contribution of the latter becoming dominant as the coherence period increases .
We find that the light modulus is generically produced by the inflaton decay and therefore a prime candidate for the dark radiation .	Interestingly , an almost scale-invariant power spectrum predicted in the modulated reheating mechanism gives a better fit to the observation in the presence of the extra radiation .
We apply this theory to Sr $ _2 $ RuO $ _4 $ to analyze those physical quantities obtained experimentally , focusing on the interplay between the strong two-dimensional anisotropy and the Pauli paramagnetic effects .	This study allows us to understand the origin of the disparity between the vortex lattice anisotropy ( $ \sim $ 60 ) and the $ H_ { \rm c2 } $ anisotropy ( $ \sim $ 20 ) .
Motivated by the recent discoveries in chromatin folding that interphase chromosomes have territorial organization with signatures pointing to metastability , we analyzed the biomolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank and found that the intrachain contact probabilities , $ P ( s ) $ as a function of the arc length $ s $ , decay in power-law $ \sim s^ { -\gamma } $ over the intermediate range of $ s $ , $ 10\lesssim s\lesssim 110 $ .	We found that the contact probability scaling exponent is $ \gamma\approx 1.11 $ for large RNA ( $ N & gt ; 110 $ ) , $ \gamma\approx 1.41 $ for small sized RNA ( $ N & lt ; 110 $ ) , and $ \gamma\approx 1.65 $ for proteins .
We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for two such irreducible Virasoro modules to be isomorphic .	Many examples for such irreducible Virasoro modules with different features are provided at the end of the paper .
Using both momentum and temperature renormalization group equations we investigate the running coupling in the magnetic sector as a function of temperature and momentum scale .	At fixed momentum scale we find that , in contrast to $ \lambda\phi^4 $ or QED , high-temperature QCD is strongly coupled , even after renormalization group improvement .
The discussed systems include a collection of two-level atoms , a two-mode quantized radiation field with a fixed total number of photons , and a single laser-cooled ion in a two-dimensional harmonic trap with a fixed total number of vibrational quanta .	In the proposed rearrangement , the standard spectroscopic and interferometric experiments are inverted .
The most important class of braided vector spaces arising from groups is the class of braided vector spaces ( CX , c^q ) , where C is the field of complex numbers , X is a rack and q is a 2-cocycle on X with values in C^* .	Racks and cohomology of racks appeared also in the work of topologists .
Overall , our knowledge of metal abundances at high z is still very sketchy .	Most significantly , there seems to be an order of magnitude shortfall in the comoving density of metals which have been measured up to now compared with those produced by the star formation activity seen in Lyman break galaxies .
60 GHz millimeter wave transmission will scale the speed of WLANs and WPANs to 6.75 Gbit/s over distances less than 10 meters .	This technology is the first of its kind and will eliminate the need for cable around personal computers , docking stations , and other consumer electronic devices .
Despite the fact that the regenerator has a fixed length one can obtain different values for the probability distribution of the $ K_L $ decay into a final state .	Using a two-arm regenerator set up it is possible to measure the imaginary parts of the $ K^0 ( \bar { K } ^0 ) $ -nucleon scattering amplitudes in the correlated decays of the $ \phi $ -resonance .
We carried out spectroscopic observations of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla .	Our spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about 100 Myrs .
At the same time the existence of in-plane uniaxial anisotropy with [ 110 ] the easy axis is evidenced .	This is related to the top/bottom symmetry breaking , resulting in the lowering of point symmetry of ( Ga , Mn ) As to the C_ { 2v } symmetry group .
LLAGN accretion disks should thus co-exist with thousands to millions of stars or proto-stars left from the previous stronger accretion activity .	In principle , these stars may produce several important effects : ( i ) contribute to the optical/UV spectra of some LLAGN ; ( ii ) reprocessing of the stellar radiation in the dusty disks could dominate the LLAGN infra-red spectra ; ( iii ) deplete the ( accretion ) gas disk much faster than it can accrete onto the supper-massive black hole ( SMBH ) ; ( iv ) stars , individually or in groups , may slow down and modulate the accretion flow significantly due to their inertia .
Hard scattering is more easily observed via single particle and few particle correlation measurements .	The main advantage of jets is higher rate at large $ p_T $ , plus the possibility of detailed studies of soft fragmentation if the soft fragments can be separated from the background .
The radiation observed by blazars is believed to originate from the transformation of bulk kinetic energy of relativistic jets into random energy .	A simple way to achieve this is to have an intermittent central power source , producing shells of plasma with different bulk Lorentz factors .
We show that under appropriate conditions synchronization of the dynamics of single electrons takes place , leading to a rise of the oscillating component of the charge current .	The synchronization time depends dramatically on the applied dc electric field and electron scattering rate , and is roughly inversely proportional to the radiative damping rate that is determined by the carrier concentration and the geometrical parameters of the device .
The present paper deals with the quantum coordinates of an event in space-time , individuated by a quantum object .	It is known that these observables can not be described by self-adjoint operators or by the corresponding spectral projection-valued measure .
Vapor sensors based on functionalized carbon nanotubes ( NTs ) have shown great promise , with high sensitivity conferred by the reduced dimensionality and exceptional electronic properties of the NT .	Critical challenges in the development of NT-based sensor arrays for chemical detection include the demonstration of reproducible fabrication methods and functionalization schemes that provide high chemical diversity to the resulting sensors .
Paired electrons , however , can not form a superconducting condensate spontaneously .	These paired electrons perform disorderly zero-point oscillations and there are no force of attraction in their ensemble .
This finding is consistent with the general HI deficiency of satellite galaxies located within the Milky Way 's virial radius and supports the hypothesis that gas is being removed from satellites by tidal and ram-pressure forces during perigalactic passages .	In addition , some of the objects may be embedded in , and interacting with , the extended neutral and ionised gas filaments of the Magellanic Stream .
In this case , the challenge is primarily control of materials and interfaces , and device nanofabrication .	We report important steps toward implementing spin qubits in a predominantly nuclear-spin-free system by demonstrating state preparation , pulsed gate control , and charge-sensing spin readout of confined hole spins in a one-dimensional Ge/Si nanowire .
The aim of this work is to discover and highlight security issues related to CUDA , the most widespread platform for GPGPU computing .	In particular , we provide details and proofs-of-concept about a novel set of vulnerabilities CUDA architectures are subject to , that could be exploited to cause severe information leak .
There are some standing paradoxes in the literature regarding relations among ( p , q ) -webs , toric diagrams and various phases of the gauge theories , we resolve them by proposing and carefully distinguishing between two kinds of ( p , q ) -webs : toric and quiver ( p , q ) -webs .	The former has a one to one correspondence with the toric diagram while the latter can correspond to multiple gauge theories .
We prove that $ f $ is fixed-point free if and only if its continuous extension $ \tilde f : \beta \mathbb R^n\to 2^ { \beta \mathbb R^n } $ is fixed-point free .	If one wishes to stay within metric terms , the result can be formulated as follows : $ f $ is fixed-point free if and only if there exists a continuous fixed-point free extension $ \bar f : b\mathbb R^n\to 2^ { b\mathbb R^n } $ for some metric compactificaton $ b\mathbb R^n $ of $ \mathbb R^n $ .
We present analytic derivation of the canonical partition functions and Lee-Yang zeros for this type of free energy using the saddle point approximation .	We also perform lattice QCD simulation in a canonical approach using the fugacity expansion of the fermion determinant , and carefully examine its reliability .
However , in general relativity it is not easy to construct indicators of chaos which are gauge-invariant .	Therefore it is reasonable to start by investigating - at first - the possibility of a gauge-invariant description of local instability .
The second property is the modulation of the aftershock sequence by the fundamental oscillation of the Earth 0S2 excited by the main shock .	Both results are supported by analysis of the Tohoku earthquake ( 11.03.2011 , M = 9 ) , as well as by the statistical analysis of the USGS earthquake catalog .
By investigating a set of three low enriched and water moderated UO2 fuel rod arrays we found that modeling the same set of data with different , yet reasonable assumptions concerning the fuel rod composition and its geometric properties leads to significantly different covariance matrices or correlation coefficients .	Following a Monte Carlo sampling approach , we show for nine different modeling assumptions the corresponding correlation coefficients and sensitivity profiles for each pair of the effective neutron multiplication factor keff .
Apparently , an automorphism of $ G $ can be regarded as a permutation on $ [ n ] =\ { 1 , \ldots , n\ } $ , provided that $ G $ has $ n $ vertices .	For each permutation $ \sigma $ on $ [ n ] $ , there is a natural action on any given vector $ \boldsymbol { u } = ( u_1 , \ldots , u_n ) ^t\in \mathbb { C } ^n $ such that $ \sigma\boldsymbol { u } = ( u_ { \sigma^ { -1 } 1 } , u_ { \sigma^ { -1 } 2 } , \ldots , u_ { \sigma^ { -1 } n } ) ^t $ , so $ \sigma $ can be viewed as a linear operator on $ \mathbb { C } ^n $ .
Write $ n $ in its binary representation $ n= ( b_i b_ { i-1 } ... b_1 b_0 ) _2 $ and set $ S_M ( n ) = \sum_ { t=0 } ^i t^ { \bar { M } } b_t 2^t $ .	We analyze the average $ TS_M ( n ) = \frac { 1 } { n } \sum_ { j & lt ; n } S_M ( j ) $ .
To investigate , we use a combination of optical and near-infrared photometry to select a sample of 74 quasars from the VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations ( VIDEO ) Survey , over 1 deg $ ^2 $ .	The depth of VIDEO allows us to study very low accretion rates and/or lower-mass black holes , and 26 per cent of the candidate quasar sample has been spectroscopically confirmed .
On one hand , the density structure factor is equal to that of elastic hard spheres , except in the limit of large length-scales , as it occurs in the presence of an effective interaction .	On the other hand , the velocity field shows a more complex structure which is a genuine expression of a non-equilibrium steady state and which can be compared to a recent fluctuating hydrodynamic theory with non-equilibrium noise .
This feature is induced by the general relativistic gravitomagnetic component of the Earth gravitational field .	The GP-B mission has been launched in April 2004 and is aimed mainly to the measurement of the gravitomagnetic precession of four gyroscopes carried onboard at a claimed accuracy of 1 % or better .
We describe models of the thermal structure of the envelopes of neutron stars with magnetic fields up to 10^ { 14 } G. Unlike earlier work , we infer the properties of envelope models in two dimensions and precisely account for the quantization of the electron phase space .	Both dipole and uniformly magnetized envelopes are considered .
Then we calculate the Z alpha corrections to the Schiff moment which appear due to the finite nuclear size .	Such corrections are important in heavy atoms with nuclear charge Z & gt ; 50 .
We find that the consequences of inconsistent choice of the mass-temperature relation and sigma_8 could be quite substantial , including a considerable mis-estimation of the magnitude of the power spectrum and cluster number counts .	Our results can partly explain the large scatter between published estimates of the power spectrum and number counts .
We present the preliminary results of a survey for OH megamasers underway at the Arecibo Observatory .	The goals of the survey are to calibrate the luminosity function of OH megamasers to the low-redshift galaxy merger rate ( 0.1 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.2 ) , and to use the enhanced sample of OH megamasers provided by the survey to study OH megamaser environments , engines , lifetimes , and structure .
We look at certain thought experiments based upon the 'delayed choice ' and 'quantum eraser ' interference experiments , which present a complementarity between information gathered from a quantum measurement and interference effects .	It has been argued that these experiments show the Bohm interpretation of quantum theory is untenable .
The cD galaxy is modelled using both axially symmetric and elliptical models and assuming several masses for its dark matter halo .	The effect of the cD orientation with respect to the mass distribution of the host galaxy cluster is also investigated .
Further understanding $ IC_\infty $ might have consequences for important direct-sum problems in communication complexity , as it lies between communication complexity and information complexity .	We also show that applying both the above relaxations simultaneously to $ IC_\infty $ gives a complexity measure that is lower-bounded by the ( log of ) relaxed partition complexity , a complexity measure introduced by Kerenidis et al . ( FOCS 2012 ) .
In this work we continue our investigation and we compute the Hardy constant for other non-convex planar domains .	In all cases the Hardy constant is related to that of a certain infinite sectorial region which has been studied by E.B.Davies .
The phase diagram of the system and the critical values of the parameters are worked out .	It is shown that the sign of the detuning plays an important role and that there is a strong suppression of the Mott transition in the case of blue detuning .
The parameter regime is appropriate for organic semiconductors used in single crystal based field effect transistors .	Different approaches have been used to solve the model : self-consistent Born approximation valid for weak electron-phonon coupling , coherent potential approximation exact for infinite dimensions , and numerical diagonalization for finite lattices .
The article describes the potential application of thermodynamic simulation to forecast chemical aging and relevant color changes in painting .	Qualitative and numerical results were obtained by applying the method to various mixtures of pigments without and with atmospheric components .
Recent work has shown that special field lines , called separators , are common sites of reconnection in 3D numerical experiments .	To date , 3D separator reconnection sites have received little attention as particle accelerators .
Estimates of their star formation rates ( SFRs ) based on SED-fitting agree within uncertainties with the Halpha luminosity inferred SFRs .	The HII region luminosity functions have standard slopes at the luminous end .
Let $ \phi $ the morphism $ X\to G_m^n $ induced by the $ f_i $ 's , and let $ t $ be the map $ X\to ( R^*_+ ) ^n $ induced by the norms of the $ f_i $ 's .	Let us recall two results .
The latter are willing to reward cooperative actions at a personal cost , thus effectively downgrading pure cooperators to second-order free-riders due to their unwillingness to bear these additional costs .	Consequently , we find that defection remains viable , especially if the rewarding is costly .
The analysis is classically performed in a Hilbert space $ H $ .	We generalize this method to functionals $ j $ which are differentiable in a Banach space .
This demonstrates the efficient relaxation towards a confined state of the system .	For slightly positive detuning , we observe the transition from strong to weak coupling regime and then to single-mode lasing .
We first define listing popularity through search clicks , favoriting and purchase activity .	Next , we infer listing quality from the pixel-level information of listed images as quality features .
This is a special case of the equivariant sectional category of an equivariant map , also defined in this paper .	The relationship of these invariants with the equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is given .
Volumes and descriptive measures ( such as means and variances ) for each subject and the pooled distances provide the morphometric differences between diagnostic groups , but they do not reveal all the morphometric information contained in LCDM distances .	To extract more information from LCDM data , censoring of the distances is introduced .
We then analyze the class of locally analytic representations with the property that their associated modules are annihilated by an ideal of finite codimension in the universal enveloping algebra of G , showing under some hypotheses on G that they are sums of representations of the form $ X\otimes Y $ , with X finite dimensional and Y smooth .	The irreducible representations of this type are obtained when X and Y are irreducible .
Via detailed analysis of the ETV curves using high-level analytic approximations , we are able to extract system masses and information about the three-dimensional characteristics of the triple for 62 systems which exhibit both LTTE and dynamical delays ; for the remaining 160 systems we give improved LTTE solutions .	New techniques of preprocessing the flux time series are applied to eliminate false positive triples and to enhance the ETV curves .
The first type is characterized by a nonzero TKNN invariant or Chern number [ 1 ] which is directly related to the quantization of Hall conductance in the integer quantum Hall effect .	Haledane propose a model with this type of band structure even in the absence of a macroscopic magnetic field [ 2 ] .
Based on a second order explicit method in time , a completely discrete scheme is examined and optimal error estimates are established with a mild condition on the space and time discretizing parameters .	Finally , some numerical experiments are conducted which confirm the theoretical order of convergence .
In this paper , we undertake a study to determine what insight can be reliably gleaned from the comparison of the X-ray and the weak lensing mass maps of galaxy clusters .	We do this by investigating the 2D substructure within three high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters .
We develop a theoretical framework for the diffusion of a single unconstrained species of atoms on a crystal lattice that provides a generalization of the classical theories of atomic diffusion and diffusion-induced phase separation to account for constitutive nonlinearities , external forces , and the deformation of the lattice .	In this framework , we regard atomic diffusion as a microscopic process described by two independent kinematic variables : ( i ) the atomic flux , which reckons the local motion of atoms relative to the motion of the underlying lattice , and ( ii ) the time-rate of the atomic density , which encompasses nonlocal interactions between migrating atoms and characterizes the kinematics of phase separation .
These results applied to the number partitioning problem as a special case are compared with those which were previously obtained by a different method .	We discuss the limit of applicability of the techniques of statistical mechanics to the present problem .
It consists in a description in terms of the densities of particles and energy and their fluxes of all orders , with the motion described by a set of coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations involving them .	These Maxwell Times have a fundamental role in determining the type of hydrodynamic motion that the system would display in the given condition and constraints .
The strongest bounds on some forms of Lorentz and CPT violation come from astrophysical data , and placing such bounds may require understanding and modeling distant sources of radiation .	However , it is also desirable to have bounds that do not rely on these kinds of detailed models .
Super-maximal representations are shown to be \emph { totally non hyperbolic } , in the sense that every simple closed curve is mapped to a non hyperbolic element .	They are also shown to be \emph { geometrizable } ( appart from the reducible super-maximal ones ) in the following very strong sense : for any element of the Teichm\ '' uller space $ \mathcal T_ { 0 , n } $ , there is a unique holomorphic equivariant map with values in the lower half-plane $ \mathbb H^- $ .
As a function of this polarization angle we present the scattering results in both the threshold and semi-classical regimes .	We find a series of resonances as a function of the angle which allows the scattering to be tuned .
We report a measurement of the ttbar production cross section using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron .	The data consist of events with an energetic electron or muon , missing transverse energy , and three or more hadronic jets , at least one of which is identified as a b-quark jet by reconstructing a secondary vertex .
This paper explores the potential of Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter ( LETKF ) by comparing the performance of LETKF with an operational 3D-Var assimilation system , Physical-Space Statistical Analysis System ( PSAS ) , under a perfect model scenario .	The comparison is carried out on the finite volume Global Circulation Model ( fvGCM ) with 72 grid points zonally , 46 grid points meridionally and 55 vertical levels .
To test for the maximal effect , we also investigate a gluonic medium in the limit of an asymptotically strong anisotropy .	The spectral function of quarkonium is calculated for this case and found to be in remarkable agreement with the corresponding results for an isotropic medium .
We identify 3 regimes of the system 's energy levels : the normal , $ U ( 1 ) $ and quantum tunneling ( QT ) regime .	The system 's energy levels are grouped into doublets which consist of scattering states and Schrodinger Cats with even ( e ) and odd ( o ) parities in the $ U ( 1 ) $ and quantum tunneling ( QT ) regime respectively .
We consider non-smooth functions of ( truncated ) Wiener -- Hopf type operators on the Hilbert space $ L^2 ( \mathbb R^d ) $ .	Our main results are uniform estimates for trace norms ( $ d\ge 1 $ ) and quasiclassical asymptotic formulas for traces of the resulting operators ( $ d=1 $ ) .
No starless cores are detected .	We use the flux densities measured from these data to improve constraints on the correlations between radio luminosity and bolometric luminosity , infrared luminosity and , where measured , outflow force .
An example of such a resonance is the Kaluza -- Klein graviton , G [ KK ] , predicted in Randall -- Sundrum models .	The analysis is based on a 4.9 inverse femtobarn sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV , collected with the CMS detector at the LHC .
On the one hand , we introduce a new comprehensive framework that encompasses the various schemes we want to look at .	On the other hand , we exhibit actual attacks on recent schemes such as those introduced at ACISP 2007 , ACISP 2008 , and SPIE 2010 , and some others .
Relations between these manifolds and Grassmann manifolds have been established .	A generalisation of a result on the dimension of the manifold of rank $ k $ idempotents in the semigroup of linear endomorphisms over $ \fldc $ has been proved .
High efficiency encapsulation of gold nanoparticles is achieved by a simple strategy : the nanoparticles synthesis occurs simultaneously with the ethosomes formation , in the absence of any undesirable reducing agents .	A three-dimensional reconstruction of a gold-embedded ethosome generated by cryoelectron tomography reveals that the gold particle is localized inside the lipid bilayer , leaving the ethosome surface and core free for further functionalization .
PNR was measured in an external magnetic field H applied in the plane of the sample with the magnetization M confined in the plane for { \mu } _o H= 6.0 T and partially out of plane at 0.65 T. Nominal thicknesses of the Co and Pd layers were 2.5 { \AA } and 21 { \AA } , respectively .	Because of these small values , the actual layer chemical composition , thickness , and interface roughness parameters were determined from the nuclear scattering length density profile ( { \rho } _n ) and its derivative obtained from both x-ray reflectivity and PNR , and uncertainties were determined using Monte Carlo analysis .
The unifying thread stretches also beyond the QIS to establish its deep connections with statistical models , conformal field theory etc .	as well as with abstract mathematical objects like quantum group , braided or quadratic algebra
Our analysis entails an extended version of the $ STU $ oblique parametrization of Peskin and Takeuchi .	In principle , this extended formalism ( $ STUVWX $ ) must be used when there are light new particles in loops .
By viewing the world input-output system as an interdependent network where the nodes are the individual industries in different economies and the edges are the monetary goods flows between industries , we study the network properties of the so-called world input-output network ( WION ) and document its evolution over time .	We are able to quantify not only some global network properties such as assortativity , clustering coefficient , and degree and strength distributions , but also its subgraph structure and dynamics by using community detection techniques .
Are there compelling scientific reasons to obtain more precise and more accurate measurements of H_0 than currently available ?	If there are , how can we achieve this goal ?
The creation of popular science web videos on the Internet has increased in recent years .	The diversity of formats , genres , and producers makes it difficult to formulate a universal definition of science web videos since not every producer considers him- or herself to be a science communicator in an institutional sense , and professionalism and success on video platforms no longer depend exclusively on technical excellence or production costs .
We relate the ABM and the hierarchy of models to a population-level compartmental ODE model that we proposed previously for the spread of political revolutions [ 1 ] , which is shown to be mathematically consistent with the proposed ABM and provides a way to analyze the global behaviour of the ABM .	This consistency with the linear threshold ABM also provides further justification a posteriori for the compartmental model of [ 1 ] .
In $ d=1 $ exact results demonstrate that $ T_ { dyn } =T_c $ , the static glass transition temperature , and that the dynamical exponent changes from $ z ( T ) =2 + 2 ( T_c/T ) ^2 $ at high temperature to $ z ( T ) = 4 T_c/T $ in the glass phase .	The same formulae are argued to hold in $ d=2 $ .
The velocity field is the superposition of a systematic component and a `` noise '' component accounting for the effects of small scale substructure and observational errors .	This procedure results in models which resemble the observations ( redshifts and angular separations of galaxies surrounding clusters ) quite well .
on an electrode of a novel photovoltaic device as Ag deposition under light illumination , in which the wavelength of incident light is longer than the long-wavelength cutoff of the materials composing the device.Naruse et al .	introduced a stochastic cellular automaton model to simulate underlying nonequilibrium processes which are necessary to formulate unique granular Ag film in this deposition process .
Also different from classical primitive words , we find that a word may have more than one Abelian root .	We also consider enumeration problems and the relation to the theory of codes .
Such a layer could have an observable signature in both long-term and short-term variations of the magnetic field of the Earth , which are used to probe the flow at the top of the core .	Indeed , with the recent SWARM mission , it seems reasonable to be able to identify waves propagating in the core with period of several months , which may play an important role in the large-scale dynamics .
This resolution allowed us to detect a richer spectrum of BPs in the QS .	The smallest BPs we observed with TiO 705.68 nm were 0.13 '' , and we were able to resolve individual components in some of the BPs clusters and ribbons observed in the QS , showing that they are composed of the individual BPs .
We present asymptotically optimal procedures for one-parameter exponential families .	Next , we develop a general theory for change-point problems when both the pre-change distribution $ f_ { \theta } $ and the post-change distribution $ g_ { \lambda } $ involve unknown parameters .
This model arises as a consistent truncation of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a three-sphere to the lowest modes of the scalar fields .	In fact , our studies mimic the current investigations concerning the integrability properties of this gauge theory .
We show that in the realistic case when phase-space cuts are applied , the asymmetry depends also on the details of the production mechanism for the B mesons .	In particular , it is sensitive to the difference in the fragmentation functions of B^0_d and B^0_s mesons .
It is shown that the Comptonization of the stellar emission will take place in a hot accretion disk such as the ADAFs around the supermassive black hole and become a relatively important source of the accretion disk cooling when the mass accretion rate is low , and stars are passing outer parts of the hot accretion disk .	We suggest that such a stellar cooling can be observed in the radio frequency regime since synchrotron luminosity of the ADAFs depends strongly on the electron temperature and occurs much more frequently than a tidal disruption event .
Recently it has been shown that there exists a sector within the Faddeev-Niemi model for which the equations of motion may be reduced to first order equations .	However , no solutions to that sector have been given .
The wavelet transform is a hierarchical technique designed to separate data sets into sets representing local averages and local differences .	Although one-to-one transformations of data sets are possible , the advantage of the wavelet transform is as an approximation scheme for the efficient calculation of thermodynamic and ensemble properties .
The continuous walk operates with continuous time .	Here a third model for a quantum walk is proposed , which is based on an analogy to optical interferometers .
The detector consists of a Time Projection Chamber with optical readout filled with CF $ _4 $ gas at low pressure .	A collision between a WIMP and a gas molecule results in a nuclear recoil of 1-2 mm .
For the finite-dimensional case we study the vanishing-viscosity limit of doubly nonlinear equations given in terms of a differentiable energy functional and a dissipation potential which is a viscous regularization of a given rate-independent dissipation potential .	The resulting definition of 'BV solutions ' involves , in a nontrivial way , both the rate-independent and the viscous dissipation potential , which play a crucial role in the description of the associated jump trajectories .
We also analyze a sample of Halpha emitters taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) to constrain the luminous end of Halpha luminosity function .	Using the same selection criteria as for the SDF , and after excluding AGNs , we obtain 317 Halpha emitting star-forming galaxies .
We present here a global reanalysis of the cross section data aimed at understanding the disagreement between the Rosenbluth extraction and the polarization transfer data .	We find that the individual cross section measurements are self-consistent , and that the new global analysis yields results that are still inconsistent with polarization measurements .
For this class of processes , we propose a compressive estimator of the discrete Rihaczek spectrum ( RS ) .	This estimator combines a minimum variance unbiased estimator of the RS ( which is a smoothed Rihaczek distribution using an appropriately designed smoothing kernel ) with a compressed sensing technique that exploits the approximate time-frequency sparsity .
We present an 850-micron map and list of candidate sources in a 70 arcmin^2 sub-area of the Groth Strip observed using SCUBA .	We initially detect 7 candidate sources with signal-to-noise ratios ( SNRs ) between 3.0 and 3.5 and 4 candidate sources with SNR & gt ; 3.5 .
Two of these turned out to be hot emission-line stars , of which one is a definite B [ e ] star .	The mass-loss rates were measured through modelling of the spectral energy distributions .
We further investigate this issue by means of Spitzer imaging and spectroscopy in the 5-70 micron range .	The dense core of Mol160/IRAS23385+6053 , which up to now had only been detected at submm and mm wavelenghts has been revealed for the first time at 24 and 70 micron by Spitzer .
In this work , we focused on the role of high-lying excited states which are located beyond a few low-lying states known in the experiment .	Expected large difference between the cross sections of $ \nu_e $ and $ { \bar \nu_e } $ reactions on $ ^ { 40 } $ Ar , which difference has been anticipated in previous calculations because of the large Q value in the $ { \bar \nu } _e $ reaction , is significantly diminished .
This question has been resolved ( at least for $ H^1 $ data ) if $ M [ u ] E [ u ] \leq M [ Q ] E [ Q ] $ , where $ M [ u ] $ and $ E [ u ] $ denote the mass and energy of $ u $ , and $ Q $ denotes the ground state solution to $ -Q+\Delta Q +|Q|^2Q=0 $ .	Here , we prove a new sufficient condition for blow-up using an interpolation type inequality and the virial identity that is applicable to certain initial data satisfying $ M [ u ] E [ u ] & gt ; M [ Q ] E [ Q ] $ .
We systematically investigated the geometric , electronic and thermoelectric ( TE ) properties of bulk black phosphorus ( BP ) under strain .	The hinge-like structure of BP brings unusual mechanical responses such as anisotropic Young 's modulus and negative Poisson 's ratio .
80 , 5782 ( 1998 ) ] , Bruder and Imry address the reentrance effect in proximity coupled normal-metal coated superconducting cylinders discovered by Mota et al .	and challenging theoretical understanding to date .
The problem is nonlinear and ill-posed .	By a specific form of Fourier transforms , we shall show that the heat source is determined uniquely by the minimum boundary condition and the temperature distribution in $ \Omega $ at the initial time $ t=0 $ and at the final time $ t=1 $ .
bag model , the bag approximation and the soliton bag model to study the hadronic properties .	We prove , in this paper , the existence of excited state solutions in the symmetric case and of a ground state solution in the non-symmetric case for the soliton bag and the bag approximation models thanks to the concentration compactness method .
This paper explores feedback systems using incremental redundancy ( IR ) with noiseless transmitter confirmation ( NTC ) .	For IR-NTC systems based on { \em finite-length } codes ( with blocklength $ N $ ) and decoding attempts only at { \em certain specified decoding times } , this paper presents the asymptotic expansion achieved by random coding , provides rate-compatible sphere-packing ( RCSP ) performance approximations , and presents simulation results of tail-biting convolutional codes .
The robustness of complex networks with dependencies has been studied in recent years .	However , previous studies focused on the robustness of networks composed of dependency links without network topology .
`` 1 ) spectra of SN 1987A obtained on days 3715 and 3743 with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope show that the high-velocity SN debris is colliding with circumstellar gas .	Very broad Ly-alpha emission with velocities extending to ~ +/- 20,000 km/s originates inside the inner circumstellar ring and appears to fill most of the surface area within 0 . `` 67 +/- 0 .
Unfortunately , the Rips complex is generally high-dimensional .	To remedy this problem , it is tempting to simplify it through a sequence of collapses .
Not only are such galaxies extremely rare , but this `` coelacanth '' galaxy exhibits characteristics -- in particular its active , inside-out stellar disk-building -- that appear more typical of past ( z ~ 1 ) star formation , when large gas fractions were more common .	Unlike most local giant HI galaxies , it is actively star forming .
Possible structure of this phase-separated state ( metallic droplets in a charge-ordered matrix ) is discussed .	The model is extended to account for the strong Hund-rule onsite coupling and the weaker intersite antiferromagnetic exchange .
