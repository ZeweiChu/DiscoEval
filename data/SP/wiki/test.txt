1	In 1970 , Yakov B. Zel 'dovich showed that for an ellipsoid of gas on a supergalactic scale , an approximation can be used that will model the collapse as occurring most rapidly along the shortest axis , resulting in a pancake form .	That is , the gas will collapse without being significantly perturbed by outward pressure .	A Zeldovich pancake is a theoretical condensation of gas out of a primordial density fluctuation following the Big Bang .	This assumption is especially valid if the collapse occurs before the recombination era that resulted in the formation of hydrogen atoms .	This approximation assumes that the ellipsoid of gas is sufficiently large that the effect of pressure is negligible and only gravitational attraction needs to be considered .

1	The prefrontal cortex may be the neuroanatomical locus mediating the HTR .	Many serotonergic hallucinogens , including lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , induce the head-twitch response , and so the HTR is used as a behavioral model of hallucinogen effects .	The head-twitch response ( HTR ) is a rapid side-to-side head movement that occurs in mice and rats after the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is activated .	Also , the effect can be non-specific , with head twitch responses also produced by some drugs that do not act through 5-HT receptors , such as phencyclidine , yohimbine , atropine and cannabinoid receptor antagonists .	However while there is generally a good correlation between compounds that induce head twitch in mice and compounds that are hallucinogenic in humans , it is unclear whether the head twitch response is primarily caused by 5-HT2A receptors , 5-HT2C receptors or both , but recent evidence shows that the 5-HT2A receptor is solely responsible .

3	In a theory with Lorentz violation neutrinos can oscillate with and without masses and many other novel effects described below appear .	Today , neutrino oscillation or change of one type of neutrino into another is an experimentally verified fact ; however , the details of the underlying theory responsible for these processes remain an open issue and an active field of study .	The conventional model of neutrino oscillations assumes that neutrinos are massive , which provides a successful description of a wide variety of experiments ; however , there are a few oscillation signals that can not be accommodated within this model , which motivates the study of other descriptions .	Lorentz-violating neutrino oscillation refers to the quantum phenomenon of neutrino oscillations described in a framework that allows the breakdown of Lorentz invariance .	The generalization of the theory by incorporating Lorentz violation has shown to provide alternative scenarios to explain all the established experimental data through the construction of global models .

However , this seeming benefit is marginal , as it is almost as difficult to make a true , zone-free sphere of precise radius of curvature as it is to make an asphere of equivalent precision .

0	In molecular biology , the Ubiquitin-Interacting Motif ( UIM ) , or ' LALAL-motif ' , is a sequence motif of about 20 amino acid residues , which was first described in the 26S proteasome subunit PSD4 / RPN-10 that is known to recognise ubiquitin .	In addition , the UIM is found , often in tandem or triplet arrays , in a variety of proteins either involved in ubiquitination and ubiquitin metabolism , or known to interact with ubiquitin-like modifiers .	Among the UIM proteins are two different subgroups of the UBP ( ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase ) family of deubiquitinating enzymes , one F-box protein , one family of HECT-containing ubiquitin-ligases ( E3s ) from plants , and several proteins containing ubiquitin-associated UBA and / or UBX domains .	In most of these proteins , the UIM occurs in multiple copies and in association with other domains such as UBA ( INTERPRO ) , UBX ( INTERPRO ) , ENTH domain , EH ( INTERPRO ) , VHS ( INTERPRO ) , SH3 domain , HECT , VWFA ( INTERPRO ) , EF-hand calcium-binding , WD-40 , F-box ( INTERPRO ) , LIM , protein kinase , ankyrin , PX , phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase ( INTERPRO ) , C2 domain , OTU ( INTERPRO ) , DnaJ domain ( INTERPRO ) , RING-finger ( INTERPRO ) or FYVE-finger ( INTERPRO ) .	UIMs have been shown to bind ubiquitin and to serve as a specific targeting signal important for monoubiquitination .

The mechanism behind the glacial buzzsaw effect would be the erosion of small glaciers that are mostly unable to erode much below the equilibrium line altitude since they do not reach these altitudes because of increased ablation .	The glacial buzzsaw is a hypothesis claiming glacier erosion is key to limit the height of mountains above certain threshold altitude .	Starting from the hypothesis it has been predicted that local climate restricts the maximum height that mountain massifs can attain by effect of uplifting tectonic forces .	To this the hypothesis adds that great mountain massifs are leveled towards the equilibrium line altitude ( ELA ) , which would act as a “ climatic base level ” .
