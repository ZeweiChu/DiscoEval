4	Gate fan-out is limited due to `` current hogging `` : if the transistor base-emitter voltages ( ) are not well matched , then the base-emitter junction of one transistor may conduct most of the input drive current at such a low base-emitter voltage that other input transistors fail to turn on .	Direct-coupled transistor logic ( DCTL ) is similar to resistor – transistor logic ( RTL ) but the input transistor bases are connected directly to the collector outputs without any base resistors .	Consequently , DCTL gates have fewer components , are more economical , and are simpler to fabricate onto integrated circuits than RTL gates .	Unfortunately , DCTL has much smaller signal levels , has more susceptibility to ground noise , and requires matched transistor characteristics .	The transistors are also heavily overdriven ; that is a good feature in that it reduces the saturation voltage of the output transistors , but it also slows the circuit down due to a high stored charge in the base .

The Convocations of Canterbury and York are the synodical assemblies of the bishops and clergy of each of the two provinces which comprise the Church of England .	Until 1225 the synods were composed entirely of bishops , but during the thirteenth century more and more clergy were cited until by 1283 the membership was established as the Bishops , Deans , Archdeacons and Abbots of each province together with one proctor ( representative ) from each cathedral chapter and two proctors elected by the clergy of each diocese .	The main purpose of the convocations was to take counsel for the well-being of the Church and to approve canonical legislation , but in practice much time was spent in discussing the amount of tax to be paid to the Crown since the clergy were a separate estate of the realm and refused to be taxed in or through Parliament .	Before the end of the nineteenth century , the Convocation of Canterbury , which was numerically very much larger , played the major role and the activity of the Convocation of York was often little more than giving formal approval to the decisions taken by the southern province .

1	In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day .	DNA repair is a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome .	Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes .	Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis .	As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure .

0	Eukaryotic initiation factors ( eIFs ) are proteins involved in the initiation phase of eukaryotic translation .	These proteins help stabilize the formation of the functional ribosome around the start codon and also provide regulatory mechanisms in translation initiation .	Several initiation factors form a complex with the small 40S ribosomal subunit and Met-tRNA called the 43S preinitation complex ( PIC ) .	Additional factors of the eIF4F complex ( eIF4A , E , and G ) recruit the 43S PIC to the five-prime cap structure of messenger RNA to promote ribosomal scanning along the mRNA to reach an AUG start codon .	Recognition of the start codon by the Met-tRNA promotes GTP hydrolysis ( or gated phosphate release ) by specific initiation factors and initiation factor release , resulting in the 60S ribosomal subunit recruitment to form the 80S ribosome .
