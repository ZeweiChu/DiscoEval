0	Resolution by Proxy ( ResProx ) is a method for assessing the equivalent X-ray resolution of NMR-derived protein structures .	This makes it possible to calculate the resolution of a structure regardless of how it was solved ( X-ray , NMR , EM , modeling , ab initio prediction ) .

Cooperative diversity is a cooperative multiple antenna technique for improving or maximising total network channel capacities for any given set of bandwidths which exploits user diversity by decoding the combined signal of the relayed signal and the direct signal in wireless multihop networks .

0	Chlorosulfolipids are a class of naturally occurring molecules that are characterized as being stereochemically complex .	Furthermore , some of these complex molecules that have been isolated from toxic mussels are associated with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning .	These polychlorinated structures have been isolated from the freshwater alga `` Ochromonas danica `` , and are proposed to serve a structural role within the membranes of this species .

2	This formula is the natural generalization of Shannon 's noisy channel coding theorem , in the sense that this formula is equal to the capacity , and there is no need to regularize it .	In the theory of quantum communication , the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel is the highest rate at which classical information can be transmitted from a sender to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless entanglement .	An additional feature that it shares with Shannon 's formula is that a noiseless classical or quantum feedback channel can not increase the entanglement-assisted classical capacity .	It is given by the quantum mutual information of the channel , which is the input-output quantum mutual information maximized over all pure bipartite quantum states with one system transmitted through the channel .	The entanglement-assisted classical capacity theorem is proved in two parts : the direct coding theorem and the converse theorem .

They form the building blocks of the DNA double helix , and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and RNA .	The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information , while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which DNA polymerase replicates DNA , and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA .	Dictated by specific hydrogen bonding patterns , Watson-Crick base pairs ( guanine-cytosine and adenine-thymine ) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its nucleotide sequence .

2	By contrast , pure grain flows are rare in subaqueous settings , where the grains in a flow are generally held in suspension dominantly by traction , saltation , fluid turbulence and / or grain buoyancy when the grains are floating in the clay matrix of a mud flow .	The high concentrations of sand that develop at the base of high-density flows brings grains close enough together that frequent grain-to grain collisions are inevitable and result in layers of sediment that are inverse graded as the smaller grains are able to fall in between larger grains and settle out beneath them .	However , grain-to-grain collisions are very important as a contributing process of sediment support in subaqueous , sand-rich , high-density turbidity currents .	Grain flows are very common in aeolian settings as grain avalanches on the slip faces of sand dunes .	A Grain flow is a type of sediment-gravity flow in which the supporting fluid , which can be either air or water , acts only as a lubricant , and grains within the flow remain in suspension due to grain-to-grain collisions that generate a dispersive pressure to prevent further settling .
