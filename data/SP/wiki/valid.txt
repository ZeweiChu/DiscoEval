3	This means that much longer wavelengths can be obtained from quantum well lasers than from conventional laser diodes using a particular semiconductor material .	A quantum well laser is a laser diode in which the active region of the device is so narrow that quantum confinement occurs .	Laser diodes are formed in compound semiconductor materials that ( quite unlike silicon ) are able to emit light efficiently .	The wavelength of the light emitted by a quantum well laser is determined by the width of the active region rather than just the bandgap of the material from which it is constructed .	The efficiency of a quantum well laser is also greater than a conventional laser diode due to the stepwise form of its density of states function .

3	An important consequence of shape dynamics is the absence of a problem of time in canonical quantum gravity .

0	Complementary Code Keying ( CCK ) is a modulation scheme used with wireless networks ( WLANs ) that employ the IEEE 802.11b specification .	In 1999 , CCK was adopted to supplement the Barker code in wireless digital networks to achieve data rate higher than 2 Mbit / s at the expense of shorter distance .	This is due to the shorter chipping sequence in CCK ( 8 bits versus 11 bits in Barker code ) that means less spreading to obtain higher data rate but more susceptible to narrowband interference resulting in shorter radio transmission range .	Beside shorter chipping sequence , CCK also has more chipping sequences to encode more bits ( 4 chipping sequences at 5.5 Mbit / s and 64 chipping sequences at 11 Mbit / s ) increasing the data rate even further .	The Barker code , however , only has a single chipping sequence .

2	Bentonite is a type of clay that is formed from the weathering of volcanic ash deposits .	The Deicke and Millbrig bentonite layers , specifically the potassium bentonite layer , K-bentonite , were formed from a volcanic eruption during the Taconic orogeny during the Late Ordovician on Laurentia , the craton of North America .	Researchers are very interested in the eruptions that formed these bentonite layers because they are thought to be some of the largest volcanic eruptions in the last 600 million years of Earth history , and the resulting ash layer for each eruption individually was greater in volume than the Toba eruption .	Some researchers suggested that the ashes were from a volcanic arc that was on a convergent crust boundary .	Researchers believe this because the trace element geochemistry of the bentonite shows that its source was a felsic calc-alkalic magmatic source , which is characteristic of volcanism from a continental crust destructive plate margin setting .
