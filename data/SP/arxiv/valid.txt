4	The potentialities of the observational modality are also discussed .	We present new near-infrared ( IR ) spectra ( 0.80-1.35um ) of the pre-Main Sequence source PV Cep taken during a monitoring program of eruptive variables we are conducting since some years .	Simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations are systematically carried out during outburst and quiescence periods .	By correlating extinction-free parameters , such as HI recombination lines and underlying continuum , it is possible to infer on the mechanism ( s ) responsible for their origin .	Accretion and mass loss processes have a dominant role in determining the PV Cep irregular variability of both continuum and line emission .
0	In recent years the problem of correct description of quantum fluids in the confined geometry at nanoscale length has emerged .	It has been recognized that the quantum fluids at these circumstances can be considered as a new state of quantum matter due to close values between characteristic lengths for these quantum liquids and the size of geometrical confinement and significant contribution from the surface atoms .	So one has to apply new physics to describe such systems with taking into account their complex nature .	For example , last two years the attempts to develop the fractionalized two-fluid hydrodynamics for nanoporous media with fractal dimensions have been made .	The actuality of such new hydrodynamics becomes very clear for the last development in chemical synthesis of different kind of aerogels with nanopore structure as well as numerous studies of nanoporous substances .
1	In particular , in conjunction with a gamma identity , we show easily that a generalized Cauchy-Stieltjes transform of a linear functional of a Dirichlet process is equivalent to the Laplace functional of a class of , what we define as , beta-gamma processes .	This paper describes how one can use the well-known Bayesian prior to posterior analysis of the Dirichlet process , and less known results for the gamma process , to address the formidable problem of assessing the distribution of linear functionals of Dirichlet processes .	This represents a generalization of the Markov-Krein identity for mean functionals of Dirichlet processes .	A prior to posterior analysis of beta-gamma processes is given that not only leads to an easy derivation of the Markov-Krein identity , but additionally yields new distributional identities for gamma and beta-gamma processes .	These results give new explanations and intepretations of exisiting results in the literature .
2	Based on the derived orbital parameters , we find that Sh 2-216 , DeHt 5 , NGC 7293 , A21 , and Ton 320 belong to the thin-disk population , and PG 1034+001 and A31 belong to the thick-disk population .	We present and analyze the orbits of eight nearby planetary nebulae ( PNs ) using two different Galactic models .	The errors of the derived orbital parameters are determined with a Monte Carlo method .	PuWe 1 probably belongs to the thick-disk population , but its population classification is very uncertain due to the large errors of its derived orbital parameters .	The PN-ISM interactions are observed for the eight PNs in our sample .
0	Ascent sequences were introduced by Bousquet-M\ ' { e } lou , Claesson , Dukes and Kitaev in their study of $ ( \bf { 2+2 } ) $ -free posets .	An ascent sequence of length $ n $ is a nonnegative integer sequence $ x=x_ { 1 } x_ { 2 } ... x_ { n } $ such that $ x_ { 1 } =0 $ and $ x_ { i } \leq \asc ( x_ { 1 } x_ { 2 } ... x_ { i-1 } ) +1 $ for all $ 1 & lt ; i\leq n $ , where $ \asc ( x_ { 1 } x_ { 2 } ... x_ { i-1 } ) $ is the number of ascents in the sequence $ x_ { 1 } x_ { 2 } ... x_ { i-1 } $ .	We let $ \cA_n $ stand for the set of such sequences and use $ \cA_n ( p ) $ for the subset of sequences avoiding a pattern $ p $ .	Similarly , we let $ S_ { n } ( \tau ) $ be the set of $ \tau $ -avoiding permutations in the symmetric group $ S_ { n } $ .	Duncan and Steingr\ ' { \i } msson have shown that the ascent statistic has the same distribution over $ \cA_n ( 021 ) $ as over $ S_n ( 132 ) $ .
2	If the parameter in question is the cardinality of $ X $ , Nathanson and Nash already obtained some of such upper bounds , which can be seen as polynomials in $ h $ with degree $ ( |X| + 1 ) $ .	Let $ A $ be an additive basis of order $ h $ and $ X $ be a finite nonempty subset of $ A $ such that the set $ A \setminus X $ is still a basis .	In this article , we give several upper bounds for the order of $ A \setminus X $ in function of the order $ h $ of $ A $ and some parameters related to $ X $ and $ A $ .	Here , by taking instead of the cardinality of $ X $ the parameter defined by $ d : = \frac { \diam ( X ) } { \gcd\ { x - y | x , y \in X\ } } $ , we show that the order of $ A \setminus X $ is bounded above by $ ( \frac { h ( h + 3 ) } { 2 } + d \frac { h ( h - 1 ) ( h + 4 ) } { 6 } ) $ .	As a consequence , we deduce that if $ X $ is an arithmetic progression of length $ \geq 3 $ , then the upper bounds of Nathanson and Nash are considerably improved .
1	The ring structure for differential equivariant K-theory is developed explicitly .	Following Hopkins and Singer , we give a definition for the differential equivariant K-theory of a smooth manifold acted upon by a finite group .	We also construct a pushforward map which parallels the topological pushforward in equivariant K-theory .	An analytic formula for the pushforward to the differential equivariant K-theory of a point is conjectured , and proved in the boundary case , in the case of a free action , and for ordinary differential K-theory in general .	The latter proof is due to K. Klonoff .
0	The Argon Dark Matter ( ArDM-1t ) experiment is a ton-scale liquid argon ( LAr ) double-phase time projection chamber designed for direct Dark Matter searches .	Such a device allows to explore the low energy frontier in LAr with a charge imaging detector .	The ionization charge is extracted from the liquid into the gas phase and there amplified by the use of a Large Electron Multiplier in order to reduce the detection threshold .	Direct detection of the ionization charge with fine spatial granularity , combined with a measurement of the amplitude and time evolution of the associated primary scintillation light , provide powerful tools for the identification of WIMP interactions against the background due to electrons , photons and possibly neutrons if scattering more than once .	A one ton LAr detector is presently installed on surface at CERN to fully test all functionalities and it will be soon moved to an underground location .
4	Several schemes are tested for the energy input .	The interstellar medium is observed in a hierarchical fractal structure over several orders of magnitude in scale .	Aiming to understand the origin of this structure , we carry out numerical simulations of molecular cloud fragmentation , taking into account self-gravity , dissipation and energy input .	Self-gravity is computed through a tree code , with fully or quasi periodic boundary conditions .	Energy dissipation is introduced through cloud-cloud ineslatic collisions .
1	The method aims to solve three related problems .	A general method to describe stochastic dynamics of Markov processes is suggested .	The determination of an optimal coordinate for the description of stochastic dynamics .	The reconstruction of time from an ensemble of stochastic trajectories .	The decomposition of stationary stochastic dynamics on eigen-modes which do not decay exponentially with time .
2	Taking advantage of the essential decomposable property of these channels ( sources ) , the proposed expansion method allows for mapping of these problems to coding over parallel channels ( respectively , sources ) , where each level is modeled as an independent coding problem over discrete alphabets .	A general method of coding over expansion is proposed , which allows one to reduce the highly non-trivial problems of coding over analog channels and compressing analog sources to a set of much simpler subproblems , coding over discrete channels and compressing discrete sources .	More specifically , the focus of this paper is on the additive exponential noise ( AEN ) channel , and lossy compression of exponential sources .	Any feasible solution to the resulting optimization problem after expansion corresponds to an achievable scheme of the original problem .	Utilizing this mapping , even for the cases where the optimal solutions are difficult to characterize , it is shown that the expansion coding scheme still performs well with appropriate choices of parameters .
1	These curves facilitate understanding of how adiabatic changes in the lattice depth affect the temperature , and we demonstrate regimes where the atomic sample can be significantly heated or cooled .	The entropy-temperature curves are calculated for non-interacting fermions in a 3D optical lattice .	When the Fermi energy of the system is near the location of a band gap the cooling regimes disappear for all temperatures and the system can only be heated by lattice loading .	For samples with greater than one fermion per site we find that lattice loading can lead to a large increase in the degeneracy of the system .	We study the scaling properties of the system in the degenerate regimes and assess the effects of non-adiabatic loading .
2	Significantly larger gaps and higher transition temperatures in cuprate superconductors might be an attractive alternative to considerably relax these constraints , but it is not clear whether the proximity effect would be effective in heterostructures involving cuprates and topological insulators .	Proximity-induced superconductivity in a 3D topological insulator represents a new avenue for observing zero-energy Majorana fermions inside vortex cores .	Relatively small gaps and low transition temperatures of conventional s-wave superconductors put the hard constraints on these experiments .	Here , we present angle-resolved photoemission studies of thin Bi2Se3 films grown in-situ on optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 substrates that show the absence of proximity-induced gaps on the surfaces of Bi2Se3 films as thin as a 1.5 quintuple layer .	These results suggest that the superconducting proximity effect between a cuprate superconductor and a topological insulator is strongly suppressed , likely due to a very short coherence length along the c-axis , incompatible crystal and pairing symmetries at the interface , small size of the topological surface state Fermi surface and adverse effects of a strong spin-orbit coupling in the topological material .
0	In this work , we propose a near-field radiative thermal transistor made of two graphene-covered silicon carbide ( SiC ) plates separated by a nanometer vacuum gap .	Thick SiC plates serve as the thermal `` source '' and `` drain '' , while graphene sheets function as the `` gate '' to modulate the near-field photon tunneling by tuning chemical potential with applied voltage biases symmetrically or asymmetrically .	The radiative heat flux calculated from fluctuational electrodynamics significantly varies with graphene chemical potentials , which can tune the coupling between graphene plasmon across the vacuum gap .	Thermal modulation , switching , and amplification , which are the key features required for a thermal transistor , are theoretically realized and analyzed .	This work will pave the way to active thermal management , thermal circuits , and thermal computing .
3	We suggest several possible explanations , but are forced to reject them all , and are left puzzled .	We study a sample of 16 microlensed Galactic bulge main sequence turnoff region stars for which high dispersion spectra have been obtained with detailed abundance analyses .	We demonstrate that there is a very strong and highly statistically significant correlation between the maximum magnification of the microlensed bulge star and the value of the [ Fe/H ] deduced from the high resolution spectrum of each object .	Physics demands that this correlation , assuming it to be real , be the result of some sample bias .	To obtain a reliable metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge based on microlensed dwarf stars it will be necessary to resolve this issue through the course of additional observations .
1	Previous work has considered the case of a single , concentrated nuclear starburst , and also that of distributed single supernovae ( SNe ) .	The spatial distribution of star formation within galaxies strongly affects the resulting feedback processes .	Here , we consider ISM structuring by SNe originating in spatially distributed clusters having a cluster membership spectrum given by the observed HII region luminosity function .	We show that in this case , the volume of HI cleared per SN is considerably greater than in either of the two cases considered hitherto .	We derive a simple relationship between the `` porosity '' of the ISM and the star formation rate ( SFR ) , and deduce a critical SFR_crit , at which the ISM porosity is unity .
3	It also pioneered the use of detector readout based on digital frequency domain multiplexing .	The E and B Experiment ( EBEX ) is a balloon-borne polarimeter designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation and to characterize the polarization of galactic dust .	EBEX was launched December 29 , 2012 and circumnavigated Antarctica observing $ \sim $ 6,000 square degrees of sky during 11 days at three frequency bands centered around 150 , 250 and 410 GHz .	EBEX was the first experiment to operate a kilo-pixel array of transition-edge sensor bolometers and a continuously rotating achromatic half-wave plate aboard a balloon platform .	We describe the temperature calibration of the experiment .
4	On the other hand , light Z ' bosons with a mass M_Z ' ~ 150 GeV , which could also account for a recent CDF dijet excess in W+jet production , are barely allowed .	We use a recent upper limit from CDF on like-sign top pair production to place constraints on general new vector bosons and scalars mediating u u - & gt ; t t. The possible vector bosons comprise neutral colour singlets or octets , and charge 4/3 colour triplets or sextets , whereas the new scalars can be neutral colour singlets or octets and charge 4/3 colour sextets .	We also estimate the expected bounds from like-sign top pair production at LHC in the near future .	Then , we address the implications of these limits for the forward-backward asymmetry in t tbar production measured at Tevatron .	In particular , we find that models explaining the observed asymmetry by the exchange of a single t-channel heavy Z ' boson are already excluded .
2	We select events where one of the B mesons is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode and the other B decays semileptonically into an electron or a muon .	We measure partial branching fractions for the inclusive charmless semileptonic decay of $ \Bxulnu $ , and present determinations of the CKM matrix element $ \Vub $ .	This analysis is based on a sample of 467 million $ \FourS $ decays into $ \BB $ pairs , collected with the \babar\ detector at the PEP-II $ e^ { + } e^ { - } $ storage rings .	We then use the invariant mass , $ \mx $ , of the hadronic system , the invariant mass squared , $ q^ { 2 } $ , of the lepton and neutrino pair , the lepton momentum in the in the $ B $ meson rest frame $ \Pl $ , the kinematic variable $ P_ { + } $ or one of their combinations as discriminating variables to isolate $ \Bxulnu $ decays from the background .	We then measure the partial branching fractions in various regions of phase space These partial branching fractions are translated into values of $ \Vub $ using several theoretical calculations .
4	The necessary criteria in detecting Boyer 's repulsive Casimir force for a sphere are discussed at the end of this investigation .	The Casimir force for charge-neutral , perfect conductors of non-planar geometric configurations have been investigated .	The configurations are : ( 1 ) the plate-hemisphere , ( 2 ) the hemisphere-hemisphere and ( 3 ) the spherical shell .	The resulting Casimir forces for these physical arrangements have been found to be attractive .	The repulsive Casimir force found by Boyer for a spherical shell is a special case requiring stringent material property of the sphere , as well as the specific boundary conditions for the wave modes inside and outside of the sphere .
1	Rotation velocity and velocity dispersions , together with 19 Lick line-strength gradients have been measured , to , on average , two effective radii .	Long-slit spectra have been obtained with the Keck telescope for a sample of 11 early-type galaxies covering a wide range in luminosity and hence mass .	Stellar population models have been used to derive ages , metallicities and alpha/Fe abundances along the radius .	We find that line-strength gradients are due , mainly , to variations of the total metallicity with the radius .	We also find both , positive and negative , although small , variations in the [ alpha/Fe ] ratio with radius .
0	In this paper , we study the impact of edge weights on distances in diluted random graphs .	We interpret these weights as delays , and take them as i.i.d exponential random variables .	We analyze the weighted flooding time defined as the minimum time needed to reach all nodes from one uniformly chosen node , and the weighted diameter corresponding to the largest distance between any pair of vertices .	Under some regularity conditions on the degree sequence of the random graph , we show that these quantities grow as the logarithm of $ n $ , when the size of the graph $ n $ tends to infinity .	We also derive the exact value for the prefactors .
0	( abridged ) We present results from two new near-infrared imaging surveys .	One covers 47.2 arcmin^2 to K ( 3\sigma ) & lt ; 20 whilst a second , deeper survey covers a sub-area of 1.8 arcmin^2 to K ( 3\sigma ) & lt ; 22.75 .	Over the entire area we have extremely deep UBRI photometry .	Our K- counts are consistent with the predictions of non-evolving models with 0 & lt ; q0 & lt ; 0.5 .	The K-selected ( B-K ) galaxy colour distributions move sharply bluewards fainter than K~20 and at at brighter magnitudes ( K & lt ; 20 ) our observed colour distributions indicate a deficiency of red , early-type galaxies at z~1 in comparison with passively evolving models .
0	Exponential growth of the volume of Bluetooth-enabled devices indicates that it has become a popular way of wireless interconnections for exchanging information .	The main goal of this paper is to analyze the most critical Bluetooth attacks in real scenarios .	In order to find out the major vulnerabilities in modern Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices several attacks have performed successfully such as- Surveillance , Obfuscation , Sniffing , Unauthorized Direct Data Access ( UDDA ) and Man-in-the-Middle Attack ( MITM ) .	To perform the testbed , several devices are used such as mobile phones , laptops , notebooks , wireless headsets , etc .	and all the tests are carried out by pen-testing software like hcittml , braudit , spoafiooph , hridump , bluesnarfer , bluebugger and carwhisperer .
0	By analyzing B - & gt ; X_u l nu_l spectra with a model based on soft-gluon resummation and an analytic time-like QCD coupling , we obtain |V_ub| = ( 3.76 +-0.13 +- 0.22 ) *10^ ( -3 ) , where the first and the second error refers to experimental and theoretical errors , respectively .	The V_ub value is obtained from the available measured semileptonic branching fractions in limited regions of the phase-space .	The distributions in the lepton energy E_l , the hadron invariant mass m_X , the light-cone momentum P_+ = E_X - p_X , together with the double distributions in ( m_X , q^2 ) and ( E_l , s_h^max ) , are used to select the phase-space regions .	The q^2 is the dilepton squared momentum and s_h^max is the maximal m_X^2 at fixed q^2 and E_l .	The V_ub value obtained is in complete agreement with the value coming from exclusive B decays and from an over-all fit to the Standard Model parameters .
0	The equilibrium rotation of tidally evolved `` Earth-like '' extra-solar planets is often assumed to be synchronous with their orbital mean motion .	The same assumption persisted for Mercury and Venus until radar observations revealed their true spin rates .	As many of these planets follow eccentric orbits and are believed to host dense atmospheres , we expect the equilibrium rotation to differ from the synchronous motion .	Here we provide a general description of the allowed final equilibrium rotation states of these planets , and apply this to already discovered cases in which the mass is lower than twelve Earth-masses .	At low obliquity and moderate eccentricity , it is shown that there are at most four distinct equilibrium possibilities , one of which can be retrograde .
2	On the side of supergravity , we investigate the phase transition in the grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble .	The low energy excitation of the rotating D3-branes is thermodynamically stable up to a critical angular momentum density .	This indicates that there is a corresponding phase transition of the $ { \cal N } $ =4 large $ N $ super Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature .	Some critical exponents of thermodynamic quantities are calculated .	They obey the static scaling laws .
3	We consider an example of two emitters and show that radiation is occurred through symmetric states of emitters as it is in Dicke model of superradiance .	We present quantum-mechanical approach for collective spontaneous emission ( superradiance ) of emitters ( as atoms ) near metal nanoparticle , when frequencies of transitions of emitters coincide with frequency of localized plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle .	Our approach is based on Schrodinger description and it uses wave functions of states of systems .	Interactions between emitters and between the nanoparticle and emitters are taken into account .	The nanoparticle accelerates collective spontaneous emission similar how it accelerates spontaneous emission of single emitter .
3	Regime III ( strong rotation ) is characterized by suppression of the vertical velocity fluctuations .	When the classical Rayleigh-B\'enard ( RB ) system is rotated about its vertical axis roughly three regimes can be identified .	In regime I ( weak rotation ) the large scale circulation ( LSC ) is the dominant feature of the flow .	In regime II ( moderate rotation ) the LSC is replaced by vertically aligned vortices .	Using results from experiments and direct numerical simulations of RB convection for a cell with a diameter-to-height aspect ratio equal to one at $ Ra \sim 10^8-10^9 $ ( $ Pr=4-6 $ ) and $ 0 \lesssim 1/Ro \lesssim 25 $ we identified the characteristics of the azimuthal temperature profiles at the sidewall in the different regimes .
0	We report a measurement of the nuclear polarization of laser-cooled , optically-pumped $ ^ { 37 } \mathrm { K } $ atoms which will allow us to precisely measure angular correlation parameters in the beta-decay of the same atoms .	These results will be used to test the $ V-A $ framework of the weak interaction at high precision .	At the TRIUMF Neutral Atom Trap ( TRINAT ) , a magneto-optical trap ( MOT ) confines and cools neutral $ ^ { 37 } \mathrm { K } $ atoms and optical pumping spin-polarizes them .	We monitor the nuclear polarization of the same atoms that are decaying in situ by photoionizing a small fraction of the partially polarized atoms and then use the standard optical Bloch equations to model their population distribution .	We obtain an average nuclear polarization of $ P = 0.9913\pm0.0008 $ , which is significantly more precise than previous measurements with this technique .
0	Galton boards are models of deterministic diffusion in a uniform external field , akin to driven periodic Lorentz gases , here considered in the absence of dissipation mechanism .	Assuming a cylindrical geometry with axis along the direction of the external field , the two-dimensional board becomes a model for one-dimensional mass transport along the direction of the external field .	This is a purely diffusive process which admits fractal non-equilibrium stationary states under flux boundary conditions .	Analytical results are obtained for the statistics of multi-baker maps modeling such a non-uniform diffusion process .	A correspondence is established between the local phase-space statistics and their macroscopic counter-parts .
0	We discuss the nature of criticality in the $ \beta^2 = 2 \pi N $ self-dual extention of the sine-Gordon model .	This field theory is related to the two-dimensional classical XY model with a N-fold degenerate symmetry-breaking field .	We briefly overview the already studied cases $ N=2,4 $ and analyze in detail the case N=3 where a single phase transition in the three-state Potts universality class is expected to occur .	The Z $ _3 $ infrared critical properties of the $ \beta^2 = 6 \pi $ self-dual sine-Gordon model are derived using two non-perturbative approaches .	On one hand , we map the model onto an integrable deformation of the Z $ _4 $ parafermion theory .
3	We discuss how the formula reduces to some of the known results as the Klauza-Klein black hole and the dilute gas limit of Cveti\v { c } and Larsen .	We find a manifestly U-duality invariant formula for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the most general 4 dimensional , stationary , asymptoticaly flat , non-extremal STU black holes constructed recently by Chow and Comp\`ere .	The expression is entirely in terms of asymptotic charges .	It involves the `` scalar charges '' of the black hole which still need to be solved in terms of the dyonic charges and the mass .	We give the expected generalization to an $ E_ { 7 ( 7 ) } $ invariant in the case of maximal $ \mathcal { N } =8 $ supergravity .
2	We consider , as a working case , the Low Frequency Instrument ( LFI ) on-board the Planck satellite albeit the approach developed here can be easily applied to any kind of experiment that makes use of an observing ( scanning ) strategy which assumes repeated pointings of the same region of the sky on different time scales .	In this paper we discuss the issue of loosing telemetry ( TM ) data due to different reasons ( e.g.spacecraft-ground transmissions ) while performing a full-sky survey with space-borne instrumentation .	This is a particularly important issue considering the current and future space missions ( like Planck from ESA and WMAP from NASA ) operating from an orbit far from Earth with short periods of visibility from ground stations .	The issue is addressed by means of a Monte Carlo approach .	Our analysis clearly shows that , under quite general conditions , it is better to cover the sky more times with a lower fraction of TM retained than less times with a higher guaranteed TM fraction .
1	We locate the regions in the nuclear chart with the most promising constituents , it being protons and alpha-particles and investigate in details the properties of the possible borromean two-alpha systems in medium heavy nuclei .	Borromean nuclear cluster structures are expected at the corresponding driplines .	We find in all cases that the alpha-particles are located at the surface of the core-nucleus as dictated by Coulomb and centrifugal barriers .	The two lowest three-body bound states resemble a slightly contracted $ ^ { 8 } \text { Be } $ nucleus outside the core .	The next two excited states have more complex structures but with strong components of linear configurations with the core in the middle .
4	Using the full dynamical model , we predict that rate-dependent hysteresis will occur in the cellular traction forces when cells are exposed to substrates of time-dependent stiffness .	Mechanical cues like the rigidity of the substrate are main determinants for the decision making of adherent cells .	Here we use a mechano-chemical model to predict the cellular response to varying substrate stiffness .	The model equations combine the mechanics of contractile actin filament bundles with a model for the Rho-signaling pathway triggered by forces at cell-matrix contacts .	A bifurcation analysis of cellular contractility as a function of substrate stiffness reveals a bistable response , thus defining a lower threshold of stiffness , below which cells are not able to build up contractile forces , and an upper threshold of stiffness , above which cells are always in a strongly contracted state .
4	In dimension $ d & lt ; \m $ , the solution to the parabolic equation is shown to converge to the ( non-deterministic ) solution of a stochastic equation in the companion paper [ 2 ] .	We consider the homogenization of parabolic equations with large spatially-dependent potentials modeled as Gaussian random fields .	We derive the homogenized equations in the limit of vanishing correlation length of the random potential .	We characterize the leading effect in the random fluctuations and show that their spatial moments converge in law to Gaussian random variables .	Both results hold for sufficiently small times and in sufficiently large spatial dimensions $ d\geq\m $ , where $ \m $ is the order of the spatial pseudo-differential operator in the parabolic equation .
4	FlexBox field data has begun shedding light on relationships between ambient temperature and load energy consumption , load and building envelope energy efficiency challenges , latency communication network challenges , and opportunities to engage existing demand-side user behavioral patterns .	The increased penetration of uncertain and variable renewable energy presents various resource and operational electric grid challenges .	Micro-level ( household and small commercial ) demand-side grid flexibility could be a cost-effective strategy to integrate high penetrations of wind and solar energy , but literature and field deployments exploring the necessary information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) are scant .	This paper presents an exploratory framework for enabling information driven grid flexibility through the Internet of Things ( IoT ) , and a proof-of-concept wireless sensor gateway ( FlexBox ) to collect the necessary parameters for adequately monitoring and actuating the micro-level demand-side .	In the summer of 2015 , thirty sensor gateways were deployed in the city of Managua ( Nicaragua ) to develop a baseline for a near future small-scale demand response pilot implementation .
4	We finally discuss a conjecture claiming , in particular , that our second upper bound improves the classical one in infinitely many cases .	Let $ K\_ { [ k , t ] } $ be the complete graph on $ k $ vertices from which a set of edges , induced by a clique of order $ t $ , has been dropped .	In this note we give two explicit upper bounds for $ R ( K\_ { [ k\_1 , t\_1 ] } , \dots , K\_ { [ k\_r , t\_r ] } ) $ ( the smallest integer $ n $ such that for any $ r $ -edge coloring of $ K\_n $ there always occurs a monochromatic $ K\_ { [ k\_i , t\_i ] } $ for some $ i $ ) .	Our first upper bound contains a classical one in the case when $ k\_1=\cdots =k\_r $ and $ t\_i=1 $ for all $ i $ .	The second one is obtained by introducing a new edge coloring called { \em $ \chi\_r $ -colorings } .
0	Let f be an analytic function defined on a complex domain Omega and A be a ( n , n ) complex matrix .	We assume that there exists a unique alpha satisfying f ( alpha ) =0 .	When f ' ( alpha ) =0 and A is non derogatory , we solve completely the equation XA-AX=f ( X ) .	This generalizes Burde 's results .	When f ' ( alpha ) is not zero , we give a method to solve completely the equation XA-AX=f ( X ) : we reduce the problem to solve a sequence of Sylvester equations .
3	This includes ARMA and GARCH-processes as well as data from chaotic dynamical systems .	The validity of various bootstrapping methods has been proved for the sample mean of strongly mixing data .	But in many applications , there appear nonlinear statistics of processes that are not strongly mixing .	We investigate the nonoverlapping block bootstrap sequences which are near epoch dependent on strong mixing or absolutely regular processes .	We establish the strong consistency of the bootstrap distribution estimator not only for the sample mean , but also for U-statistics , which include examples as Gini 's mean difference or the chi^2-test statistic .
0	Cylindrical probability measures are finitely additive measures on Banach spaces that have sigma-additive projections to Euclidean spaces of all dimensions .	They are naturally associated to notions of weak ( cylindrical ) random variable and hence weak ( cylindrical ) stochastic processes .	In this paper we focus on cylindrical Levy processes .	These have ( weak ) Levy-Ito decompositions and an associated Levy-Khintchine formula .	If the process is weakly square integrable , its covariance operator can be used to construct a reproducing kernel Hilbert space in which the process has a decomposition as an infinite series built from a sequence of uncorrelated bona fide one-dimensional Levy processes .
0	We present a spectroscopic survey of the giant stellar stream found in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy .	Taken with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on the Keck2 telescope , these data display a narrow velocity dispersion of 11+/-3 km/s , with a steady radial velocity gradient of 245 km/s over the 125 kpc radial extent of the stream studied so far .	This implies that the Andromeda galaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo .	We fit the orbit of the stream in different galaxy potential models .	In a simple model with a composite bulge , disk and halo , where the halo follows a `` universal '' profile that is compressed by the formation of the baryonic components , we find that the kinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of 7.5^ ( +2.5 ) _ ( -1.3 ) x 10^ { 11 } M_Sun , or more than 5.4 x 10^ { 11 } M_Sun at the 99 % confidence level .
2	We use the following convention here : The EUV and UV span the regions ~100-912 and 912-3000 Angstroem respectively .	We describe telescopes and instruments that were developed and used for astronomical research in the ultraviolet ( UV ) and extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum .	The wavelength ranges covered by these bands are not uniquely defined .	The limitation between both ranges is a natural choice , because the hydrogen Lyman absorption edge is located at 912 Angstroem .	At smaller wavelengths , astronomical sources are strongly absorbed by the interstellar medium .
3	The new GUI was motivated primarily by the desire of more updated operations , more flexibility incorporating future and current improvements in producing atomic data .	We create a Python GUI scripting interface working under Windows in addition to ( UNIX/Linux ) .	The GUI has been built around the Python open-source programming language .	We use the Python 's GUI library that so called Python Mega Widgets ( PMW ) and based on Tkinter Python module ( http : //www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/tutgui.htm ) .	Furthermore it will be useful for a variety of applications of atomic physics , plasma physics and astrophysics and will help in calculating various atomic properties .
1	We analyze the partition function and main thermodynamic properties arising from perturbative thermal loops .	We develop the thermodynamics of field theories characterized by non-local propagators .	We focus on the p-adic models associated with the tachyon phenomenology in string theories .	We reproduce well known features of these theories , but also obtain many new results .	In particular , we explain how to maintain consistency of such non-local theories by avoiding the appearance of ghosts at finite temperature .
3	In the latter case , we also show that convergence to equilibrium is well described by the heat equation .	We consider a long Lorentz tube with absorbing boundaries .	Particles are injected to the tube from the left end .	We compute the equilibrium density profiles in two cases : the semi-infinite tube ( in which case the density is constant ) and a long finite tube ( in which case the density is linear ) .	In order to prove these results , we obtain new results for the Lorentz particle which are of independent interest .
4	The plausible interpretation of f_0 ( 1710 ) and X ( 1812 ) being K* K*bar dominated states is briefly discussed .	A dynamical coupled-channel study of K* K*bar state with isospin 0 and omega phi state is performed within both the chiral SU ( 3 ) quark model and the extended chiral SU ( 3 ) quark model by solving a resonating group method ( RGM ) equation .	The model parameters are taken from our previous work , which gave a satisfactory description of the energies of the octet and decuplet baryon ground states , the binding energy of the deuteron , the nucleon-nucleon ( NN ) scattering phase shifts , and the hyperon-nucleon ( YN ) cross sections .	The results show that the interactions of K* K*bar states are attractive , which consequently result in K* K*bar bound states with the binding energies of about 10-70 MeV , and contrarily , no omega phi bound state is obtained .	The channel coupling effect of K* K*bar and omega phi is found to be considerably large , which makes the binding of K* K*bar 5-45 MeV deeper .
2	In particular , we plan to study the properties of the onset of deconfinement and to search for the signatures of the critical point .	The NA61/SHINE at the CERN SPS is a new experiment to study hadron production in p+p p+A , h+A and A+A interactions .	The main goal of the NA61 ion program is to explore the phase diagram ( T - mu_B ) of strongly interacting matter .	A two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram will be performed by varying the energy ( 13A-158A GeV ) and system size ( p+p , Be+Be , Ar+Ca , Xe+La ) of collisions .	This paper summarizes the status and plans of the NA61/SHINE ion program .
1	This possibility evades all current constraints that assume that the self-interacting component makes up the majority of the dark matter .	We consider the cosmological consequences if a small fraction ( $ f\lesssim 0.1 $ ) of the dark matter is ultra-strongly self-interacting , with an elastic self-interaction cross-section per unit mass $ \sigma\gg1\ \mathrm { cm^ { 2 } /g } $ .	Nevertheless , even a small fraction of ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter ( uSIDM ) can have observable consequences on astrophysical scales .	In particular , the uSIDM subcomponent can undergo gravothermal collapse and form seed black holes in the center of a halo .	These seed black holes , which form within several hundred halo interaction times , contain a few percent of the total uSIDM mass in the halo .
2	The management of VM comprises computing resources exploitation in the monitoring of VM in entire lifecycle and physical resources management for VM on SMDs .	In Mobile Cloud Computing ( MCC ) , Virtual Machine ( VM ) migration based process offloading is a dominant approach to enhance Smart Mobile Devices ( SMDs ) .	A challenging aspect of VM deployment is the additional computing resources usage in the deployment and management of VM which obliges computing resources for VM creation and configuration .	Therefore , VM migration based application offloading requires additional computing resource .	Consequently computing resources demand and execution time of the application increases respectively .
4	These functions include fast and synchronized response to environmental change , or long-term memory about the transcriptional status .	The dynamics of gene transcription is tightly regulated in eukaryotes .	Recent experiments have revealed various kinds of transcriptional dynamics , such as RNA polymerase II pausing , that involves regulation at the transcription initiation stage , and the choice of different regulation pattern is closely related to the physiological functions of the target gene .	Here we consider a simplified model of transcription initiation , a process including the assembly of transcription complex and the pausing and releasing of the RNA polymerase II .	Focusing on the collective behaviors on a population level , we explore potential regulatory functions this model can offer .
3	A lower bound for the Higgs mass arises for the class of standard bare potentials of \phi^4 type from the requirement of a well-defined functional integral ( i.e. , stability of the bare potential ) .	We study a chiral Yukawa model mimicking the Higgs-top-bottom sector of the standard model .	We re-analyze the conventional arguments that relate a lower bound for the Higgs mass with vacuum stability in the light of exact results for the regularized fermion determinant as well as in the framework of the functional renormalization group .	In both cases , we find no indication for vacuum instability nor meta-stability induced by top-fluctuations if the cutoff is kept finite but arbitrary .	This consistency bound can however be relaxed considerably by more general forms of the bare potential without necessarily introducing new meta-stable minima .
0	BaR-SPOrt ( Balloon-borne Radiometers for Sky Polarisation Observations ) is an experiment to measure the linearly polarized emission of sky patches at 32 and 90 GHz with sub-degree angular resolution .	It is equipped with high sensitivity correlation polarimeters for simultaneous detection of both the U and Q stokes parameters of the incident radiation .	On-axis telescope is used to observe angular scales where the expected polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMBP ) peaks .	This project shares most of the know-how and sophisticated technology developed for the SPOrt experiment onboard the International Space Station .	The payload is designed to flight onboard long duration stratospheric balloons both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres where low foreground emission sky patches are accessible .
1	Hultman shows that T_G and Q_G are homotopy equivalent and Cohen-Macaulay , and determines the rank of their top homology .	Given a finite group G and a natural number n , we study the structure of the complex of nested sets of the associated Dowling lattice Q ( G ) and of its subposet of the G-symmetric partitions Q_G which was recently introduced by Hultman together with the complex of G-symmetric phylogenetic trees T_G .	An application of the theory of building sets and nested set complexes by Feichtner and Kozlov shows that in fact T_G is subdivided by the order complex of Q_G .	We introduce the complex of Dowling trees T ( G ) and prove that it is subdivided by the order complex of Q ( G ) and contains T_G as a subcomplex .	We show that T ( G ) is obtained from T_G by successive coning over certain subcomplexes .
2	By the Robertson-Seymour graph minor theorem , $ \mathcal { D } _k $ is characterised by a finite family of minor-minimal forbidden graphs , which we denote by $ \widehat { \mathcal { D } } _k $ .	Let $ \mathcal { D } _k $ be the class of graphs for which every minor has minimum degree at most $ k $ .	Then $ \mathcal { D } _k $ is closed under taking minors .	This paper discusses $ \widehat { \mathcal { D } } _k $ and related topics .	We obtain four main results : We prove that every $ ( k+1 ) $ -regular graph with less than $ { 4/3 } ( k+2 ) $ vertices is in $ \widehat { \mathcal { D } } _k $ , and this bound is best possible .
3	Ongoing analysis has led to the identification of three candidates .	A 52'X52 ' field in the Lupus Galactic plane was observed with the ANU 1m telescope for 53 nights during 2005 and 2006 in a search for transiting Hot Jupiter planets .	A total of 2200 images were obtained .	We have sampled 120,000 stars via differential photometry , of which ~26,000 have sufficient photometric accuracy ( & lt ; =2.5 % ) with which to perform a search for transiting planets .	We present an overview of the project , including the results of radial velocity analysis performed on the first candidate ( Lupus-TR-1 ) with the 4m AAT telescope .
4	Thus , the violations of relativistic causality by evanescent particles can be considered as the tunneling , as an analog of the short-term violation of conservation laws at virtual transitions .	The refinement and specifications of time-energy uncertainty relations have shown that the experimentally observed phenomena of superluminal signaling are describable by such their form : $ \Delta E\Delta\tau\geq\pi\hbar $ , where both standard deviations are negative .	When $ \Delta\tau & lt ; 0 $ , these evanescent photons would be instantly tunneling from one light cone into another on the distance $ c| \Delta\tau| $ .	( This assertion , previously proved via dispersion relations , is described here by the temporal parameters of process . )	Special forms of these relations describe the transmutation of particles into their partners of bigger mass , in $ K^ { 0 } $ and $ B^ { 0 } $ cases and at the $ \nu $ 's transmutations .
0	The supersymmetric extension of `` Starobinsky '' $ R+\alpha R^2 $ models of inflation is particularly simple in the `` new minimal '' formalism of supergravity , where the inflaton has no scalar superpartners .	This paper is devoted to matter couplings in such supergravity models .	We show how in the new minimal formalism matter coupling presents certain features absent in other formalisms .	In particular , for the large class of matter couplings considered in this paper , matter must possess an R-symmetry , which is gauged by the vector field which becomes dynamical in the `` new minimal '' completion of the $ R+\alpha R^2 $ theory .	Thus , in the dual formulation of the theory , where the gauge vector is part of a massive vector multiplet , the inflaton is the superpartner of the massive vector of a nonlinearly realized R-symmetry .
0	Stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool ( T ~ 20-30 K ) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies , which implies that the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk should depend on Hubble type .	We investigate the differences between cool dust temperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fitting models to measurements between 70 and 500 microns .	We attempt to quantify temperature trends in nearby disk galaxies , with archival data from Spitzer/MIPS and new observations with Herschel/SPIRE , which were acquired during the first phases of the Herschel observations for the KINGFISH ( key insights in nearby galaxies : a far-infrared survey with Herschel ) sample .	We fit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimeter measurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine the temperature of the component ( s ) emitting at those wavelengths .	We present the ratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13 nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type .
1	Let F be a fully nonlinear second-order partial differential subequation of degenerate elliptic type on a manifold X .	We study the problem of removable singularities for degenerate elliptic equations .	We study the question : Which closed subsets E in X have the property that every F-subharmonic function ( subsolution ) on X-E , which is locally bounded across E , extends to an F-subharmonic function on X .	We also study the related question for F-harmonic functions ( solutions ) which are continuous across E. Main results assert that if there exists a convex cone subequation M such that F+M is contained in F , then any closed set E which is M-polar has these properties .	To be M-polar means that E = { f = -\infty } where f is M-subharmonic on X and smooth outside of E. Many examples and generalizations are given .
4	We show their connection through the $ ( V-A ) $ spin correlation between the charged lepton and the top quark with different polarization states .	Forward-backward asymmetries $ A_ { FB } ^t $ and $ A_ { FB } ^\ell $ are observed in the top quark $ t $ rapidity distribution and in the rapidity distribution of charged leptons $ \ell $ from top quark decay at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider , and a charge asymmetry $ A_C $ is seen in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) .	In this paper , we update our previous studies of the Tevatron asymmetries using the most recent data .	We provide expectations for $ A_C $ at the LHC based first on model independent extrapolations from the Tevatron , and second based on new physics models that can explain the Tevatron asymmetries .	We examine the relationship of the two asymmetries $ A_ { FB } ^t $ and $ A_ { FB } ^\ell $ .
3	We then analyze the instability of the antiferromagnetic system in two spatial dimensions by studying the non-perturbative behaviour of the Higgs boson self-energy using the Dyson -- Schwinger equations .	We discuss the stability of the antiferromagnetic ground state in two spatial dimensions .	We start with a general analysis , based on Gribov 's current-conservation techniques , of the bosonic modes in systems with magnetic order .	We argue that the Goldstone $ \phi $ and Higgs $ h $ modes mix in antiferromagnetic systems , and this leads to an effective $ hh\phi $ three-point interaction .	The ground state turns out to be unstable for all values of the three-point coupling .
2	Power spectral analysis using the CLEAN algorithm was performed to search for evidence of periodic variability .	We present photometric light curves for a sample of 21 ultra cool M and L dwarfs in the field and in the young open clusters sigma Orionis and the Pleiades .	Evidence for variability with RMS amplitudes ( in the I band ) of 0.01 to 0.055 magnitudes on timescales of 0.4 to 100 hours is discovered in half of these objects .	Some objects show strong periodicities at around a few hours , which could be due to rotational modulation of the light curve by surface features .	However , several objects do not have any significant periodicities to explain their variability .
3	have been the object of intense studies and the obtained results provide convincing evidence of the importance of a non-equilibrium state of high angle grain boundaries for UFG materials with unusual properties .	Grain boundaries in ultrafine grained ( UFG ) materials processed by severe plastic deformation ( SPD ) are often called `` non-equilibrium '' grain boundaries .	Such boundaries are characterized by excess grain boundary energy , presence of long range elastic stresses and enhanced free volumes .	These features and related phenomena ( diffusion , segregation , etc . )	The aims of the present paper are first to give a short overview of this research field and then to consider tangled , yet unclear issues and outline the ways of oncoming studies .
2	In this note , we characterize a slightly smaller class of contractions using a stronger form of the curvature inequality .	The curvature $ \mathcal K_T ( w ) $ of a contraction $ T $ in the Cowen-Douglas class $ B_1 ( \mathbb D ) $ is bounded above by the curvature $ \mathcal K_ { S^* } ( w ) $ of the backward shift operator .	However , in general , an operator satisfying the curvature inequality need not be contractive .	Along the way , we find conditions on the metric of the holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle $ E_T $ corresponding to the operator $ T $ in the Cowen-Douglas class $ B_1 ( \mathbb D ) $ which ensures negative definiteness of the curvature function .	We obtain a generalization for commuting tuples of operators in the class $ B_1 ( \Omega ) $ , for a bounded domain $ \Omega $ in $ \mathbb C^m $ .
4	We obtain our results not by employing a more general formula for the trace of Hecke operators on spaces of Hilbert modular forms , but instead by using basic properties of newforms which were proven for elliptic modular forms by Li , and Atkin and Li , and later extended to Hilbert modular forms by Shemanske and Walling .	Let $ \mathscr { S } _k^+ ( \cn , \Phi ) $ denote the space generated by Hilbert modular newforms ( over a fixed totally real field $ K $ ) of weight $ k $ , level $ \cn $ and Hecke character $ \Phi $ .	We show how to decompose $ \mathscr { S } _k^+ ( \cn , \Phi ) $ into direct sums of twists of other spaces of newforms .	This sheds light on the behavior of a newform under a character twist : the exact level of the twist of a newform , when such a twist is itself a newform , and when a newform may be realized as the twist of a primitive newform .	These results were proven for elliptic modular forms by Hijikata , Pizer and Shemanske by employing a formula for the trace of the Hecke operator $ T_k ( n ) $ .
4	Using a Bayesian analysis of the velocity-resolved Stokes $ V $ profiles to infer the magnetic field characteristics , we tentatively derive a dipole field strength of $ 1680^ { +134 } _ { -356 } $ G. The derived field strength and wind characteristics imply a wind that is strongly confined by the magnetic field .	We report the detection of a strong , organised magnetic field in the O9IV star HD 57682 , using spectropolarimetric observations obtained with ESPaDOnS at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope within the context of the Magnetism in Massive Stars ( MiMeS ) Large Program .	From the fitting of our spectra using NLTE model atmospheres we determined that HD 57682 is a $ 17^ { +19 } _ { -9 } $ M $ _ { \odot } $ star with a radius of $ 7.0^ { +2.4 } _ { -1.8 } $ R $ _\odot $ , and a relatively low mass-loss rate of $ 1.4^ { +3.1 } _ { -0.95 } \times10^ { -9 } $ M $ _ { \odot } $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ .	The photospheric absorption lines are narrow , and we use the Fourier transform technique to infer $ v\sin i=15\pm3 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ .	This $ v\sin i $ implies a maximum rotational period of 31.5 d , a value qualitatively consistent with the observed variability of the optical absorption and emission lines , as well as the Stokes $ V $ profiles and longitudinal field .
4	We apply our main theorem to a semilinear beam equation and to a nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger equation with smoothing nonlinearity .	In this paper we give an extension of the Birkhoff -- Lewis theorem to some semilinear PDEs .	Accordingly we prove existence of infinitely many periodic orbits with large period accumulating at the origin .	Such periodic orbits bifurcate from resonant finite dimensional invariant tori of the fourth order normal form of the system .	Besides standard nonresonance and nondegeneracy assumptions , our main result is obtained assuming a regularizing property of the nonlinearity .
3	Although discovered only three years after the pioneering work of Bednorz and Muller , the physical origin of this pseudogap behavior and whether it constitutes a distinct phase of matter is still shrouded in mystery .	Although nineteen years have passed since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity , there is still no consensus on its physical origin .	This is in large part because of a lack of understanding of the state of matter out of which the superconductivity arises .	In optimally and underdoped materials , this state exhibits a pseudogap at temperatures large compared to the superconducting transition temperature .	In the summer of 2004 , a band of physicists gathered for five weeks at the Aspen Center for Physics to discuss the pseudogap .
1	Starting from the phenomenological interaction DD-ME2 with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings , we construct a family of point-coupling effective interactions for different values of the strength parameter of the isoscalar-scalar derivative term .	We study the relation between the finite-range ( meson-exchange ) and zero-range ( point-coupling ) representations of effective nuclear interactions in the relativistic mean-field framework .	In the meson-exchange picture this corresponds to different values of the $ \sigma $ -meson mass .	The parameters of the isoscalar-scalar and isovector-vector channels of the point-coupling interactions are adjusted to nuclear matter and ground-state properties of finite nuclei .	By comparing results for infinite and semi-infinite nuclear matter , ground-state masses , charge radii , and collective excitations , we discuss constraints on the parameters of phenomenological point-coupling relativistic effective interaction .
1	This family bridges an energy space ( containing weak solutions to Navier-Stokes equation ) to a critical space ( invariant through the canonical scaling of the Navier-Stokes equation ) .	In this article , a non linear family of spaces , based on the energy dissipation , is introduced .	This family is used to get uniform estimates on higher derivatives to solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations .	Those estimates are uniform , up to the possible blowing-up time .	The proof uses blow-up techniques .
3	SN 2012ca is a member of the set of type of the ambiguous IIn/Ia-CSM SNe , the nature of which have been debated extensively in the literature .	We present the complete set of ultra-violet , optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy for SN 2012ca , covering the period from 6~days prior to maximum light , until 531 days after maximum .	The spectroscopic time series for SN 2012ca is essentially unchanged over 1.5 years , and appear to be dominated at all epochs by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium rather than the underlying supernova ( SN ) .	At late phases , we see a near infrared excess in flux which is possibly associated with dust formation , although without any signs of accompanying line shifts .	The two leading scenarios are either a type Ia SN exploding within a dense CSM from a non-degenerate , evolved companion , or a core-collapse SN from a massive star .
2	Our study concentrates on clean intrinsic graphene , where the spin-orbit coupling from the adatoms can be neglected .	Electron spin relaxation in graphene on a substrate is investigated from the fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach .	All the relevant scatterings , such as the electron-impurity , electron -- acoustic-phonon , electron -- optical-phonon , electron -- remote-interfacial-phonon , as well as electron-electron Coulomb scatterings , are explicitly included .	We discuss the effect of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction on spin relaxation under various conditions .	It is shown that the electron-electron Coulomb scattering plays an important role in spin relaxation at high temperature .
1	The transition to this new form of matter as well as properties of the plasma phase are studied in large scale numerical calculations based on the theory of strong interactions - Quantum Chromo Dynamics ( QCD ) .	At high temperatures or densities matter formed by strongly interacting elementary particles ( hadronic matter ) is expected to undergo a transition to a new form of matter - the quark gluon plasma - in which elementary particles ( quarks and gluons ) are no longer confined inside hadrons but are free to propagate in a thermal medium much larger in extent than the typical size of a hadron .	Experimentally properties of hot and dense elementary particle matter are studied in relativistic heavy ion collisions such as those currently performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( RHIC ) at BNL .	We review here recent results from studies of thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting elementary particle matter performed on Teraflops-Computer .	We present results on the QCD equation of state and discuss the status of studies of the phase diagram at non-vanishing baryon number density .
0	We present in this paper the design and characterisation of a new sub-system of the VLTI 2nd generation instrument GRAVITY : the Calibration Unit .	The Calibration Unit provides all functions to test and calibrate the beam combiner instrument : it creates two artificial stars on four beams , and dispose of four delay lines with an internal metrology .	It also includes artificial stars for the tip-tilt and pupil guiding systems , as well as four metrology pick-up diodes , for tests and calibration of the corresponding sub-systems .	The calibration unit also hosts the reference targets to align GRAVITY to the VLTI , and the safety shutters to avoid the metrology light to propagate in the VLTI-lab .	We present the results of the characterisation and validtion of these differrent sub-units .
0	This paper presents adaptive bidirectional minimum mean-square error parameter estimation algorithms for fast-fading channels .	The time correlation between successive channel gains is exploited to improve the estimation and tracking capabilities of adaptive algorithms and provide robustness against time-varying channels .	Bidirectional normalized least mean-square and conjugate gradient algorithms are devised along with adaptive mixing parameters that adjust to the time-varying channel correlation properties .	An analysis of the proposed algorithms is provided along with a discussion of their performance advantages .	Simulations for an application to interference suppression in multiuser DS-CDMA systems show the advantages of the proposed algorithms .
3	The spiking classifiers are coupled with a temporally-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm , which allows the system to perform temporal state decomposition by appropriately rewarding `` macro-actions , '' created by chaining together multiple atomic actions .	Learning Classifier Systems ( LCS ) are population-based reinforcement learners that were originally designed to model various cognitive phenomena .	This paper presents an explicitly cognitive LCS by using spiking neural networks as classifiers , providing each classifier with a measure of temporal dynamism .	We employ a constructivist model of growth of both neurons and synaptic connections , which permits a Genetic Algorithm ( GA ) to automatically evolve sufficiently-complex neural structures .	The combination of temporal reinforcement learning and neural information processing is shown to outperform benchmark neural classifier systems , and successfully solve a robotic navigation task .
1	For this purpose , we introduce the concept of a hypothetical Peierls barrier , which reproduces all the aspects of the dislocation glide at 0 K resulting from the complex response to non-glide stresses and is expressed in a compact form by the yield criteria advanced in Part II .	In this paper we develop a link between the atomic-level modeling of the glide of 1/2 & lt ; 111 & gt ; screw dislocations at 0 K and the thermally activated motion of these dislocations via nucleation of pairs of kinks .	To achieve this the barrier is dependent not only on the crystal symmetry and interatomic bonding but also on the applied stress tensor .	Standard models are then employed to evaluate the activation enthalpy of kink-pairs formation , which is now also a function of the full applied stress tensor .	The transition states theory links then this mechanism with the temperature and strain rate dependence of the yield stress .
1	We present three ways of viewing these pseudo-dualities : as a series of transformations in the STU model , as a combination of Melvin twists and T-dualities and , finally , as a sequence of two generalized spectral flows and a coordinate transformation .	We show that the six-dimensional uplift of the five-dimensional Near-Horizon-Extremal-Kerr ( NHEK ) spacetime can be obtained from an AdS_3 X S^3 solution by a sequence of supergravity - but not string theory - dualities .	We then use these to find an infinite family of asymptotically flat embeddings of NHEK spacetimes in string theory , parameterized by the arbitrary values of the moduli at infinity .	Our construction reveals the existence of non-perturbative deformations of asymptotically-NHEK spacetimes , which correspond to the bubbling of nontrivial cycles wrapped by flux , and paves the way for finding a microscopic field theory dual to NHEK which involves Melvin twists of the D1-D5 gauge theory .	Our analysis also clarifies the meaning of the generalized spectral flow solution-generating techniques that have been recently employed in the literature .
4	However , there will also be a dramatic increase in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe contribution at low multipoles .	We discuss the time dependence and future of the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) in the context of the standard cosmological model , in which we are now entering a state of endless accelerated expansion .	The mean temperature will simply decrease until it reaches the effective temperature of the de Sitter vacuum , while the dipole will oscillate as the Sun orbits the Galaxy .	However , the higher CMB multipoles have a richer phenomenology .	The CMB anisotropy power spectrum will for the most part simply project to smaller scales , as the comoving distance to last scattering increases , and we derive a scaling relation that describes this behaviour .
2	This is a simple idea but can be challenging for the user in practice which leads to infrequent usage .	The rise in popularity of microblogging services like Twitter has led to increased use of content annotation strategies like the hashtag .	Hashtags provide users with a tagging mechanism to help organize , group , and create visibility for their posts .	In this paper , we will investigate various methods of recommending hashtags as new posts are created to encourage more widespread adoption and usage .	Hashtag recommendation comes with numerous challenges including processing huge volumes of streaming data and content which is small and noisy .
4	Moreover , the comparison of our toy model with the observable data and simulations leads to the following preferable NFW parameters for the Coma cluster : $ R_ { 200 } \approx 1.77\ , h^ { -1 } \ , \mathrm { Mpc } = 2.61\ , \mathrm { Mpc } $ , $ c=3\div 4 $ and $ M_ { 200 } = 1.29 h^ { -1 } \times10^ { 15 } M_ { \odot } $ .	We investigate dark and visible matter distribution in the Coma cluster in the case of the Navarro-Frenk-White ( NFW ) profile .	A toy model where all galaxies in the cluster are concentrated inside a sphere of an effective radius $ R_ { eff } $ is considered .	It enables to obtain the mean velocity dispersion as a function of $ R_ { eff } $ .	We show that , within the observation accuracy of the NFW parameters , the calculated value of $ R_ { eff } $ can be rather close to the observable cutoff of the galaxy distribution .
3	The MINIBALL germanium array was used to detect gamma rays from the excited states in 12Be .	The bound states of 12Be have been studied through a 11Be ( d , p ) 12Be transfer reaction experiment in inverse kinematics .	A 2.8 MeV/u beam of 11Be was produced using the REX-ISOLDE facility at CERN .	The outgoing protons were detected with the T-REX silicon detector array .	The gamma-ray detection enabled a clear identification of the four known bound states in 12Be , and each of the states has been studied individually .
2	The collimation effect has been studied versus the order of the Laguerre-Gaussian mode ( up to 10 ) and the laser atom frequency detuning ( 2 to 120 GHz ) .	Using a blue detuned laser shaped in a Laguerre-Gaussian donut mode we highly collimate the output of a two dimensional magneto-optical trap .	The resulting atomic beam has a 1 mm diameter , its divergence is reduced from 40 down to 3 mrad and the atomic density is increased by a factor of 200 .	The 2D-colli-MOT study allows us to determine the best conditions which minimize the atom heating due to residual light absorption and optimize the collimation effect .	The 2D-colli MOT could provide a new tool to fill a 3D-MOT using lasers with millimeter range diameters and thus sparing the laser power .
2	The process is described by a set of time-dependent continuity equations for the electrons , positive and negative ions ; gas and vibrational temperature ; and equations which account for the convective heat and plasma losses by the transverse flux .	We study the dynamic contraction a self-sustained glow discharge in air in a rectangular duct with convective cooling .	A two dimensional numerical model of the plasma contraction was developed in a cylindrical frame .	Transition from the uniform to contracted state was analyzed .	It was shown that such transition experiences a hysteresis , and that the critical current of the transition increases when the gas density drops .
3	The optical theorem for free particles gives a relation between the effective Hamiltonian and the cross section , a relation that is valid also when bound states are present .	The standard S-matrix formulation can not generally be used in the treatment of atomic scattering processes , involving bound-state QED effects , due to the special type of singularity that can here appear .	This type of singularity can be handled by means of methods designed for structure calculations .	It is essentially a consequence of the optical theorem that similar techniques can be applied also in scattering processes .	We have found that the method with the Covariant-evolution-operator/Green 's operator that we have developed primarily for structure problems can here be applied in a rather straightforward manner .
4	We also compare the magnetic masses obtained here with those obtained using finite temperature lattice QCD methods at similar temperatures at RHIC and LHC .	The infrared behaviour of the medium modified gluon propagator in non-equilibrium situations is studied in the covariant gauge using the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time path formalism .	It is shown that the magnetic screening mass is non-zero at the one loop level whenever the initial gluon distribution function is non isotropic with the assumption that the distribution function of the gluon is not divergent at zero transverse momentum .	For isotropic gluon distribution functions , such as those describing local equilibrium , the magnetic mass at one loop level is zero which is consistent with finite temperature field theory results .	Assuming that a reasonable initial gluon distribution function can be obtained from a perturbative QCD calculation of minijets , we determine these out of equilibrium values for the initial magnetic and Debye screening masses at energy densities appropriate to RHIC and LHC .
1	$ N $ decays to \chi e^+e^- via a dimension 6 operator induced by a penguin-type one loop diagram with the life time of 10^ { 26 } sec. , explaining energetic cosmic e^\pm excess observed recently by PAMELA and ATIC/PPB-BETS .	We discuss dark matter decay mediated by exotically charged particles ( `` exotics '' ) in a supersymmetric model with two dark matter ( DM ) components : One is the ( bino-like ) lightest supersymmetric particle ( LSP ) \chi , and the other is a newly introduced meta-stable neutral singlet $ N $ .	The superheavy masses of exotics ( \sim 10^ { 15-16 } GeV ) are responsible for the longevity of $ N $ .	The superpartner of $ N $ develops the vacuum expectation value ( VEV ) of order TeV so that the DM $ N $ achieves the desired mass of 2 TeV .	By the VEV , the U ( 1 ) _R symmetry is broken to the discrete Z_2 symmetry , which is identified with the matter parity in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( MSSM ) .
2	Given a modular category C , a rational conformal field theory can be constructed from a Frobenius algebra A in C. We show that if C contains a symmetric special Frobenius algebra A such that the torus partition function Z ( A ) of the corresponding conformal field theory is non-trivial , implying reducibility of the genus 1 representation of the modular group , then the representation of the genus g mapping class group constructed from C is reducible for every g\geq 1 .	We review and extend the results of [ 1 ] that gives a condition for reducibility of quantum representations of mapping class groups constructed from Reshetikhin-Turaev type topological quantum field theories based on modular categories .	This criterion is derived using methods developed to describe rational conformal field theories , making use of Frobenius algebras and their representations in modular categories .	We also extend the number of examples where we can show reducibility significantly by establishing the existence of algebras with the required properties using methods developed by Fuchs , Runkel and Schweigert .	As a result we show that the quantum representations are reducible in the SU ( N ) case , N & gt ; 2 , for all levels k\in \mathbb { N } .
0	We study six groups and clusters of galaxies suggested in the literature to be `fossil ' systems ( i.e.to have luminous diffuse X-ray emission and a magnitude gap of at least 2 mag-R between the first and the second ranked member within half of the virial radius ) , each having good quality X-ray data and SDSS spectroscopic or photometric coverage out to the virial radius .	The poor cluster AWM4 is clearly established as a fossil system , and we confirm the fossil nature of four other systems ( RXJ1331.5+1108 , RXJ1340.6+4018 , RXJ1256.0+2556 and RXJ1416.4+2315 ) , while the cluster RXJ1552.2+2013 is disqualified as fossil system .	For all systems we present the luminosity functions within 0.5 and 1 virial radius that are consistent , within the uncertainties , with the universal luminosity function of clusters .	For the five bona fide fossil systems , having a mass range 2x10^13-3x10^14 M_Sun , we compute accurate cumulative substructure distribution functions ( CSDFs ) and compare them with the CSDFs of observed and simulated groups/clusters available in the literature .	We demonstrate that the CSDFs of fossil systems are consistent with those of normal observed clusters and do not lack any substructure with respect to simulated galaxy systems in the cosmological LambdaCDM framework .
1	Addressing the atomic orbitals at the neck of the nanocontact , we find that the local band structure deviates strongly from bulk fcc aluminium .	We present results of electronic structure calculations for aluminium contacts of atomic size , based on density functional theory and the local density approximation .	In particular , hybridization between Al 3s and 3p states is fully suppressed due to directed bonds at the contact .	Moreover , a charge transfer of 0.6 electrons off the contact aluminium site is found .	Both the suppressed hybridization and the violated charge neutrality are characteristic features of metallic nanocontacts .
2	We consider the cases of a finite lattice and infinite lattice separately .	Matrix models have been shown to be equivalent to noncommutative field theories .	In this work we study noncommutative X-Y model and try to understand Kosterlitz Thouless transition in it by analysing the equivalent matrix model .	We show that the critical value of the matrix model coupling is identical for the finite and infinite lattice cases .	However , the critical values of the coupling of the continuum field theory , in the large $ N $ limit , is finite in the infinite lattice case and zero in the case of finite lattice .
3	These models have topological sectors labeled by group products along topologically non-trivial loops .	We present Monte Carlo simulations on a new class of lattice models in which the degrees of freedom are elements of an abelian or non-abelian finite symmetry group G , placed on directed edges of a two-dimensional lattice .	The plaquette group product is constrained to be the group identity .	In contrast to discrete gauge models ( but similar to past work on height models ) only elements of symmetry-related subsets S of G are allowed on edges .	Measurement of relative sector probabilities and the distribution of distance between defect pairs are done to characterize the types of order ( topological or quasi-LRO ) exhibited by these models .
0	Relativistic third-order MBPT is applied to obtain energies of ions with two valence electrons in the no virtual-pair approximation ( NVPA ) .	A total of 302 third-order Goldstone diagrams are organized into 12 one-body and 23 two-body terms .	Only third-order two-body terms and diagrams are presented here , owing to the fact that the one-body terms are identical to the previously studied third-order terms in monovalent ions .	Dominant classes of diagrams are identified .	The model potential is a Dirac-Hartree-Fock $ V^ { N-2 } $ potential , and B-spline basis functions in a cavity of finite radius are employed in the numerical calculations .
4	In this Letter , we prove a useful formula , which makes it possible to investigate this conjectured universality in arbitrary dimensions for the maximally symmetric black holes in general Lovelock gravity and $ f ( R ) $ gravity .	It is proposed by Cvetic et al [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	106 ( 2011 ) 121301 ] that the product of all horizon areas for general rotating multi-change black holes has universal expressions independent of the mass .	When we consider the product of all horizon entropies , however , the mass will be present in some cases , while another new universal property [ JHEP 1401 ( 2014 ) 031 ] is preserved , which is more general and says that the sum of all horizon entropies depends only on the coupling constants of the theory and the topology of the black hole .	The property has been studied in limited dimensions and the generalization in arbitrary dimensions is not straight-forward .
0	We present a design for high energy density laboratory experiments studying the interaction of hypersonic shocks with a large number of inhomogeneities .	These `` clumpy '' flows are relevant to a wide variety of astrophysical environments including the evolution of molecular clouds , outflows from young stars , Planetary Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei .	The experiment consists of a strong shock ( driven by a pulsed power machine or a high intensity laser ) impinging on a region of randomly placed plastic rods .	We discuss the goals of the specific design and how they are met by specific choices of target components .	An adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic code is used to analyze the design and establish a predictive baseline for the experiments .
4	Our OCaml implementation seems to be the first theorem prover for CPDL .	We give an optimal ( EXPTIME ) , sound and complete tableau-based algorithm for deciding satisfiability for propositional dynamic logic with converse ( CPDL ) which does not require the use of analytic cut .	Our main contribution is a sound methodto combine our previous optimal method for tracking least fix-points in PDL with our previous optimal method for handling converse in the description logic ALCI .	The extension is non-trivial as the two methods can not be combined naively .	We give sufficient details to enable an implementation by others .
0	The type IIB supergravity solution describing a collection of regular and fractional D3 branes on the conifold ( hep-th/0002159 ) was recently generalized to the case of the deformed conifold ( hep-th/0007191 ) .	Here we present another generalization -- when the conifold is replaced by the resolved conifold .	This solution can be found in two different ways : ( i ) by first explicitly constructing the Ricci-flat Kahler metric on resolved conifold and then solving the supergravity equations for the D3-brane ansatz with constant dilaton and ( self-dual ) 3-form fluxes ; ( ii ) by generalizing the `` conifold '' ansatz of hep-th/0002159 in a natural `` asymmetric '' way so that the 1-d action describing radial evolution still admits a superpotential and then solving the resulting 1-st order system .	The superpotentials for the `` resolved '' and `` deformed '' conifold cases turn out to have essentially the same simple structure .	The solution in the resolved conifold case has the same asymptotic UV behaviour as in the conifold case , but unlike the deformed conifold case is still singular in the IR .
4	The suggested lattice diffusion equations can be considered as a new microstructural basis of space-fractional diffusion in nonlocal media .	Fractional diffusion equations for three-dimensional lattice models based on fractional-order differences of the Grunwald-Letnikov type are suggested .	These lattice fractional diffusion equations contain difference operators that describe long-range jumps from one lattice site to other .	In continuum limit , the suggested lattice diffusion equations with non-integer order differences give the diffusion equations with the Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives for continuum .	We propose a consistent derivation of the fractional diffusion equation with the fractional derivatives of Grunwald-Letnikov type .
2	But the relative computation cost of the pairing is approximately twenty times higher than that of the scalar multiplication over elliptic curve group .	Certificateless public key cryptography simplifies the complex certificate management in the traditional public key cryptography and resolves the key escrow problem in identity-based cryptography .	Many certificateless authenticated key agreement protocols using bilinear pairings have been proposed .	Recently , several certificateless authenticated key agreement protocols without pairings were proposed to improve the performance .	In this paper , we propose a new certificateless authenticated key agreement protocol without pairing .
4	A further change in the spectrum is observed at 7.5 GPa related to a scheelite-to-fergusonite transition .	Room-temperature Raman scattering has been measured in barium tungstate ( BaWO4 ) up to 16 GPa .	We report the pressure dependence of all the Raman-active first-order phonons of the tetragonal scheelite phase ( BaWO4-I , space group I41/a ) , which is stable at normal conditions .	As pressure increases the Raman spectrum undergoes significant changes around 6.9 GPa due to the onset of the structural phase transition to the monoclinic BaWO4-II phase ( space group P21/n ) .	This transition is only completed above 9.5 GPa .
1	The QoS information parameter includes New Connection Blocking Probability ( NCBP ) , Hand off Connection Dropping Probability ( HCDP ) and Connection Outage Probability ( COP ) .	In this paper , a new technique for cross layer design , based on present Eb/N0 ( bit energy per noise density ) ratio of the connections and target values of the Quality of Service ( QoS ) information parameters from MAC layer , is proposed to dynamically select the Modulation and Coding Scheme ( MCS ) at the PHY layer for WiMAX Broadband Wireless Access ( BWA ) networks .	In addition , a Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio ( SINR ) based Call Admission Control ( CAC ) algorithm and Queue based Scheduling algorithm are integrated for the cross layer design .	An analytical model using the Continuous Time Markov Chain ( CTMC ) is developed for performance evaluation of the algorithms under various MCS .	The effect of Eb/No is observed for QoS information parameters in order to determine its optimum range .
1	Contrary to previous calculations , no expansion in the mass ratio mc/mb is performed , and all the possible Dirac and flavor structures are included .	We evaluate two-loop b - & gt ; s gamma matrix elements of all the four-quark operators containing no derivatives .	Consequently , we are able to provide the last item in the NLO analysis of B - & gt ; Xs gamma that has been missing so far , namely the two-loop matrix elements of the QCD-penguin operators .	Due to smallness of the Wilson coefficients of those operators in the Standard Model , their effect on the branching ratio is small : a reduction by roughly 1 % .	We find BR [ B - & gt ; Xs gamma ] _ { E_gamma & gt ; 1.6 GeV } = ( 3.57 +_ 0.30 ) *10^ { -4 } .
4	The third model , MM2 , is a minimal one constructed ad hoc and in this article it plays a central role .	The step bunching instability is studied in three models of step motion defined in terms of ordinary differential equations ( ODE ) .	The source of instability in these models is step-step attraction , it is opposed by step-step repulsion and the developing surface patterns reflect the balance between the two .	The first model , TE2 , is a generalization of the seminal model of Tersoff et al . ( 1995 ) .	The second one , LW2 , is obtained from the model of Liu and Weeks ( 1998 ) using the repulsions term to construct the attractions one with retained possibility to change the parameters in the two independently .
0	We define two classes of topological infinite degree covering maps modeled on two families of transcendental holomorphic maps .	The first , which we call exponential maps of type $ ( p , q ) $ , are branched covers and is modeled on transcendental entire maps of the form $ P e^ { Q } $ , where $ P $ and $ Q $ are polynomials of degrees $ p $ and $ q $ .	The second is the class of universal covering maps from the plane to the sphere with two removed points modeled on transcendental meromorphic maps with two asymptotic values .	The problem we address is to give a combinatorial characterization of the holomorphic maps contained in these classes whose post-singular sets are finite .	The main results in this paper are that a post-singularly finite topological exponential map of type $ ( 0,1 ) $ or a certain post-singularly finite topological exponential map of type $ ( p,1 ) $ or a post-singularly finite universal covering map from the plane to the sphere with two points removed is combinatorially equivalent to a holomorphic same type map if and only if this map has bounded geometry .
3	The main task is to facilitate the creation and deletion of job templates , which are the elements describing the jobs to be run .	Parameter sweeping is a widely used algorithmic technique in computational science .	It is specially suited for high-throughput computing since the jobs evaluating the parameter space are loosely coupled or independent .	A tool that integrates the modeling of a parameter study with the control of jobs in a distributed architecture is presented .	Extra functionality relies upon the GridWay Metascheduler , acting as the middleware layer for job submission and control .
3	The ratios of neutrino and charged lepton decay modes in baryon decay may also be related to neutrino oscillation parameters .	We discuss systematically the fermion mass and mixing matrices in a generic \linebreak field-theoretical flipped $ SU ( 5 ) $ model , with particular applications to neutrino and baryon number-changing physics .	We demonstrate that the different quark flavour branching ratios in proton decay are related to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angles , whereas the lepton flavour branching ratios are undetermined .	The light neutrino mixing angles observable via oscillation effects are related to the heavy conjugate ( right-handed ) neutrino mass matrix , which also plays a key role in cosmological baryogenesis .	Plausible Ans\ '' atze for the generation structure of coupling matrices motivate additional relations between physical observables , and yield a satisfactory baryon asymmetry .
1	Assuming that the second neighbor spin exchange J2 is the dominant one , we argued in a recent theoretical study [ Chen et al. , Phys.Rev.Lett .	The orbitally degenerate A-site spinel compound FeSc2S4 has been experimentally identified as a `` spin-orbital liquid '' , with strong fluctuations of both spins and orbitals .	102 , 096406 ( 2009 ) ] that FeSc2S4 is in a local `` spin-orbital singlet '' state driven by spin orbit coupling , close to a quantum critical point , which separates the `` spin-orbital singlet '' phase from a magnetically and orbitally ordered phase .	In this paper , we refine further and develop this theory of FeSc2S4 .	First , we show that inclusion of a small first neighbor exchange J1 induces a narrow region of incommensurate phase near the quantum critical point .
1	The matrix element and parton shower domains are separated at some value $ y_ { ini } $ of the jet resolution , defined according to the $ k_T $ -clustering algorithm .	We propose a method for combining QCD matrix elements and parton showers in Monte Carlo simulations of hadronic final states in $ e^+e^- $ annihilation .	The matrix elements are modified by Sudakov form factors and the parton showers are subjected to a veto procedure to cancel dependence on $ y_ { ini } $ to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy .	The method provides a leading-order description of hard multi-jet configurations together with jet fragmentation , while avoiding the most serious problems of double counting .	We present first results of an approximate implementation using the event generator APACIC++ .
2	We test our formulation with a simple advection problem , with sound waves encountering a density discontinuity , and with shock tubes containing a contact discontinuity between air and Diesel oil .	We introduce a modified SPH approach that is based on discretising the particle density instead of the mass density .	This approach makes it possible to use SPH particles with very different masses to simulate multi-phase flows with large differences in mass density between the phases .	For all examined problems where particles have different masses , the new formulation yields better results than standard SPH .	This is also the case for problems in which different spatial resolutions are needed while the mass density does not change .
3	The subject of free RAG flows in two branches .	This chapter is a tutorial on techniques and results in free convex algebraic geometry and free real algebraic geometry ( RAG ) .	The term free refers to the central role played by algebras of noncommutative polynomials R & lt ; x & gt ; in free ( freely noncommuting ) variables x= ( x_1 , ... , x_g ) .	The subject pertains to problems where the unknowns are matrices or Hilbert space operators as arise in linear systems engineering and quantum information theory .	One , free positivity and inequalities is an analog of classical real algebraic geometry , a theory of polynomial inequalities embodied in algebraic formulas called Positivstellens\ '' atze ; often free Positivstellens\ '' atze have cleaner statements than their commutative counterparts .
1	We model the day-scale SEDs with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-Compton ( SSC ) models , investigate the physical parameters , and evaluate whether the observed broadband SED variability can be associated to variations in the relativistic particle population .	A flare from the TeV blazar Mrk 421 , occurring in March 2010 , was observed for 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy ( VHE , E & gt ; 100 GeV ) gamma-rays with MAGIC , VERITAS , Whipple , FermiLAT , MAXI , RXTE , Swift , GASP-WEBT , and several optical and radio telescopes .	Flux variability was remarkable in the X-ray and VHE bands while it was minor or not significant in the other bands .	The one-zone SSC model can describe reasonably well the SED of each day for the 13 consecutive days .	This flaring activity is also very well described by a two-zone SSC model , where one zone is responsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone , which is spatially separated from the first one , contributes to the daily-variable emission occurring in X-rays and VHE gamma-rays .
4	This supports the conjecture that negativity of W is necessary for exponential speedup in pure-state quantum computation .	In [ Phys.Rev .	A 70 , 062101 ( 2004 ) ] Gibbons et al .	defined a class of discrete Wigner functions W to represent quantum states in a finite Hilbert space dimension d. I characterize a set C_d of states having non-negative W simultaneously in all definitions of W in this class .	For d & lt ; 6 I show C_d is the convex hull of stabilizer states .
1	We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs .	Terminological knowledge representation systems ( TKRSs ) are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages ( or concept languages ) .	The new features studied , often required in practical applications , can be summarized in three main points .	First , we consider a highly expressive terminological language , called ALCNR , including general complements of concepts , number restrictions and role conjunction .	Second , we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts , and terminological cycles as a particular case .
2	Under certain conditions , the symmetric or asymmetric entangled state is produced in the steady state .	We propose a scheme for the generation of entangled states for two atoms trapped in separate cavities coupled to each other .	The scheme is based on the competition between the unitary dynamics induced by the classical fields and the collective decays induced by the dissipation of two delocalized field modes .	The analytical result shows that the distributed steady entanglement can be achieved with high fidelity independent of the initial state , and is robust against parameter fluctuations .	We also find out that the linear scaling of $ F $ has a quadratic improvement compared to distributed entangled state preparation protocols based on unitary dynamics .
3	This description of the transition functions gives a connection between representation theories of the quantum loop algebra $ U_q ( \widetilde { gl } _2 $ and the elliptic quantum group $ E_ { \rho , \gamma } ( sl_2 ) $ and is analogous to the Kohno-Drinfeld theorem on the monodromy group of the differential Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation .	The trigonometric quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation ( qKZ equation ) associated with the quantum group $ U_q ( sl_2 ) $ is a system of linear difference equations with values in a tensor product of $ U_q ( sl_2 ) $ Verma modules .	We solve the equation in terms of multidimensional $ q $ -hypergeometric functions and define a natural isomorphism between the space of solutions and the tensor product of the corresponding evaluation Verma modules over the elliptic quantum group $ E_ { \rho , \gamma } ( sl_2 ) $ , where parameters $ \rho $ and $ \gamma $ are related to the parameter $ q $ of the quantum group $ U_q ( sl_2 ) $ and the step $ p $ of the qKZ equation via $ p=e^ { 2\pii\rho } $ and $ q=e^ { -2\pii\gamma } $ .	We construct asymptotic solutions associated with suitable asymptotic zones and compute the transition functions between the asymptotic solutions in terms of the dynamical elliptic R-matrices .	In order to establish these results we construct a discrete Gauss-Manin connection , in particular , a suitable discrete local system , discrete homology and cohomology groups with coefficients in this local system , and identify an associated difference equation with the qKZ equation .
1	Eight bursts of seventeen entering the sample , have significant extragalactic X-ray absorptions .	We compare the HI column densities from Ly-alpha absorption to the metal column densities from X-ray absorption in gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) afterglows .	Of these we find a range in metallicities from sub-solar to a few hundred times the solar value .	There is a complete lack of correlation between the X-ray and optical column densities .	This , and the large range and extreme values of these 'metallicities ' , suggest that the column densities derived by one or both methods are not a reliable indication of the true total column densities towards GRBs .
0	Carbon sequestration is the process of capture and long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) with the aim to avoid dangerous climate change .	In this paper , we propose a simple mathematical model ( a coupled system of nonlinear ODEs ) to capture some of the dynamical effects produced by adding charcoal to fertile soils .	The main goal is to understand to which extent charcoal is able to lock up carbon in soils .	Our results are preliminary in the sense that we do not solve the CO2 sequestration problem .	Instead , we do set up a flexible modeling framework in which the interaction between charcoal and soil can be tackled by means of mathematical tools .
2	In others , strain large enough to fracture the tube can be applied without a significant change in the contact resistance .	We investigate the response of multi-walled carbon nanotubes to mechanical strain applied with an Atomic Force Microscope ( AFM ) probe .	We find that in some samples , changes in the contact resistance dominate the measured resistance change .	In this case we observe that enough force is applied to break the tube without any change in resistance until the tube fails .	We have also manipulated the ends of the broken tube back in contact with each other , re-establishing a finite resistance .
3	Results were also compared with theoretical results obtained for a circular coil with similar dimensions .	The analytical expression for the signal-to-noise ratio of a slotted surface coil with an arbitrary number of slots was derived using the quasi-static approach .	This surface coil based on the vane-type magnetron tube .	To study the coil perfomance , the theoretical signal-to-noise ratio predictions of this coil design were computed using a different number of slots .	It can be appreciated that slotted surface coil performance improves as the number of coils increases and , outperformed the circular-shaped coil .
4	This paper shows that the class of nested canalyzing functions is equal to that of unate cascade functions .	This paper focuses on the study of certain classes of Boolean functions that have appeared in several different contexts .	Nested canalyzing functions have been studied recently in the context of Boolean network models of gene regulatory networks .	In the same context , polynomial functions over finite fields have been used to develop network inference methods for gene regulatory networks .	Finally , unate cascade functions have been studied in the design of logic circuits and binary decision diagrams .
1	We found that in a universe with holographic Ricci dark energy and dark matter , interacting with each other , the GSL is satisfied at the apparent horizon and partially satisfied at the event horizon under thermal equilibrium conditions .	We explore the validity of the generalized second law ( GSL ) of thermodynamics in flat FRW universe with apparent horizon and event horizon as the boundary .	We also analyses the GSL under non-equilibrium conditions and shows that the fulfillment of GSL at the apparent horizon implies that the temperature of the dark energy is greater than that of the horizon .	Thus there occurs a flow of dark energy towards the apparent horizon .	As a result the entropy of the dark energy decreases and that of horizon increases .
4	and the stellar population models Vazdekis et al .	Model color magnitude diagrams of low-metallicity globular clusters usually show a deficit of hot evolved stars with respect to observations .	We investigate quantitatively the impact of such modelling inaccuracies on the significance of star formation history reconstructions obtained from optical integrated spectra .	To do so , we analyse the sample of spectra of galactic globular clusters of Schiavon et al .	with STECKMAP ( Ocvirk et al . )
4	The energy per baryon number decreases very slowly from the center of the star to the periphery , remaining above the corresponding values for the iron or the nuclear matter , even at the edge .	Strange quark matter in beta equilibrium at high densities is studied in a quark confinement model .	Two equations of state are dynamically generated for the { \it same } set of model parameters used to describe the nucleon : one corresponds to a chiral restored phase with almost massless quarks and the other to a chiral broken phase .	The chiral symmetric phase saturates at around five times the nuclear matter density .	Using the equation of state for this phase , compact bare quark stars are obtained with radii and masses in the ranges $ R\sim 5 - 8 $ km and $ M\sim M_\odot $ .
1	Here , we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability .	A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets using highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning , sampling , inference , and evaluation are still analytically or computationally tractable .	The essential idea , inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics , is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process .	We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data , yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data .	This approach allows us to rapidly learn , sample from , and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps , as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model .
3	The resulting algorithm thus inherits the benefits of both level set methods and boundary integral methods to simulate the nonlocal front propagation problem with possible topological changes .	We present an algorithm for computing the nonlinear interface dynamics of the Mullins-Sekerka model for interfaces that are defined implicitly ( e.g.by a level set function ) using integral equations .	The computation of the dynamics involves solving Laplace 's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on multiply connected and unbounded domains and propagating the interface using a normal velocity obtained from the solution of the PDE at each time step .	Our method is based on a simple formulation for implicit interfaces , which rewrites boundary integrals as volume integrals over the entire space .	We present numerical results in both two and three dimensions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm .
0	We investigate the possibility that the observed rotation of galaxies can be accounted for by invoking a massive baryonic disc with no need for non-baryonic dark matter or a massive halo .	There are 5 primary reasons for suggesting this : 1. there are well known disc surface mass density distributions that naturally produce the observed rotation curves of galaxies .	2. there are a number of rotation curve `puzzles ' that can not be explained by a massive dark matter halo i.e.the success of maximum disc fitting , HI gas scaling to the observed rotation , the disc/halo conspiracy and the interpretation of the Tully-Fisher relation .	3. recent 21cm observations show an almost constant HI surface density and a distinct `cut-off ' or edge to galactic discs .	We explain this constant surface density in terms of either an optical depth effect or the onset of molecular gas formation and hence the possibility of considerably more gas existing in galaxies .
4	14 of them are offset AGN and nine are dual AGN , resulting in a fraction of ( 1.2 \pm 0.3 ) % AGN pairs with respect to the total number of AGN .	In the last few years , it became possible to observationally resolve galaxies with two distinct nuclei in their centre .	For separations smaller than 10kpc , dual and offset active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) are distinguished : in dual AGN , both nuclei are active , whereas in offset AGN only one nucleus is active .	To study the origin of such AGN pairs , we employ a cosmological , hydrodynamic simulation with a large volume of ( 182Mpc ) ^3 from the set of Magneticum Pathfinder Simulations .	The simulation self-consistently produces 35 resolved black hole ( BH ) pairs at redshift z=2 , with a comoving distance smaller than 10kpc .
3	The sensitive parameter dependence of the corresponding currents includes frequent sign reversals .	Chaotic scattering with an internal degree of freedom and the possibility to generate directed transport of angular momentum is studied in a specific model , a magnetic dipole moving in a periodically modulated magnetic field confined to a compact region in space .	We show that this system is an irregular scatterer in large parts of its parameter space .	If in addition all spatio-temporal symmetries are broken , directed transport of mass as well as angular momentum occurs .	Zeros of either quantity entail the exclusive occurrence of the other and thus give rise in particular to angular-momentum separation without mass transport as a classical analogue of spin-polarized currents .
1	Recently , neural headline generation models have been proposed to take advantage of well-trained neural networks in learning sentence representations and mapping sequence to sequence .	Automatic headline generation is an important research area within text summarization and sentence compression .	Nevertheless , traditional neural network encoder utilizes maximum likelihood estimation for parameter optimization , which essentially constraints the expected training objective within word level instead of sentence level .	Moreover , the performance of model prediction significantly relies on training data distribution .	To overcome these drawbacks , we employ minimum risk training strategy in this paper , which directly optimizes model parameters with respect to evaluation metrics and statistically leads to significant improvements for headline generation .
3	The string picture also suggests different scenarios of gauge and gravitational couplings unification .	Utilizing the idea of extra large dimensions , it has been suggested that the gauge and gravity couplings unification can happen at a scale as low as 1 TeV .	In this paper , we explore this phenomenological possibility within string theory .	In particular , we discuss how the proton decay bound can be satisfied in Type I string theory .	The various scenarios are explicitly illustrated with a specific 4-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric chiral Type I string model with Pati-Salam-like gauge symmetry .
1	The system provides low-cost minute-by-minute alignment monitoring with submicron precision .	We describe the design and operation of the RASNIK optical relative alignment system designed for and installed on the CDF inner tracking detectors .	To reduce ambiguities , we modified the original three-element rasnik design to a two-element one .	Since the RASNIKs are located within 10 -- 40 cm of the beamline , the systems were built from low-mass and radiation-hard components and are operated in a mode which reduces damage from radiation .	We describe the data-acquisition system , which has been running without interruption since before the CDF detector was rolled into its collision hall in March 2001 .
0	The crystal structure of Lanthanum Cerium Oxide ( La $ _2 $ Ce $ _2 $ O $ _7 $ ) is investigated using \textit { ab initio } density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations .	The relative stability of fluorite- and pyrochlore-like structures is studied through comparison of their formation energies .	These formation energies show the pyrochlore structure to be favored over the fluorite structure , apparently contradicting the conclusions based on experimental neutron and X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) .	By calculating and comparing XRD spectra for a set of differently ordered and random structures , we show that the pyrochlore structure is consistent with diffraction experiments .	For these reasons , we suggest the pyrochlore structure as the ground state crystal structure for La $ _2 $ Ce $ _2 $ O $ _7 $ .
3	We find that i ) the critical scales for the flows to strong coupling are shifted downwards by a factor that is usually of order one but can get larger in specific parameter regions , and ii ) that the leading channel in this flow does not depend strongly on whether self-energies and frequency-dependence is included or not .	We study the impact of including the self-energy feedback and frequency-dependent interactions on functional renormalization group grows for the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at weak to moderate coupling strength .	Previous studies using the functional renormalization group had ignored these two ingredients to large extent , and the question is how much the flows to strong coupling analyzed by this method depend on these approximations .	Here we include the imaginary part of the self-energy on the imaginary axis and the frequency-dependence of the running interactions on a frequency mesh of 10 frequencies on the Matsubara axis .	We also discuss the main features of the self-energies developing during the flows .
1	In terms of the imaginary-time formalism at finite temperature , the root of Planck 's law of radiation can be traced back to finite modification of the infinite vacuum energy induced by the periodic boundary condition in the temporal direction .	The Casimir force has its origin in finite modification of the infinite zero-point energy induced by a specific boundary condition for the spatial configuration .	We give the explicit conversion from the Casimir force to Planck 's law of radiation , which shows the apparent correspondence between the system bounded by parallel conducting plates and the thermodynamic system .	The temperature inversion symmetry and the duality relation in the thermodynamics are also discussed .	We conclude that the effective temperature characterized by the spatial extension should no longer be regarded as genuine temperature .
4	Here the first error is statistical and the second is an estimate of the systematic discretization error .	We report on the first complete calculation of the $ K_L-K_S $ mass difference , $ \Delta M_K $ , using lattice QCD .	The calculation is performed on a 2+1 flavor , domain wall fermion ensemble with a 330MeV pion mass and a 575 MeV kaon mass .	We use a quenched charm quark with a 949 MeV mass to implement Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani cancellation .	For these heavier-than-physical particle masses , we obtain $ \Delta M_K =3.19 ( 41 ) ( 96 ) \times 10^ { -12 } $ MeV , quite similar to the experimental value .
3	The corresponding upper limits to the time-average rates of the constant variations are |d\alpha/ ( \alpha dt ) | & lt ; 1.6\times 10^ { -14 } yr^ { -1 } and |d\mu/ ( \mu dt ) | & lt ; 2.2\times10^ { -14 } yr^ { -1 } .	Contemporary multidimensional cosmological theories predict different variations of fundamental physical constants in course of the cosmological evolution .	On the basis of the QSO spectra analysis , we show that the fine-structure constant \alpha=e^2/ ( \hbar c ) and the proton-to-electron mass ratio \mu=m_p/m_e reveal no statistically significant variation over the last 90 % of the lifetime of the Universe .	At the 2\sigma significance level , the following upper bounds are obtained for the epoch corresponding to the cosmological redshifts z ~ 3 ( i.e. , ~ 10 Gyr ago ) : |\Delta\alpha/\alpha| & lt ; 0.00016 and |\Delta\mu/\mu| & lt ; 0.00022 .	These limits serve as criteria for selection of those theoretical models which predict \alpha and \mu variation with the cosmological time .
4	In particular , we can use the limit of electron dipole moment to constrain the size of the CP violating triplet correlation in the $ e^+ e^- \ra t \bar { t } $ process .	Aiming at a model-independent analysis of possible new physics effects in semileptonic processes at various energy scales , we list and study a complete set of $ SU ( 3 ) _c\times SU ( 2 ) _L\times U ( 1 ) _Y $ invariant 4-Fermi operators which consist of a pair of quarks and a pair of leptons above the electroweak symmetry breaking .	We give a full 1-loop renormalization group treatment of the evolution of the Wilson coefficients associated with these 4-Fermi operators between low energy ( $ \sim $ meson masses ) and the cutoff scale $ \Lambda $ , $ \sim ( 1-10 ) $ TeV , where we assume new degree of freedom beyond standard model will begin to appear and an ultra-violet completion of our effective theory will take place .	Motivated by the existing phenomenological bounds , we argue that the new CP violation can only stem from the scalar and tensor types of 4-Fermi interaction .	Some interesting constraints are obtained by studying the universality of kaon and pion leptonic decays , CP violating polarization of $ K^+_ { \mu 3 } $ , charged lepton anomalous magnetic moments , and $ ( \mu\ra e \gamma ) $ like rare decays .
3	Depending on the functional and which error estimate that is being used , the difference in the error between the elastic constants and the bulk modulus can be rather large , about a factor of two .	We have performed density functional calculations using a range of local and semi-local as well as hybrid density functional approximations of the structure and elastic constants of 18 semiconductors and insulators .	We find that most of the approximations have a very small error in the lattice constants , of the order of 1\ % , while the error in the elastic constants and bulk modulus are much larger , at about 10\ % .	In addition , we find that the error in the elastic constants , $ c_ { ij } $ , are larger compared to the error in the bulk modulus .	According to our study , the overall best performing density functional approximation for determining the structure and elastic properties is the PBEsol , closely followed by the two hybrid functionals PBE0 and HSE , and the AM05 functional .
4	In this paper , we briefly review EPC in cuprate and iron-based superconducting systems revealed by Raman scattering .	Electron-phonon coupling ( EPC ) is one of the most common and fundamental interactions in solids .	It not only dominates many basic dynamic processes like resistivity , thermal conductivity etc , but also provides the pairing glue in conventional superconductors .	But in high-temperature superconductors ( HTSC ) , it is still controversial whether or not EPC is in favor of paring .	Despite the controversies , many experiments have provided clear evidence for EPC in HTSC .
1	For example , the number of independent sets in a $ d $ -regular graph on $ n $ vertices is at most $ ( 2^ { d+1 } -1 ) ^ { n/2d } $ by the Kahn-Zhao theorem .	Extremal problems involving the enumeration of graph substructures have a long history in graph theory .	Relaxing the regularity constraint to a minimum degree condition , Galvin conjectured that , for $ n\geq 2d $ , the number of independent sets in a graph with $ \delta ( G ) \geq d $ is at most that in $ K_ { d , n-d } $ .	In this paper , we give a lower bound on the number of independent sets in a $ d $ -regular graph mirroring the upper bound in the Kahn-Zhao theorem .	The main result of this paper is a proof of a strengthened form of Galvin 's conjecture , covering the case $ n\leq 2d $ as well .
3	Than I discuss where large new physics effects in the MSSM are still possible .	In this article I review some aspects of flavour phenomenology in the MSSM .	After an overview of various flavour observables I discuss the constraints on the off-diagonal elements of the squark mass matrices .	In this context I present the Fortran code SUSY_FLAVOR which calculates these processes in the generic MSSM including the complete resummation of all chirally enhanced effects as a new feature of version 2 .	As an example of a model which can give large effects in flavour physics I review a model with `` radiative flavour violation '' ( RFV ) and update the results in the light of the recent LHCb measurement of Bs - & gt ; \mu \mu .
4	Different representations appropriate for numerical calculations are derived for the matrix elements of interest .	We develop an approach for calculating matrix elements of meson exchange currents between 3N basis states in ( jJ ) -coupling and a 3N bound state .	The contribution generated by $ \pi $ - and $ \rho $ -exchange are included in the consideration .	The matrix elements are expressed in terms of multiple integrals in the momentum space .	We apply a technique of the partial wave decompositions and carry out some angular integrations in closed form .
4	From this , the observed optical depth/linear size relationship is best reproduced through models which approximate either of the two Fanaroff & amp ; Riley classifications , although the observed scatter in the sample can not be duplicated using a single deprojected radio source size .	Existing studies of the atomic hydrogen gas content in distant galaxies , through the absorption of the 21-cm line , often infer that the total column density is anti-correlated with the linear extent of the background radio source .	We investigate this interpretation , by dissecting the various parameters from which the column density is derived , and find that the relationship is driven primarily by the observed optical depth , which , for a given absorber size , is anti-correlated with the linear size .	Therefore , the inferred anti-correlation is merely the consequence of geometry , in conjunction with the assumption of a common spin temperature/covering factor ratio for each member of the sample , an assumption for which there is scant observational justification .	While geometry can explain the observed correlation , many radio sources comprise two radio lobes and so we model the projected area of a two component emitter intercepted by a foreground absorber .
1	We consider the statistical inference for precision matrices with ultra high-dimensional time dependent observations .	Precision matrices play important roles in many statistical applications .	More specifically , let $ \boldsymbol { \Omega } $ be the precision matrix and $ \mathcal { S } $ be a given index set of interest .	We propose a data-driven procedure to construct a class of confidence regions $ \mathcal { C } _ { \mathcal { S } , \alpha } $ for $ \boldsymbol { \Omega } _ { \mathcal { S } } $ such that $ \sup_ { 0 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; 1 } |\mathbb { P } ( \boldsymbol { \Omega } _ { \mathcal { S } } \in\mathcal { C } _ { \mathcal { S } , \alpha } ) -\alpha|\rightarrow0 $ as $ n\rightarrow\infty $ , where $ \boldsymbol { \Omega } _ { \mathcal { S } } $ is a vector whose components are the elements of $ \boldsymbol { \Omega } $ indexed by $ \mathcal { S } $ .	The proposed procedure includes two steps .
1	Valid metric distances between high order networks have been defined but they are difficult to compute when the number of nodes is large .	High order networks are weighted hypergraphs col- lecting relationships between elements of tuples , not necessarily pairs .	The goal here is to find tractable approximations of these network distances .	The paper does so by mapping high order networks to filtrations of simplicial complexes and showing that the distance between networks can be lower bounded by the difference between the homological features of their respective filtrations .	Practical implications are explored by classifying weighted pairwise networks constructed from different gener- ative processes and by comparing the coauthorship networks of engineering and mathematics academic journals .
1	A graph $ G $ from such a model is generated by first assigning vertex labels at random from a finite alphabet , and then connecting vertices with edge probabilities depending on the labels of the endpoints .	We develop an information-theoretic view of the stochastic block model , a popular statistical model for the large-scale structure of complex networks .	In the case of the symmetric two-group model , we establish an explicit `single-letter ' characterization of the per-vertex mutual information between the vertex labels and the graph .	The explicit expression of the mutual information is intimately related to estimation-theoretic quantities , and -- in particular -- reveals a phase transition at the critical point for community detection .	Below the critical point the per-vertex mutual information is asymptotically the same as if edges were independent .
1	The methodology consists on implement a Genetic Algorithm capable of search the input feature space used by the NNR classifier .	The present paper deals with optimisation of Nearest Neighbour rule Classifiers via Genetic Algorithms .	Results show that is adequate to perform feature reduction and simultaneous improve the Recognition Rate .	Some practical examples prove that is possible to Recognise Portuguese Granites in 100 % , with only 3 morphological features ( from an original set of 117 features ) , which is well suited for real time applications .	Moreover , the present method represents a robust strategy to understand the proper nature of the images treated , and their discriminant features .
4	This influence can be both beneficial or detrimental .	We study the two-dimensional toric code Hamiltonian with effective long-range interactions between its anyonic excitations induced by coupling the toric code to external fields .	It has been shown that such interactions allow to increase the lifetime of the stored quantum information arbitrarily by making $ L $ , the linear size of the memory , larger [ Phys.Rev .	A 82 022305 ( 2010 ) ] .	We show that for these systems the choice of boundary conditions ( open boundaries as opposed to periodic boundary conditions ) is not a mere technicality ; the influence of anyons produced at the boundaries becomes in fact dominant for large enough $ L $ .
1	Instant interactive proofs effect a fragile epistemic impact in their intended communities of peer reviewers that consists in the impermanent induction of the knowledge of their proof goal by means of the knowledge of the proof with the interpreting reviewer : If my peer reviewer knew my proof then she would at least then ( in that instant ) know that its proof goal is true .	We propose a monotonic logic of internalised non-monotonic or instant interactive proofs ( LiiP ) and reconstruct an existing monotonic logic of internalised monotonic or persistent interactive proofs ( LiP ) as a minimal conservative extension of LiiP .	Their impact is fragile and their induction of knowledge impermanent in the sense of being the case possibly only at the instant of learning the proof .	This accounts for the important possibility of internalising proofs of statements whose truth value can vary , which , as opposed to invariant statements , can not have persistent proofs .	So instant interactive proofs effect a temporary transfer of certain propositional knowledge ( knowable ephemeral facts ) via the transmission of certain individual knowledge ( knowable non-monotonic proofs ) in distributed systems of multiple interacting agents .
3	There is a strong suppression of tunnelling at zero bias , with temperature and dc-bias dependences consistent with power laws , as expected for a Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid caused by electron-electron interactions in the wires .	We present the results of non-linear tunnelling spectroscopy between an array of independent quantum wires and an adjacent two-dimensional electron gas ( 2DEG ) in a double-quantum-well structure .	The two layers are separately contacted using a surface-gate scheme , and the wires are all very regular , with dimensions chosen carefully so that there is minimal modulation of the 2DEG by the gates defining the wires .	We have mapped the dispersion spectrum of the 1D wires down to the depletion of the last 1D subband by measuring the conductance \emph { G } as a function of the in-plane magnetic field \emph { B } , the interlayer bias $ V_ { \rm dc } $ and the wire gate voltage .	In addition , the current peaks fit the free-electron model quite well , but with just one 1D subband there is extra structure that may indicate interactions .
2	For a realistic electron distribution we demonstrate that it is probable that each decade of the seed photon distribution from the mm to IR waveband contributes roughly equally to the medium energy X-ray flux .	From a combination of high quality X-ray observations from the NASA Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) , and infrared observations from the UK Infrared Telescope ( UKIRT ) we show that the medium energy X-ray ( 3-20 keV ) and near infrared fluxes in the quasar 3C273 are highly correlated .	It is widely believed that the X-ray emission in quasars like 3C273 arises from Compton scattering of low energy seed photons and our observations provide the first reliable detection of correlated variations in 3C273 between the X-ray band and any lower energy band .	However the expected mm variations are too small to be detected above the noise , probably explaining the lack of success of previous searches for a correlation between X-ray and mm variations .	In addition we show that the infrared leads the X-rays by 0.75+/-0.25 days .
1	They proved that any subword complex is homeomorphic to a ball or a sphere and asked about their geometric realizations .	Subword complexes are simplicial complexes introduced by Knutson and Miller to illustrate the combinatorics of Schubert polynomials and determinantal ideals .	We show that a family of subword complexes can be realized geometrically via regular triangulations of root polytopes .	This implies that a family of $ \beta $ -Grothendieck polynomials are special cases of reduced forms in the subdivision algebra of root polytopes .	We can also write the volume and Ehrhart series of root polytopes in terms of $ \beta $ -Grothendieck polynomials .
3	The gain of each bolometer is stabilized with voltage pulses developed by a high stability pulse generator across heater resistors put in thermal contact with the absorber .	We report the present results of CUORICINO a cryogenic experiment on neutrinoless double beta decay ( DBD ) of 130Te consisting of an array of 62 crystals of TeO2 with a total active mass of 40.7 kg .	The array is framed inside of a dilution refrigerator , heavily shielded against environmental radioactivity and high-energy neutrons , and operated at a temperature of ~8 mK in the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory .	Temperature pulses induced by particle interacting in the crystals are recorded and measured by means of Neutron Transmutation Doped thermistors .	The calibration is performed by means of two thoriated wires routinely inserted in the set-up .
1	Strong emphasis has been placed on real economy .	Research activities of Kyoto Econophysics Group is reviewed .	While the initial stage of research was a first high-definition data analysis on personal income , it soon progressed to firm dynamics , growth rate distribution and establishment of Pareto 's law and Gibrat 's law .	It then led to analysis and simulation of firm dynamics on economic network .	Currently it covers a wide rage of dynamics of firms and financial institutions on complex network , using Japanese large-scale network data , some of which are not available in other countries .
2	The fraction of kinematically-disturbed galaxies increases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from the cluster centre , but remains constant with projected galaxy density .	With the aim of distinguishing between possible physical mechanisms acting on galaxies when they fall into clusters , we study the properties of the gas and the stars in a sample of 422 emission-line galaxies from EDisCS in different environments up to z~1 .	We identify galaxies with kinematical disturbances ( from emission-lines in their 2D spectra ) and find that they are more frequent in clusters than in the field .	We also studied morphological disturbances in the stellar light from HST/F814W images , finding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar in all environments .	Moreover , there is little correlation between the presence of kinematically-disturbed gas and morphological distortions .
1	This problem consists of determining least-cost vehicle routes to serve a set of customers while respecting the restrictions of vehicle capacity and time windows .	This paper addresses a new vehicle routing problem that simultaneously involves time windows , split collection and linear weight-related cost , which is a generalization of the split delivery vehicle routing problem with time windows ( SDVRPTW ) .	The travel cost per unit distance is a linear function of the vehicle weight and the customer demand can be fulfilled by multiple vehicles .	To solve this problem , we propose a exact branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm , where the pricing subproblem is a resource-constrained elementary least-cost path problem .	We first prove that at least an optimal solution to the pricing subproblem is associated with an extreme collection pattern , and then design a tailored and novel label-setting algorithm to solve it .
4	However the two loop order shows a logarithmic divergence appear in the centre of the wall .	The spatial 't Hooft loop measures the colour electric flux in SU ( N ) /Z ( N ) gauge theory .	It is a closed loop of Dirac Z ( N ) flux and has strength k=1 , 2 , .. , N-1 .	It is analyzed for generic k and small gauge coupling in the high temperature phase of { \cal N } =1 , 2 and 4 SUSY theory up and including cubic order .	In one loop order no qualitative difference with gluodynamics shows .
3	Logic provides several tools for making outer descriptions of mathematical objects .	One often sees a sharp distinction in mathematics between descriptions from the outside and from the inside .	Think of defining a set in the plane through an algebraic equation , or dynamically as the closure of the orbit of some point under iterations of a given mapping .	In logic one sees this dichotomy in the descriptions of sets of tautologies through semantics and proofs .	This paper concerns a slightly complicated mixture of themes related to inner descriptions and formal proofs .
0	Information-related measures are important tools of multi-variable data analysis , as measures of dependence among variables and the description of order in biological and physical systems .	Informtion-related measures , like marginal entropies , mutual / interaction / multi-information , are also relevant to the theory of complexity of systems and biological data analysis .	The mathematical properties and relationships among these measures are therefore of significant interest .	A number of interesting relations between common information measures include the duality relations based on M\ '' obius inversion on lattices , which are the direct consequence of the symmetries of the lattices ( subsets ordered by inclusion ) of the sets of variables .	In this paper we define operators on functions on these lattices that map the functions into one another , called M\ '' obius operators .
1	Using a one-loop renormalization group scheme for weak to moderate coupling strengths , we find that for purely local interactions U & gt ; 0 and small Fermi surfaces the renormalization group flow remains bounded down to very low scales and no superconducting or other instabilities can be detected .	Motivated by the recent finding of superconductivity in layered CoO_2 compounds , we investigate superconducting and magnetic instabilities of interacting electrons on the two-dimensional triangular lattice .	Antiferromagnetic exchange interactions J generate a wide density region with a d_ { x^2-y^2 } +id_ { xy } -wave superconducting instability similar to recent proposals for the strongly correlated t-J model .	For larger Fermi surface volumes the interactions flow to strong coupling also for purely local interactions U & gt ; 0 .	We find a singlet pairing instability in the vicinity of strong magnetic ordering tendencies at three wavevectors for the van Hove filling .
2	We then employ the familiar canonical quantization procedure in the given cosmological setting to find the cosmological wave functions in the corresponding minisuperspace .	We study the classical and quantum models of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ( FRW ) space-time , coupled to a perfect fluid , in the context of the consensus and a gauge-fixed Lagrangian frameworks .	It is shown that , either in the usual or in the gauge-fixed actions , the evolution of the universe based on the classical cosmology represents a late time power law expansion , coming from a big-bang singularity in which the scale factor goes to zero for the standard matter , and tending towards a big-rip singularity in which the scale factor diverges for the phantom fluid .	Using a gauge-fixed ( reduced ) Lagrangian , we show that , it may lead to a Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation for the quantum-mechanical description of the model under consideration , the eigenfunctions of which can be used to construct the time dependent wave function of the universe .	We use the resulting wave function in order to investigate the possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum effects by means of the many-worlds and ontological interpretation of quantum cosmology .
4	The maximum Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter is approximately 0.4 .	Using a version of the ZEUS code , we carry out two-dimensional simulations of self-gravitating shearing sheets , with application to QSO accretion disks at a few thousand Schwarzschild radii , corresponding to a few hundredths of a parsec for a 10^8 solar-mass black hole .	Radiation pressure and optically thick radiative cooling are implemented via vertical averages .	We determine dimensionless versions of the maximum surface density , accretion rate , and effective viscosity that can be sustained by density-wave turbulence without fragmentation .	Where fragments do form , we study the final masses that result .
2	We also study that the double scaling limit of these massive theories and find that the massive N_f -1 theory can be obtained from the massive N_f theory .	We discuss N=2 SU ( 2 ) Yang-Mills gauge theories coupled with N_f ( =2,3 ) massive hypermultiplets in the weak coupling limit .	We determine the exact massive prepotentials and the monodromy matrices around the weak coupling limit .	New formulae for the massive prepotentials and the monodromy matrices are proposed .	In these formulae , N_f dependences are clarified .
4	To show the existence of the solutions of the field equations we have derived the general form of the displacement field in Minkowski space-time which is invariant under rotation and space and time inversion .	The gauge symmetry inherent in the concept of manifold has been discussed .	Within the scope of this symmetry the linear connection or displacement field can be considered as a natural gauge field on the manifold .	The gauge invariant equations for the displacement field have been derived .	It has been shown that the energy-momentum tensor of this field conserves and hence the displacement field can be treated as one that transports energy and gravitates .
3	Thus , these well-shaped single crystals may be the best candidates for studying the direction dependences of the physical properties .	We synthesized hexagonal-disc-shaped MgB2 single crystals under high-pressure conditions and analyzed the microstructure and pinning properties .	The lattice constants and the Laue pattern of the crystals from X-ray micro-diffraction showed the crystal symmetry of MgB2 .	A thorough crystallographic mapping within a single crystal showed that the edge and c-axis of hexagonal-disc shape exactly matched the ( 10-10 ) and the ( 0001 ) directions of the MgB2 phase .	The magnetization curve and the magnetic hysteresis for these single crystals showed the existence of a wide reversible region and weak pinning properties , which supported our single crystals being very clean .
2	Rather , irradiance measurements are typically available from a few , relatively small sensors and thus aggregate solar irradiance must be estimated from these data .	Design and operation of a utility scale photovoltaic ( PV ) power plant depends on accurate modeling of the power generated , which is highly correlated with aggregate solar irradiance on the plant 's PV modules .	At present , aggregate solar irradiance over the area of a typical PV power plant can not be measured directly .	As a step towards finding more accurate methods for estimating aggregate irradiance from avaialble measurements , we evaluate semiparametric spatio-temporal models for global horizontal irradiance .	Using data from a 1.2 MW PV plant located in Lanai , Hawaii , we show that a semiparametric model can be more accurate than simple intepolation between sensor locations .
2	The measurements show a spin-dependent rectification of the current caused by the asymmetry of the device .	Low-temperature measurements of asymmetric carbon nanotube ( CNT ) quantum dots are reported .	The CNTs are end-contacted with one ferromagnetic and one normal-metal electrode .	This rectification occurs for gate voltages for which the normal-metal lead is resonant with a level of the quantum dot .	At the gate voltages at which the current is at the maximum current , a significant decrease in the current shot noise is observed .
3	When the number of background events is comparable or larger than the signal , the upper limit obtained is less stringent than that extracted without including the Poisson uncertainty .	We present a procedure for calculating an upper limit on the number of signal events which incorporates the Poisson uncertainty in the background , estimated from control regions of one or two dimensions .	For small number of signal events , the upper limit obtained is more stringent than that extracted without including the Poisson uncertainty .	This trend continues until the number of background events is comparable with the signal .	It is therefore important to incorporate the Poisson uncertainty into the upper limit ; otherwise the upper limit obtained could be too stringent .
3	These SEDs can be explained well with the synchrotron+synchrotron-self-Compton model .	BL Lac objects are the best candidates to study the jet properties since their spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) are less contaminated by the emission from the accretion disk and external Compton processes .	We compile the broadband SEDs observed with Fermi/LAT and other instruments from literature for 24 TeV BL Lac objects .	Two SEDs , which are identified as a low or high state according to its flux density at 1 TeV , are available for each of ten objects .	We constrain the magnetic filed strength B and the Doppler factor delta of the radiation region by incorporating the chi^ { 2 } -minimization technique and the gamma-ray transparency condition .
3	This work forms the foundation of our understanding of black hole demography , and provides constraints on scenarios for black hole formation and growth , and on their connection to the formation and properties of the host galaxy .	In the past decade , much effort was devoted to measure the masses of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei , to establish the relation between black hole mass and the global/nuclear properties of the host galaxy , and to understand the role of these objects in the formation and subsequent dynamical evolution of galaxies .	This whole area of research is an appropriate and timely topic for the first in this series of symposia .	Nearly half the contributions were devoted to the various methods that are being used to estimate masses of central black holes , from nearby globular clusters all the way to quasars at redshifts z & gt ; 6 .	I will address these topics in this same order .
4	The first extension increases the number of subtrees that define the feature space , and the second one removes noisy features from the graph representations .	Motivated by chemical applications , we revisit and extend a family of positive definite kernels for graphs based on the detection of common subtrees , initially proposed by Ramon et al . ( 2003 ) .	We propose new kernels with a parameter to control the complexity of the subtrees used as features to represent the graphs .	This parameter allows to smoothly interpolate between classical graph kernels based on the count of common walks , on the one hand , and kernels that emphasize the detection of large common subtrees , on the other hand .	We also propose two modular extensions to this formulation .
4	The exponent of this power-law was 0.5 and it was independent of sample size .	We investigated two-dimensional brittle fragmentation with a flat impact experimentally , focusing on the low impact energy region near the fragmentation-critical point .	We found that the universality class of fragmentation transition disagreed with that of percolation .	However , the weighted mean mass of the fragments could be scaled using the pseudo-control parameter multiplicity .	The data for highly fragmented samples included a cumulative fragment mass distribution that clearly obeyed a power-law .
2	Here we show that every continuous map from a finitely connected planar domain , possibly with punctures , into $ \C\times\C^* $ is homotopic to a proper immersion that identifies at most countably many pairs of distinct points , and in most cases , only finitely many pairs .	Gromov , in his seminal 1989 paper on the Oka principle , proved that every continuous map from a Stein manifold into an elliptic manifold is homotopic to a holomorphic map .	Previously we have shown that , given a continuous map $ X \to \C\times\C^* $ from a finitely connected planar domain $ X $ without isolated boundary points , a stronger Oka property holds , namely that the map is homotopic to a proper holomorphic embedding .	By examining situations in which the immersion is injective , we obtain a strong Oka property for embeddings of some classes of planar domains with isolated boundary points .	It is not yet clear whether a strong Oka property for embeddings holds in general when the domain has isolated boundary points .
4	We discuss the implications of these results for the evolutionary history of the hot gas in clusters , and suggest that preheating may affect the entropy of intracluster gas primarily by reducing the density of material accreting into groups and clusters along cosmic filaments .	We examine profiles and scaling properties of the entropy of the intergalactic gas in a sample of 66 virialized systems , ranging in mass from single elliptical galaxies to rich clusters , for which we have resolved X-ray temperature profiles .	Some of the properties we derive appear to be inconsistent with any of the models put forward to explain the breaking of self-similarity in the baryon content of clusters .	In particular , the entropy profiles , scaled to the virial radius , are broadly similar in form across the sample , apart from a normalization factor which differs from the simple self-similar scaling with temperature .	Low mass systems do not show the large isentropic cores predicted by preheating models , and the high entropy excesses reported at large radii in groups by Finoguenov et al ( 2002 ) are confirmed , and found to extend even to moderately rich clusters .
1	We study six distinct Al/Al $ _2 $ O $ _3 $ interfaces which differ in stacking sequences of the metal and the oxide surface atoms and the oxide termination .	We investigate how different interface geometries of an Al/Al $ _2 $ O $ _3 $ junction , a common component of modern tunnel devices , affect electron transport through the tunnel barrier .	To construct model potential barrier profiles for each examined geometry , we rely on first-principles density-functional theory ( DFT ) calculations for the barrier heights and the shapes of the interface regions as well as on experimental data for the barrier widths .	We show that even tiny variations in the atomic arrangement at the interface cause significant changes in the tunnel barrier parameters and , consequently , in electron transport properties .	Especially , we obtain that variations in the crucial barrier heights and widths can be as large as 2 eV and 5 \AA , respectively .
3	Simulations have provided the means to make concrete predictions for the X-ray morphologies of clusters in cosmologies with different $ \Omega_o $ , with the result that low $ \Omega_o $ cosmologies fair rather poorly when compared to observations .	The degree of complexity and , to a somewhat lesser degree , realism in simulations has advanced rapidly in the past few years .	The simplest approach - modeling a cluster as collisionless dark matter and collisonal , non -- radiative gas is now fairly well established .	One of the most fruitful results of this approach is the { \sl morphology -- cosmology connection } for X-ray clusters .	Another result concerns the accuracy of \xray binding mass estimates .
3	As it is well known in the context of the classic magnetic dipole radiation , $ n & lt ; 3 $ would only be possible for positive $ ( \dot { B } _0/B_0 + \dot { \phi } /\tan\phi ) $ , which , for instance , leads to $ \dot { B } _0 & gt ; 0 $ ( $ \dot { \phi } & gt ; 0 $ ) when $ \phi $ ( $ B_0 $ ) is constant .	We firstly revisit the energy loss mechanism known as quantum vacuum friction ( QVF ) , clarifying some of its subtleties .	Then we investigate the observables that could easily differentiate QVF from the classical magnetic dipole radiation for pulsars with braking indices ( n ) measured accurately .	We show this is specially the case for the time evolution of a pulsar 's magnetic dipole direction ( $ \dot { \phi } $ ) and surface magnetic field ( $ \dot { B } _0 $ ) .	On the other hand , we show that QVF can result in very contrasting predictions with respect to the above ones .
4	We present measurements on the dynamics of ejection and on the self-repulsion force driving ejection .	We study the control parameters that govern the dynamics of in vitro DNA ejection in bacteriophage lambda .	Past work has demonstrated that bacteriophage DNA is highly pressurized ; this pressure has been hypothesized to help drive DNA ejection .	Ions influence this process by screening charges on DNA ; however , a systematic variation of salt concentrations to explore these effects has not been undertaken .	To study the nature of the forces driving DNA ejection , we performed in vitro measurements of DNA ejection in bulk and at the single-phage level .
3	The motion is favored at large Rh content , while it is hindered by the application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the FeAs layers .	This work presents 75As NMR spin echo decay rate ( 1/T2 ) measurements in Ba ( Fe1-xRhx ) 2As2 superconductors , for 0.041 & lt ; x & lt ; 0.094 .	It is shown that 1/T2 increases upon cooling , in the normal phase , suggesting the onset of an unconventional very low-frequency activated dynamic .	The correlation times of the fluctuations and their energy barriers are derived .	The same dynamic is observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate , in a quantitatively consistent manner .
3	Moreover , the proposed approach is proved to be the unique one if only the last moment equation is allowed to be alternated to match the condition of non-equilibrium independent characteristic speeds .	In this paper , we present a regularization to 1D Grad 's moment system to achieve global hyperbolicity .	The regularization is based on the observation that the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian of the flux in Grad 's moment system is independent of the intermediate moments .	The method is not relied on the form of the collision at all , thus this regularization is applicable to the system without collision terms .	The hyperbolic structure of the regularized system , including the signal speeds , Riemann invariants and the properties of the characteristic waves including the rarefaction wave , contact discontinuity and shock are provided in the perfect formations .
0	There is a natural stratification of the character variety of a finitely presented group coming from the jumping loci of the first cohomology of one-dimensional representations .	Equations defining the jumping loci can be effectively computed using Fox calculus .	In this paper , we give an exposition of Fox calculus in the language of group cohomology and in the language of finite abelian coverings of CW complexes .	Work of Simpson , Arapura and others show that if $ \Gamma $ is the fundamental group of a compact K\ '' ahler manifold , then the strata are finite unions of translated affine subtori .	If follows that for K\ '' ahler groups the jumping loci must be defined by binomial ideals .
1	The main difference between these two classes of homogeneous spaces is that their isotropy representation does not contain/contain equivalent summands .	We give an overview of progress on homogeneous Einstein metrics on large classes of homogeneous manifolds , such as generalized flag manifolds and Stiefel manifolds .	We also discuss a third class of homogeneous spaces that falls into the intersection of such dichotomy , namely the generalized Wallach spaces .	We give new invariant Einstein metrics on the Stiefel manifold $ V_5\mathbb { R } ^n $ ( $ n\ge 7 $ ) and through this example we show how to prove existence of invariant Einstein metrics by manipulating parametric systems of polynomial equations .	This is done by using Gr\ '' obner bases techniques .
0	The three-dimensional XY model is studied at finite chemical potential using complex Langevin dynamics .	An adaptive stepsize algorithm is implemented to cure the problem of runaway solutions that appears when using a constant stepsize .	The validity of complex Langevin dynamics is tested against calculations using imaginary chemical potential and the world line formalism .	While complex Langevin dynamics is found to work correctly at larger beta , it fails for smaller beta , in the region of the phase diagram corresponding to the disordered phase .	Diagnostic tests are developed to identify behaviour symptomatic of incorrect convergence .
0	New method is presented to look for exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations .	Two basic ideas are at the heart of our approach .	One of them is to use the general solutions of the simplest nonlinear differential equations .	Another idea is to take into consideration all possible singularities of equation studied .	Application of our approach to search exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations is discussed in detail .
4	Comparisons between our asymptotic and numerical results for the conservative and forced-dissipative forms of the GP equations as applied to these systems show excellent agreement between the two sets of solutions thereby illustrating the accuracy of these approximations .	We obtain approximations for the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii ( GP ) and complex GP equation in two and three spatial dimensions by generalizing the divergence-free WKB method .	The results include an explicit expression of a uniformly valid approximation for the condensate density of an ultracold Bose gas confined in a harmonic trap that extends into the classically forbidden region .	This provides an accurate approximation of the condensate density that includes healing effects at leading order that are missing in the widely adopted Thomas-Fermi approximation .	The results presented herein allow us to formulate useful approximations to a range of experimental systems including the equilibrium properties of a finite temperature Bose gas and the steady-state properties of a 2D nonequilibrium condensate .
2	However , space-time coding impairs the system ability to suppress interferences as the signals transmitted from two transmit antennas are superposed and interfered at the receiver antennas .	Combined with space-time coding , the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( OFDM ) system explores space diversity .	It is a potential scheme to offer spectral efficiency and robust high data rate transmissions over frequency-selective fading channel .	In this paper , we developed an adaptive beamforming based on least mean squared error algorithm and null deepening to combat co-channel interference ( CCI ) for the space-time coded OFDM ( STC-OFDM ) system .	To illustrate the performance of the presented approach , it is compared to the null steering beamformer which requires a prior knowledge of directions of arrival ( DOAs ) .
1	We present details of the newly-discovered galaxy cluster XMMU J0104.4-0630 at z=0.947 and a probable associated system in the LSS environment .	X-ray luminous clusters of galaxies at z~1 are emerging as major cosmological probes and are fundamental tools to study the cosmic large-scale structure and environmental effects of galaxy evolution at large look-back times .	The clusters were found in a systematic study for high-redshift systems using deep archival XMM-Newton data for the serendipitous detection and the X-ray analysis , complemented by optical/NIR imaging observations and spectroscopy of the main cluster .	We find a well-evolved , intermediate luminosity cluster with Lx= ( 6.4+-1.3 ) x10^43 erg/s ( 0.5-2.0 keV ) and strong central 1.4 GHz radio emission .	The cluster galaxy population exhibits a pronounced transition toward bluer colors at cluster-centric distances of 1-2 core radii , consistent with an age difference of 1-2 Gyr for a single burst solar metallicity model .
3	We propose another way to topologize $ H^n ( k , G ) $ : in the key case $ n = 1 $ , identify $ H^1 ( k , G ) $ with the set of isomorphism classes of objects of the groupoid of $ k $ -points of the classifying stack $ \mathbf { B } G $ and invoke Moret-Bailly 's general method of topologizing $ k $ -points of locally of finite type $ k $ -algebraic stacks .	Arithmetic duality theorems over a local field $ k $ are delicate to prove if $ \mathrm { char } k & gt ; 0 $ .	In this case , the proofs often exploit topologies carried by the cohomology groups $ H^n ( k , G ) $ for commutative finite type $ k $ -group schemes $ G $ .	These `` \v { C } ech topologies '' , defined using \v { C } ech cohomology , are impractical due to the lack of proofs of their basic properties , such as continuity of connecting maps in long exact sequences .	Geometric arguments prove that these `` classifying stack topologies '' enjoy the properties expected from the \v { C } ech topologies .
2	The 3-metric tensor is constituted by a dominant term , corresponding to an isotropic-like component , while the amplitude of the first order one is controlled by a `` small '' function $ \eta ( t ) $ .	In this paper we find a solution for a quasi-isotropic inflationary Universe which allows to introduce in the problem a certain degree of inhomogeneity .	We consider a model which generalize the ( flat ) FRW one by introducing a first order inhomogeneous term , whose dynamics is induced by an effective cosmological constant .	In a Universe filled with ultrarelativistic matter and a real self-interacting scalar field , we discuss the resulting dynamics , up to first order in $ \eta $ , when the scalar field performs a slow roll on a plateau of a symmetry breaking configuration and induces an effective cosmological constant .	We show how the spatial distribution of the ultrarelativistic matter and of the scalar field admits an arbitrary form but nevertheless , due to the required inflationary e-folding , it can not play a serious dynamical role in tracing the process of structures formation ( via the Harrison -- Zeldovic spectrum ) .
3	This signal is detected in two independent directions on the sky and has been identified with numerous structures visible in the survey which appear as walls and voids .	We have measured the 2 dimensional ( 2D ) power spectrum of the Las Campanas Redshift Survey on scales between 30 and 200 Mpc ( q_0=0.5 , H_o=100h km sec^ { -1 } Mpc^ { -1 } ) .	Such an analysis is more sensitive to structure on scales & gt ; 50 Mpc than a full 3 dimensional analysis given the geometry of the survey .	We find a strong peak in the power spectrum at approximately 100 Mpc relative to the smooth continuum expected from the best fit Cold Dark Matter model ( Probability is 2.5x10^ { -4 } with Omega h = 0.3 assuming a Gaussian random field ) .	Therefore , we conclude that there exists a significant increase in power on this scale and that such structures are common features in the local universe , z & lt ; = 0.2 .
1	These experiments measure only one parameter of the massive compact halo objects ( machos ) , the magnification time scale of the events .	Three ongoing microlensing experiments have found more candidate events than expected from the known stars .	More information is required to understand the nature of the machos .	A satellite experiment has been proposed to measure their projected transverse speed $ \tilde { v } = v/ ( 1-z ) $ , where $ v $ is the macho transverse speed and $ z $ its distance divided by the distance of the source .	Measurement of $ \tilde { v } $ would determine whether the machos were in the Galactic disk , Galactic halo , or in the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) .
3	The weights of a module generated by an extremal vector are contained in the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of the extremalweight .	We study the properties of level zero modules over quantized affine algebras .	The proof of the conjecture on the cyclicity of tensor products by Akasaka and the present author is given .	Several properties of modules generated by extremal vectors are proved .	The universal extremal weight module with level zero fundamental weight as an extremal weight is irreducible , and isomorphic to the affinization of an irreducible finite-dimensional module .
1	The metric for the Fermi coordinates is calculated directly from the tensor transformation rule .	Coordinate transformations are derived from global Minkowski coordinates to the Fermi coordinates of an observer moving in a circle in Minkowski space-time .	The behavior of ideal clocks is examined from the observer 's reference frame using the Fermi coordinates .	A complicated relation exists between Fermi coordinate time and proper time on stationary clocks ( in the Fermi frame ) and between proper time on satellite clocks that orbit the observer .	An orbital Sagnac-like effect exists for portable clocks that orbit the Fermi coordinate origin .
2	We study the problem of describing such sequences $ ( b_n ) $ in terms of the asymptotic decay of the subsequence $ ( b_ { p_j } ) $ , where $ p_j $ denotes the $ j $ th prime number .	Let $ \mathcal { H } _\infty $ be the set of all ordinary Dirichlet series $ D=\sum_n a_n n^ { -s } $ representing bounded holomorphic functions on the right half plane .	A multiplicative sequence $ ( b_n ) $ of complex numbers is said to be an $ \ell_1 $ -multiplier for $ \mathcal { H } _\infty $ whenever $ \sum_n |a_n b_n| & lt ; \infty $ for every $ D \in \mathcal { H } _\infty $ .	Given a multiplicative sequence $ b= ( b_n ) $ we prove ( among other results ) : $ b $ is an $ \ell_1 $ -multiplier for $ \mathcal { H } _\infty $ provided $ |b_ { p_j } | & lt ; 1 $ for all $ j $ and $ \overline { \lim } _n \frac { 1 } { \log n } \sum_ { j=1 } ^n b_ { p_j } ^ { *2 } & lt ; 1 $ , and conversely , if $ b $ is an $ \ell_1 $ -multiplier for $ \mathcal { H } _\infty $ , then $ |b_ { p_j } | & lt ; 1 $ for all $ j $ and $ \overline { \lim } _n \frac { 1 } { \log n } \sum_ { j=1 } ^n b_ { p_j } ^ { *2 } \leq 1 $ ( here $ b^* $ stands for the decreasing rearrangement of $ b $ ) .	Following an ingenious idea of Harald Bohr it turns out that this problem is intimately related with the question of characterizing those sequences $ z $ in the infinite dimensional polydisk $ \mathbb { D } ^\infty $ ( the open unit ball of $ \ell_\infty $ ) for which every bounded and holomorphic function $ f $ on $ \mathbb { D } ^\infty $ has an absolutely convergent monomial series expansion $ \sum_ { \alpha } \frac { \partial_\alpha f ( 0 ) } { \alpha ! } z^\alpha $ .
1	This process , known as polarization self-rotation ( PSR ) , has been suggested as a mechanism for producing squeezed light at atomic transition wavelengths .	The traversal of an elliptically polarized optical field through a thermal vapour cell can give rise to a rotation of its polarization axis .	In this paper , we show results of the characterization of PSR in isotopically enhanced Rubidium-87 cells , performed in two independent laboratories .	We observed that , contrary to earlier work , the presence of atomic noise in the thermal vapour overwhelms the observation of squeezing .	We present a theory that contains atomic noise terms and show that a null result in squeezing is consistent with this theory .
1	Our variational scheme accurately reproduces the known replica symmetric results and also allows for the inclusion of replica symmetry breaking effects .	A variational approach to finite connectivity spin-glass-like models is developed and applied to describe the structure of optimal solutions in random satisfiability problems .	For the 3-SAT problem , we find two transitions as the ratio $ \alpha $ of logical clauses per Boolean variables increases .	At the first one $ \alpha_s \simeq 3.96 $ , a non-trivial organization of the solution space in geometrically separated clusters emerges .	The multiplicity of these clusters as well as the typical distances between different solutions are calculated .
1	For example , security can be achieved if the adversary can store strictly less then half of the qubits transmitted during the protocol .	Secure two-party cryptography is possible if the adversary 's quantum storage device suffers imperfections .	This special case is known as the bounded-storage model , and it has long been an open question whether security can still be achieved if the adversary 's storage were any larger .	Here , we answer this question positively and demonstrate a two-party protocol which is secure as long as the adversary can not store even a small fraction of the transmitted pulses .	We also show that security can be extended to a larger class of noisy quantum memories .
4	Additional features of the proposed algorithm include low computational cost and parallel implementability .	This paper introduces a new algorithm for the so-called `` Analysis Problem '' in quantization of finite frame representations which provides a near-optimal solution in the case of random measurements .	The main contributions include the development of a general quantization framework called distributed noise-shaping , and in particular , beta duals of frames , as well as the performance analysis of beta duals in both deterministic and probabilistic settings .	It is shown that for random frames , using beta duals results in near-optimally accurate reconstructions with respect to both the frame redundancy and the number of levels that the frame coefficients are quantized at .	More specifically , for any frame $ E $ of $ m $ vectors in $ \mathbb { R } ^k $ except possibly from a subset of Gaussian measure exponentially small in $ m $ and for any number $ L \geq 2 $ of quantization levels per measurement to be used to encode the unit ball in $ \mathbb { R } ^k $ , there is an algorithmic quantization scheme and a dual frame together which guarantee a reconstruction error of at most $ \sqrt { k } L^ { - ( 1-\eta ) m/k } $ , where $ \eta $ can be arbitrarily small for sufficiently large problems .
4	Second , a comprehensive validation procedure for fluid-particle simulations is presented and applied here to the SPH-DEM method , using simulations of single and multiple particle sedimentation in a 3D fluid column and comparison with analytical models .	First , a meshless simulation method is presented for multiphase fluid-particle flows with a two-way coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ( SPH ) for the fluid and the Discrete Element Method ( DEM ) for the solid phase .	The unresolved fluid model , based on the locally averaged Navier Stokes equations , is expected to be considerably faster than fully resolved models .	Furthermore , in contrast to similar mesh-based Discrete Particle Methods ( DPMs ) , our purely particle-based method enjoys the flexibility that comes from the lack of a prescribed mesh .	It is suitable for problems such as free surface flow or flow around complex , moving and/or intermeshed geometries and is applicable to both dilute and dense particle flows .
4	The results confirm explicitly the universal relations between the parameters in the Kondo regime .	We extend the renormalized perturbation theory for the single impurity Anderson model to the n-channel model with a Hund 's rule coupling , and show that the exact results for the spin , orbital and charge susceptibilities , as well as the leading low temperature dependence for the resistivity , are obtained by working to second order in the renormalized couplings .	A universal relation is obtained between the renormalized parameters , independent of n , in the Kondo regime .	An expression for the dynamic spin susceptibility is also derived by taking into account repeated quasiparticle scattering , which is asymptotically exact in the low frequency regime and satisfies the Korringa-Shiba relation .	The renormalized parameters , including the renormalized Hund 's rule coupling , are deduced from numerical renormalization group calculations for the model for the case n=2 .
2	The best fit Bianchi model corresponds to x=0.55 , Omega_0=0.5 , a rotation axis in the direction ( l , b ) = ( 222degr , -62degr ) , shear ( sigma/H ) _0=2.4e-10 and a right -- handed vorticity ( omega/H ) _0=6.1e-10 .	Motivated by the large-scale asymmetry observed in the cosmic microwave background sky , we consider a specific class of anisotropic cosmological models -- Bianchi type VII_h -- and compare them to the WMAP first-year data on large angular scales .	Remarkably , we find evidence of a correlation which is ruled out as a chance alignment at the 3sigma level .	Correcting for this component greatly reduces the significance of the large-scale power asymmetry , resolves several anomalies detected on large angular scales ( ie .	the low quadrupole amplitude and quadrupole/octopole planarity and alignment ) , and can account for a non -- Gaussian `` cold spot '' on the sky .
2	( 3 ) The most likely candidate for cold dark matter is therefore a sneutrino .	An unconventional version of supersymmetry leads to the following highly testable predictions : ( 1 ) The Higgs boson has an R-parity of -1 , so it can only be produced as one member of a pair of superpartners .	( 2 ) The only superpartners are scalar bosons , so neutralinos etc.do not exist .	( 4 ) The Higgs and other bosonic superpartners have an unconventional equation of motion .	These predictions are associated with new interpretations of Yukawa couplings , supersymmetry , gauge fields , and Lorentz invariance .
2	Physically relevant applications include explicit estimates of the pulse frequencies and mean spacings for which the transport is non-zero , and more specifically the pulse frequencies which maximize work .	We consider a generalized one-dimensional chain in a periodic potential ( the Frenkel-Kontorova model ) , with dissipative , pulsating ( or ratchet ) dynamics as a model of transport when the average force on the system is zero .	We find lower bounds on the transport speed under mild assumptions on the asymmetricity and steepness of the site potential .	The bounds explicitly depend on the pulse period and subtle number-theoretical properties of the mean spacing .	The used method is a study of the time evolution of spatially invariant measures in the space of measures equipped with the $ L^1 $ -Wasserstein metric .
4	Standard Model branching ratios , calculated as functions of the Higgs boson mass , are assumed .	We combine results from CDF and D0 searches for a standard model Higgs boson in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron at sqrt { s } =1.96 TeV .	With 1.0-2.4 fb-1 of data collected at CDF , and 1.1-2.3 fb-1 at D0 , the 95 % C.L .	upper limits on Higgs boson production are a factor of 3.7 ( 1.1 ) higher than the SM cross section for a Higgs boson mass of m_ { H } =115 ( 160 ) GeV .	Based on simulation , the median expected upper limit should be 3.3 ( 1.6 ) .
1	So far the experimental realization of proposed extended plasmonic networks consisting of multiple functional elements remains challenging , mainly due to the multi-crystallinity of commonly used thermally evaporated gold layers .	Deep subwavelength integration of high-definition plasmonic nanostructures is of key importance for the development of future optical nanocircuitry for high-speed communication , quantum computation and lab-on-a-chip applications .	Resulting structural imperfections in individual circuit elements will drastically reduce the yield of functional integrated nanocircuits .	Here we demonstrate the use of very large ( & gt ; 100 micron^2 ) but thin ( & lt ; 80 nm ) chemically grown single-crystalline gold flakes , which , after immobilization , serve as an ideal basis for focused-ion beam milling and other top-down nanofabrication techniques on any desired substrate .	Using this methodology we obtain high-definition ultrasmooth gold nanostructures with superior optical properties and reproducible nano-sized features over micrometer length scales .
4	A detailed analysis is presented for the various forms of the passive scalar equation and for the first-order It\^ { o } stochastic partial differential equation .	A new method is described for constructing a generalized solution for stochastic differential equations .	The method is based on the Cameron-Martin version of the Wiener Chaos expansion and provides a unified framework for the study of ordinary and partial differential equations driven by finite- or infinite-dimensional noise with either adapted or anticipating input .	Existence , uniqueness , regularity , and probabilistic representation of this Wiener Chaos solution is established for a large class of equations .	A number of examples are presented to illustrate the general constructions .
4	In order to address it , we propose a single-sided market mechanism for trading virtual machine instances in the cloud , where the cloud provider can express the reservation prices for traded cloud services .	With the rapidly growing demand for the cloud services , a need for efficient methods to trade computing resources increases .	Commonly used fixed-price model is not always the best approach for trading cloud resources , because of its inflexible and static nature .	Dynamic trading systems , which make use of market mechanisms , show promise for more efficient resource allocation and pricing in the cloud .	However , most of the existing mechanisms ignore the seller 's costs of providing the resources .
0	We argue that gravitational instability in the outer parts of collapsar disks may lead to fragmentation near the radius where helium photodisintegrates , because of the strong cooling provided by this process .	This physics sets clear physical scales for the fragmentation conditions and the properties of gravitationally bound clumps .	Collapse of a fragment proceeds until the neutrons become degenerate ; a neutron star of mass ~0.1-1Msun may result .	We find that tidal disruption of a fragment and accretion by the central black hole are too rapid to account for the durations of observed X-ray flares from long gamma-ray bursts .	Prior to disruption , migration of the fragment is driven by gravitational radiation and disk viscosity , which act together to produce a unique gravitational-wave signature .
4	The main parameter is carbon abundance .	It is of prime importance to recognize evolution and extinction effects in supernovae results as a function of redshift , for SN Ia to be considered as distance indicators .	This review surveys all observational data searching for an evolution and/or extinction , according to host morphology .	For instance , it has been observed that high-z SNe Ia have bluer colours than the local ones : although this goes against extinction to explain why SN are dimmer with redshift until z ~ 1 , supporting a decelerating universe , it also demonstrates intrinsic evolution effects .	-- SNe Ia could evolve because the age and metallicity of their progenitors evolve .
3	Using the mathematical concept of immersed surface to represent the configuration of the bilayer , one might expect to be able to adapt methods from differential geometry and the calculus of variations to perform a fine analysis of bilayer configurations in terms of the parameters that it depends upon .	The Helfrich functional , denoted by H^ { c_0 } , is a mathematical expression proposed by Helfrich ( 1973 ) for the natural free energy carried by an elastic phospholipid bilayer .	Helfrich theorises that idealised elastic phospholipid bilayers minimise H^ { c_0 } among all possible configurations .	The functional integrates a spontaneous curvature parameter c_0 together with the mean curvature of the bilayer and constraints on area and volume , either through an inclusion of osmotic pressure difference and tensile stress or otherwise .	In this article we focus upon the case of spherical red blood cells with a view to better understanding spherocytes and spherocytosis .
0	Isogeometric cohesive elements are presented for modeling two and three dimensional delaminated composite structures .	We exploit the knot insertion algorithm offered by NURBS ( Non Uniform Rational B-splines ) to generate cohesive elements along delamination planes in an automatic fashion .	A complete computational framework is presented including pre-processing , processing and post-processing .	They are explained in details and implemented in MIGFEM -- an open source Matlab Isogemetric Analysis code developed by the authors .	The composite laminates are modeled using both NURBS solid and shell elements .
4	Our second conclusion is that even when the inter-strand attraction alone is too weak for creating a naturated state at the given temperature , and also the surface-strand attraction alone is too weak for creating an adsorbed state , the combined effect of the two attractions can lead to a naturated and adsorbed state .	The thermally induced denaturation of DNA in the presence of attractive solid surface is studied .	The two strands of DNA are modeled via two coupled flexible chains without volume interactions .	If the two strands are adsorbed on the surface , the denaturation phase-transition disappears .	Instead , there is a smooth crossover to a weakly naturated state .
3	This construction directly yields decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA , as well as an elementary upper bound for the bisimilarity problem on the subclass of probabilistic basic process algebras , i.e. , single-state pPDA .	We study the bisimilarity problem for probabilistic pushdown automata ( pPDA ) and subclasses thereof .	Our definition of pPDA allows both probabilistic and non-deterministic branching , generalising the classical notion of pushdown automata ( without epsilon-transitions ) .	Our first contribution is a general construction that reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic transition systems to checking bisimilarity of non-deterministic transition systems .	We further show that , with careful analysis , the general reduction can be used to prove an EXPTIME upper bound for bisimilarity of probabilistic visibly pushdown automata .
4	The case $ n=3 $ is solved with nested Bethe ansatz method and it is showed the dependence of the Bethe equations in the second parameter introduced	The Hoft structure of the central extension of the $ U_q \left ( \widehat { sl\left ( n \right ) } \right ) $ algebra is considered .	The intertwine matrix induces new integrable spin chain models .	We show the relation of these models and the biparametric spin chain $ \widehat { sl_ { p , q } \left ( n \right ) } $ models .	The cases $ n=2 $ are $ n=3 $ are discussed and for $ n=2 $ we obtain the model of Dasgupta and Chowdhury .
1	To understand this new convention of digital culture , we study the collective behavior of sharing selfies on Instagram and present how people appear in selfies and which patterns emerge from such interactions .	Online interactions are increasingly involving images , especially those containing human faces , which are naturally attention grabbing and more effective at conveying feelings than text .	Analysis of millions of photos shows that the amount of selfies has increased by 900 times from 2012 to 2014 .	Selfies are an effective medium to grab attention ; they generate on average 1.1 -- 3.2 times more likes and comments than other types of content on Instagram .	Compared to other content , interactions involving selfies exhibit variations in homophily scores ( in terms of age and gender ) that suggest they are becoming more widespread .
0	The Higgs sector of the Standard Model offers a unique opportunity to probe the hidden sector .	The Higgs squared operator is the only dimension two operator which is Lorentz and gauge invariant .	It can therefore couple both to scalar curvature and the hidden sector at the dim -- 4 level .	We consider the possibility that a combination of the Higgs and a singlet from the hidden sector plays the role of inflaton , due to their large couplings to gravity .	This implies that the quartic couplings satisfy certain constraints which leads to distinct low energy phenomenology , including Higgs signals at the LHC .
4	This is simulated , requiring far less constraints on the initial conditions used .	We numerically simulate the formation of $ ( 2+1 ) $ -dimensional baby Skyrmions and $ ( 3+1 ) $ -dimensional $ SU ( 2 ) $ Skyrmions from domain wall collisions .	It has been suggested that Skyrmion , anti-Skyrmion pairs can be produced from the interaction of two domain walls .	This is confirmed , however it is also demonstrated that the process can require quite precise conditions .	An alternative , more stable , formation process is proposed as the interaction of more than two segments of domain wall .
2	For strong spontaneous emission from that state , however , the ionization is never complete because the dark state required for STIRAP does not exist .	We propose a technique which produces nearly complete ionization of the population of a discrete state coupled to a continuum by a two-photon transition via a lossy intermediate state whose lifetime is much shorter than the interaction duration .	We show that using counterintuitively ordered pulses , as in stimulated Raman adiabatic passage ( STIRAP ) , wherein the pulse coupling the intermediate state to the continuum precedes and partly overlaps the pulse coupling the initial and intermediate states , greatly increases the ionization signal and strongly reduces the population loss due to spontaneous emission through the lossy state .	We demonstrate that this drawback can be eliminated almost completely by creating a laser-induced continuum structure ( LICS ) by embedding a third discrete state into the continuum with a third control laser .	This LICS introduces some coherence into the continuum , which enables a STIRAP-like population transfer into the continuum .
4	These problems are reduced to one optimal stopping problem and one Dynkin game .	In this paper we consider stochastic optimization problems for an ambiguity averse decision maker who is uncertain about the parameters of the underlying process .	In a first part we consider problems of optimal stopping under drift ambiguity for one-dimensional diffusion processes .	Analogously to the case of ordinary optimal stopping problems for one-dimensional Brownian motions we reduce the problem to the geometric problem of finding the smallest majorant of the reward function in a two-parameter function space .	In a second part we solve optimal stopping problems when the underlying process may crash down .
0	Due to notable discoveries in the fast evolving field of complex networks , recent research in software engineering has also focused on representing software systems with networks .	Previous work has observed that these networks follow scale-free degree distributions and reveal small-world phenomena , while we here explore another property commonly found in different complex networks , i.e.community structure .	We adopt class dependency networks , where nodes represent software classes and edges represent dependencies among them , and show that these networks reveal a significant community structure , characterized by similar properties as observed in other complex networks .	However , although intuitive and anticipated by different phenomena , identified communities do not exactly correspond to software packages .	We empirically confirm our observations on several networks constructed from Java and various third party libraries , and propose different applications of community detection to software engineering .
1	The $ r $ -dynamic chromatic number of $ G $ , $ \chi_r ( G ) $ , is defined as the smallest $ k $ such that $ G $ admits an $ r $ -dynamic $ k $ -coloring .	An $ r $ -dynamic $ k $ -coloring of a graph $ G $ is a proper vertex $ k $ -coloring such that the neighbors of any vertex $ v $ receive at least $ \min\ { r , { \rm deg } ( v ) \ } $ different colors .	In this paper we introduce an upper bound for $ \chi_r ( G ) $ in terms of $ r $ , chromatic number , maximum degree and minimum degree .	In 2001 , Montgomery \cite { MR2702379 } conjectured that , for a $ d $ -regular graph $ G $ , $ \chi_2 ( G ) -\chi ( G ) \leq 2 $ .	In this regard , for a $ d $ -regular graph $ G $ , we present two upper bounds for $ \chi_2 ( G ) -\chi ( G ) $ , one of them , $ \lceil 5.437\log d+2.721\rceil $ , is an improvement of the bound $ 14.06\log d +1 $ , proved by Alishahi ( 2011 ) \cite { MR2746973 } .
1	Although the onset of novae from runaway thermonuclear fusion reactions on the surface of a white dwarf in a binary star system is understood [ 1 ] , the structure , dynamics , and mass of the ejecta are not well known .	Stellar explosions such as novae and supernovae produce most of the heavy elements in the Universe .	In rare cases , the white dwarf is embedded in the wind nebula of a red-giant companion ; the explosion products plow through the nebula and produce X-ray emission .	Early this year , an eruption of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi [ 2,3 ] provided the first opportunity to perform comprehensive X-ray observations of such an event and diagnose conditions within the ejecta .	Here we show that the hard X-ray emission from RS Ophiuchi early in the eruption emanates from behind a blast wave , or outward-moving shock wave , that expanded freely for less than 2 days and then decelerated due to interaction with the nebula .
1	Excessive surface traffic is a cause of increased controller and pilot workload .	Airport departure operations are a source of airline delays and passenger frustration .	It is also a source of increased emissions and delays , and does not yield improved runway throughput .	Leveraging the extensive past research on airport departure management , this paper explores the environmental and safety benefits that improved surveillance technologies can bring in the context of gate- or spot-release strategies .	The paper shows that improved surveillance technologies can yield 4 % to 6 % reduction of aircraft on taxiway , and therefore emissions , in addition to the savings currently observed by implementing threshold starategies under evaluation at Boston Logan Airport and other busy airports during congested periods .
4	Our work therefore provides a robust theoretical proposal for the controlling of the non-equilibrium stationary current through a quantum dot in a randomly fluctuating potential .	We study the transport through a quantum dot subject to a randomly fluctuating potential , generated by a sequence of pulses in the gate voltage with the help of the autoregressive model .	We find that the tunneling current is multistable when the fluctuating potential with a finite correlation time is applied before the non-equilibrium steady state is built up .	The non-equilibrium stationary current is heavily dependent on the history of the fluctuating potential during the transient period if the potential has a finite correlation time .	Furthermore , the averaged current over the path of the fluctuating potential is a function of its strength and correlation time .
1	These inhomogeneities , responsible for the conspicuous photometric and spectroscopic variation of Ap stars , are believed to be produced by atomic diffusion operating in the stellar atmospheres stabilized by multi-kG magnetic fields .	The upper main sequence magnetic chemically peculiar ( Ap ) stars exhibit a non-uniform distribution of chemical elements across their surfaces and with height in their atmospheres .	Here I present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in understanding Ap-star spots and their relation to magnetic fields .	In particular , I highlight recent 3-D chemical spot structure studies and summarize magnetic field mapping results based on the inversion of the full Stokes vector spectropolarimetric observations .	I also discuss a puzzling new type of spotted stars , HgMn stars , in which the formation and evolution of heavy element spots is driven by a poorly understood mechanism , apparently unrelated to magnetic fields .
0	The presence of defects can introduce important changes in the electronic structure of graphene , leading to phenomena such as C magnetism .	In addition , vacancies are reactive and permit the incorporation of dopants .	This paper discusses the electronic properties of defective graphene for O and B decoration .	Phonon calculations allow us to address directly the stability of the systems under study .	We show that it is possible to obtain magnetic solutions with and without dangling bonds , demonstrating that C magnetism can be achieved in the presence of B and O .
0	We derive an estimate of the rate of formation of dark matter halos per unit volume as a function of the halo mass and redshift of formation .	Analytical estimates of the number density of dark matter halos are useful in modeling several cosmological phenomena .	We use the excursion set formalism for computing the formation rate of dark matter halos .	We use an approach that allows us to differentiate between major and minor mergers , as this is a pertinent issue for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation .	We compute the formation rate for the Press-Schechter and the Sheth-Tormen mass function .
0	Finite fields of the form GF ( 2^m ) play an important role in coding theory and cryptography .	We show that the choice of how to represent the elements of these fields can have a significant impact on the resource requirements for quantum arithmetic .	In particular , we show how the use of Gaussian normal basis representations and of `ghost-bit basis ' representations can be used to implement inverters with a quantum circuit of depth O ( m log ( m ) ) .	To the best of our knowledge , this is the first construction with subquadratic depth reported in the literature .	Our quantum circuit for the computation of multiplicative inverses is based on the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm which exploits that in normal basis representation squaring corresponds to a permutation of the coefficients .
4	For each original text , two simplified versions were generated manually with increasing number of simplification operations .	Methods from statistical physics , such as those involving complex networks , have been increasingly used in quantitative analysis of linguistic phenomena .	In this paper , we represented pieces of text with different levels of simplification in co-occurrence networks and found that topological regularity correlated negatively with textual complexity .	Furthermore , in less complex texts the distance between concepts , represented as nodes , tended to decrease .	The complex networks metrics were treated with multivariate pattern recognition techniques , which allowed us to distinguish between original texts and their simplified versions .
3	However , at the 20-kton scale planned for the new detectors , these channels become powerful tools for probing the $ \nu_e $ emission .	We examine the prospects for detecting supernova $ \nu_e $ in JUNO , RENO-50 , LENA , or other approved or proposed large liquid scintillator detectors .	The main detection channels for supernova $ \nu_e $ in a liquid scintillator are its elastic scattering with electrons and its charged-current interaction with the $ ^ { 12 } $ C nucleus .	In existing scintillator detectors , the numbers of events from these interactions are too small to be very useful .	We find that the $ \nu_e $ spectrum can be well measured , to better than $ \sim 40\ % $ precision for the total energy and better than $ \sim 25\ % $ precision for the average energy .
3	Critical to their future use as 'frequency markers ' , is however the absolute frequency stabilization of the optical comb spectrum .	Optical frequency combs have revolutionized the field of frequency metrology within the last decade and have become enabling tools for atomic clocks , gas sensing and astrophysical spectrometer calibration .	The rapidly increasing number of applications has heightened interest in more compact comb generators .	Optical microresonator based comb generators bear promise in this regard .	A powerful technique for this stabilization is self-referencing , which requires a spectrum that spans a full octave , i.e.a factor of two in frequency .
2	We focus on the long-wavelength magnetic dynamics that experiences current-induced torques and produces fictitious electromotive forces .	We study the role of spin-orbit interactions in the coupled magnetoelectric dynamics of a ferromagnetic film coated with an electrical conductor .	While the main thrust of this work is phenomenological , several popular simple models are considered microscopically in some detail , including Rashba and Dirac two-dimensional electron gases coupled to a magnetic insulator , as well as a diffusive spin Hall system .	Our phenomenology provides a suitable framework for analyzing experiments on current-induced magnetic dynamics and reciprocal charge pumping , including the effects of magnetoresistance and Gilbert-damping anisotropies , without a need to resort to any microscopic considerations or modeling .	Finally , some remarks are made regarding the interplay of spin-orbit interactions and magnetic textures .
0	Tree-reweighted max-product ( TRW ) message passing is a modified form of the ordinary max-product algorithm for attempting to find minimal energy configurations in Markov random field with cycles .	For a TRW fixed point satisfying the strong tree agreement condition , the algorithm outputs a configuration that is provably optimal .	In this paper , we focus on the case of binary variables with pairwise couplings , and establish stronger properties of TRW fixed points that satisfy only the milder condition of weak tree agreement ( WTA ) .	First , we demonstrate how it is possible to identify part of the optimal solution|i.e. , a provably optimal solution for a subset of nodes| without knowing a complete solution .	Second , we show that for submodular functions , a WTA fixed point always yields a globally optimal solution .
0	The existence of a minimal and fundamental length scale , say , the Planck length , is a characteristic feature of almost all the models of quantum gravity .	The presence of the fundamental length is expected to lead to an improved ultra-violet behavior of the semi-classical propagators .	The hypothesis of path integral duality provides a prescription to evaluate the modified propagator of a free , quantum scalar field in a given spacetime , taking into account the existence of the fundamental length in a locally Lorentz invariant manner .	We use this prescription to compute the quantum gravitational modifications to the propagators in spacetimes with constant curvature , and show that : ( i ) the modified propagators are ultra-violet finite , and ( ii ) the modifications are non-perturbative in the Planck length .	We discuss the implications of our results .
1	Representative applications are reviewed and some new developments are introduced .	Several advances have extended the power and versatility of coherent state theory to the extent that it has become a vital tool in the representation theory of Lie groups and their Lie algebras .	The examples given are chosen to illustrate special features of the scalar and vector coherent state constructions and how they work in practical situations .	Comparisons are made with Mackey 's theory of induced representations .	For simplicity , we focus on square integrable ( discrete series ) unitary representations although many of the techniques apply more generally , with minor adjustment .
0	We have obtained FUSE and HST STIS spectra of HR 4796A , a nearby 8 Myr old main sequence star that possesses a dusty circumstellar disk whose inclination has been constrained from high resolution near-infrared observations to be ~17 deg from edge-on .	We searched for circumstellar absorption in the ground states of C II at 1036.3 A , O I at 1039.2 A , Zn II at 2026.1 A , Lyman series H2 , and CO ( A-X ) and failed to detect any of these species .	We place upper limits on the column densities and infer upper limits on the gas masses assuming that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , is well-mixed , and has a temperature , Tgas ~ 65 K. Our measurements suggest that this system possesses very little molecular gas .	Therefore , we infer an upper limit for the gas : dust ratio ( & lt ; 4.0 ) assuming that the gas is atomic .	We measure less gas in this system than is required to form the envelope of Jupiter .
0	We present reduced basis approximations and rigorous a posteriori error bounds for the instationary Stokes equations .	We shall discuss both a method based on the standard formulation as well as a method based on a penalty approach , which combine techniques developed in our previous work on parametrized saddle point problems with current reduced basis techniques for parabolic problems .	The analysis then shows how time integration affects the development of reduced basis a posteriori error bounds as well as the construction of computationally efficient reduced basis approximation spaces .	To demonstrate their performance in practice , the methods are applied to a Stokes flow in a two-dimensional microchannel with a parametrized rectangular obstacle ; evolution in time is induced by a time-dependent velocity profile on the inflow boundary .	Numerical results illustrate ( i ) the rapid convergence of reduced basis approximations , ( ii ) the performance of a posteriori error bounds with respect to sharpness , and ( iii ) computational efficiency .
4	Clusters with a smaller initial separation tend to merge in $ \aplt 60 $ Myr due to loss of angular momentum from escaping stars .	We study the evolution of bound pairs of star clusters by means of direct N-body simulations .	Our simulations include mass loss by stellar evolution .	The initial conditions are selected to mimic the observed binary star cluster NGC 2136 and NGC 2137 in the Large Magellanic Cloud .	Based on the rather old ages ( $ \sim 100 $ Myr ) , masses , sizes of the two clusters and their projected separation , we conclude that the cluster pair must have been born with an initial separation of 15 -- 20 pc .
4	We expect that our model might simplify calculations of one-loop amplitudes with respect to standard quantum field theoretical methods .	We develop a worldline approach to quantum gravity in D=4 .	Using the background field method we consider the covariantly gauge fixed Einstein-Hilbert action with cosmological constant , and find a worldline representation of the differential operators identified by its quadratic approximation .	We test it by computing the correct one-loop divergencies .	Alternative worldline methods , such as the use of the O ( 4 ) spinning particle that is known to describe correctly the propagation of a massless spin 2 particle in D=4 , find obstructions in the coupling to an arbitrary background metric , apparently preventing a more extensive use in perturbative descriptions of quantum gravity .
1	We considered one head-on collision and one off-axis collision between two 0.6 M_sun main sequence stars .	We performed high-resolution simulations of two stellar collisions relevant for stars in globular clusters .	We show that a resolution of about 100 000 particles is sufficient for most studies of the structure and evolution of blue stragglers .	We demonstrate conclusively that collision products between main-sequence stars in globular clusters do not have surface convection zones larger than 0.004 M_sun after the collision , nor do they develop convection zones during the `pre-main-sequence ' thermal relaxation phase of their post-collision evolution .	Therefore , any mechanism which requires a surface convection zone ( i.e.chemical mixing or angular momentum loss via a magnetic wind ) can not operate in these stars .
3	The majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a high probability of containing AGN .	We provide evidence for a correlation between the presence of giant clumps and the occurrence of active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) in disk galaxies .	Giant clumps of 10^8-9 Msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-rich galaxies , and it has been proposed that this instability could feed supermassive black holes ( BH ) .	We use emission line diagnostics to compare a sample of 14 clumpy ( unstable ) disks and a sample of 13 smoother ( stable ) disks at redshift z~0.7 .	Their [ OIII ] emission line is strongly excited , inconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone .
1	This is reflected in the analysis of experimental results on tracer particles and the discussions which follow , as reported in recent experimental and numerical publications .	The leading paradigm for chaotic flows dominated by dissipation predicts an exponential growth of the mean distance between pairs of fluid elements , in the long run .	To quantitatively validate this prediction , we have conducted a microfluidic experiment generating elastic turbulence , a flow characterised in the literature as smooth in space and random in time .	To our great surprise , we discovered that the pair separation follows a much slower power-law -- - also known as ballistic -- - a notion overlooked so far for flows of this type .	We provide conclusive experimental evidence that this scaling is well-desribed by the same coefficients derived from the short-time dynamics .
0	Context : Hadronic models , involving matter ( proton or nuclei ) acceleration in blazar jets , imply high energy photon and neutrino emissions due to interactions of high-energy protons with matter and/or radiation in the source environment .	Aims : This paper shows that the sensitivity of the IceCube neutrino telescope in its 40-string configuration ( IC-40 ) is already at the level of constraining the parameter space of purely hadronic scenarios of activity of blazars .	Methods : Assuming that the entire source power originates from hadronic interactions , and assuming that the models describe the data , we estimate the expected neutrino flux from blazars based on the observed gamma-ray flux by Fermi , simultaneously with IC-40 observations .	We consider two cases separately to keep the number of constrainable parameters at an acceptable level : proton-proton or proton-gamma interactions are dominant .	Comparing the IC-40 sensitivity to the neutrino flux expected from some of the brightest blazars , we constrain model parameters characterizing the parent high-energy proton spectrum .
1	These films show a superconducting transition temperature ( Tc ) of over 30 K although P content is around 0.22 , which is lower than the optimal one for single crystals ( i.e. , 0.33 ) .	Microstructura lly clean , isov alently P-doped BaFe2As2 ( Ba-122 ) single crystalline thin films have been prepared on MgO ( 001 ) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy .	The enhanced Tc at this doping level is attributed to the in-plane tensile strain .	The strained film shows high transport self-field critical current densities ( Jc ) of over 6 MA/cm2 at 4.2 K , which are among the highest for Fe based superconductors ( FeSCs ) .	In-field Jc exceeds 0.1 MA/cm2 at m0H = 35 T for H||ab and m0H = 18 T for H||c at 4.2 K , respectively , in spite of moderate upper critical fields compared to other FeSCs with similar Tc .
4	Resonant vortex dynamic generation , including revivals , is shown to be possible not only in waveguides mediated by total internal reflection but also in Bragg-guiding hollow-core geometries .	We expose a mechanism for the dynamical generation and control of light states with diverse topologies in spiraling guiding structures .	Specifically , we show that spiraling shallow refractive index landscapes induce coupling and periodic energy exchange between states with different topological charges .	Such a resonant effect enables excitation of optical vortices by vortex-free inputs and allows the output topological charge of the beam to be controlled .	The presence of nonlinearity results in a strong asymmetrization of the resonant curves and a shift of the resonant frequencies .
4	Moreover , additional atomic qubits are not required , but only a single-photon medium .	We propose a heralded quantum repeater based on the scattering of photons off single emitters in one-dimensional waveguides .	We show the details by implementing nonlocal entanglement generation , entanglement swapping , and entanglement purification modules with atoms in waveguides , and discuss the feasibility of the repeater with currently achievable technology .	The scheme features a filtering mechanism that the faulty events can be discarded by detecting the polarization of the photons .	That is , our protocols either succeed with 100 % fidelity or fail in a heralded way , which is advantageous for implementing realistic long-distance quantum communication .
4	Photoelectrons from the CsI photocathode drift toward the charge readout micro-structure in the centre of the detector .	We propose a new concept for a very low background multi-ton liquid xenon Dark Matter experiment .	The detector consists of two concentric spheres and a charge readout device in the centre .	Xenon between the two spheres forms a self-shield and veto device .	The inner surface of the central sphere is coated with CsI to form an internal photocathode with minimum of 2\pi coverage for any event in the active volume .
1	In datasets with solely nominal input variables , we observe records with the exact same input $ x^u $ , but different real valued outputs due to the inherent noise in the system .	Proposed methods for prediction interval estimation so far focus on cases where input variables are numerical .	Existing prediction interval estimation methods do not use representations that can accurately model such inherent noise in the case of nominal inputs .	We propose a new prediction interval estimation method tailored for this type of data , which is prevalent in biology and medicine .	We call this method Distribution Adaptive Prediction Interval Estimation given Nominal inputs ( DAPIEN ) and has four main phases .
4	In this work , we apply this methodology to the stacked profiles of 58 high-redshift ( $ 0.1 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.2 $ ) clusters using X-ray surface brightness profiles from the XMM Cluster Survey and weak lensing profiles from CFHTLenS .	The Beyond Horndeski class of alternative gravity theories allow for Self-accelerating de-Sitter cosmologies with no need for a cosmological constant .	This makes them viable alternatives to $ \Lambda $ CDM and so testing their small-scale predictions against General Relativity is of paramount importance .	These theories generically predict deviations in both the Newtonian force law and the gravitational lensing of light inside extended objects .	Therefore , by simultaneously fitting the X-ray and lensing profiles of galaxy clusters new constraints can be obtained .
3	While relatively mature , DFT has never been implemented in its full power , as it relies on a very large number ( ~ 10^9-10^12 ) of expensive calculations ( ~ day ) .	Reliable calculations of the structure of heavy elements are crucial to address fundamental science questions such as the origin of the elements in the universe .	Applications relevant for energy production , medicine , or national security also rely on theoretical predictions of basic properties of atomic nuclei .	Heavy elements are best described within the nuclear density functional theory ( DFT ) and its various extensions .	The advent of leadership-class computers , as well as dedicated large-scale collaborative efforts such as the SciDAC 2 UNEDF project , have dramatically changed the field .
4	Implications for the application of perturbative QCD to the quark-gluon plasma are also discussed .	Recent developments of perturbation theory at finite temperature based on effective field theory methods are reviewed .	These methods allow the contributions from the different scales to be separated and the perturbative series to be reorganized .	The construction of the effective field theory is shown in detail for phi^4 theory and QCD .	It is applied to the evaluation of the free energy of QCD at order g^5 and the calculation of the g^6 term is outlined .
1	In the case of a circular equilibrium ( i.e.vorton ) state of a closed string loop it is shown that the fundamental axisymmetric ( $ n=0 $ ) and lowest order ( $ n=1 $ ) nonaxisymmetric perturbation modes can never be unstable .	Dynamic perturbation equations are derived for a generic stationary state of an elastic string model -- of the kind appropriate for representing a superconducting cosmic string -- in a flat background .	However , stability for modes of higher order ( $ n\geq 2 $ ) is found to be non-trivially dependent on the values of the characteristic propagation velocity , $ c $ say , of longitudinal perturbations and of the corresponding extrinsic perturbation velocity , $ v $ say .	For each mode number the criterion for instability is the existence of nonreal roots for a certain cubic eigenvalue equation for the corresponding mode frequency .	A very simple sufficient but not necessary condition for reality of the roots and therefore absence of instability is that the characteristic velocity ratio , $ c/v $ be greater than or equal to unity .
0	We have found that the bulge of the large , nearby Sb galaxy NGC 7331 rotates retrograde to its disk .	Analysis of spectra in the region of the near-IR Ca II triplet along the major axis shows that , in the radial range between 5 '' and ~20 '' , the line of sight velocity distribution of the absorption lines has two distinct peaks , and can be decomposed into a fast-rotating component with v/sigma & gt ; 3 , and a slower rotating , retrograde component with v/sigma between 1 -- 1.5 .	The radial surface brightness profile of the counter-rotating component follows that of the bulge , obtained from a 2-dimensional bulge-disk decomposition of a near-infrared K-band image , while the fast rotating component follows the disk .	At the radius where the disk starts to dominate the isophotes change from being considerably boxy to very disky .	Although a number of spiral galaxies have been found that contain cold , couter-rotating disks , this is the first galaxy known to have a boxy , probably triaxial , fairly warm , counter-rotating component , which is dominating in the central regions .
1	The embedding is achieved by translating both the static structure ( modelling aspect ) and the evolution semantics of Petri nets .	We present an embedding of Petri nets into B abstract systems .	The static structure of a Petri-net is captured within a B abstract system through a graph structure .	This abstract system is then included in another abstract system which captures the evolution semantics of Petri-nets .	The evolution semantics results in some B events depending on the chosen policies : basic nets or high level Petri nets .
1	In the m-L plane , there is a line of center symmetry changing phase transitions .	We study the phase diagram of SU ( 2 ) Yang-Mills theory with one adjoint Weyl fermion on R^3xS^1 as a function of the fermion mass m and the compactification scale L. This theory reduces to thermal pure gauge theory as m- & gt ; infinity and to circle-compactified ( non-thermal ) supersymmetric gluodynamics in the limit m- & gt ; 0 .	In the limit m- & gt ; infinity , this transition takes place at L_c=1/T_c , where T_c is the critical temperature of the deconfinement transition in pure Yang-Mills theory .	We show that near m=0 , the critical compactification scale L_c can be computed using semi-classical methods and that the transition is of second order .	This suggests that the deconfining phase transition in pure Yang-Mills theory is continuously connected to a transition that can be studied at weak coupling .
2	Purpose : Develop a new three-body method , which tackles properly the scattering boundary condition for three charged particles and takes into account both the resonant and the non-resonant reaction mechanisms on the same footing , to compute the triple-alpha reaction rate at low temperatures .	Background : The triple-alpha reaction is the key to our understanding about the nucleosynthesis and the observed abundance of $ ^ { 12 } $ C in stars .	The theory of this process is well established at high temperatures but rather ambiguous in the low temperature regime where measurements are impossible .	Methods : We combine the R-matrix expansion , the R-matrix propagation method , and the screening technique in the hyperspherical harmonics basis .	Results : Both the $ 2^+_1 $ bound state and the $ 0^+_2 $ resonant state in $ ^ { 12 } $ C are well reproduced .
4	We further obtain a simple expression for the asymptotic ASER , which is useful to determine a factor governing the system performance at high SNRs , i.e. , the diversity order .	Performance of quadrature amplitude modulation ( QAM ) schemes is analyzed with dual-hop decode-and-forward ( DF ) relaying systems over mixed $ \eta $ - $ \mu $ and $ \kappa $ - $ \mu $ fading channels .	Closed-form expressions are obtained for the average symbol error rate ( ASER ) for general order rectangular QAM and cross QAM schemes using moment generating function based approach .	Derived expressions are in the form of Lauricella 's $ ( F_D^ { ( n ) } ( \cdot ) , \Phi_1^ { ( n ) } ( \cdot ) ) $ hypergeometric functions which can be numerically evaluated using either integral or series representation .	The obtained ASER expressions include other mixed fading channel cases addressed in the literature as special cases such as mixed Hoyt , and Rice fading , mixed Nakagami- $ m $ , and Rice fading .
0	We analytically study the dynamics of evolving populations that exhibit metastability on the level of phenotype or fitness .	In constant selective environments , such metastable behavior is caused by two qualitatively different mechanisms .	One the one hand , populations may become pinned at a local fitness optimum , being separated from higher-fitness genotypes by a { \em fitness barrier } of low-fitness genotypes .	On the other hand , the population may only be metastable on the level of phenotype or fitness while , at the same time , diffusing over { \em neutral networks } of selectively neutral genotypes .	Metastability occurs in this case because the population is separated from higher-fitness genotypes by an { \em entropy barrier } : The population must explore large portions of these neutral networks before it discovers a rare connection to fitter phenotypes .
1	At finite quark chemical potential , the real and imaginary parts of the effective potential , in terms of the Polyakov loop variables , are made apparent , showing explicitly the fermion sign problem of the theory .	We obtain the in-medium effective potential of the three-flavor Polyakov-Quark-Meson model as a real function of real variables in the Polyakov loop variable , to allow for the study of all possible minima of the model .	The phase diagram and other equilibrium observables , obtained from the real part of the effective potential , are calculated in the mean-field approximation .	The obtained results are compared to those found with the so-called saddle-point approach .	Our procedure also allows the calculation of the surface tension between the chirally broken and confined phase , and the chirally restored and deconfined phase .
3	In particular , we recover the fundamental Rees 's mixed multiplicity theorem for modules , which was proved first by Kirby and Rees in \cite { Kirby-Rees1 } and recently also proved by the authors in \cite { Bedregal-Perez } .	Let $ ( R , \mathfrak m ) $ be a Noetherian local ring .	In this work we extend the notion of mixed multiplicities of modules , given in \cite { Kleiman-Thorup2 } and \cite { Kirby-Rees1 } ( see also \cite { Bedregal-Perez } ) , to an arbitrary family $ E , E_1 , ... , E_q $ of $ R $ -submodules of $ R^p $ with $ E $ of finite colength .	We prove that these mixed multiplicities coincide with the Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity of some suitable $ R $ -module .	Our work is based on , and extend to this new context , the results on mixed multiplicities of ideals obtained by Vi\^et in \cite { Viet8 } and Manh and Vi\^et in \cite { Manh-Viet } .
0	We consider perfect fluid bodies ( stars ) in general relativity , characterized by particle number density and entropy per particle .	A star is said to be in dynamic equilibrium if it is a stationary , axisymmetric solution to the Einstein-fluid equations with circular flow .	We prove that for a star in dynamic equilibrium , the necessary and sufficient condition for thermodynamic equilibrium ( extremum of total entropy S ) is constancy of angular velocity ( \Omega ) , redshifted temperature , and redshifted chemical potential .	Friedman previously identified positivity of canonical energy , E , as a criterion for dynamic stability and argued that all rotating stars are dynamically unstable to sufficiently nonaxisymmetric perturbations ( the CFS instability ) , so our main focus is on axisymmetric stability .	We show that for a star in dynamic equilibrium , mode stability holds with respect to all axisymmetric perturbations if E is positive on a certain subspace , V , of axisymmetric Lagrangian perturbations that , in particular , have no Lagrangian change in angular momentum density .
1	An important element that distinguishes our study from other works is a consistent allowance for the evolution of the angle between the magnetic and spin axes .	We study the statistical distribution of extinct radio pulsars -- isolated neutron stars , that just crossed the death line .	We find the distribution of extinct radio pulsars in spin period for two models : the model with hindered particle escape from the neutron star surface and the model with free particle escape .	The total number of extinct radio pulsars is shown to be much smaller than for the model in which the evolution of an inclination angle is disregarded .	The decrease in total number of extinct radio pulsars arises from the fact , that account for evolution of the inclination angle allows the transition of a neutron star to the propeller stage appear at much smaller periods ( P~5-10 s ) than it is commonly assumed .
4	We put angle-constrained path planning problem formally and present a new algorithm tailored to solve it - LIAN .	Square grids are commonly used in robotics and game development as spatial models and well known in AI community heuristic search algorithms ( such as A* , JPS , Theta* etc . )	are widely used for path planning on grids .	A lot of research is concentrated on finding the shortest ( in geometrical sense ) paths while in many applications finding smooth paths ( rather than the shortest ones but containing sharp turns ) is preferable .	In this paper we study the problem of generating smooth paths and concentrate on angle constrained path planning .
2	We show how it is used in an abstract algebraic approach to the definition of integrals over paths which involves a cochain complex of finite increments .	This is a review paper on recent work about the connections between rough path theory , the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra on rooted trees and the analysis of finite and infinite dimensional differential equation .	We try to explain and motivate the theory of rough paths introduced by T. Lyons in the context of differential equations in presence of irregular noises .	In the context of such abstract integration theories we outline a connection with the combinatorics of rooted trees .	As interesting examples where these ideas apply we present two infinite dimensional dynamical systems : the Navier-Stokes equation and the Korteweg-de-Vries equation .
2	These B-periodic oscillations are reminiscent of the ones reported by Kukushkin \textit { et al } [ 1 ] and which were attributed to the presence of edge-magneto-plasmons .	We have measured the magneto-resistance of a two-dimensional electron gas ( 2DEG ) under continuous microwave irradiation as a function of electron density and mobility tuned with a metallic top-gate .	In the entire range of density and mobility we have investigated , we observe microwave induced oscillations of large amplitude that are B-periodic .	We have found that the B-periodicity does not increase linearly with the density in our sample but shows a plateau in the range ( 2.4-3 ) 10^ { 11 } \rm cm^ { -2 } $ .	In this regime , the phase of the B-periodic oscillations is found to shift continuously by two periods .
4	In general , coherent jets and vortices ( and their associated temperature distributions ) characterize the flow , and they evolve differently in time , depending on the initial condition .	We use a general circulation model to study the three-dimensional ( 3-D ) flow and temperature distributions of atmospheres on tidally synchronized extrasolar planets .	In this work , we focus on the sensitivity of the evolution to the initial flow state , which has not received much attention in 3-D modeling studies .	We find that different initial states lead to markedly different distributions-even under the application of strong forcing ( large day-night temperature difference with a short `` thermal drag time '' ) that may be representative of close-in planets .	This is in contrast with the results or assumptions of many published studies .
3	The analogy with the quantization of non-Abelian Yang-Mills theories in non-covariant gauges is emphasized .	We study the quantization of many-body systems in three dimensions in rotating coordinate frames using a gauge invariant formulation of the dynamics .	We consider reference frames defined by linear gauge conditions , and discuss their Gribov ambiguities and commutator algebra .	We construct the momentum operators , inner-product and Hamiltonian in those gauges , for systems with and without translation invariance .	Our results are applied to quasi-rigid systems in the Eckart frame .
1	The main result is the calculation of the effective action at finite temperature .	We study the finite temperature properties of the SO ( 3 ) lattice gauge theory using mean field theory .	The form of the effective action is used to explain the behaviour of the adjoint Wilson line in numerical simulations .	Numerical simulations of the SO ( 3 ) lattice gauge theory show that the adjoint Wilson line has a very small value at low temperatures ; at high temperatures , metastable states are observed in which the adjoint Wilson line takes positive or negative values .	The effective action is able to explain the origin of these metastable states .
1	In this letter , we focus on the clock synchronization problem in delay tomography and propose a synchronization-free delay tomography scheme .	Delay tomography has so far burdened source and receiver measurement nodes in a network with two requirements such as path establishment and clock synchronization between them .	The proposed scheme selects a path between source and receiver measurement nodes as a reference path , which results in a loss of equation in a conventional delay tomography problem .	However , by utilizing compressed sensing , the proposed scheme becomes robust to the loss .	Simulation experiments confirm that the proposed scheme works comparable to a conventional delay tomography scheme in networks with no clock synchronization between source and receiver measurement nodes .
1	We assume Gaussian states for light and atoms and formulate the system dynamics in terms of first and second moments of the angular momentum operators .	We present a model which describes coherent and incoherent processes in continuous-variable atom-light interfaces .	Spatial and temporal inhomogeneities in light and atom variables are incorporated by partitioning the system into small homogeneous segments .	Furthermore , other experimental imperfections as for instance limited detector time-resolution and atomic motion are simulated .	The model is capable of describing many experimental situations ranging from room temperature vapor cells to sub-mK atomic clouds .
0	The paper presents a nonlinear state-feedback control design approach for long-time average cost control , where the control effort is assumed to be expensive .	The approach is based on sum-of-squares and semi-definite programming techniques .	It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand side is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls .	The key idea , first described but not implemented in ( Chernyshenko et al. , Phil.Trans.R . Soc .	A , 372 , 2014 ) , is that the difficult problem of optimizing a cost function involving long-time averages is replaced by an optimization of the upper bound of the same average .
4	Using the new theory , we determine the parities of ground and excited spin states of high-spin ( S = 5/2 ) Fe ( III ) in hemin from the polarization dependence of experimental ground state EPR line intensities .	We present general expressions for the magnetic transition rates in beam Electron Paramagnetic Resonance ( EPR ) experiments of anisotropic spin systems in the solid state .	The expressions apply to general spin centers and arbitrary excitation geometry ( Voigt , Faraday , and intermediate ) .	They work for linear and circular polarized as well as unpolarized excitation , and for crystals and powders .	The expressions are based on the concept of the ( complex ) magnetic transition dipole moment vector .
1	Through the use of the Kronecker product and some basic facts of tensor algebra , we propose a simple model of nonlinearity , one that can be interpreted as a product of the outputs of K FIR linear filters , and compute its cost function together with its gradient , which allows for some analysis of the optimization problem .	Nonlinear adaptive filtering allows for modeling of some additional aspects of a general system and usually relies on highly complex algorithms , such as those based on the Volterra series .	We use these results it in a stochastic gradient framework , from which we derive an LMS-like algorithm and investigate the problems of multi-modality in the mean-square error surface and the choice of adequate initial conditions .	Its computational complexity is calculated .	The new algorithm is tested in a system identification setup and is compared with other polynomial algorithms from the literature , presenting favorable convergence and/or computational complexity .
2	We work in the context of hs [ \lambda ] + hs [ \lambda ] Chern-Simons theory coupled to scalar fields , and make efficient use of the associative lone-star product underlying the hs [ \lambda ] algebra .	We compute boundary three-point functions involving two scalars and a gauge field of arbitrary spin in the AdS vacuum of Vasiliev 's higher spin gravity , for any deformation parameter \lambda .	In the process , we develop tools for extracting scalar field equations in arbitrary higher spin backgrounds .	Our results for the correlators precisely match expectations from CFT ; in particular they match those of any CFT with W_ { \infinity } [ \lambda ] symmetry at large central charge , and with primary operators dual to the scalar fields .	As this is expected to include the `t Hooft limit of the W_N minimal model CFT , our results serve as further evidence of the conjectured AdS/CFT duality between these two theories .
1	The equations of motion of these models reduce to systems of the Liouville equations endowed with energy and momentum constraints .	A class of explicitly integrable models of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to scalar fields is described in some detail .	The general solution of the equations and constraints in terms of chiral moduli fields is explicitly constructed and some extensions of the basic integrable model are briefly discussed .	These models may be related to high dimensional supergravity theories but here they are mostly considered independently of such interpretations .	A brief review of other integrable models of two-dimensional dilaton gravity is also given .
2	We then show that the exact distribution easily extends to the distribution of the change-point mle when a change occurs in the mean vector of a multivariate Gaussian process .	We derive exact computable expressions for the asymptotic distribution of the change-point mle when a change in the mean occurred at an unknown point of a sequence of time-ordered independent Gaussian random variables .	The derivation , which assumes that nuisance parameters such as the amount of change and variance are known , is based on ladder heights of Gaussian random walks hitting the half-line .	We perform simulations to examine the accuracy of the derived distribution when nuisance parameters have to be estimated as well as robustness of the derived distribution to deviations from Gaussianity .	Through simulations , we also compare it with the well-known conditional distribution of the mle , which may be interpreted as a Bayesian solution to the change-point problem .
2	The value of HR , defined as the ratio of counts in the 1.6-10 keV band to those in the 0.8-1.6 keV , is an indicator to investigate the spatial variation of spectral features .	We present the nonuniform distribution of temperature and abundance in the angular extent of 10 ' ( 1.4 Mpc ) in A1650 observed by XMM-Newton .	Spectral analysis was carried out in 19 systematically-subdivided regions , and in 15 specified regions referred to the hardness ratio ( HR ) map .	The temperature and abundance were obtained to be 4-6 keV and 0.2-0.5 solar value with average values of 5.62+0.05-0.07 keV and 0.36+0.02-0.01 solar value within a radius of 5 ' , respectively .	The redshift was derived to be 8.01+0.02-0.02x10^-2 against an optical value of 8.45x10^-2 .
2	We achieve a modest sensitivity to acceleration of da = 7x10^-4 m/s^2 .	We demonstrate a horizontal , linearly guided Mach Zehnder atom interferometer in an optical waveguide .	Intended as a proof-of-principle experiment , the interferometer utilises a Bose-Einstein condensate in the magnetically insensitive |F=1 , mF=0 & gt ; state of Rubidium-87 as an acceleration sensitive test mass .	Our fringe visibility is as high as 38 % in this optically guided atom interferometer .	We observe a time-of-flight in the waveguide of over half a second , demonstrating the utility of our optical guide for future sensors .
0	Let X be a scheme of finite type over a Noetherian base scheme S admitting a dualizing complex , and let U be an open subset whose complement has codimension at least 2 .	We extend the Deligne-Bezrukavnikov theory of perverse coherent sheaves by showing that a coherent middle extension ( or intersection cohomology ) functor from perverse sheaves on U to perverse sheaves on X may be defined for a much broader class of perversities than has previously been known .	We also introduce a derived category version of the coherent middle extension functor .	Under suitable hypotheses , we introduce a construction ( called `` S2-extension '' ) in terms of perverse coherent sheaves of algebras on X that takes a finite morphism to U and extends it in a canonical way to a finite morphism to X .	In particular , this construction gives a canonical `` S2-ification '' of appropriate X .
1	First , it answers the question of how large megaprojects are by measuring them in the units mega , giga , and tera , concluding we are presently entering a new `` tera era '' of trillion-dollar projects .	This paper takes stock of megaproject management , an emerging and hugely costly field of study .	Second , total global megaproject spending is assessed , at USD 6-9 trillion annually , or 8 percent of total global GDP , which denotes the biggest investment boom in human history .	Third , four `` sublimes '' - political , technological , economic , and aesthetic - are identified to explain the increased size and frequency of megaprojects .	Fourth , the `` iron law of megaprojects '' is laid out and documented : Over budget , over time , over and over again .
4	In the linear approximation the equations of our coupled system coincide with those of the Bateman dual system ( a pair of damped and anti-damped harmonic oscillators ) .	The equation of the Van der Pol oscillator , being characterized by a dissipative term , is non-Lagrangian .	Appending an additional degree of freedom we bring the equation in the frame of action principle and thus introduce a one-way coupled system .	As with the Van der Pol oscillator , the coupled system also involves only one parameter that controls the dynamics .	The response system is described by a linear differential equation coupled nonlinearly to the drive system .
0	Density functional theory ( DFT ) has been used to estimate vacancy formation enthalpy ( H_fv ) for a few transition metals like nickel ( Ni ) and copper ( Cu ) .	It is shown that , for these metals , H_fv is underestimated considerably by DFT .	The aim of the present work is to bridge the gap between the estimates made by DFT calculations and experiments .	The sources of this discrepancy are identified as to be related to the opening up of the surface like region surrounding the vacancy , and the temperature induced anharmonic contribution .	The surface related correction to H_fv has been estimated by a jellium based model originally proposed by Mattsson et al . [ Phys.Rev .
4	We interpret the observed $ EMD $ s as the result of the emission of ensembles of magnetically confined loop-like structures with different apex temperatures .	We report on the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of three G-type stars in very different evolutionary phases : the weak-lined T Tauri star HD 283572 , the Zero Age Main Sequence star EK Dra and the Hertzsprung-gap giant star 31 Com .	They all have high X-ray luminosity ( 10^31 erg/s for HD 283572 and 31 Com and 10^30 erg/s for EK Dra ) .	We compare the Emission Measure Distributions ( EMDs ) of these active coronal sources , derived from high-resolution XMM-Newton grating spectra , as well as the pattern of elemental abundances vs. First Ionization Potential ( FIP ) .	We also perform time-resolved spectroscopy of a flare detected by XMM from EK Dra .
3	Similar results are obtained for complex Milnor manifolds which are defined analogously .	A real Milnor manifold is the non-singular hypersurface of degree $ ( 1,1 ) $ in the product of two real projective spaces .	These manifolds were introduced by Milnor to give generators for the unoriented cobordism algebra , and they admit free actions by elementary abelian 2-groups .	In this paper , we obtain some results on the free 2-rank of symmetry of products of finitely many real Milnor manifolds under the assumption that the induced action on mod 2 cohomology is trivial .	Here the free 2-rank of symmetry of a topological space is the maximal rank of an elementary abelian 2-group which acts freely on that space .
4	The emission of C $ ^ { 17 } $ O ( 3-2 ) and C $ ^ { 34 } $ S ( 7-6 ) both show a velocity gradient oriented along a northeast-southwest direction with respect to the continuum marking the location of one of the components of the binary , IRAS16293A .	A fundamental question about the early evolution of low-mass protostars is when circumstellar disks may form .	High angular resolution observations of molecular transitions in the ( sub ) millimeter wavelength windows make it possible to investigate the kinematics of the gas around newly-formed stars , for example to identify the presence of rotation and infall .	IRAS 16293-2422 was observed with the extended Submillimeter Array ( eSMA ) resulting in subarcsecond resolution ( 0.46 '' x 0.29 '' , i.e. $ \sim $ 55 $ \times $ 35~AU ) images of compact emission from the C $ ^ { 17 } $ O ( 3-2 ) and C $ ^ { 34 } $ S ( 7-6 ) transitions at 337~GHz ( 0.89~mm ) .	To recover the more extended emission we have combined the eSMA data with SMA observations of the same molecules .
3	Typically , inspiral rates are estimated for only a small set of models with a remarkably poor coverage of the highly multi-dimensional parameter space ( primarily because of limited computer resources ) .	Formation rates of compact-object binaries are often derived from population synthesis calculations .	However , such calculations depend sensitively on a relatively large number of model input parameters .	Given considerable uncertainty in those model parameters , the predicted inspiral rates for double compact objects relevant to gravitational-wave interferometric detectors have been shown to be are uncertain by several orders of magnitude .	Here , using as an example seven population-synthesis model parameters , we show that it is possible to derive fits of double-compact-object inspiral rates dependent simultaneously on all seven parameters .
4	Since , the issues are mainly generic , the aim is to provide discussion and recommendations to benefit a wider computing community in academia .	Software Project Management ( SPM ) and Software Quality Assurance ( SQA ) are key components of undergraduate Computing programmes at educational establishments in Pakistan .	Because of the nature of these subjects , there are a number of issues that need to be discussed and resolved so that the teaching becomes more effective , students learning experience is more enjoyable and their ability to be actively involved in SPM and SQA , after the completion of their studies , becomes further improved .	In this paper , we discuss experience of teaching SPM and SQA at one particular institution in Islamabad Pakistan .	Using this as a case study , we underline the students perspective , highlight the inherent issues and suggest ways to improve the delivery of these subjects .
1	We consider a paradigmatic model , the quantum baker map in contact with a heat bath at finite temperature .	We study the stability of classical structures in chaotic systems when a dissipative quantum evolution takes place .	We analyze the behavior of the purity , fidelity and Husimi distributions corresponding to initial states localized on short periodic orbits ( scar functions ) and map eigenstates .	Scar functions , that have a fundamental role in the semiclassical description of chaotic systems , emerge as very robust against environmental perturbations .	This is confirmed by the study of other states localized on classical structures .
1	Fix any positive real number c , and consider the multiplier ideal J of the sum a_1+ ... +a_r with weighting coefficient c. We construct an exact sequence resolving J by sheaves over X that are direct sums of multiplier ideals for products a_1^ { v_1 } ... a_r^ { v_r } for various real vectors v such that v_1+ ... +v_r = c. The resolution is cellular , in the sense that its boundary maps are encoded by the algebraic chain complex of a regular CW-complex .	Fix nonzero ideal sheaves a_1 , ... , a_r on a normal Q-Gorenstein complex variety X .	The CW-complex is naturally expressed as a triangulation T of the simplex of nonnegative real vectors summing to c. The acyclicity of our resolution reduces to that of a cellular free resolution , supported on T , of a related monomial ideal .	This acyclicity rests on a comparison between the homology of certain homology-manifolds-with-boundary and the homology of the simplicial complexes obtained by deleting collections of boundary faces from them .	Our resolution implies the multiplier ideal sum formula J ( ( a_1+ ... +a_r ) ^c ) = \sum_ { |v|=c } J ( a_1^ { v_1 } ... a_r^ { v_r } ) , which implicitly follows from Takagi 's proof of the two-summand formula ( math.AG/0410612 ) .
4	We demonstrate that multiplier ideals reduce to test ideals under reduction modulo $ p $ when the symbolic Rees algebra is finitely generated .	Many results are known about test ideals and $ F $ -singularities for $ { \bf Q } $ -Gorenstein rings .	In this paper we generalize many of these results to the case when the symbolic Rees algebra $ O_X \oplus O_X ( -K_X ) \oplus O_X ( -2K_X ) \oplus ... $ is finitely generated ( or more generally , in the log setting for $ -K_X - \Delta $ ) .	In particular , we show that the $ F $ -jumping numbers of $ \tau ( X , a^t ) $ are discrete and rational .	We show that test ideals $ \tau ( X ) $ can be described by alterations as in Blickle-Schwede-Tucker ( and hence show that splinters are strongly $ F $ -regular in this setting -- recovering a result of Singh ) .
0	We provide a method for analytically constructing high-accuracy templates for the gravitational wave signals emitted by compact binaries moving in inspiralling eccentric orbits .	By contrast to the simpler problem of modeling the gravitational wave signals emitted by inspiralling { \it circular } orbits , which contain only two different time scales , namely those associated with the orbital motion and the radiation reaction , the case of { \it inspiralling eccentric } orbits involves { \it three different time scales } : orbital period , periastron precession and radiation-reaction time scales .	By using an improved `method of variation of constants ' , we show how to combine these three time scales , without making the usual approximation of treating the radiative time scale as an adiabatic process .	We explicitly implement our method at the 2.5PN post-Newtonian accuracy .	Our final results can be viewed as computing new `post-adiabatic ' short period contributions to the orbital phasing , or equivalently , new short-period contributions to the gravitational wave polarizations , $ h_ { + , \times } $ , that should be explicitly added to the `post-Newtonian ' expansion for $ h_ { + , \times } $ , if one treats radiative effects on the orbital phasing of the latter in the usual adiabatic approximation .
3	The superconducting transition temperature ( TC ) is determined to be 9.4 K by AC magnetic susceptibility and electronic transport measurements .	A flux-free solution to the growth of large and composition homogeneous superconducting FeSe crystal is reported for the first time , which is based on the traveling-solvent floating-zone technique .	The size of the crystal samples prepared by this approach is up to 15x6x2 mm3 , being far bigger than previously reported in all dimensions , and the main phase of the crystals is of a single preferred orientation along the tetragonal ( 101 ) plane .	X-ray diffraction analysis identifies the main phase to be the superconducting tetragonal \b { eta } -FeSe .	A nearly perfect diamagnetic shielding of -97 % is observed , indicating a bulk superconductivity in the crystal sample .
0	Supergroups are defined in the framework of $ \dZ_2 $ -graded Clifford algebras over the fields of real and complex numbers , respectively .	It is shown that cyclic structures of complex and real supergroups are defined by Brauer-Wall groups related with the modulo 2 and modulo 8 periodicities of the complex and real Clifford algebras .	Particle ( fermionic and bosonic ) representations of a universal covering ( spinor group $ \spin_+ ( 1,3 ) $ ) of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group are constructed via the Clifford algebra formalism .	Complex and real supergroups are defined on the representation system of $ \spin_+ ( 1,3 ) $ .	It is shown that a cyclic ( modulo 2 ) structure of the complex supergroup is equivalent to a supersymmetric action , that is , it converts fermionic representations into bosonic representations and vice versa .
4	Their creation requires gravitational effects to be compensated by applying additional optical dipole potentials .	We discuss a method to create two-dimensional traps as well as atomic shell , or bubble , states for a Bose-Einstein condensate initially prepared in a conventional magnetic trap .	The scheme relies on the use of time-dependent , radio frequency-induced adiabatic potentials .	These are shown to form a versatile and robust tool to generate novel trapping potentials .	Our shell states take the form of thin , highly stable matter-wave bubbles and can serve as stepping-stones to prepare atoms in highly-excited trap eigenstates or to study `collapse and revival phenomena ' .
4	This average generates a weight on chiral polymers associated with the classical localization length exponent $ \nu = 4/3 $ .	A mapping is developed between the quantum Hall plateau transition and two-dimensional self-interacting lattice polymers .	This mapping is exact in the classical percolation limit of the plateau transition , and diffusive behavior at the critical energy is shown to be related to the critical exponents of a class of chiral polymers at the $ \theta $ -point .	The exact critical exponents of the chiral polymer model on the honeycomb lattice are found , verifying that this model is in the same universality class as a previously solved model of polymers on the Manhattan lattice .	The mapping is obtained by averaging analytically over the local random potentials in a previously studied lattice model for the classical plateau transition .
0	The measurement of large scale patterns or anisotropies in the arrival direction of high energy cosmic rays is an important step towards the understanding of their origin .	Such measurements rely on an accurate estimation of the detector relative exposure in each direction on the sky : the coverage map .	To reach an accuracy on the determination of this map below the one percent level one must properly identify and correct for all the environmental effects that may induce variations in the detector exposure as a function of time .	In an approach , similar to the one used in anti-sidereal time analysis , we propose a method to empirically estimate and correct for those effects under the hypothesis that seasonal and diurnal variations can be factorized .	We tested this method using a model ground detector of cosmic ray air showers , whose aperture varies due to the dependence of the air shower development on the atmospheric conditions .
1	We observe that $ \mathbf { PCP } _n $ is closely related to the equalizer problem in groups , while $ \mathbf { GPCP } _n $ is connected to the double twisted conjugacy problem for endomorphisms .	We generalize the classical Post correspondence problem ( $ \mathbf { PCP } _n $ ) and its non-homogeneous variation ( $ \mathbf { GPCP } _n $ ) to non-commutative groups and study the computational complexity of these new problems .	Furthermore , it is shown that one of the strongest forms of the word problem in a group $ G $ ( we call it the { \em hereditary word problem } ) can be reduced to $ \mathbf { GPCP } _n $ in $ G $ in polynomial time .	The main results are that $ \mathbf { PCP } _n $ is decidable in a finitely generated nilpotent group in polynomial time , while $ \mathbf { GPCP } _n $ is undecidable in any group containing free non-abelian subgroup ( though the argument is very different from the classical case of free semigroups ) .	We show that the double endomorphism twisted conjugacy problem is undecidable in free groups of sufficiently large finite rank .
0	Topological insulators are known to their metallic surface states , a result of strong-spin-orbital coupling , that show unique surface transport phenomenon .	But these surface transports are buried in presence of metallic bulk conduction .	We synthesized very high quality Bi $ _2 $ Te $ _2 $ Se single crystals by modified Bridgman method , that possess high bulk resistivity of $ & gt ; $ 20~ $ \Omega $ cm below 20~K , whereas the bulk is mostly inactive and surface transport dominates .	Temperature dependence resistivity follows the activation law like a gap semiconductor in temperature range 20-300~K .	We designed a special measurement geometry , which aims to extract the surface transport from the bulk .
0	We propose a sampling method to include the negative contribution to probability density distribution in a sampling procedure .	This sampling method is a universal solution for all negative probability problem and shows extraordinarily power in negative cross section problem .	A Monte Carlo simulation including negative cross section contribution is developed and successfully preformed to simulate reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy ( REELS ) spectra for Ag and Au as examples .	Excellent agreement is found between simulated spectra and experimental measurements .	Notably improved fits to experimental REELS spectra in low energy loss range illustrate the method 's strength as well as the necessity of negative cross section contribution .
1	Albeit in many realistic scenarios the quantum system can simultaneously interact with composite environments , this condition remains little understood , particularly regarding the effect of the coupling between environmental parts .	Controlling the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is essential in quantum information technology since it plays a crucial role in preserving quantum memory .	We analyze the non-Markovian behavior of a qubit interacting at the same time with two coupled single-mode cavities which in turn dissipate into memoryless or memory-keeping reservoirs .	We show that increasing the control parameter , that is the two-mode coupling , allows for triggering and enhancing a non-Markovian dynamics for the qubit starting from a Markovian one in absence of coupling .	Surprisingly , if the qubit dynamics is non-Markovian for zero control parameter , increasing the latter enables multiple transitions from non-Markovian to Markovian regimes .
1	Orbifolds are intuitively speaking manifolds with some singularities .	In recent years a lot of attention has been paid to topological spaces which are a bit more general than smooth manifolds - orbifolds .	The formal definition is also modelled on that of manifolds , an orbifold is a topological space which locally is homeomorphic to the orbit space of a finite group acting on $ R^n $ .	Orbifolds were defined by Satake , as V-manifolds , then studied by W. Thurston , who introduced the term `` orbifold '' .	Due to their importance in physics , and in particular in the string theory , orbifolds have been drawing more and more attention .
3	With a cutoff in the range of $ \Lambda ~ 2.1 fm^ { -1 } $ , the new potential V_ { low k } is independent of the input model , and reproduces the experimental phase shift data for corresponding laboratory energies below $ E_ { lab } ~ 350 MeV $ , as well as the deuteron binding energy with similar accuracy as the realistic input potentials .	We present detailed results for the model-independent low momentum nucleon-nucleon interaction V_ { low k } .	By introducing a cutoff in momentum space , we separate the Hilbert space into a low momentum and a high momentum part .	The renormalization group is used to construct the effective interaction V_ { low k } in the low momentum space , starting from various high precision potential models commonly used in nuclear many-body calculations .	The model independence of V_ { low k } demonstrates that the physics of nucleons interacting at low momenta does not depend on details of the high momentum dynamics assumed in conventional potential models .
2	We speculate that the expansion of the gas also re-excites electrons in the lobes of 3C 442A through compression and adiabatic heating .	We use Chandra data to infer that an X-ray bright component of gas is in the process of separating the radio lobes of 3C 442A .	This is the first radio galaxy with convincing evidence that central gas , overpressured with respect to the lobe plasma and not simply a static atmosphere , is having a major dynamical effect on the radio structure .	Two features of 3C 442A contribute to its dynamical state .	Firstly , the radio source is no longer being powered by a detected active jet , so that the dynamical state of the radio plasma is at the mercy of the ambient medium .
3	For N=3 and 4 we confirm its \omega^3 rise at low frequency .	Relativistic O ( N ) field theories are studied near the quantum critical point in two space dimensions .	We compute dynamical correlations by large scale Monte Carlo simulations and numerical analytic continuation .	In the ordered side , the scalar spectral function exhibits a universal peak at the Higgs mass .	On the disordered side , the spectral function exhibits a sharp gap .
0	Response calibration is the process of inferring how much the measured data depend on the signal one is interested in .	It is essential for any quantitative signal estimation on the basis of the data .	Here , we investigate self-calibration methods for linear signal measurements and linear dependence of the response on the calibration parameters .	The common practice is to augment an external calibration solution using a known reference signal with an internal calibration on the unknown measurement signal itself .	Contemporary self-calibration schemes try to find a self-consistent solution for signal and calibration by exploiting redundancies in the measurements .
3	It turnes out that any Berwald metric is a perturbed-Cartesian product of Riemannian , Minkowski , and such non-Riemannian metrics which can be constructed on irreducible symmetric manifolds of $ rank & gt ; 1 $ .	Berwald metrics are particular Finsler metrics which still have linear Berwald connections .	Their complete classification is established in an earlier work , [ Sz1 ] , of this author .	The main tools in these classification are the Simons-Berger holonomy theorem and the Weyl-group theory .	The existence of these metrics are well established by the above theories .
1	This code solves the equation of radiative transfer following the principle of long characteristic in a 2-D polar grid while considering a 3-D radiation field at each grid point .	We have developed a general purpose dust radiative transfer code for an axisymmetric system , 2-Dust , motivated by the recent increasing availability of high-resolution images of circumstellar dust shells at various wavelengths .	A solution is sought through an iterative scheme in which self-consistency of the solution is achieved by requiring a global luminosity constancy throughout the shell .	The dust opacities are calculated through Mie theory from the given size distribution and optical properties of the dust grains .	The main focus of the code is to obtain insights on ( 1 ) the global energetics of dust grains in the shell ( 2 ) the 2-D projected morphologies that are strongly dependent on the mixed effects of the axisymmetric dust distribution and inclination angle of the shell .
0	Paths are important structural elements in complex networks because they are finite ( unlike walks ) , related to effective node coverage ( minimum spanning trees ) , and can be understood as being dual to star connectivity .	This article introduces the concept of random path applies it for the investigation of structural properties of complex networks and as the means to estimate the longest path .	Random paths are obtained by selecting one of the network nodes at random and performing a random self-avoiding walk ( here called path-walk ) until its termination .	It is shown that the distribution of random paths are markedly different for diverse complex network models ( i.e.Erdos-Renyi , Barabasi-Albert , Watts-Strogatz , a geographical model , as well as two recently introduced path-based network types ) , with the BA structures yielding the shortest random walks , while the longest paths are produced by WS networks .	Random paths are also explored as the means to estimate the longest paths ( i.e.several random paths are obtained and the longest taken ) .
3	Our main result is that this problem admits a polynomial kernel .	A graph is called ( claw , diamond ) -free if it contains neither a claw ( a $ K_ { 1,3 } $ ) nor a diamond ( a $ K_4 $ with an edge removed ) as an induced subgraph .	Equivalently , ( claw , diamond ) -free graphs can be characterized as line graphs of triangle-free graphs , or as linear dominoes , i.e. , graphs in which every vertex is in at most two maximal cliques and every edge is in exactly one maximal clique .	In this paper we consider the parameterized complexity of the ( claw , diamond ) -free Edge Deletion problem , where given a graph $ G $ and a parameter $ k $ , the question is whether one can remove at most $ k $ edges from $ G $ to obtain a ( claw , diamond ) -free graph .	We complement this finding by proving that , even on instances with maximum degree $ 6 $ , the problem is NP-complete and can not be solved in time $ 2^ { o ( k ) } \cdot |V ( G ) |^ { O ( 1 ) } $ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fail
2	We study an example in which the final spectrum of fluctuations depends sensitively on the modifications of the dispersion relation without needing to invoke complex frequencies .	In this paper , we calculate the spectrum of scalar field fluctuations in a bouncing , asymptotically flat Universe , and investigate the dependence of the result on changes in the physics on length scales shorter than the Planck length which are introduced via modifications of the dispersion relation .	In this model , there are no ambiguities concerning the choice of the initial vacuum state .	Changes in the amplitude and in the spectral index are possible , in addition to modulations of the spectrum .	This strengthens the conclusions of previous work in which the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in expanding inflationary cosmologies was studied , and it was found that , for dispersion relations for which the evolution is not adiabatic , the spectrum changes from the standard prediction of scale-invariance .
1	The kinematic distance of the associated molecular cloud is 11.9 kpc .	We study stars and molecular gas in the direction of IRAS06145+1455 ( WB89-789 ) through NIR ( JHK ) , molecular line- , and dust continuum observations .	With a galactocentric distance of about 20.2 kpc , this object is at the edge of the ( molecular ) disk of the Galaxy .	The near-IR data show the presence of an ( embedded ) cluster of about 60 stars , with a radius ca .	1.3 pc and an average stellar surface density of ca.12 pc^ { -2 } .
0	Sampling-based motion planners are an effective means for generating collision-free motion paths .	However , the quality of these motion paths , with respect to different quality measures such as path length , clearance , smoothness or energy , is often notoriously low .	This problem is accentuated in the case of non-holonomic sampling-based motion planning , in which the space of feasible motion trajectories is restricted .	In this study , we combine the C-PRM algorithm by Song and Amato with our recently introduced path-hybridization approach , for creating high quality non-holonomic motion paths , with combinations of several different quality measures such as path length , smoothness or clearance , as well as the number of reverse car motions .	Our implementation includes a variety of code optimizations that result in nearly real-time performance , and which we believe can be extended with further optimizations to a real-time tool for the planning of high-quality car-like motion .
2	Results from proton-proton collisions at sqrt ( s ) = 2.76 and 7 TeV , and from Pb -- Pb collisions at sqrt ( s_NN ) = 2.76 TeV are presented .	ALICE at the LHC is the experiment dedicated to study the physics of nucleus-nucleus collisions .	The apparatus is well suited for the measurement of heavy-quark hadron production , making use of the high spatial resolution provided by the tracking detectors and the excellent particle identification , which are distinctive of the ALICE apparatus .	The measurements in pp collisions provide an important test of perturbative QCD predictions .	The precise vertex reconstruction together with the electron identification , allows the separation of the charm and the beauty components .
3	We establish provably correct guarantees for the distributed strategies that result from the proposed approach and examine their robustness against delays , packet drops , and communication noise .	This paper studies the real-time implementation of distributed controllers on networked cyber-physical systems .	We build on the strengths of event- and self-triggered control to synthesize a unified approach , termed team-triggered , where agents make promises to one another about their future states and are responsible for warning each other if they later decide to break them .	The information provided by these promises allows individual agents to autonomously schedule information requests in the future and sets the basis for maintaining desired levels of performance at lower implementation cost .	The results are illustrated in simulations of a multi-agent formation control problem .
0	We analyze the geometry of the tower of Lubin-Tate deformation spaces , which parametrize deformations of a one-dimensional formal module of height h together with level structure .	According to the conjecture of Deligne-Carayol , these spaces realize the local Langlands correspondence in their l-adic cohomology .	This conjecture is now a theorem , but currently there is no purely local proof .	Working in the equal characteristic case , we find a family of affinoids in the Lubin-Tate tower with good reduction equal to a rather curious nonsingular hypersurface , whose equation we present explicitly .	Granting a conjecture on the L-functions of this hypersurface , we find a link between the conjecture of Deligne-Carayol and the theory of Bushnell-Kutzko types , at least for certain class of wildly ramified supercuspidal representations of small conductor .
1	Some of them , like the carbonaceous CM meteorites experienced aqueous alteration thus their olivine content transformed more or less into hydrated silicates such as phyllosilicates .	Chondritic meteorites are of great interest since they are one of the most ancient remnants of the early solar system .	These hydrated CM2 meteorites have been investigated in KBr pellets by means of Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR ) spectroscopy .	In our focus of interest was to study the 3 and 10 $ \mu $ m ( 3000 and 1000 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ , the O $ - $ H and silicate streching ) bands of several CM2 chondrites .	By investigating these signals the water content and the extent of hydration can be determined .
1	For this purpose we generalize the concept of helicity supertraces to nine spacetime dimensions .	We study BPS dominated loop amplitudes in M-theory on T^2 .	These traces distinguish between various massive supermultiplets and appear as coefficients in their one-loop contributions to n-graviton scattering amplitudes .	This can be used to show that only ultrashort BPS multiplets contribute to the R^4 term in the effective action , which was first computed by Green , Gutperle and Vanhove .	There are two inequivalent ultrashort BPS multiplets which describe the Kaluza-Klein states and the wrapped membranes that cover the torus a number of times .
3	We show that as expected , the SNII rates provide a direct measurement of the instantaneous CSFR , whereas the SNIa rate depends on the CSFR history during the past few Gyrs .	We study how Type Ia/II supernova rates at various redshifts can be used to constrain the cosmic star formation rate ( CSFR ) history .	We use a spectrophotometric model of galaxy evolution which provides a self-consistent description of global properties of local galaxies .	We have chosen two CSFR histories , with and without dust extinction , both normalized in order to reproduce the observed comoving luminosity densities at different wavelengths .	Therefore the SNIa rate detected up to $ z { \sim } $ 1 is able to provide new insight on the CSFR at higher redshift .
3	We use features extracted from the \overfeat network as a generic image representation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object image classification , scene recognition , fine grained recognition , attribute detection and image retrieval applied to a diverse set of datasets .	Recent results indicate that the generic descriptors extracted from the convolutional neural networks are very powerful .	This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case .	We report on a series of experiments conducted for different recognition tasks using the publicly available code and model of the \overfeat network which was trained to perform object classification on ILSVRC13 .	We selected these tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away from the original task and data the \overfeat network was trained to solve .
4	The velocity structure is sensitive to the modelling of galaxies in clusters , indicative of the complex interplay of tidal stripping , dynamical friction , and merging .	By combining galaxy tracers from high-resolution N-body and hydrodynamical simulations , we present a consistent picture of the behaviour of galaxy velocities in massive clusters .	In haloes above ~ 10^14 Msun , the brightest satellite galaxies are slightly cooler compared to the dark matter , while fainter satellites are hotter .	Within the virial radius of a cluster , the mean velocity dispersion based on the 100 brightest galaxies is a factor of 1.065 +/- 0.005 ( stat ) +/- 0.027 ( sys ) higher than that of the dark matter ( corresponding to a ~10-15 per cent bias in the dynamical mass estimate ) while that based on only the five brightest galaxies is 0.868 +/- 0.039 ( stat ) +/- 0.035 ( sys ) .	These trends are approximately independent of redshift .
0	Smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( SPH ) is used to estimate accretion rates of mass , linear and angular momentum in a binary system where one component undergoes mass loss through a wind .	Physical parameters are chosen such as to model the alleged binary precursors of barium stars , whose chemical peculiarities are believed to result from the accretion of the wind from a companion formerly on the asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) .	The binary system modelled consists of a 3 solar masses AGB star on the main sequence , in a 3AU circular orbit .	Three-dimensional simulations are performed for gases with polytropic indices gamma=1 , 1.1 and 1.5 , to bracket more realistic situations that would include radiative cooling .	Mass accretion rates are found to depend on resolution and we estimate typical values of 1-2 % for the gamma=1.5 case and 8 % for the other models .
2	As a case study , the light emission of a correlated plasma is investigated numerically for a one-dimensional two-band tight-binding model .	A microscopic theory for the luminescence of ordered semiconductors is modified to describe photoluminescence of strongly disordered semiconductors .	The approach includes both diagonal disorder and the many-body Coulomb interaction .	The band structure of the underlying ordered system is assumed to correspond to either a direct or an indirect semiconductor .	In particular , luminescence and absorption spectra are computed for various levels of disorder and sample temperature to determine thermodynamic relations , the Stokes shift , and the radiative lifetime distribution .
2	Thanks to its large-format , high-cadence CCD detectors with sophisticated computer hard- and software it is capable of scanning spectral lines with a cadence that is sufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of the solar atmosphere .	The GREGOR Fabry-P\'erot Interferometer ( GFPI ) is one of three first-light instruments of the German 1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope at the Observatorio del Teide , Tenerife , Spain .	The GFPI uses two tunable etalons in collimated mounting .	The field-of-view ( FOV ) of 50 '' x 38 '' is well suited for quiet Sun and sunspot observations .	However , in the vector spectropolarimetric mode the FOV reduces to 25 '' x 38 '' .
3	We apply approximation theory for pseudo-Boolean functions to binary Markov random fields and construct approximations and upper and lower bounds for the associated computationally intractable normalising constant .	Discrete Markov random fields form a natural class of models to represent images and spatial data sets .	The use of such models is , however , hampered by a computationally intractable normalising constant .	This makes parameter estimation and a fully Bayesian treatment of discrete Markov random fields difficult .	As a by-product of this process we also get a partially ordered Markov model approximation of the binary Markov random field .
0	In 1934 , Reinhardt asked for the centrally symmetric convex domain in the plane whose best lattice packing has the lowest density .	He conjectured that the unique solution up to an affine transformation is the smoothed octagon ( an octagon rounded at corners by arcs of hyperbolas ) .	This article offers a detailed strategy of proof .	In particular , we show that the problem is an instance of the classical problem of Bolza in the calculus of variations .	A minimizing solution is known to exist .
4	It thus appears that metal- and dust-poor halo clouds like Complex C are not able to form and maintain widely distributed H_2 , whereas metal and dust-rich halo clouds like the IV Arch can maintain H_2 even at low HI column densities .	We present Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer ( FUSE ) observations of interstellar molecular hydrogen ( H_2 ) in two Galactic high-velocity clouds ( HVCs ) .	Molecular hydrogen absorption is detected in the Magellanic Stream ( abundance ~0.3 solar ) toward the Seyfert galaxy Fairall 9 in the lowest three rotational states ( J=0-2 ) at v ( LSR ) =+190 km/s , yielding a total H_2 column density of log N ( H_2 ) =16.40 ( +0.26 ) ( -0.53 ) .	In contrast , no H_2 absorption is seen in the high-velocity cloud Complex C ( abundance ~0.1 solar ) toward the quasar PG 1259+593 ( log N ( H_2 ) & lt ; 13.96 at v ( LSR ) =-130 km/s ) although both HVCs have similar HI column densities on the order of log N ( HI ) ~20 .	Weak H_2 absorption is detected in the Intermediate-Velocity Arch ( IV Arch ; abundance \~1.0 solar ) toward PG 1259+593 ( log N ( H_2 ) =14.10 ( +0.21 ) ( -0.44 ) at v ( LSR ) =-55 km/s and log N ( HI ) =19.5 ) .
1	With 1.0-1.9 fb-1 of data collected at CDF , and 0.9-1.7 fb-1 at D0 , the 95 % C.L .	We combine results from CDF and D0 searches for a standard model Higgs boson ( H ) in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron at sqrt { s } =1.96 TeV .	upper limits on Higgs production are a factor of 6.2 ( 1.4 ) higher than the SM cross section for a Higgs mass of m_Higgs = 115 ( 160 ) GeV/c^2 .	Based on simulation , the median expected upper limit is 4.3 ( 1.9 ) .	These results extend significantly the individual limits of each experiment .
2	We prove that the linear-time prune-and-search algorithm -- -presented in most textbooks on algorithms -- -can be modified to use $ \Theta ( N ) $ bits instead of $ \Theta ( N ) $ words of extra space .	Given an unordered array of $ N $ elements drawn from a totally ordered set and an integer $ k $ in the range from $ 1 $ to $ N $ , in the classic selection problem the task is to find the $ k $ -th smallest element in the array .	We study the complexity of this problem in the space-restricted random-access model : The input array is stored on read-only memory , and the algorithm has access to a limited amount of workspace .	Prior to our work , the best known algorithm by Frederickson could perform the task with $ \Theta ( N ) $ bits of extra space in $ O ( N \lg^ { * } N ) $ time .	Our result separates the space-restricted random-access model and the multi-pass streaming model , since we can surpass the $ \Omega ( N \lg^ { * } N ) $ lower bound known for the latter model .
4	We introduce another variant of Quantum MIP , where the provers do not share entanglement , the communication between the verifier and the provers is quantum , but the provers are unlimited in the classical communication between them .	Multi Prover Interactive Proof systems ( MIPs ) were first presented in a cryptographic context , but ever since they were used in various fields .	Understanding the power of MIPs in the quantum context raises many open problems , as there are several interesting models to consider .	For example , one can study the question when the provers share entanglement or not , and the communication between the verifier and the provers is quantum or classical .	While there are several partial results on the subject , so far no one presented an efficient scheme for recognizing NEXP ( or NP with logarithmic communication ) , except for [ KM03 ] , in the case there is no entanglement ( and of course no communication between the provers ) .
0	In a sample of $ 9.66\times 10^6 B\bar { B } $ pairs collected with the CLEO detector we make the first observation of B decays to an $ \eta_c $ and a kaon .	We measure branching fractions $ BR ( B^+\to\eta_c K^+ ) = ( 0.69 + 0.26 - 0.21 +- 0.08 +- 0.20 ) \times 10^ { -3 } $ and $ BR ( B^0\to\eta_c K^0 ) = ( 1.09 + 0.55 - 0.42 +- 0.12 +- 0.31 ) \times 10^ { -3 } $ , where the first error is statistical , the second is systematic and the third is from the $ \eta_c $ branching fraction uncertainty .	From these we extract the $ \eta_c $ decay constant in the factorization approximation , $ f_ { \eta_c } = 335 +- 75 $ MeV .	We also search for B decays to a $ \chi_ { c0 } $ and a kaon .	No evidence for a signal is found and we set 90 % CL upper limits : $ BR ( B^+\to\chi_ { c0 } K^+ ) & lt ; 4.8\times 10^ { -4 } $ and $ BR ( B^0\to\chi_ { c0 } K^0 ) & lt ; 5.0\times 10^ { -4 } $ .
4	Using this method , God { \l } owski ( 2012 ) analyzed the orientation of galaxies inside Tully 's group founding no significant deviations from isotropy both in orientation of position angles and $ \delta_D $ and $ \eta $ angles as well , giving the spatial orientation of galaxy planes .	The analysis of Tully 's groups of galaxies belonging to the Local Supercluster ( LSC ) was performed .	In the 1975 Hawley and Peebles presented the method for investigations of the galaxies orientation in the large structures .	In our previous papers statistical test proposed by Hawley and Peebles for investigation of this problem was analyzed in details and some improvements were suggested .	On this base the new method of the analysis of galactic alignment in clusters was proposed .
1	The models do not apply if the initial proportion is large ( and fail whenever R_0 & lt ; 1 ) , and can not measure the impact of an intervention .	Background : Recently developed techniques to study the spread of infectious diseases through networks make assumptions that the initial proportion infected is infinitesimal and the population behavior is static throughout the epidemic .	Methods : In this paper we adapt `` edge-based compartmental models '' to situations having finite-sized initial conditions .	Results : The resulting models remain simple and accurately capture the effect of the initial conditions .	It is possible to generalize the model to networks whose partnerships change in time .
4	In addition we develop techniques with which to recover all kinematic unknowns , even in situations where the unknown quantities outnumber the constraints .	If physics beyond the Standard Model contains metastable new particle states , its signatures may manifest themselves at the LHC through the presence of displaced vertices or displaced tracks .	Such signatures are common in low-scale supersymmetry breaking scenarios as well as a host of other well-studied new physics models .	Here we analyze the kinematics of dual cascade decays with missing energy resulting from a stable non-interacting new particle state at the bottom of the decay chain .	We find that if the final step of the decay chain involves a metastable particle , the resulting presence of displaced tracks provides strong constraints with which to solve for the unknown kinematic quantities lost through missing energy .
0	In this paper we study Lipschitz contact equivalence of continuous function germs in the plane definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure , such as semialgebraic and subanalytic functions .	We partition the germ of the plane at the origin into zones where the function has explicit asymptotic behavior .	Such a partition is called a pizza .	We show that each function germ admits a minimal pizza , unique up to combinatorial equivalence .	We show then that two definable continuous function germs are definably Lipschitz contact equivalent if and only if their corresponding minimal pizzas are equivalent .
3	The resulting dynamics is determined by shape , size and ordering of magnetic domains arising in the films below the Curie temperature .	Actuation and control of motion in micro-mechanical systems are technological challenges , since they are accompanied by mechanical friction and wear , principal and well known sources of device lifetime reduction .	In this theoretical work we propose a non-contact motion control technique based on the introduction of a tunable magnetic interaction .	The latter is realized by coating two non-touching sliding bodies with ferromagnetic films .	We demonstrate that the domain behavior can be tailored by acting on handles like ferromagnetic coating preparation , external magnetic fields and the finite distance between the plates .
2	The scaling of the number of gates for such methods , while polynomial , presents some serious experimental challenges .	Quantum chemistry provides a target for quantum simulation of considerable scientific interest and industrial importance .	The majority of algorithms to date have been based on a second-quantized representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian - necessitating qubit requirements that scale linearly with the number of orbitals .	However , because the number of electrons is a good quantum number for the electronic structure problem it is unnecessary to store the full Fock space of the orbitals .	Representation of the wave function in a basis of Slater determinants for fixed electron number suffices .
1	The second is the analysis of reconstruction error associated to each such method .	This paper has two themes that are intertwined : The first is the dynamics of certain piecewise affine maps on the Euclidean space that arise from a class of analog-to-digital conversion methods called Sigma-Delta quantization .	Sigma-Delta quantization generates approximate representations of functions by sequences that lie in a restricted set of discrete values .	These are special sequences in that their local averages track the function values closely , thus enabling simple convolutional reconstruction .	In this paper , we are concerned with the approximation of constant functions only , a basic case that presents surprisingly complex behavior .
0	We study ergodic properties of a family of traffic maps acting in the space of bi-infinite sequences of real numbers .	The corresponding dynamics mimics the motion of vehicles in a simple traffic flow , which explains the name .	Using connections to topological Markov chains we obtain nontrivial invariant measures , prove their stochastic stability , and calculate the topological entropy .	Technically these results in the deterministic setting are related to the construction of measures of maximal entropy via measures uniformly distributed on periodic points of a given period , while in the random setting we directly construct ( spatially ) Markov invariant measures .	In distinction to conventional results the limiting measures in non-lattice case are non-ergodic .
3	The static potential appearing in the equation is identical to that whose soft part has been determined up to NLO and on the lattice in the context of jet quenching .	Thermal screening masses related to the conserved vector current are determined for the case that the current carries a non-zero Matsubara frequency , both in a weak-coupling approach and through lattice QCD .	We point out that such screening masses are sensitive to the same infrared physics as light-cone real-time rates .	In particular , on the perturbative side , the inhomogeneous Schrodinger equation determining screening correlators is shown to have the same general form as the equation implementing LPM resummation for the soft-dilepton and photon production rates from a hot QCD plasma .	Numerical results based on this potential suggest that screening masses overshoot the free results ( multiples of 2piT ) more strongly than at zero Matsubara frequency .
2	The rate for these loop-suppressed processes , however , is larger than typically expected for thermally produced DM .	An analysis of the Fermi gamma ray space telescope data has recently revealed a resolved gamma-ray feature close to the galactic center which is consistent with monochromatic photons at an energy of about 130 GeV .	If interpreted in terms of dark matter ( DM ) annihilating into \gamma\gamma ( \gamma Z , \gamma h ) , this would correspond to a DM particle mass of roughly 130 GeV ( 145 GeV , 155 GeV ) .	Correspondingly , one would generically expect even larger tree level production rates of standard model fermions or gauge bosons .	Here , we quantify this expectation in a rather model-independent way by relating the tree level and loop amplitudes with the help of the optical theorem .
2	For a uniform distribution of sizes , the stationary temperature profile is nonuniform with either hot small particles ( constant force driving ) or hot large particles ( constant velocity or constant energy driving ) .	A highly polydisperse granular gas is modeled by a continuous distribution of particle sizes , a , giving rise to a corresponding continuous temperature profile , T ( a ) , which we compute approximately , generalizing previous results for binary or multicomponent mixtures .	If the system is driven , it evolves towards a stationary temperature profile , which is discussed for several driving mechanisms in dependence on the variance of the size distribution .	Polydispersity always gives rise to non-Gaussian velocity distributions .	Depending on the driving mechanism the tails can be either overpopulated or underpopulated as compared to the molecular gas .
3	It is found that the polymer reduces the line tension of membrane edges , as well as the interfacial line tension between membrane domains , leading to microdomain formation .	The entropic effects of anchored polymers on biomembranes are studied using simulations of a meshless membrane model combined with anchored linear polymer chains .	The bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature are investigated for anchored ideal and excluded-volume polymer chains .	Our results are in good agreement with the previous theoretical predictions .	Instead of the mixing of two phases as observed in typical binary fluids , densely anchored polymers stabilize small domains .
4	We use the observed morphological and dynamical conditions , as well as plasma properties of the coronal curtain based on Differential Emission Measure ( DEM ) analysis to initialize a 3D MHD model of its vertical and transverse oscillations by implementing the impulsively excited velocity pulse mimicking the flare generated nonlinear fast magnetosonic propagating disturbance interacting with the curtain obliquely .	Observations on 2011 August 9 of an X6.9-class flare in active region ( AR ) 11263 by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly ( AIA ) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) , were followed by a rare detection of vertical kink oscillations in a large-scale coronal active region plasma curtain in EUV coronal lines .	The damped oscillations with periods in the range 8.8-14.9 min were detected and analyzed recently .	Our aim is to study the generation and propagation of the MHD oscillations in the plasma curtain taking into account realistic 3D magnetic and density structure of the curtain .	We also aim at testing and improving coronal seismology for more accurate determination of the magnetic field than with standard method .
1	Although the gradient descent method is a natural choice for this task , it requires exact gradient computations and hence can be inefficient when the problem size is large or the gradient is difficult to evaluate .	Many recent applications in machine learning and data fitting call for the algorithmic solution of structured smooth convex optimization problems .	Therefore , there has been much interest in inexact gradient methods ( IGMs ) , in which an efficiently computable approximate gradient is used to perform the update in each iteration .	Currently , non-asymptotic linear convergence results for IGMs are typically established under the assumption that the objective function is strongly convex , which is not satisfied in many applications of interest ; while linear convergence results that do not require the strong convexity assumption are usually asymptotic in nature .	In this paper , we combine the best of these two types of results and establish -- -under the standard assumption that the gradient approximation errors decrease linearly to zero -- -the non-asymptotic linear convergence of IGMs when applied to a class of structured convex optimization problems .
3	Our analysis suggests that the CMB spectrum shape is mostly determined by $ \alpha^2m_e/m_p $ and the proton-CDM-particle mass ratio , $ m_p/\mchi $ .	We use the three-scale framework of Hu et al .	to show how the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy spectrum depends on the fundamental constants .	As expected , the spectrum depends only on \emph { dimensionless } combinations of the constants , and we emphasize the points that make this generally true for cosmological observables .	The distance to the last-scattering surface depends on $ Gm_p\mchi/\hbar c $ , so published CMB observational limits on time variations of the constants implicitly assume the time-independence of this quantity , as well as assuming a flat-\lcdm~cosmological model .
0	When surfing the Internet , individuals leak personal and corporate information to third parties whose ( legitimate or not ) businesses revolve around the value of collected data .	The implications are serious , from a person unwillingly exposing private information to an unknown third party , to a company unable to manage the flow of its information to the outside world .	The point is that individuals and companies are more and more kept out of the loop when it comes to control private data .	With the goal of empowering informed choices in information leakage through the Internet , we propose CROWDSURF , a system for comprehensive and collaborative auditing of data that flows to Internet services .	Similarly to open-source efforts , we enable users to contribute in building awareness and control over privacy and communication vulnerabilities .
0	Let $ \nu\in M^1 ( [ 0 , \infty [ ) $ be a fixed probability measure .	For each dimension $ p\in\b N $ , let $ ( X_n^p ) _ { n\ge1 } $ be i.i.d .	$ \b R^p $ -valued radial random variables with radial distribution $ \nu $ .	We derive two central limit theorems for $ \|X_1^p+ ... +X_n^p\|_2 $ for $ n , p\to\infty $ with normal limits .	The first CLT for $ n & gt ; & gt ; p $ follows from known estimates of convergence in the CLT on $ \b R^p $ , while the second CLT for $ n & lt ; & lt ; p $ will be a consequence of asymptotic properties of Bessel convolutions .
2	We obtained a suit of models using population synthesis code , estimated the gravitational-wave background they produce , and discuss its detectability with second- ( advanced LIGO , advanced Virgo ) and third- ( Einstein Telescope ) generation detectors .	Recent studies on stellar evolution have shown that the properties of compact objects strongly depend on the metallicity of the environment in which they were formed .	Using some very simple assumptions on the metallicity of the stellar populations , we explore how this property affects the unresolved gravitational-wave background from extragalactic compact binaries .	Our results show that the background is dominated by binary black holes for all considered models in the frequency range of terrestrial detectors , and that it could be detected in most cases by advanced LIGO/Virgo , and with Einstein Telescope with a very high signal-to-noise ratio .	The observed peak in a gravitational wave spectrum depends on the metallicity of the stellar population .
3	The proposed framework is fully decentralized and only requires local communication among robots ; in particular , each robot locally estimates all the relevant global quantities .	We present a control framework for achieving encirclement of a target moving in 3D using a multi-robot system .	Three variations of a basic control strategy are proposed for different versions of the encirclement problem , and their effectiveness is formally established .	An extension ensuring maintenance of a safe inter-robot distance is also discussed .	We validate the proposed strategy through simulations on kinematic point robots and quadrotor UAVs , as well as experiments on differential-drive wheeled mobile robots .
3	Recent band calculation and transport measurements suggest that the in-gap states could actually be ascribed to topological surface states .	Kondo insulators ( KIs ) are strongly correlated materials in which the interactions between 4f and conduction electrons lead to a hybridization gap opening at low temperature 1-2 .	SmB6 is a typical KI , but its resistivity does not diverge at low temperatures , which was attributed to some in-gap states 3-10 .	However after several decades of research , the nature and origin of the in-gap states remain unclear .	SmB6 thus might be the first realization of topological Kondo insulator ( TKI ) 13 , the strongly correlated version of topological insulator ( TI ) 11,12 .
3	Using this , it is proved that there is no genuine compact quantum group which can act faithtully on $ C ( M ) $ such that the action leaves invariant the linear span of the above cordinate functions .	Let $ G $ be one of the classical compact , simple , centre-less , connected Lie groups or rank $ n $ with a maximal torus $ T $ , the Lie algebra $ \clg $ and let $ \ { E_i , F_i , H_i , i=1 , \ldots , n \ } $ be the standard set of generators corresponding to a basis of the root system .	Consider the adjoint-orbit space $ M=\ { { \rm Ad } _g ( H_1 ) , ~g \in G \ } $ , identified with the homogeneous space $ G/L $ where $ L=\ { g \in G : ~ { \rm Ad } _g ( H_1 ) =H_1\ } $ .	We prove that the `coordinate functions ' $ \ { f_i , i=1 , \ldots , n \ } $ , ( where $ f_i ( g ) : =\lambda_i ( { \rm Ad } _g ( H_1 ) ) $ , $ \ { \lambda_1 , \ldots , \lambda_n\ } $ is basis of $ \clg^\prime $ ) are `quadratically independent ' in the sense that they do not satisfy any nontrivial homogeneous quadratic relations among them .	As a corollary , it is also shown that any compact quantum group having a faithful action on the noncommutative manifold obtained by Rieffel deformation of $ M $ satisfying a similar `linearity ' condition must be a Rieffel-Wang type deformation of some compact group .
2	We apply this in the context of bosonic models with ring exchanges realizing so-called Exciton Bose Liquid ( EBL ) phase and compare a Gutzwiller wave function against an accurate EBL wave function .	Slave particle approaches are widely used in studies of exotic quantum phases .	A complete description beyond mean field also contains dynamical gauge fields , while a simplified procedure considers Gutzwiller-projected trial states .	We solve the parton-gauge theory and show that dynamical fluctuations of the spatial gauge fields are necessary for obtaining qualitatively accurate EBL description .	On the contrary , just the Gutzwiller projection leads to a state with subtle differences in the long-wavelength properties , thus suggesting that Gutzwiller wave functions may generally fail to capture long-wavelength physics .
1	The optical analogs of these velocity effects are described .	The Rabi oscillations of a two-level atom illuminated by a laser on resonance with the atomic transition may be suppressed by the atomic motion through averaging or filtering mechanisms .	The two atomic levels correspond in the optical analogy to orthogonal polarizations of light and the Rabi oscillations to polarization oscillations in a medium which is optically active , naturally or due to a magnetic field .	In the later case , the two orthogonal polarizations could be selected by choosing the orientation of the magnetic field , and one of them be filtered out .	It is argued that the time-dependent optical polarization oscillations or their suppression are observable with current technology .
0	We present theory and experiments on the dynamics of reaction fronts in two-dimensional , vortex-dominated flows , for both time-independent and periodically driven cases .	We find that the front propagation process is controlled by one-sided barriers that are either fixed in the laboratory frame ( time-independent flows ) or oscillate periodically ( periodically driven flows ) .	We call these barriers \emph { burning invariant manifolds } ( BIMs ) , since their role in front propagation is analogous to that of invariant manifolds in the transport and mixing of passive impurities under advection .	Theoretically , the BIMs emerge from a dynamical systems approach when the advection-reaction-diffusion dynamics is recast as an ODE for front element dynamics .	Experimentally , we measure the location of BIMs for several laboratory flows and confirm their role as barriers to front propagation .
3	Define $ C_r $ as the largest constant such that $ \gamma ( G ) \ge C_r \sum_ { 1 \le i & lt ; j \le r } d ( x_i , x_j ) $ for any $ r $ vertices of an arbitrary connected graph $ G $ ; then $ C_2=\frac { 1 } { 3 } $ in this view .	A vertex set $ S $ of a graph $ G $ is a \emph { dominating set } if each vertex of $ G $ either belongs to $ S $ or is adjacent to a vertex in $ S $ .	The \emph { domination number } $ \gamma ( G ) $ of $ G $ is the minimum cardinality of $ S $ as $ S $ varies over all dominating sets of $ G $ .	It is known that $ \gamma ( G ) \ge \frac { 1 } { 3 } ( diam ( G ) +1 ) $ , where $ diam ( G ) $ denotes the diameter of $ G $ .	The main result of this paper is that $ C_r=\frac { 1 } { r ( r-1 ) } $ for $ r\geq 3 $ .
0	The growth morphology and the effects of surface reconstruction/relaxation of the habit faces on the crystal morphology of urea crystal are investigated from first principle using the Hartman-Perdok approach .	A procedure has been developed to find out surface termination when a slab of d ( hkl ) thickness is created having { hkl } orientation .	Slice energy of different habit faces have been computed and the attachment energy was calculated .	The crystal growth morphology of the urea crystal has been drawn on the basis of computed attachment energies of different habit faces .	The calculated crystal growth morphology depends on the functional employed for computing the attachment energies .
3	The combination of CDF and D0 results leads to the first observation of the s-channel mode of single top quark production .	The production of single-top quarks occurs via the weak interaction at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider .	Single top quark events are selected in the lepton+jets final state by CDF and D0 and in the missing transverse energy plus jets final state by CDF .	Multivariate classifiers separate the s-channel and t-channel single-top signals from the large backgrounds .	The t-channel and single top combined cross sections have also been measured .
4	We demonstrate that the optical properties ( i.e.light absorption ) of nonspherical structures are dictated by the eigenvalue of the structure 's leaky modes .	Subwavelength dielectric structures offer an attractive low loss alternative to plasmonic structures for the development of resonant optics functionality such as metamaterials .	Nonspherical like rectangular structures are of most interest from the standpoint of device development due to fabrication convenience .	However , no intuitive fundamental understanding of optical resonance in nonspherical structures is available , which has substantially delayed the device development with dielectric materials .	Here we elucidate the general fundamentals of optical resonances in nonspherical subwavelength dielectric structures of different shapes ( rectangular or triangular ) and dimensionalities ( 1D nanowires and 0D nanoparticles ) .
0	We investigate the structure of a simple class of affine toric Calabi-Yau varieties that are defined from quiver representations based on finite eulerian directed graphs ( digraphs ) .	The vanishing first Chern class of these varieties just follows from the characterisation of eulerian digraphs as being connected with all vertices balanced .	Some structure theory is used to show how any eulerian digraph can be generated by iterating combinations of just a few canonical graph-theoretic moves .	We describe the effect of each of these moves on the lattice polytopes which encode the toric Calabi-Yau varieties and illustrate the construction in several examples .	We comment on physical applications of the construction in the context of moduli spaces for superconformal gauged linear sigma models .
1	The spectrum features global H charges , vortices carrying flux labeled by the elements of H and dyonic combinations .	A detailed analysis of Chern-Simons ( CS ) theories in which a compact abelian direct product gauge group U ( 1 ) ^k is spontaneously broken down to a direct product H of ( finite ) cyclic groups is presented .	Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect these particles exhibit toplogical interactions .	The remnant of the U ( 1 ) ^k CS term in the discrete H gauge theory describing the effective long distance physics of such a model is shown to be a 3-cocycle for H summarizing the nontrivial topological interactions cast upon the magnetic vortices by the U ( 1 ) ^k CS term .	It is noted that there are in general three types of 3-cocycles for a finite abelian gauge group H : one type describes topological interactions among vortices carrying flux w.r.t .
1	Following a brief review of the process stellar collapse to a black hole , I discuss the gravitational redshift , particle trajectories in gravitational fields , the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions to Einstein 's equations , orbits in Schwarzschild and in Kerr geometry , and the dragging of inertial frames .	I present an elementary primer of black hole physics , including its general relativity basis , all peppered with astrophysical illustrations .	I follow with a brief review of galactic X-ray binary systems with known black holes , stressing the QPO phenomenon in particular .	I then discuss the evidence from AGN for the existence of supermassive black holes in galaxy nuclei , as well as evidence for such black holes in ordinary galaxy nuclei .	I use the free motion of gas parcels to illustrate aspects of accretion disks around black holes , showing how to calculate energy efficiency and surface emissivity of disks , and the rate of black hole spin-up .
2	Statistical analysis of GPS measurements points to ORM as an observing site with suitable conditions for infrared ( IR ) observations , with a median column of precipitable water vapor ( PWV ) of 3.8 mm .	The atmospheric water vapor content above the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory ( ORM ) obtained from Global Positioning Systems ( GPS ) is presented .	GPS measurements have been evaluated by comparison with 940nm-radiometer observations .	PWV presents a clear seasonal behavior , being Winter and Spring the best seasons for IR observations .	The percentage of nighttime showing PWV values smaller than 3 mm is over 60 % in February , March and April .
2	When the theories are defined on AdS ( 4 ) space-time there are boundary manifestations of the duality , which for the case of gravity account for the energy-momentum/Cotton tensor duality ( also known as dual graviton correspondence ) .	We review the status of electric/magnetic duality for free gauge field theories in four space-time dimensions with emphasis on Maxwell theory and linearized Einstein gravity .	Using the theory of vector and tensor spherical harmonics , we provide explicit construction of dual photons and gravitons by decomposing the fields into axial and polar configurations with opposite parity and interchanging the two sectors .	For AdS ( 4 ) black-hole backgrounds there is no direct analogue of gravitational duality on the bulk , but there is still a boundary duality for quasi-normal modes satisfying a selected set of boundary conditions .	Possible extensions of this framework and some open questions are also briefly discussed .
3	Assuming $ \rm R_ { GC } $ = 8 kpc , this implies the distance to these stars is $ ( m-M ) _0 $ = 16.97 $ \pm $ 0.07 mags , which corresponds to D = 24.8 $ \pm $ 0.8 kpc .	We derive the distance to the northern extension of the Sagittarius ( Sgr ) dwarf spheroidal galaxy from 203 Sgr RR0 Lyrae stars found in the MACHO database .	Their distances are determined differentially with respect to 288 Galactic Bulge RR0 Lyrae stars also found in the MACHO data .	We find a distance modulus difference of 2.41 mags at $ l $ = 5 $ ^ { \circ } $ and $ b $ = -8 $ ^ { \circ } $ and that the extension of the Sgr galaxy towards the galactic plane is inclined toward us .	Although this estimate is smaller than previous determinations for this galaxy and agrees with previous suggestions that Sgr 's body is truly closer to us , this estimate is larger than studies at comparable galactic latitudes .
4	As the manual social network extraction of web documents is impractical and unscalable , and fully automated extraction are still at the very early stage to be implemented , we proposed a ( semi ) -automatic extraction based on the superficial methods .	The Web has been chosen as a basic infrastructure to gain the social structure information , through the social network extraction , from all over the world .	However , most of the web documents are unstructured and lack of semantics .	Moreover , that network is subject to all kinds of changes and dynamics , and a network can be very complex due to the large number of nodes and links Web contains .	In this paper , we discuss a methodology that meant to assists in extracting and modeling the social network from Web snippet .
2	In this case , the moduli space of the noncommutative deformations is of dimension 19 , the same as the moduli dimension of the complex deformations of commutative algebraic K3 surfaces .	We consider N-point deformation of algebraic K3 surfaces .	First , we construct two-point deformation of algebraic K3 surfaces by considering algebraic deformation of a pair of commutative algebraic K3 surfaces .	Then , we extend this method to the N-point case .	In the N-point case , the dimension of deformation moduli space becomes 19N ( N-1 ) /2 .
1	In cosmology , gravitational-wave distortions are produced by most of the inflationary scenarios and their anticipated detection should open a new window to the early universe .	Gravitational waves are propagating undulations in the spacetime fabric , which interact very weakly with their environment .	Motivated by the relative lack of studies on the potential implications of gravitational radiation for the large-scale structure of the universe , we consider its coupling to density perturbations during the post-recombination era .	We do so by assuming an Einstein-de Sitter background cosmology and by employing a second-order perturbation study .	At this perturbative level and on superhorizon scales , we find that gravitational radiation adds a distinct and faster growing mode to the standard linear solution for the density contrast .
4	Numerical results are given to verify the theoretical analysis .	We present and analyze a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin ( HDG ) method for the time-harmonic Maxwell equations .	The divergence-free condition is enforced on the electric field , then a Lagrange multiplier is introduced , and the problem becomes the solution of a mixed curl-curl formulation of the Maxwell 's problem .	The method is shown to be an absolutely stable HDG method for the indefinite time-harmonic Maxwell equations with high wave number .	By exploiting the duality argument , the dependence of convergence of the HDG method on the wave number k , the mesh size h and the polynomial order p is obtained .
2	Our approach generalizes Loday 's realization of the associahedron ( a type $ A $ $ c $ -generalized associahedron whose outer normal fan is not the cluster fan but a coarsening of the Coxeter fan arising from the Tamari lattice ) to any finite Coxeter group .	Given a finite Coxeter system $ ( W , S ) $ and a Coxeter element $ c $ , we construct a simple polytope whose outer normal fan is N. Reading 's Cambrian fan $ F_c $ , settling a conjecture of Reading that this is possible .	We call this polytope the $ c $ -generalized associahedron .	A crucial role in the construction is played by the $ c $ -singleton cones , the cones in the $ c $ -Cambrian fan which consist of a single maximal cone from the Coxeter fan .	Moreover , if $ W $ is a Weyl group and the vertices of the permutahedron are chosen in a lattice associated to $ W $ , then we show that our realizations have integer coordinates in this lattice .
4	We evaluate their performance on dataset that contains multiple instances of the same class , demonstrating the potentials and their synergies .	This paper proposes the problem of point-and-count as a test case to break the what-and-where deadlock .	Different from the traditional detection problem , the goal is to discover key salient points as a way to localize and count the number of objects simultaneously .	We propose two alternatives , one that counts first and then point , and another that works the other way around .	Fundamentally , they pivot around whether we solve `` what '' or `` where '' first .
3	These three periods include the strong rises around BC 671 , AD 775 , and AD 1795 .	The motivation for our study is the disputed cause for the strong variation of 14-C around AD 775 .	Our method is to compare the 14-C variation around AD 775 with other periods of strong variability .	Our results are : ( a ) We see three periods , where 14-C varied over 200 yr in a special way showing a certain pattern of strong secular variation : after a Grand Minimum with strongly increasing 14-C , there is a series of strong short-term drop ( s ) , rise ( s ) , and again drop ( s ) within 60 yr , ending up to 200 yr after the start of the Grand Minimum .	( b ) We show with several solar activity proxies ( radioisotopes , sunspots , and aurorae ) for the AD 770s and 1790s that such intense rapid 14-C increases can be explained by strong rapid decreases in solar activity and , hence , wind , so that the decrease in solar modulation potential leads to an increase in radioisotope production .
1	The weights are obtained composing a suitable support map with the rank function of a graded lattice that satisfies certain regularity properties .	We construct a family of weight functions on finite abelian groups that yield invertible MacWilliams identities for additive codes .	We express the Krawtchouk coefficients of the corresponding MacWilliams transformation in terms of the combinatorial invariants of the underlying lattice , and show that the most relevant weight functions studied in coding theory belong , up to equivalence , to the class that we introduce .	In particular , we compute some classical Krawtchouk coefficients employing a simple combinatorial method .	Our approach also allows to systematically construct weight functions that endow the underlying group with a metric space structure .
1	However , quantization of the AdS $ _5\times\ ; $ S $ ^5 $ superstring from first principles is still an open question and especially the spectrum of short string states has previously been derived only at leading order in large 't Hooft coupling .	The the duality between $ { \cal N } =4 $ SYM and the AdS $ _5\times\ ; $ S $ ^5 $ superstring appears to enjoy quantum integrability in the planar limit , which allowed to devise powerful methods ostensibly solving the spectral problem .	In this thesis we investigate possible routes to take the perturbative quantization of short string states beyond the leading order , where equally our aim is to gain better appreciation of the quantum symmetries at play .	A prominent role is played by the lowest excited string states , dual to the Konishi supermultiplet , and we start by reviewing critically an asserted derivation of the Konishi anomalous dimension in the setup of pure spinor string theory .	Next , we study the bosonic AdS $ _5\times\ ; $ S $ ^5 $ string in static gauge , where we construct a so-called single-mode string solution , which shows classical integrability and invariance under the isometries SO ( 2,4 ) $ \ ; \times\ ; $ SO ( 6 ) at the quantum level .
0	We extend the covariant , parametrized post-Friedmann treatment of cosmic acceleration from modified gravity to an arbitrary admixture of matter , radiation , relativistic components and spatial curvature .	Explicit expressions in the comoving , Newtonian and synchronous gauges facilitate the adaptation of Einstein-Boltzmann codes for solving CMB and matter perturbations in the linear regime .	Using a comoving gauge code , we study the effect of metric evolution on the CMB through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect .	Modified gravity can alter the low multipole spectrum , including lowering the power in the quadrupole .	From a principal component description of the primary metric ratio parameter , we obtain general constraints from WMAP on modified gravity models of the acceleration .
1	The additional seven observed variables considered here are their surface nitrogen abundance , rotational frequency , magnetic field strength , and the amplitude and frequency of their dominant acoustic and gravity mode of oscillation .	We have composed a sample of 68 massive stars in our galaxy whose projected rotational velocity , effective temperature and gravity are available from high-precision spectroscopic measurements .	Multiple linear regression to estimate the nitrogen abundance combined with principal components analysis , after addressing the incomplete and truncated nature of the data , reveals that the effective temperature and the frequency of the dominant acoustic oscillation mode are the only two significant predictors for the nitrogen abundance , while the projected rotational velocity and the rotational frequency have no predictive power .	The dominant gravity mode and the magnetic field strength are correlated with the effective temperature but have no predictive power for the nitrogen abundance .	Our findings are completely based on observations and their proper statistical treatment and call for a new strategy in evaluating the outcome of stellar evolution computations .
2	We also consider Monte Carlo simulations for a vortex model with a screened interaction .	We study vortex lines in high-temperature superconductors with columnar defects produced by heavy ion irradiation .	We reconsider scaling theory for the Bose glass transition with tilted magnetic fields , and propose , e.g. , a new scaling form for the shape of the Bose glass phase boundary , which is relevant for experiments .	Critical exponents are determined from scaling analysis of Monte Carlo data for current-voltage characteristics and other quantities .	The dynamic critical exponent is found to be z = 4.6 +/- 0.3 .
0	We discuss the algorithm of the cutting rules of calculating the imaginary part of physical amplitude and the optical theorem .	We ameliorate the conventional cutting rules to make it suitable for actual calculation and give the right imaginary part of physical amplitude .	The calculations of the imaginary parts of several Feynman diagrams show that the ameliorated cutting rules agrees with the conventional integral algorithm very well .	The investigation helps us to find that the optical theorem has severe contradictions and problem , thus is n't right .	Besides , the calculation of a physical amplitude show that the ameliorated cutting rules keeps the physical result gauge-parameter independent .
0	We show that the interplay between spin-changing collisions and quadratic Zeeman coupling provides a novel mechanism for the formation of repulsively bound composites in high-spin fermions , which we illustrate by considering spin flips in an initially polarized hard-core 1D Mott insulator of spin-3/2 fermions .	We show that after the flips the dynamics is characterized by the creation of two types of exciton-biexciton composites .	We analyze the conditions for the existence of these bound states , and discuss their intriguing properties .	In particular we show that the effective mass and stability of the composites depends non-trivially on spin-changing collisions , on the quadratic Zeeman effect and on the initial exciton localization .	Finally , we show that the composites may remain stable against inelastic collisions , opening the possibility of novel quantum composite phases .
4	We use GLIMPSE and MSX 8 micron images to show that the bulk of the free-free luminosity is associated with bubbles having radii r~5-100 pc , with a mean ~20 pc .	We use the WMAP maximum entropy method foreground emission map combined with previously determined distances to giant HII regions to measure the free-free flux at Earth and the free-free luminosity of the galaxy .	We find a total flux f_\nu=54211 Jy and a flux from 88 sources of f_\nu=36043 Jy .	The bulk of the sources are at least marginally resolved , with mean radii ~60 pc , electron density n_e ~ 9 cm^ { -3 } , and filling factor \phi_ { HII } =0.005 ( over the Galactic gas disk ) .	The total dust-corrected ionizing photon luminosity is Q=3.2x10^ { 53 } photons/s , in good agreement with previous estimates .
0	Measurements of two-particle angular correlations between an identified strange hadron ( K0S or Lambda/anti-Lambda ) and a charged particle , emitted in pPb collisions , are presented over a wide range in pseudorapidity and full azimuth .	The data , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 35 inverse nanobarns , were collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy ( sqrt ( s [ NN ] ) ) of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC .	The results are compared to semi-peripheral PbPb collision data at sqrt ( s [ NN ] ) = 2.76 TeV , covering similar charged-particle multiplicities in the events .	The observed azimuthal correlations at large relative pseudorapidity are used to extract the second-order ( v [ 2 ] ) and third-order ( v [ 3 ] ) anisotropy harmonics of K0S and Lambda/anti-Lambda particles .	These quantities are studied as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in the event and the transverse momentum of the particles .
2	In this work , we propose the additional use of the generalized Langevin oscillator model to also include the effect of the energy exchange between the molecule and the heated surface lattice in the desorption dynamics .	We simulate the femtosecond laser induced desorption dynamics of a diatomic molecule from a metal surface by including the effect of the electron and phonon excitations created by the laser pulse .	Following previous models , the laser induced surface excitation is treated through the two temperature model , while the multidimensional dynamics of the molecule is described by a classical Langevin equation , in which the friction and random forces account for the action of the heated electrons .	The model is applied to study the laser induced desorption of O $ _2 $ from the Ag ( 110 ) surface , making use of a six-dimensional potential energy surface calculated within density functional theory .	Our results reveal the importance of the phonon mediated process and show that , depending on the value of the electronic density in the surroundings of the molecule adsorption site , its inclusion can significantly enhance or reduce the desorption probabilities .
3	We show on examples that our bound is sharp .	We give two examples of periodic Gaussian processes , having entropy numbers of exactly same order but radically different small deviations .	Our construction is based on classical Knopp 's result yielding of existence of continuous nowhere differentiable functions , and more precisely on Loud 's functions .	We also obtain a general lower bound for small deviations using the majorizing measure method .	We also apply it to Gaussian independent sequences and to the generic class of ultrametric Gaussian processes .
0	We present results of a survey for giant Ly-alpha nebulae ( LABs ) at z=3 with Subaru/Suprime-Cam .	We obtained Ly-alpha imaging at z=3.09+-0.03 around the SSA22 protocluster and in several blank fields .	The total survey area is 2.1 square degrees , corresponding to a comoving volume of 1.6 x 10^6 Mpc^3 .	Using a uniform detection threshold of 1.4 x 10^ { -18 } erg s^ { -1 } cm^ { -2 } arcsec^ { -2 } for the Ly-alpha images , we construct a sample of 14 LAB candidates with major-axis diameters larger than 100 kpc , including five previously known blobs and two known quasars .	This survey triples the number of known LABs over 100 kpc .
3	To be more discriminative , the coarse saliency map is further enhanced into the posterior probability map within Bayesian perspective .	In this letter , an effective image saliency detection method is proposed by constructing some novel spaces to model the background and redefine the distance of the salient patches away from the background .	Concretely , given the backgroundness prior , eigendecomposition is utilized to create four spaces of background-based distribution ( SBD ) to model the background , in which a more appropriate metric ( Mahalanobis distance ) is quoted to delicately measure the saliency of every image patch away from the background .	After that , a coarse saliency map is obtained by integrating the four adjusted Mahalanobis distance maps , each of which is formed by the distances between all the patches and background in the corresponding SBD .	Finally , the final saliency map is generated by properly refining the posterior probability map with geodesic distance .
0	Emerging hybrid accelerator architectures for high performance computing are often suited for the use of a data-parallel programming model .	Unfortunately , programmers of these architectures face a steep learning curve that frequently requires learning a new language ( e.g. , OpenCL ) .	Furthermore , the distributed ( and frequently multi-level ) nature of the memory organization of clusters of these machines provides an additional level of complexity .	This paper presents preliminary work examining how programming with a local orientation can be employed to provide simpler access to accelerator architectures .	A locally-oriented programming model is especially useful for the solution of algorithms requiring the application of a stencil or convolution kernel .
2	The method is first generalized to the case of quantum strangeness canonical ensemble .	Strangeness canonical ensemble for Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is reconsidered for excited nuclear systems with non-vanishing net strangeness .	A new recurrence relation method is applied to find the partition function .	Uncertainties in calculation of the K+/pi+ excitation function are discussed .	A new scenario based on the strangeness distillation effect is put forward for a possible explanation of anomalous strangeness production observed at the bombarding energy near 30 AGeV .
4	In addition to the more standard diagnostic of the maximum error , we supply illustrations of the spatial distribution of the errors , which offers visual evidence of all the contributing factors to the overall approximation accuracy : multipole expansion , local expansion , hierarchical spatial decomposition ( interaction lists , local domain , far domain ) .	The Fast Multipole Method ( FMM ) offers an acceleration for pairwise interaction calculation , known as $ N $ -body problems , from $ \mathcal { O } ( N^2 ) $ to $ \mathcal { O } ( N ) $ with $ N $ particles .	This has brought dramatic increase in the capability of particle simulations in many application areas , such as electrostatics , particle formulations of fluid mechanics , and others .	Although the literature on the subject provides theoretical error bounds for the FMM approximation , there are not many reports of the measured errors in a suite of computational experiments .	We have performed such an experimental investigation , and summarized the results of about 1000 calculations using the FMM algorithm , to characterize the accuracy of the method in relation with the different parameters available to the user .
3	Numerical simulations were carried out on a two dimensional lattice $ L\times L $ in which two constant thresholds $ E_ { c } ^ { I } =4 $ and $ E_ { c } ^ { II } & gt ; E_ { c } ^ { I } $ were randomly distributed .	The aim of this study is to investigate a wave dynamics and size scaling of avalanches which were created by the mathematical model { [ } J .	\v { C } ern\'ak Phys.Rev .	E \textbf { 65 } , 046141 ( 2002 ) ] .	A density of sites $ c $ with the threshold $ E_ { c } ^ { II } $ and threshold $ E_ { c } ^ { II } $ are parameters of the model .
1	It is shown that SN 2003dh had a high explosion kinetic energy ( $ \sim 4 \times 10^ { 52 } $ erg in spherical symmetry ) , making it one of the most powerful hypernovae observed so far , and supporting the case for association between hypernovae and Gamma Ray Bursts .	The spectra of SN 2003dh , identified in the afterglow of GRB030329 , are modeled using radiation transport codes .	However , the light curve derived from fitting the spectra suggests that SN 2003dh was not as bright as SN 1998bw , ejecting only $ \sim 0.35\Msun $ of \Nifs .	The spectra of SN 2003dh resemble those of SN 1998bw around maximum , but later they look more like those of the less energetic hypernova SN 1997ef .	The spectra and the inferred light curve can be modeled adopting a density distribution similar to that used for SN 1998bw at $ v & gt ; 25,000 $ \kms but more like that of SN 1997ef at lower velocities .
2	We define the more manageable locally normal universal C*-algebra C*_ln ( A ) as the quotient of C* ( A ) by its largest ideal vanishing in all locally normal representations and we investigate its structure .	We study the representation theory of a conformal net A on the circle from a K-theoretical point of view using its universal C*-algebra C* ( A ) .	We prove that if A satisfies the split property then , for every representation \pi of A with finite statistical dimension , \pi ( C* ( A ) ) is weakly closed and hence a finite direct sum of type I_\infty factors .	In particular , if A is completely rational with n sectors , then C*_ln ( A ) is a direct sum of n type I_\infty factors .	Its ideal K_A of compact operators has nontrivial K-theory , and we prove that the DHR endomorphisms of C* ( A ) with finite statistical dimension act on K_A , giving rise to an action of the fusion semiring of DHR sectors on K_0 ( K_A ) $ .
3	The images show UV emission from both the active nucleus and the host galaxy .	The Optical Monitor telescope ( Mason et al .	2001 ) on XMM-Newton provides an exciting multi-wavelength dimension to observations of Active Galactic Nuclei .	Here we present ultraviolet images , taken with the OM UVW2 filter ( 140-270 nm ) , of various Seyfert galaxies , some of which have never been observed in this waveband before .	The distribution of UV emission in the galaxy shows where star formation is occurring , thus giving us clues as to the evolution of the host galaxy and perhaps its relationship to the Seyfert Nucleus .
0	We consider a continuum model of active viscoelastic matter , whereby an active nematic liquid-crystal is coupled to a minimal model of polymer dynamics with a viscoelastic relaxation time $ \tau_C $ .	To explore the resulting interplay between active and polymeric dynamics , we first generalise a linear stability analysis ( from earlier studies without polymer ) to derive criteria for the onset of spontaneous heterogeneous flows ( strain rate ) and/or deformations ( strain ) .	We find two modes of instability .	The first is a viscous mode , associated with strain rate perturbations .	It dominates for relatively small values of $ \tau_C $ and is a simple generalisation of the instability known previously without polymer .
1	We study connected , singular-hyperbolic , attracting sets with dense closed orbits { \em and only one singularity } .	A { \em singular hyperbolic set } is a partially hyperbolic set with singularities ( all hyperbolic ) and volume expanding central direction \cite { MPP1 } .	These sets are shown to be transitive for most $ C^r $ flows in the Baire 's second category sence .	In general these sets are shown to be either transitive or the union of two homoclinic classes .	In the later case we prove the existence of finitely many homoclinic classes .
1	We show that the result for inertial mass can be extended to passive gravitational mass .	In previous work it has been shown that the electromagnetic quantum vacuum , or electromagnetic zero-point field , makes a contribution to the inertial reaction force on an accelerated object .	As a consequence the weak equivalence principle , which equates inertial to passive gravitational mass , appears to be explainable .	This in turn leads to a straightforward derivation of the classical Newtonian gravitational force .	We call the inertia and gravitation connection with the vacuum fields the quantum vacuum inertia hypothesis .
0	Measuring distances to galaxies , determining their chemical composition , investigating the nature of their stellar populations and the absorbing properties of their interstellar medium are fundamental activities in modern extragalactic astronomy helping to understand the evolution of galaxies and the expanding universe .	The optically brightest stars in the universe , blue supergiants of spectral A and B , are unique tools for these purposes .	With absolute visual magnitudes up to M_V = -9.5 they are the ideal to obtain accurate quantitative information about galaxies through the powerful modern methods of quantitative stellar spectroscopy .	The spectral analyis of individual blue supergiant targets provides invaluable information about chemical abundances and abundance gradients , which is more comprehensive than the one obtained from HII regions , as it includes additional atomic species , and which is also more accurate , since it avoids the systematic uncertainties inherent in the strong line studies usually applied to the HII regions of spiral galaxies beyond the Local Group .	Simultaneously , the spectral analysis yields stellar parameters and interstellar extinction for each individual supergiant target , which provides an alternative very accurate way to determine extragalactic distances through a newly developed method , called the Flux-weighted Gravity - Luminosity Relationship ( FGLR ) .
0	We present the data analysis and the X-ray source counts for the first season of XMM-Newton observations in the COSMOS field .	The survey covers ~2 deg^2 within the region of sky bounded by 9^h57.5^m & lt ; R.A. & lt ; 10^h03.5^m ; 1^d27.5^m & lt ; DEC & lt ; 2^d57.5^m with a total net integration time of 504 ks .	A maximum likelihood source detection was performed in the 0.5-2 keV , 2-4.5 keV and 4.5-10 keV energy bands and 1390 point-like sources were detected in at least one band .	Detailed Monte Carlo simulations were performed to fully test the source detection method and to derive the sky coverage to be used in the computation of the logN-logS relations .	The 0.5 -- 2 keV and 2 -- 10 keV differential logN-logS were fitted with a broken power-law model which revealed a Euclidean slope ( alpha~2.5 ) at the bright end and a flatter slope ( alpha~1.5 ) at faint fluxes .
1	Here , we present the first radial velocity curve for this system .	HD 553 was discovered as an eclipsing binary by Hipparcos .	It is found that HD 553 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary .	Despite the large luminosity difference , the two components of the system are of very simmilar mass .	The primary , a K0-giant , fills a large fraction of its Roche-lobe .
0	I present results for the two-loop self-energy functions for scalars in a general renormalizable field theory , using mass-independent renormalization schemes based on dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction .	The results are given in terms of a minimal set of loop-integral basis functions , which are readily evaluated numerically by computers .	This paper contains the contributions corresponding to the Feynman diagrams with zero or one vector propagator lines .	These are the ones needed to obtain the pole masses of the neutral and charged Higgs scalar bosons in supersymmetry , neglecting only the purely electroweak parts at two-loop order .	A subsequent paper will present the results for the remaining diagrams , which involve two or more vector lines .
1	The dielectric constant was found to decrease with increasing aging time at an aging temperature in many cases .	Aging dynamics in thin films of poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) have been investigated through dielectric measurements for different types of aging processes .	An increase in the dielectric constant was also observed in the long time region ( $ \ge $ 11h ) near the glass transition temperature for thin films with thickness less than 26nm .	In the constant rate mode including a temporary stop at a temperature $ T_a $ , the memory of the aging at $ T_a $ was found to be kept and then to be recalled during the subsequent heating process .	In the negative temperature cycling process , a strong rejuvenation effect has been observed after the temperature shift from the initial temperature $ T_1 $ to the second temperature $ T_2 $ ( $ =T_1+\Delta T $ ) when $ \Delta T\approx -20 $ K .
1	In this paper , emphasis is placed upon the motivation of the theory .	In an earlier paper , a new theory of measurefree `` conditional '' objects was presented .	The central part of this motivation is established through an example involving a knowledge-based system .	In order to evaluate combination of evidence for this system , using observed data , auxiliary at tribute and diagnosis variables , and inference rules connecting them , one must first choose an appropriate algebraic logic description pair ( ALDP ) : a formal language or syntax followed by a compatible logic or semantic evaluation ( or model ) .	Three common choices- for this highly non-unique choice - are briefly discussed , the logics being Classical Logic , Fuzzy Logic , and Probability Logic .
4	Using Bayesian analysis , we find 6 brown dwarfs with confident $ ( p & gt ; 95\ % ) $ variability in the relative flux in at least one wavelength region at sub-percent precision , and 5 brown dwarfs with tentative $ ( p & gt ; 68\ % ) $ variability .	Condensate clouds strongly impact the spectra of brown dwarfs and exoplanets .	Recent discoveries of variable L/T transition dwarfs argued for patchy clouds in at least some ultracool atmospheres .	This study aims to measure the frequency and level of spectral variability in brown dwarfs and to search for correlations with spectral type .	We used HST/WFC3 to obtain spectroscopic time series for 22 brown dwarfs of spectral types ranging from L5 to T6 at 1.1-1.7 $ \mu $ m for $ \approx $ 40 min per object .
4	For the $ \phi $ meson we find almost no mass shift , but the width of the peak increases significantly .	Based on an effective Lagrangian which combines chiral SU ( 3 ) dynamics with vector meson dominance , we have developed a model for the forward vector meson-nucleon scattering amplitudes .	We use this as an input to calculate the low energy part of the current-current correlation function in nuclear matter .	For the isovector channel we find a significant enhancement of the in-medium spectral density below the $ \rho $ resonance while the $ \rho $ meson mass itself changes only slightly .	The situation is different in the isoscalar channel , where the mass and peak position of the $ \omega $ meson move downward while its width increases moderately .
0	Multi-gap RPC prototypes with readout on a multi-strip electrode were developed for the small polar angle region of the CBM-TOF subdetector , the most demanding zone in terms of granularity and counting rate .	The prototypes are based on low resistivity ( $ \sim $ 10 $ ^ { 10 } $ $ \Omega $ cm ) glass electrodes for performing in high counting rate environment .	The strip width/pitch size was chosen such to fulfill the impedance matching with the front-end electronics and the granularity requirements of the innermost zone of the CBM-TOF wall .	The in-beam tests using secondary particles produced in heavy ion collisions on a Pb target at SIS18 - GSI Darmstadt and SPS - CERN were focused on the performance of the prototype in conditions similar to the ones expected at SIS100/FAIR .	An efficiency larger than 98\ % and a system time resolution in the order of 70~-~80~ps were obtained in high counting rate and high multiplicity environment .
3	This result is further supported with the inclusion of the radio-loud QSOs in the FIRST survey , although the total number of DLAs is still small ( 4 ) and the result is currently only significant at approximately the 2 sigma level .	We present a list of z_abs ~ z_em ( Delta v & lt ; 3000 km/s ) DLAs discovered during the CORALS survey for absorbers in a radio-selected QSO sample .	On the assumption that z_abs ~ z_em DLAs are neither ejecta from the QSO , nor part of the host galaxy itself , we use the number density statistics of these DLAs to investigate galaxy clustering near the QSO redshift .	We find that n ( z ) of z_abs \~z_em DLAs in our radio-selected QSO sample is ~4 times larger than the number density of intervening DLAs , implying an excess of galaxies near the QSO .	Since all of the z_abs ~ z_em DLAs we identify in CORALS are found towards optically bright ( B & lt ; 20 ) QSOs , there is no strong evidence ( based on these limited statistics ) that this population suffers from a severe dust bias .
1	It has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy ( HE , 0.1-100 GeV ) gamma-rays .	Puppis A is an interesting ~4 kyr-old supernova remnant ( SNR ) that shows strong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud .	An analysis of the Fermi-LAT data has shown an extended HE gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 GeV spectrum exhibiting no significant deviation from a power law , unlike most of the GeV-emitting SNRs known to be interacting with molecular clouds .	This makes it a promising target for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes ( IACTs ) to probe the gamma-ray emission above 100 GeV .	Very-high-energy ( VHE , E & gt ; = 0.1 TeV ) gamma-ray emission from Puppis A is for the first time searched for with the High Energy Stereoscopic System ( H.E.S.S . ) .
0	We describe a new method for summarizing similarities and differences in a pair of related documents using a graph representation for text .	Concepts denoted by words , phrases , and proper names in the document are represented positionally as nodes in the graph along with edges corresponding to semantic relations between items .	Given a perspective in terms of which the pair of documents is to be summarized , the algorithm first uses a spreading activation technique to discover , in each document , nodes semantically related to the topic .	The activated graphs of each document are then matched to yield a graph corresponding to similarities and differences between the pair , which is rendered in natural language .	An evaluation of these techniques has been carried out .
1	In doing this , we consider the possibility of analyzing networks where the diagonal of the adjacency matrix is structured , that is , has a fixed number of nonzero entries .	Having in mind the large-scale analysis of gene regulatory networks , we review a graph decimation algorithm , called `` leaf-removal '' , which can be used to evaluate the feedback in a random graph ensemble .	We test these ideas on a network model with fixed degree , using both numerical and analytical calculations .	Our results are the following .	First , the leaf-removal behavior for large system size enables to distinguish between different regimes of feedback .
2	We found that students were more engaged with videos that supported laboratory activities than with videos that presented lecture content .	The advent of MOOCs has stimulated interest in using online videos to deliver content in university courses .	We examined student engagement with 78 online videos that we created and were incorporated into a one-semester blended introductory mechanics course at the Georgia Institute of Technology .	In particular , the percentage of students accessing laboratory videos was consistently greater than 80 percent throughout the semester while the percentage of students accessing lecture videos dropped to less than 40 percent by the end of the term .	Moreover , students were more likely to access the entirety of a laboratory video than a lecture video .
4	We demonstrate how cupolets from two interacting chaotic systems may be induced into a state of mutual and self-sustaining stabilization , in a manner that may be an analog of quantum entanglement .	This paper discusses applications of a particular control technique that can be used to very efficiently stabilize a chaotic system onto a large subset of the unstable periodic orbits that are typically embedded in the system .	The control method is adapted from one developed by Hayes , Grebogi , and Ott , and the resulting ( stabilized ) orbits are known as cupolets ( Chaotic , Unstable , Periodic , Orbit-LETS ) .	Cupolets exhibit the interesting property that a given set of controls will uniquely identify a cupolet , independent of its initial condition .	Practical applications of cupolets already include data compression , secure communication , and image processing .
3	Under this account , cultural change is unbiased : for instance , vocabulary , baby names and pottery designs have been found to spread through random copying .	Human communication systems , such as language , evolve culturally ; their components undergo reproduction and variation .	However , a role for selection in cultural evolutionary dynamics is less clear .	Often neutral evolution ( also known as 'drift ' ) models , are used to explain the evolution of human communication systems , and cultural evolution more generally .	While drift is the null hypothesis for models of cultural evolution it does not always adequately explain empirical results .
4	The EOS parameters are decorrelated by diagonalizing the covariance matrix .	The behavior of the dark energy equation of state ( EOS ) is crucial in distinguishing different cosmological models .	With a model independent approach , we constrain the possible evolution of the dark energy EOS .	Gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) of redshifts up to $ z & gt ; 6 $ are used , in addition to type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) .	We separate the redshifts into 4 bins and assume a constant EOS parameter for dark energy in each bin .
0	Laboratory astrophysics and complementary theoretical calculations are the foundations of astronomy and astrophysics and will remain so into the foreseeable future .	The impact of laboratory astrophysics ranges from the scientific conception stage for ground-based , airborne , and space-based observatories , all the way through to the scientific return of these projects and missions .	It is our understanding of the under-lying physical processes and the measurements of critical physical parameters that allows us to address fundamental questions in astronomy and astrophysics .	In this regard , laboratory astrophysics is much like detector and instrument development at NASA , NSF , and DOE .	These efforts are necessary for the success of astronomical research being funded by the agencies .
0	The electron addition spectrum A^+ ( k , omega ) is obtained analytically for the one-dimensional ( 1D ) supersymmetric t-J model with 1/r^2 interaction .	The result is obtained first for a small-sized system and its validity is checked against the numerical calculation .	Then the general expression is found which is valid for arbitrary size of the system .	The thermodynamic limit of A^+ ( k , omega ) has a simple analytic form with contributions from one spinon , one holon and one antiholon all of which obey fractional statistics .	The upper edge of A^+ ( k , omega ) in the ( k , omega ) plane includes a delta-function peak which reduces to that of the single-electron band in the low-density limit .
0	Complex period variations of five W UMa type binaries ( AB And , OO Aql , DK Cyg , V566 Oph , U Peg ) were investigated by analyzing their O -- C diagrams , and several common features were found .	Four of the five systems show secular period variations at a constant rate on the order of |dP / dt 1/P | ~ 10E-7 1/yr .	In the case of AB And , OO Aql , and U Peg a high-amplitude , nearly one-century long quasi-sinusoidal pattern was also found .	It might be explained as light-time effect , or by some magnetic phenomena , although the mathematical , and consequently the physical , parameters of these fits are very problematic , as the obtained periods are very close to the length of the total data range .	The most interesting feature of the studied O -- C diagrams is a low amplitude ( 2-4 x 10E-3 d ) modulation with a period around 18 -- 20 yr in four of the five cases .
0	In a recent work , a model of gauge mediation with sequestered supersymmetry ( SUSY ) breaking was proposed .	In this model , the mass of the gravitino is O ( 100 ) GeV without causing the flavor-changing neutral-current problem .	In contrast to traditional gauge mediation , the gravitino is not the lightest SUSY particle and the neutralino is the candidate of the dark matter .	In this paper , we investigate phenomenological aspects of this model and discuss the possibility of the direct detection of the dark matter .	In particular , we focus on the light neutralino case and find that the light-Higgsino scenario such as the focus point is interesting , taking account of the recent CDMS result .
0	We investigate a dynamically generated Mott gap from holographic fermions in asymptotically geometries with hyperscaling violation by employing a bulk dipole coupling for the fermion field .	We find that when the coupling strength increases the spectral function first transfers to the negative frequency region but soon redistributes to the positive region .	A stable gap and two bands emerges for all momentum when the coupling strength beyonds a critical value .	Generally , The upper band on the positive frequency axis is much sharper than the lower band on the negative side .	When the diploe coupling increases further , the gap becomes larger and the up band still keeps sharp while the lower band disperses and widens , concentrating on the small momentum region .
4	For this , we show diagonal covariance matrices are sum-rate optimal for strong and mixed TPGICs .	The separability in parallel Gaussian interference channels ( PGICs ) is studied in this paper .	We generalize the separability results in one-sided PGICs ( OPGICs ) by Sung \emph { et al . }	to two-sided PGICs ( TPGICs ) .	Specifically , for strong and mixed TPGICs , we show necessary and sufficient conditions for the separability .
4	In the absence of thermal fluctuations , the stable dynamical state is predominantly formed by the eigenmode with longest relaxation time .	Colloidal particles moving in a fluid interact via the induced velocity field .	The collective dynamic state for a class of actively forced colloids , driven by harmonic potentials via a rule that couples forces to configurations , to perform small oscillations around an average position , is shown by experiment , simulation and theoretical arguments to be determined by the eigenmode structure of the coupling matrix .	It is remarkable that the dynamical state can therefore be predicted from the mean spatial configuration of the active colloids , or from an analysis of the fluctuations near equilibrium .	This has the surprising consequence that while 2 particles , or polygonal arrays of 4 or more colloids , synchronize with the nearest neighbors in anti-phase , a system of 3 equally spaced colloids synchronizes in-phase .
1	Critical temperature $ T_ { \rm c } $ is precisely determined by finite-size scaling analysis .	Ferromagnetic transition in three-dimensional double-exchange models is studied by the Monte Carlo method .	Strong spin fluctuations in this itinerant system significantly reduce $ T_ { \rm c } $ from mean-field estimates .	By choosing appropriate parameters , obtained values of $ T_ { \rm c } $ quantitatively agree with experiments for the ferromagnetic metal regime of ( La , Sr ) MnO $ _ { 3 } $ , which is a typical perovskite manganite showing colossal magnetoresistance .	This indicates that the double-exchange mechanism alone is sufficient to explain $ T_ { \rm c } $ in this material .
3	Examples are given to show how $ F_q $ can be obtained for positive and negative values of $ q $ .	The normalized factorial moments $ F_q $ are continued to noninteger values of the order $ q $ , satisfying the condition that the statistical fluctuations remain filtered out .	That is , for Poisson distribution $ F_q = 1 $ for all $ q $ .	The continuation procedure is designed with phenomenology and data analysis in mind .	With $ q $ being continuous , multifractal analysis is made possible for multiplicity distributions that arise from self-similar dynamics .
1	The formalism is applied in various situations and emphasis is put on the momentum representation .	The Bethe-Peierls asymptotic approach which models pairwise short-range forces by contact conditions is introduced in arbitrary representation for spatial dimensions less than or equal to 3 .	In the presence of a transverse harmonic confinement , dimensional reduction toward two-dimensional ( 2D ) or one-dimensional ( 1D ) physics is derived within this formalism .	The energy theorem relating the mean energy of an interacting system to the asymptotic behavior of the one-particle density matrix illustrates the method in its second quantized form .	Integral equations that encapsulate the Bethe-Peierls contact condition for few-body systems are derived .
3	Since the IN covers a substantial faction of the solar surface , it may account for most of the unsigned magnetic flux and energy existing on the solar surface at any given time .	When the polarimetric sensitivity and the angular resolution exceed a threshold , magnetic fields show up almost everywhere on the solar surface .	Here I revise the observational properties of the weakest polarization signals , which appear in the InterNetwork ( IN ) regions .	We already have some information on the magnetic field strengths and inclinations , mass motions , lifetimes , magnetic fluxes , magnetic energies , etc .	This fact makes IN fields potentially important to understand the global magnetic properties of the Sun ( e.g. , the structure of the quiet solar corona , an issue briefly addressed here ) .
2	Essentially the only algorithm known previously was for the special case of binary answers , as follows from the work of Tsirelson in 1980 .	We consider one-round games between a classical verifier and two provers who share entanglement .	We show that when the constraints enforced by the verifier are `unique ' constraints ( i.e. , permutations ) , the value of the game can be well approximated by a semidefinite program .	Among other things , our result implies that the variant of the unique games conjecture where we allow the provers to share entanglement is false .	Our proof is based on a novel `quantum rounding technique ' , showing how to take a solution to an SDP and transform it to a strategy for entangled provers .
1	The impurity couples to both spin and charge degrees of freedom and has the interesting feature that the interaction with the bulk can be varied continuously without losing integrability .	We study the effects of an integrable impurity in a periodic t-J chain .	We first consider ground state properties close to half-filling in the presence of a small bulk magnetic field .	We calculate the impurity contributions to the ( zero temperature ) susceptibilities and the low temperature specific heat and determine the high-temperature characteristics of the impurity .	We then investigate transport properties by computing the spin and charge stiffnesses at zero temperature .
3	As a principled and general temporal formulation , we propose a dynamical state space model of matrix factorization .	Matrix factorization from a small number of observed entries has recently garnered much attention as the key ingredient of successful recommendation systems .	One unresolved problem in this area is how to adapt current methods to handle changing user preferences over time .	Recent proposals to address this issue are heuristic in nature and do not fully exploit the time-dependent structure of the problem .	Our proposal builds upon probabilistic matrix factorization , a Bayesian model with Gaussian priors .
3	This paper establishes the equivalence of a deformed theory with that in a nearby state space in the bundle via a connection that defines maps between nearby state spaces .	There are two methods to study families of conformal theories in the operator formalism .	In the first method we begin with a theory and a family of deformed theories is defined in the state space of the original theory .	In the other there is a distinct state space for each theory in the family , with the collection of spaces forming a vector bundle .	We find that an appropriate connection for establishing equivalence is one that arose in a recent paper by Kugo and Zwiebach .
4	Interestingly , the ionizing continuum must be harder than the observed one .	The recent report of iron line features in the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) 991216 has important implications for the properties of the radiating material and hence the nature of the immediate burst environment .	We argue that the putative strong Fe emission line can be attributed to the reflected emission from Thomson-thick matter which is illuminated by a power-law continuum .	The ionization parameter of the material ( i.e. , the flux to density ratio ) is around 10^3 , resulting in a Fe K line from He-like iron .	A supersolar abundance of iron is not required by the data .
4	Measuring dust emission directly from these galaxies is thus a more accurate way to estimate the total dust mass , giving us real physical information on the stellar populations and interstellar medium ( ISM ) enrichment .	Recent results have shown that a substantial fraction of high-redshift Lyman alpha galaxies contain considerable amounts of dust .	This implies that Lyman alpha galaxies are not primordial , as has been thought in the past .	However , this dust has not been directly detected in emission ; rather it has been inferred based on extinction estimates from rest-frame ultraviolet ( UV ) and optical observations .	This can be tricky , as both dust and old stars redden galactic spectra at the wavelengths used to infer dust .
0	We present a catalogue of 18 new Galactic supernova remnants ( SNRs ) uncovered in the optical regime as filamentary emissions and extended nebulosities on images of the Anglo Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope ( AAO/UKST ) HAlpha survey of the southern Galactic plane .	Our follow-up spectral observations confirmed classical optical SNR emission lines for these 18 structures via detection of very strong [ SII ] at 6717 and 6731A relative to HAlpha ( [ SII ] /HAlpha & gt ; 0.5 ) .	Morphologically , 10 of these remnants have coherent , extended arc or shell structures , while the remaining objects are more irregular in form but clearly filamentary in nature , typical of optically detected SNRs .	In 11 cases there was a clear if not complete match between the optical and radio structures with H filamentary structures registered inside and along the presumed radio borders .	Additionally , ROSAT X-ray sources were detected inside the optical/radio borders of 11 of these new remnants and 3 may have an associated pulsar .
2	Cosmological , magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters are used to show that for a magnetic field of cosmic origin this correlation is expected and excellently reproduces the observations showing that the RMS scatter of the Faraday rotation increases linearly with the X-ray surface brightness .	We present a correlation between X-ray surface brightness and Faraday rotation measure in galaxy clusters , both , from radio and X-ray observations as well as from modeling of the intra-cluster medium .	The observed correlation rules out a magnetic field of constant strength throughout the cluster .	From the correlation between the observable quantities , rotation measure and X-ray surface brightness , we infer a relation between the physical quantities : magnetic field and gas density .	For the best available observations , those of A119 , we find $ B \propto n_e^ { 0.9 } $ .
0	The correlation between distant Gamma-Ray Bursts ( GRBs ) and foreground galaxy clusters is re-examined by using the well localized ( with an accuracy down to a few arcseconds ) Swift/XRT GRBs .	The galaxy clusters are compiled from both X-ray selected ROSAT brightest cluster sample ( BCS ) and BCS extension by requiring $ \delta \geq0\degr $ and $ b\geq20\degr $ .	The Swift/XRT GRBs fulfilling the above selection criteria are cross-correlated with the clusters .	Both Nearest-Neighbor Analysis and angular two-point cross-correlation function show that there is no enough evidence supporting the correlation between the GRBs and foreground clusters .	We suggest that the non-correlation is probably related to the GRB number-flux relation slope .
3	In particular this conjecture predicts that a single concrete algorithm provides optimal guarantees among all efficient algorithms for a large class of computational problems .	In order to obtain the best-known guarantees , algorithms are traditionally tailored to the particular problem we want to solve .	Two recent developments , the Unique Games Conjecture ( UGC ) and the Sum-of-Squares ( SOS ) method , surprisingly suggest that this tailoring is not necessary and that a single efficient algorithm could achieve best possible guarantees for a wide range of different problems .	The Unique Games Conjecture ( UGC ) is a tantalizing conjecture in computational complexity , which , if true , will shed light on the complexity of a great many problems .	The Sum-of-Squares ( SOS ) method is a general approach for solving systems of polynomial constraints .
0	Analyzing two standard preparators , the Stern-Gerlach and the hole-in-the-screen ones , it is demonstrated that four entities are the basic ingredients of the theory : the composite-system preparator-plus-object state ( coming about as a result of a suitable interaction between the subsystems ) , a suitable preparator observable , one of its characteristic projectors called the triggering event , and , finally , the conditional object state corresponding to the occurrence of the triggering event .	The concepts of a conditional state and of retrospective apparent ideal occurrence are discussed in the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics .	In the general theory of a preparator in this interpretation first-kind and second-kind preparators are distinguished .	They are described by the same entities in the same way , but in terms of different physical mechanisms .	In this article the relative-collapse interpretation is extended to encompass also preparators ( besides measuring apparatuses ) .
4	We discuss the possible orbits for massive and massless test particles and classify them according to the particle 's energy and angular momentum .	We study the geodesic motion of test particles in the space-time of non-compact boson stars .	These objects are made of a self-interacting scalar field and -- depending on the scalar field 's mass -- can be as dense as neutron stars or even black holes .	In contrast to the former these objects do not contain a well-defined surface , while in contrast to the latter the space-time of boson stars is globally regular , can -- however -- only be given numerically .	Hence , the geodesic equation also has to be studied numerically .
3	Our proof extends to all generalized DCell connection rules for $ n\ge 3 $ .	DCell has been proposed for data centers as a server centric interconnection network structure .	DCell can support millions of servers with high network capacity by only using commodity switches .	With one exception , we prove that a $ k $ level DCell built with $ n $ port switches is Hamiltonian-connected for $ k \geq 0 $ and $ n \geq 2 $ .	Then , we propose an $ O ( t_k ) $ algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian path in $ DCell_ { k } $ , where $ t_k $ is the number of servers in $ DCell_ { k } $ .
1	Normally , a quantized variable is regarded as a perturbed copy of the unquantized variable in the research of quantization effect , but this model has shown many obvious disadvantages in control system analysis and design process .	Quantization problem in digital control system have attracted more and more attention in these years .	In this paper , we give a new model for quantization based 'cell mapping ' concept .	This cell model could clearly describe the global dynamics of quantized digital system .	Then some important characteristics of control system like controllability are analyzed by this model .
3	Moreover , the dynamical spin structure factors on the intra- and inter-leg correlations are calculated .	Using the ( dynamical ) density-matrix renormalization group method , we study the low-energy physics of three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model where the periodic boundary conditions are applied in the rung direction .	We confirm that the spin excitations are always gapped as long as the intra-ring couplings form a regular triangle .	From precise finite-size-scaling analyses of the spin gap and dimerization order parameter , we also find that the spin gap is collapsed by very small asymmetric modulation of the intra-ring couplings .	It is demonstrated that the low-lying structure of the inter-leg spectra is particularly affected by the asymmetric modulation .
3	We investigate the hidden conformal symmetry in the near horizon limit and consider the relation between the hidden conformal symmetry and the asymptotic symmetry in the near horizon limit .	Toward the Kerr/CFT correspondence for generic non-extremal Kerr black hole , the analysis of scattering amplitudes by near extremal Kerr provides a clue .	This pursuit reveals a hidden conformal symmetry in the law frequency wave equation for a scalar field in a certain spacetime region referred to as the near region .	For extremal case , the near region is expected to be the near horizon region in which the correspondence via the asymptotic symmetry is studied .	By using an appropriate definition of the quasi-local charge , we obtain the deviation of the entropy from the extremality .
0	Contrary to conventional wisdom that light bends away from the normal at the interface when it passes from high to low refractive index media , here we demonstrate an exotic phenomenon that the direction of electromagnetic power bends towards the normal when light is incident from arbitrary high refractive index medium to \epsilon-near-zero metamaterial .	Moreover , the direction of the transmitted beam is close to the normal for all angles of incidence .	In other words , the electromagnetic power coming from different directions in air or arbitrary high refractive index medium can be redirected to the direction almost parallel to the normal upon entering the \epsilon-near-zero metamaterial .	This phenomenon is counterintuitive to the behavior described by conventional Snell 's law and resulted from the interplay between \epsilon-near-zero and material loss .	This property has potential applications in communications to increase acceptance angle and energy delivery without using optical lenses and mechanical gimbals .
4	Depending on the assumed rotation velocity , rotation causes profound changes in the properties of young stellar populations .	The impact of new stellar evolution models with rotation on the predictions of population synthesis models is discussed .	Massive rotating stars have larger convective cores than their non-rotating counterparts , and their outer layers are chemically enriched due to increased mixing .	Together , these two effects lead to hotter and more luminous stars , in particular during later evolutionary phases .	As a result , stellar populations containing massive stars are predicted to become more luminous for a given mass and to emit more ionizing photons .
0	Near Earth Objects ( NEOs ) are fragments of remnant primitive bodies that date from the era of Solar System formation .	At present , the physical properties and origins of NEOs are poorly understood .	We have measured thermal emission from three NEOs -- ( 6037 ) 1988 EG , 1993 GD , and 2005 GL -- with Spitzer 's IRAC instrument at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 microns ( the last object was detected only at 5.8 and 8.0 microns ) .	The diameters of these three objects are 400 m , 180 m , and 160 m , respectively , with uncertainties of around 20 % ( including both observational and systematic errors ) .	For all three the geometric albedos are around 0.30 , in agreement with previous results that most NEOs are S-class asteroids .
1	The mission , conceived to understand the formation of galaxies , stars and planets from molecular hydrogen , is designed to observe the first rotational lines of the H2 molecule ( 28.2 , 17.0 , 12.3 and 9.7 micron ) over a wide field , and at high spectral resolution .	The Molecular Hydrogen Explorer , H2EX , was proposed in response to the ESA 2015 - 2025 Cosmic Vision Call as a medium class space mission with NASA and CSA participations .	H2EX can provide an inventory of warm ( & gt ; 100 K ) molecular gas in a broad variety of objects , including nearby young star clusters , galactic molecular clouds , active galactic nuclei , local and distant galaxies .	The rich array of molecular , atomic and ionic lines , as well as solid state features available in the 8 to 29 micron spectral range brings additional science dimensions to H2EX .	We present the optical and mechanical design of the H2EX payload based on an innovative Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer ( IFTS ) fed by a 1.2m telescope .
2	Truncated expansions yield asymptotic approximations for $ F ( \lambda , k ) $ as $ \lambda $ and/or $ k $ tend to unity , including the case when logarithmic singularity $ \lambda=k=1 $ is approached from any direction .	We find two convergent series expansions for Legendre 's first incomplete elliptic integral $ F ( \lambda , k ) $ in terms of recursively computed elementary functions .	Both expansions are valid at every point of the unit square $ 0 & lt ; \lambda , k & lt ; 1 $ .	Explicit error bounds are given at every order of approximation .	For the reader 's convenience we present explicit expressions for low-order approximations and numerical examples to illustrate their accuracy .
1	In an attempt to understand three-dimensional conformal field theories , we study in detail one such example -- the large $ N $ limit of the $ O ( N ) $ non-linear sigma model at its non-trivial fixed point -- in the zeta function regularization .	This talk is based on a recent paper $ ^ { 1 } $ of ours .	We study this on various three-dimensional manifolds of constant curvature of the kind $ \Sigma \times R $ ( $ \Sigma=S^1 \times S^1 , S^2 , H^2 $ ) .	This describes a quantum phase transition at zero temperature .	We illustrate that the factor that determines whether $ m=0 $ or not at the critical point in the different cases is not the `size ' of $ \Sigma $ or its Riemannian curvature , but the conformal class of the metric .
2	( ICS 2011 ) who suggested that this was a natural model for human communication , and efficient schemes for compression here could give insights into the behavior of natural languages.Kalai et al .	We consider the task of compression of information when the source of the information and the destination do not agree on the prior , i.e. , the distribution from which the information is being generated .	This setting was considered previously by Kalai et al .	gave a compression scheme with nearly optimal performance , assuming the source and destination share some uniform randomness .	In this work we explore the need for this randomness , and give some non-trivial upper bounds on the deterministic communication complexity for this problem .
1	In this paper , the background models developed for three 12.5-kg NaI ( Tl ) detectors produced by Alpha Spectra Inc. and operated at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory are presented together with an evaluation of the background prospects for the full experiment .	A large effort has been carried out to characterize the background of sodium iodide crystals within the ANAIS ( Annual modulation with NaI Scintillators ) project .	Measured spectra from threshold to high energy in different conditions are well described by the models based on quantified activities .	At the region of interest , crystal bulk contamination is the dominant background source .	Contributions from 210Pb , 40K , 22Na and 3H are the most relevant .
4	Data at multiple wavelengths are used simultaneously , taking into account possible spectral variations of the planetary signals .	The capability of the Terrestrial Planet Finder Interferometer ( TPF-I ) for planetary signal extraction , including both detection and spectral characterization , can be optimized by taking proper account of instrumental characteristics and astrophysical prior information .	We have developed the Point Process Algorithm ( PPA ) , a Bayesian technique for extracting planetary signals using the sine-chopped outputs of a dual nulling interferometer .	It is so-called because it represents the system being observed as a set of points in a suitably-defined state space , thus providing a natural way of incorporating our prior knowledge of the compact nature of the targets of interest .	It can also incorporate the spatial covariance of the exozodi as prior information which could help mitigate against false detections .
3	Applying these criteria to the WISE+2MASS sources , 1.37 million of them are selected .	In the WISE all-sky source catalogue there are 76 million mid-infrared ( MIR ) point sources that were detected at the first three WISE bands and have association with only one 2MASS near-IR source within 3 arcsec .	We search for their identifications in the SIMBAD database and find 3.2 million identified sources .	Based on these known sources , we establish three criteria for selecting candidate AGB stars in the Galaxy , which are three defined occupation zones in a color-color diagram , Galactic latitude |gb| & lt ; 20 deg , and `` corrected '' WISE third-band W3c & lt ; 11 .	We analyze the WISE third-band W3 distribution of the selected sources , and further establish that W3 & lt ; 8 is required in order to exclude a large fraction of normal stars in them .
3	The resulting algebra A has a number of curious properties ; for example it is noetherian but never strongly noetherian and the point modules are never parametrized by a projective scheme .	In an earlier paper ( D. S. Keeler , D. Rogalski , and J. T. Stafford , `` Naive noncommutative blowing up , '' Duke Math .	J. , 126 ( 2005 ) , 491-546 ) , we defined and investigated the properties of the naive blowup of an integral projective scheme X at a single closed point .	In this paper we extend those results to the case when one naively blows up X at any suitably generic zero-dimensional subscheme Z .	This is despite the fact that the category of torsion modules in the quotient category qgr A is equivalent to the category of torsion coherent sheaves over X .
3	We also show how these $ \mu $ m-size bound states can be populated { \it via } photoassociation ( PA ) , and how the signature of the ad-mixing of various $ \ell $ -character producing the potential wells could be probed .	We investigate the interaction between two rubidium atoms in highly excited Rydberg states , and find that very long-range potential wells exist .	These wells are shown to support many bound states .	We calculate the properties of the wells and bound levels , and show that their lifetimes are limited by that of the constituent Rydberg atoms .	We discuss how sharp variations of the PA rate % to macrodimer bound levels could act as a switching mechanism with potential application to quantum information processing .
0	A subparsec-scale dense plasma torus around an active galactic nucleus ( AGN ) is unveiled .	We report on very-long-baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) observations at 2.3 , 8.4 , and 15.4 GHz towards the active galaxy NGC 1052 .	The convex spectra of the double-sided jets and the nucleus imply that synchrotron emission is obscured through free -- free absorption ( FFA ) by the foreground cold dense plasma .	A trichromatic image was produced to illustrate the distribution of the FFA opacity .	We found a central condensation of the plasma which covers about 0.1 pc and 0.7 pc of the approaching and receding jets , respectively .
4	We 'll understand how the area formula incorporates the structure of the domain wall approximation .	The aim of the present letter is to find the holographic entanglement entropy ( HEE ) in 2D holographic superconductors ( HSC ) .	Indeed , it is possible to compute the exact form of this entropy due to an advantage of approximate solutions inside normal and superconducting phases with backreactions .	By making the UV and IR limits applied to the integrals , an approximate expression for HEE is obtained .	In case the software can not calculate minimal surface integrals analytically , it offers the possibility to proceed with a numerical evaluation of the corresponding terms .
1	A large family of regular solutions of these equations is shown to exist .	The Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in five dimensions is extended by scalar fields and the corresponding equations are reduced to a system of non-linear differential equations .	Generically , these solutions are spinning black holes with scalar hairs .	They can be characterized ( but not uniquely ) by an horizon and an angular velocity on this horizon .	Taking particular limits the black holes approach boson star or become extremal , in any case the limiting configurations remain hairy .
4	In addition , we also report on two general-purpose Theorema tools we developed for an efficient and convenient exploration of mathematical theories : an interactive proving strategy and a `` theory analyzer '' that already proved extremely useful when creating large structured knowledge bases .	In this paper we present the first-ever computer formalization of the theory of Gr\ '' obner bases in reduction rings , which is an important theory in computational commutative algebra , in Theorema .	Not only the formalization , but also the formal verification of all results has already been fully completed by now ; this , in particular , includes the generic implementation and correctness proof of Buchberger 's algorithm in reduction rings .	Thanks to the seamless integration of proving and computing in Theorema , this implementation can now be used to compute Gr\ '' obner bases in various different domains directly within the system .	Moreover , a substantial part of our formalization is made up solely by `` elementary theories '' such as sets , numbers and tuples that are themselves independent of reduction rings and may therefore be used as the foundations of future theory explorations in Theorema .
0	The electronic energy of $ \mathrm H_2^+ $ in magnetic fields of up to $ B=0.2B_0 $ ( or 4.7 $ \times 10^4 $ Tesla ) is investigated .	Numerical values of the magnetic susceptibility for both the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions are reported for arbitrary orientations of the molecule in the magnetic field .	It is shown that both diamagnetic and paramagnetic susceptibilities grow with inclination , while paramagnetic susceptibility is systematically much smaller than the diamagnetic one .	Accurate two-dimensional Born-Oppenheimer surfaces are obtained with special trial functions .	Using these surfaces , vibrational and rotational states are computed and analysed for the isotopologues $ \mathrm H_2^+ $ and $ \mathrm D_2^+ $ .
2	We find that non-linear phase modulation effects will be detrimental , and will limit the quantum interference visibility that can be achieved at a given generation rate .	We consider the effect of self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation on the joint spectral amplitude of photon pairs generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing .	In particular , the purity of a heralded photon from a pair is considered , in the context of schemes that aim to maximise the purity and minimise correlation in the joint spectral amplitude using birefringent phase-matching and short pump pulses .	An approximate expression for the joint spectral amplitude with phase modulation is found by considering the group velocity walk-off between each photon and the pump , but neglecting the group-velocity dispersion at each wavelength .	The group-velocity dispersion can also be included with a numerical calculation , and it is shown that it only has a small effect on the purity for the realistic parameters considered .
3	In this canonical and double-linear seesaw scenario , we can expect one sterile neutrino at the eV scale and the other two above the MeV scale to fit the cosmological and short baseline neutrino oscillation data .	We consider an SU ( 3 ) '_c\times SU ( 2 ) '_L\times U ( 1 ) '_Y mirror sector where the field content and dimensionless couplings are a copy of the SU ( 3 ) _c\times SU ( 2 ) _L\times U ( 1 ) _Y ordinary sector .	Our model also contains three gauge-singlet fermions with heavy Majorana masses and an [ SU ( 2 ) _L\times SU ( 2 ) '_L ] -bidoublet Higgs scalar with seesaw-suppressed vacuum expectation value .	The mirror sterile neutrino masses will have a form of canonical seesaw while the ordinary active neutrino masses will have a form of double and linear seesaw .	Associated with the SU ( 2 ) _L and SU ( 2 ) '_L sphaleron processes , the decays of the fermion singlets can simultaneously generate a lepton asymmetry in the [ SU ( 2 ) _L ] -doublet leptons and an equal lepton asymmetry in the [ SU ( 2 ) '_L ] -doublet leptons to explain the existence of baryonic and dark matter .
4	We show that these `` kicks '' to the chameleon field have catastrophic consequences for chameleon gravity .	Chameleon gravity is a scalar-tensor theory that includes a non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and the matter fields and yet mimics general relativity in the Solar System .	The scalar degree of freedom is hidden in high-density environments because the effective mass of the chameleon scalar depends on the trace of the stress-energy tensor .	In the early Universe , when the trace of the matter stress-energy tensor is nearly zero , the chameleon is very light , and Hubble friction prevents it from reaching the minimum of its effective potential .	Whenever a particle species becomes non-relativistic , however , the trace of the stress-energy tensor is temporarily nonzero , and the chameleon begins to roll .

0	Majorana fermion representations of the algebra associated with spin , charge , and flavor currents have been used to transform the two-channel Kondo Hamiltonian .	Using a path integral formulation , we derive a reduced effective action with long-range impurity spin-spin interactions at different imaginary times .	In the semiclassical limit , it is equivalent to a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain with two-spin , three-spin , etc .	long-range interactions , as a generalization of the inverse-square long-range Haldane-Shastry spin model .	In this representation the elementary excitations are `` semions '' , and the non-Fermi-liquid low-energy properties of the two-channel Kondo model are recovered .
3	This study presents the theory of interference contribution to magnetoresistance that explicitly includes effects of both frozen and free electron spins .	Despite the fact that the problem of interference mechanism of magnetoresistance in semiconductors with hopping conductivity was widely discussed , most of existing studies were focused on the model of spinless electrons .	This model can be justified only when all electron spins are frozen .	However there is always an admixture of free spins in the semiconductor .	We consider the cases of small and large number of scatterers in the hopping event .
3	We study a set of simple scenarios where the variability is produced by injection of relativistic electrons as a `shock front ' crosses the emission region .	( abridged ) We present a new time-dependent multi-zone radiative transfer code and its application to study the SSC emission of Mrk 421 .	The code couples Fokker-Planck and Monte Carlo methods , in a 2D geometry .	For the first time all the light travel time effects ( LCTE ) are fully considered , along with a proper treatment of Compton cooling , which depends on them .	We consider emission from two components , with the second one either being pre-existing and co-spatial and participating in the evolution of the active region , or spatially separated and independent , only diluting the observed variability .
3	In this work we analyze if and how MUVEs can be considered a mean for augmenting communities ( and more in general people ) life .	The necessity of supporting more and more social interaction ( and not only the mere information sharing ) in online environments is the disruptive force upon which phenomena ascribed to the Web2.0 paradigm continuously bud .	People interacting in online socio-technical environments mould technology on their needs , seamlessly integrating it into their everyday life .	MUVEs ( Multi User Virtual Environments ) are no exception and , in several cases , represent the new frontier in this field .	We trace a framework of analysis based on four main observations , and through these lenses we look at Second Life and at several projects we are currently developing in that synthetic world .
2	A thorough analysis was performed through the simultaneous fit of interstellar absorption lines detected in the four FUSE channels of multiple observations with different slits .	We present a deuterium abundance analysis of the line of sight toward the white dwarf WD2211-495 observed with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer ( FUSE ) .	Numerous interstellar lines are detected on the continuum of the stellar spectrum .	We excluded all saturated lines in order to reduce possible systematic errors on the column density measurements .	We report the determination of the average interstellar D/O and D/N ratios along this line of sight at the 95 % confidence level : D/O = 4.0 +/-1.2 *10^-2 ; D/N = 4.4 +/-1.3 *10^-1 .
2	For appropriate bath temperatures and the resonator 's quality factors , we demonstrate effective cooling below the thermal background .	The cooling effects of a nonlinear quantum oscillator via its interaction with an artificial atom ( qubit ) are investigated .	The quantum dissipations through the environmental reservoir of the nonlinear oscillator are included , taking into account the nonlinearity of the qubit-oscillator interaction .	As the photon coherence functions behave differently for even and odd photon number states , we describe a mechanism distinguishing those states .	The analytical formalism developed is general and can be applied to a wide range of systems .
2	We concentrate on the case where an exponential warp factor ( depending on the distance along the orbifold ) accompanies the Minkowski $ M $ and the internal space $ \Sigma $ line elements .	We consider a class of warped higher dimensional brane models with topology $ M \times \Sigma \times S^1/Z_2 $ , where $ \Sigma $ is a $ D_2 $ dimensional manifold .	Two branes of codimension one are embedded in such a bulk space-time and sit at the orbifold fixed points .	We evaluate the moduli effective potential induced by bulk scalar fields in these models , and we show that generically this can stabilize the size of the extra dimensions .	As an application , we consider a scenario where supersymmetry is broken not far below the cutoff scale , and the hierarchy between the electroweak and the effective Planck scales is generated by a combination of redshift and large volume effects .
2	Watermark remains in the content after applying various attacks without any distortions .	Insertion of a text message , audio data or/and an image into another image or 3D model is called as a watermarking process .	Watermarking has variety of applications like : Copyright Protection , Owner Identification , Copy Protection and Data Hiding etc. , depending upon the type of watermark insertion algorithm .	The blind watermarking method used in the system is based on a wavelet transform , a fuzzy inference system and a multi-resolution representation ( MRR ) of the 3d model .	The watermark scrambled by Arnold Transform is embedded in the wavelet coefficients at third resolution level of the MRR .
2	In this companion paper , we shall extend our study to the entire $ { \rm psu } ( 2,2|4 ) $ sector and obtain several important generalizations .	As a step toward uncovering the relation between the weak and the strong coupling regimes of the $ \mathcal { N } =4 $ super Yang-Mills theory beyond the specral level , we have developed in a previous paper [ arXiv:1410.8533 ] a novel group theoretic interpretation of the Wick contraction of the fields , which allowed us to compute a much more general class of three-point functions in the SU ( 2 ) sector , as in the case of strong coupling [ arXiv:1312.3727 ] , directly in terms of the determinant representation of the partial domain wall partition funciton .	Furthermore , we derived a non-trivial identity for the three point functions with monodromy operators inserted , being the discrete counterpart of the global monodromy condition which played such a crucial role in the computation at strong coupling .	They include in particular ( i ) the manifestly conformally covariant construction , from the basic principle , of the singlet-projection operator for performing the Wick contraction and ( ii ) the derivation of the monodromy relation for the case of the so-called `` harmonic R-matrix '' , as well as for the usual fundamental R-matrtix .	The former case , which is new and has features rather different from the latter , is expected to have important applications .
1	A major asset of the experiment is the use of a wire mesh fence around the rim-halo shielded antenna with the purpose of levelling out and reducing this source of stray radiation for zenith-centered 1-rpm circular scans .	We have analyzed observations from a radioastronomical experiment to survey the sky at decimetric wavelengths along with feed pattern measurements in order to account for the level of ground contamination entering the sidelobes .	We investigate the shielding performance of the experiment by means of a geometric diffraction model in order to predict the level of the spillover and diffraction sidelobes in the direction of the ground .	Using 408 MHz and 1465 MHz feed measurements , the model shows how a weakly-diffracting and unshielded antenna configuration becomes strongly-diffracting and double-shielded as far-field diffraction effects give way to near-field ones .	Due to the asymmetric response of the feeds , the orientation of their radiation fields with respect to the secondary must be known a priori before comparing model predictions with observational data .
3	The N variations are not predicted by standard stellar evolution models .	New abundances of N , O , Na , Mg , Si , Ca , Sc , Ti , Cr , Fe , Sr , Zr , and Ba are presented for 10 A-type supergiants in the SMC , plus upper limits for C. In interpreting the CNO results for constraints on stellar evolution theories , careful attention has been paid to the comparison abundances , i.e. , the present day abundances of SMC nebulae and B-dwarf stars .	These new results are also compared to published results from F-K supergiant analyses , and found to be in good agreement when both sets of data are carefully examined as differential ( SMC minus Galactic standard ) abundances .	With the exception of nitrogen , very small star-to-star abundance variations are found for all elements in this analysis .	Instead , the results support the new predictions reported from rotating stellar models , where the range in nitrogen is the result of partial mixing of CN-cycled gas from the stellar interior due to main-sequence rotation at different rates ( c.f. , Langer & amp ; Heger 1998 ) .
3	In all cases , the phase space is foliated by a biquadratic curve in the dynamical variables ( and a set of suitably chosen angular momentum variables ) .	The McMillan map is a well-known example of a rational integrable system for one particle in a two-dimensional phase space .	An elegant recent paper presented a generalization of the McMillan map to an $ N $ -body system , for particles moving in $ d $ space dimensions .	This paper presents some alternative generalizations ( also completely integrable ) of the McMillan map to $ N $ -body systems .	It is also demonstrated that the constraints to generalize the McMillan map to $ N $ -body systems are not trivial .
3	These techniques are based on the detection of the light intensity near to the sample , where light scattered at different directions overlaps but can be distinguished by Fourier transform analysis .	Light scattering techniques are widely used in many fields of condensed and sof t matter physics .	Usually these methods are based on the study of the scattered light in the far field .	Recently , a new family of near field detection schemes has been developed , mainly for the study of small angle light scattering .	Here we report for the first time data obtained with a dynamic near field scattering instrument , measuring both polarized and depolarized scattered light .
3	For the purposes of the coastal forecasts and early warnings in case of severe storms we decided to implement SWAN ( Simulating the Waves Near Shore ) - development of TU- DELFT .	The paper describes the existing operational sea state forecast system of NIMH- BAS for sea state in the Black Sea and our current progress on the implementation of an additional component for the forecasts of wind waves in the Bulgarian coastal zone .	Wind Waves and especially the extreme ones , occurring during severe storms are a major hazard for the coastal zone , causing significant damages to the infrastructure , threat for the human lives and also causing significant damages to the protected areas around the coast .	The numerical model WAVEWATCH III is in use for wind waves forecasts for the entire Black Sea with horizontal resolution of 1/8 degree ( roughly 14 kilometers ) , which is sufficient for the open Sea , but not enough for a detailed coastal forecast .	In this paper we will describe the brief details about the coastal sea state forecasting system of NIMH- BAS and a case study of the storm of 07-08 February 2012 , which is the severest storm in our coastal area for the last decade ( and probably longer period ) .
4	The poles in the unitarized scattering amplitude are studied in some detail .	Pion pion scattering is studied in a generalized linear sigma model which contains two scalar nonets ( one of quark-antiquark type and the other of diquark-antidiquark type ) and two corresponding pseudoscalar nonets .	An interesting feature concerns the mixing of the four isosinglet scalar mesons which yield poles in the scattering amplitude .	Some realism is introduced by enforcing exact unitarity via the K-matrix method .	It is shown that a reasonable agreement with experimental data is obtained up to about 1 GeV .
3	$ R^p $ -valued random variables $ X_1^p , X_2^p , ... $ with radial laws corresponding to $ \nu $ as above .	The radial probability measures on $ R^p $ are in a one-to-one correspondence with probability measures on $ [ 0 , \infty [ $ by taking images of measures w.r.t .	the Euclidean norm mapping .	For fixed $ \nu\in M^1 ( [ 0 , \infty [ ) $ and each dimension p , we consider i.i.d .	We derive weak and strong laws of large numbers as well as a large deviation principle for the Euclidean length processes $ S_k^p : =\|X_1^p+ ... +X_k^p\| $ as k , p\to\infty in suitable ways .
4	We demonstrate that estimates for the dynamical mass of young star clusters , derived from the observed velocity dispersion , exceed the photometric mass by up-to a factor of 10 and are consistent with a constant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion .	Many young extra-galactic clusters have a measured velocity dispersion that is too high for the mass derived from their age and total luminosity , which has led to the suggestion that they are not in virial equilibrium .	Most of these clusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 Myr because of observational constraints .	At this age the cluster light is dominated by luminous evolved stars , such as red supergiants , with initial masses of ~13-22 Msun for which ( primordial ) binarity is high .	In this study we investigate to what extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the orbital motions of binaries .
2	The main tools to study Delta g/g in lepton-nucleon scattering are scaling violations of the g_1 structure functions and longitudinal spin asymmetries in hadron production .	Our present information on the gluon polarisation Delta g/g is reviewed .	The data from fixed-target lepton-nucleon experiments are in context with the recent data from the RHIC polarised pp collider .	Results from high-p_T hadron pairs , inclusive hadrons as well as open-charm production are discussed .	At RHIC the most precise data presently came from inclusive pi^0 and jet production .
1	In this contribution , we compare Kerner 's three-phase traffic theory with the phase diagram approach for traffic models with a fundamental diagram .	Despite the availability of large empirical data sets and the long history of traffic modeling , the theory of traffic congestion on freeways is still highly controversial .	We discuss the inconsistent use of the term `` traffic phase '' and show that patterns demanded by three-phase traffic theory can be reproduced with simple two-phase models , if the model parameters are suitably specified and factors characteristic for real traffic flows are considered , such as effects of noise or heterogeneity or the actual freeway design ( e.g.combinations of off- and on-ramps ) .	Conversely , we demonstrate that models created to reproduce three-phase traffic theory create similar spatiotemporal traffic states and associated phase diagrams , no matter whether the parameters imply a fundamental diagram in equilibrium or non-unique flow- density relationships .	In conclusion , there are different ways of reproducing the empirical stylized facts of spatiotemporal congestion patterns summarized in this contribution , and it appears possible to overcome the controversy by a more precise definition of the scientific terms and a more careful comparison of models and data , considering effects of the measurement process and the right level of detail in the traffic model used .
1	Utilizing the constrained parameters in these well measured decay channels , we study most of the possible charmless $ B_s \to PP $ , $ PV $ and $ VV $ decay channels in the perturbative QCD approach .	We review the perturbative QCD approach study of hadronic B decays .	In addition to the branching ratios and CP asymmetries , we also give predictions to the polarization fractions of the vector meson final states .	The size of SU ( 3 ) breaking effect is also discussed .	These predictions can be tested by the future LHCb experiment .
3	By adjusting the current in each wire , a matrix can create versatile magnetic field patterns on microscopic length scale .	Micromanipulation of magnetotactic bacteria with a microelectromagnet matrix was demonstrated .	Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize a chain of magnetic nanoparticles inside their body to guide their motion in the geomagnetic field .	A microelectromagnet matrix consists of two arrays of lithographically patterned wires , one array perpendicular to the other , that are separated and covered by insulating layers .	Using a matrix , magnetotactic bacteria were trapped , continuously moved , rotated , and assembled in water at room temperature .
1	We have studied the frequency-dependent conductivity of phosphorus-doped silicon in the THz frequency range ( 30 GHz to 3 THz ) at low temperatures $ T\geq 1.8 $ K. The crossover in the optical conductivity from a linear to a quadratic frequency dependence as predicted by Efros and Shklovskii is observed qualitatively ; however , the simple model does not lead to a quantitative agreement .	Electronic transport in highly doped but still insulating silicon at low temperatures is dominated by hopping between localized states ; it serves as a model system of a disordered solid for which the electronic interaction can be investigated .	Covering a large range of donor concentration , our temperature- and frequency-dependent investigations reveal that electronic correlation effects between the localized states play an important and complex role at low temperatures .	In particular we find a super-linear frequency dependence of the conductivity that highlights the influence of the density of states , i.e.the Coulomb gap , on the optical conductivity .	When approaching the metal-to-insulator transition by increasing doping concentration , the dielectric constant and the localization length exhibit critical behavior .
3	Thoroughly examining current flavor constraints we find that non-minimal flavor structures can have a sizeable impact , but tend to predict moderate production rates .	A charged Higgs boson is a clear signal for an extended Higgs sector , as for example predicted by supersymmetry .	Squark mixing can significantly change the pattern of charged-Higgs production and most notably circumvent the chiral suppression for single Higgs production .	We evaluate the LHC discovery potential in the light of flavor physics , in the single-Higgs production channel and in association with a hard jet for small and moderate values of tan beta .	Nevertheless , charged-Higgs searches will probe flavor structures not accessible to rare kaon , bottom , or charm experiments , and can invalidate the assumption of minimal flavor violation .
2	We implement it in the radiation hydrodynamics solver we designed for the RAMSES code for astrophysical purposes and , more particularly , for protostellar collapse .	Implicit solvers present strong limitations when used on supercomputing facilities and in particular for adaptive mesh-refinement codes .	We present a new method for implicit adaptive time-stepping on adaptive mesh refinement-grids .	We briefly recall the radiation hydrodynamics equations and the adaptive time-stepping methodology used for hydrodynamical solvers .	We then introduce the different types of boundary conditions ( Dirichlet , Neumann , and Robin ) that are used at the interface between levels and present our implementation of the new method in the RAMSES code .
0	We consider an interaction of charged bodies under the following simplified conditions : the distribution of charge over each body is stable ; the interaction of bodies is governed by electrical forces only .	Physically , these assumptions can be treated as the following decomposition of charges : the structure of each body is assumed to be stable due to inner forces ( say , quantum forces [ 1 ] ) , which do not influence the interaction of the bodies ; the bodies interact due to the classical electrical forces [ 2 ] only .	In this model , the role of inner forces is to create a specific stable distribution of the charge over a body .	We assume that the charge distribution over a body can be described by the density of the charge .	In our model , the distribution of the charge is the property of a body and does not change in the process of the bodies ' interaction .
4	I argue that this effect is invisible to any local observer , and thus does not constitute a relaxation of the cosmological constant in the normal sense of the term .	This paper presents an exact solution to the long wavelength perturbations for the scalar modes and for a scalar field theory with arbitrary potential .	Locally these modes are coordinate transformations of the homogeneous background solutions ( although non-locally they are not ) .	These solutions are then used to discuss a couple of recent papers in which such perturbations play a role .	Abramo , Brandenberger , and Mukhanov have recently argued that long wavelength perturbations have the effect of driving the cosmological constant to zero if the higher order perturbation equation are examined .
0	We examine an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector coupled to a scalar field in three-dimensional curved spacetime .	We first obtain a regulator-free expression for the transition probability in an arbitrary Hadamard state , working within first-order perturbation theory and assuming smooth switching , and we show that both the transition probability and the instantaneous transition rate remain well defined in the sharp switching limit .	We then analyse a detector coupled to a massless conformally coupled field in the Hartle-Hawking vacua on the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole , under both transparent and reflective boundary conditions at the infinity .	A selection of stationary and freely-falling detector trajectories are examined , including the co-rotating trajectories , for which the response is shown to be thermal .	Analytic results in a number of asymptotic regimes , including those of large and small mass , are complemented by numerical results in the interpolating regimes .
2	Then we were able to make an efficient even footing comparison of the [ X/Fe ] scatter between the elements that have different number of observable spectral lines in the studied spectra .	The main goal of this work is to explore which elements carry the most information about the birth origin of stars and as such that are best suited for chemical tagging .	We explored different techniques to minimize the effect of outlier value lines in the abundances by using Ni abundances derived for 1111 FGK type stars.We evaluated how the limited number of spectral lines can affect the final chemical abundance .	We found that the most efficient way of calculating the average abundance of elements when several spectral lines are available is to use a weighted mean ( WM ) where as a weight we considered the distance from the median abundance .	This method can be effectively used without removing suspected outlier lines.We showed that when the same number of lines is used to determine chemical abundances , the [ X/Fe ] star-to-star scatter for iron group and $ \alpha $ -capture elements is almost the same .
2	Users join the system sequentially , according to the order of their desired departure times .	We consider a discrete population of users with homogeneous service demand who need to decide when to arrive to a system in which the service rate deteriorates linearly with the number of users in the system .	The users have heterogeneous desired departure times from the system , and their goal is to minimize a weighted sum of the travel time and square deviation from the desired departure times .	We model this scenario as a non-cooperative game in which each user selects his actual arrival time .	We present explicit equilibria solutions for a two-user example , namely the subgame perfect and Nash equilibria and show that multiple equilibria may exist .
1	The cluster sample used in this analysis consists of 9 optically-confirmed high-mass clusters comprising the high-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 square degrees of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 GHz .	We present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wave survey by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope .	We focus on the most massive systems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics and cosmology derived from SZ surveys .	We describe the scaling relation between cluster mass and SZ signal with a 4-parameter fit .	Marginalizing over the values of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives sigma_8 = 0.851 +/- 0.115 and w = -1.14 +/- 0.35 for a spatially-flat wCDM cosmological model with WMAP 7-year priors on cosmological parameters .
1	All the radio-interferometric , wide-field imaging methods currently belong to the mosaicking family .	After several generations of interferometers in radioastronomy , wide-field imaging at high angular resolution is today a major goal for trying to match optical wide-field performances .	Based on a 30 years old , original idea from Ekers & amp ; Rots , we aim at proposing an alternate formalism .	Starting from their ideal case , we successively evaluate the impact of the standard ingredients of interferometric imaging .	A comparison with standard nonlinear mosaicking shows that both processing schemes are not mathematically equivalent , though they both recover the sky brightness .
2	Finally , we define the notion of a relative dualizing complex of bimodules for a pair of noncommutative ring homomorphisms A \to R and B \to S , and obtain an equivalence between the R/A-semicoderived category of R-modules and the S/B-semicontraderived category of S-modules .	For a left coherent ring A with every left ideal having a countable set of generators , we show that the coderived category of left A-modules is compactly generated by the bounded derived category of finitely presented left A-modules ( reproducing a particular case of a recent result of Stovicek with our methods ) .	Furthermore , we present the definition of a dualizing complex of fp-injective modules over a pair of noncommutative coherent rings A and B , and construct an equivalence between the coderived category of A-modules and the contraderived category of B-modules .	For a homomorphism of commutative rings A\to R , we also construct a tensor structure on the R/A-semicoderived category of R-modules .	A vision of semi-infinite algebraic geometry is discussed in the introduction .
0	The dynamics of human mobility characterizes the trajectories humans follow during their daily activities and is the foundation of processes from epidemic spreading to traffic prediction and information recommendation .	In this paper , we investigate a massive data set of human activity including both online behavior of browsing websites and offline one of visiting towers based mobile terminations .	The non-Markovian character observed from both online and offline cases is suggested by the scaling law in the distribution of dwelling time at individual and collective levels , respectively .	Furthermore , we argue that the lower entropy and higher predictability in human mobility for both online and offline cases may origin from this non-Markovian character .	However , the distributions of individual entropy and predictability show the different degrees of non-Markovian character from online to offline cases .
0	One prediction of particle acceleration in the supernova remnants in the magnetic wind of exploding Wolf Rayet and Red Super Giant stars is that the final spectrum is a composition of a spectrum $ E^ { -7/3 } $ and a polar cap component of $ E^ { -2 } $ at the source .	This polar cap component contributes to the total energy content with only a few percent , but dominates the spectrum at higher energy .	The sum of both components gives spectra which curve upwards .	The upturn was predicted to occur always at the same rigidity .	An additional component of cosmic rays from acceleration by supernovae exploding into the Inter-Stellar Medium ( ISM ) adds another component for Hydrogen and for Helium .
2	We present exact analytical expressions for this effect , and also physical models and approximate expressions which give useful insights into the phenomena .	We discuss the use of electromagnetically modified absorption to achieve selective excitation in atoms : that is , the laser excitation of one transition while avoiding simultaneously exciting another transition whose frequency is the same as or close to that of the first .	The selectivity which can be achieved in the presence of electromagnetically induced transparency ( EIT ) is limited by the decoherence rate of the dark state .	When the laser frequencies are near-resonant with the single-photon atomic transitions , EIT is essential for achieving discrimination .	When the laser frequencies are far detuned , the `bright ' two-photon Raman resonance is important for achieving selective excitation , while the `dark ' resonance ( EIT ) need not be .
3	Because of this , the derived routes posses the fewest turns .	In this paper , we introduced a novel approach to computing the fewest-turn map directions or routes based on the concept of natural roads .	Natural roads are joined road segments that perceptually constitute good continuity .	This approach relies on the connectivity of natural roads rather than that of road segments for computing routes or map directions .	However , what we intend to achieve are the routes that not only possess the fewest turns , but are also as short as possible .
2	The popularity of the field as well as a substantial academic interest in linear systems with sparse solutions are in a significant part due to seminal results \cite { CRT , DonohoPol } .	In this paper we revisit under-determined linear systems of equations with sparse solutions .	As is well known , these systems are among core mathematical problems of a very popular compressed sensing field .	Namely , working in a statistical scenario , \cite { CRT , DonohoPol } provided substantial mathematical progress in characterizing relation between the dimensions of the systems and the sparsity of unknown vectors recoverable through a particular polynomial technique called $ \ell_1 $ -minimization .	In our own series of work \cite { StojnicCSetam09 , StojnicUpper10 , StojnicEquiv10 } we also provided a collection of mathematical results related to these problems .
4	We also explore different implementations and boundary conditions on the map and also introduce the idea of a random atlas where a large number of different maps are created and their individual predictions are aggregated to produce a more robust photometric redshift PDF .	In this paper we explore the applicability of the unsupervised machine learning technique of Self Organizing Maps ( SOM ) to estimate galaxy photometric redshift probability density functions ( PDFs ) .	This technique takes a spectroscopic training set , and maps the photometric attributes , but not the redshifts , to a two dimensional surface by using a process of competitive learning where neurons compete to more closely resemble the training data multidimensional space .	The key feature of a SOM is that it retains the topology of the input set , revealing correlations between the attributes that are not easily identified .	We test three different 2D topological mapping : rectangular , hexagonal , and spherical , by using data from the DEEP2 survey .
4	It has been conjectured ( Tarjan , 1985 ) that splay trees ( Sleator and Tarjan , 1983 ) can serve such sequences in linear time .	In this paper we extend the geometric binary search tree ( BST ) model of Demaine , Harmon , Iacono , Kane , and Patrascu ( DHIKP ) to accommodate for insertions and deletions .	Within this extended model , we study the online Greedy BST algorithm introduced by DHIKP .	Greedy BST is known to be equivalent to a maximally greedy ( but inherently offline ) algorithm introduced independently by Lucas in 1988 and Munro in 2000 , conjectured to be dynamically optimal .	With the application of forbidden-submatrix theory , we prove a quasilinear upper bound on the performance of Greedy BST on deque sequences .
0	We study the dynamics of a micromaser where the pumping atoms are strongly driven by a resonant classical field during their transit through the cavity mode .	We derive a master equation for this strongly-driven micromaser , involving the contributions of the unitary atom-field interactions and the dissipative effects of a thermal bath .	We find analytical solutions for the temporal evolution and the steady-state of this system by means of phase-space techniques , providing an unusual solvable model of an open quantum system , including pumping and decoherence .	We derive closed expressions for all relevant expectation values , describing the statistics of the cavity field and the detected atomic levels .	The transient regime shows the build-up of mixtures of mesoscopic fields evolving towards a superpoissonian steady-state field that , nevertheless , yields atomic correlations that exhibit stronger nonclassical features than the conventional micromaser .
2	We present Always Best Packet Switching ( ABPS ) , an operation mode to perform network handover in a seamless way without the need to change the current network infrastructure and configuration .	This paper discusses on the need to focus on effective and cheap communication solutions for the deployment of smart services in countrysides .	We present the main wireless technologies , software architectures and protocols that need to be exploited , such as multihop , multipath communication and mobility support through multihoming .	This is in accordance with the need of having cheap solutions that may work in a smart shire scenario .	A simulation assessment confirms the effectiveness of our approach .
3	This hardly depends on our structured EGMF strength .	We simulate the arrival distribution of ultra-high-energy ( UHE ) protons by following their propagation processes in several strengths of a structured extragalactic magnetic field ( EGMF ) .	Comparing our result to observational one by Akeno Giant Air Shower Array , we constrain the number density of UHE cosmic ray sources with the small-scale anisotropy .	As a result , the source number density is $ \sim 10^ { -5 } { \rm Mpc } ^ { -3 } $ with uncertainty of about an order of magnitude due to the small number of observed events .	We also investigate future prospects for this approarch .
2	We have probed structural transitions under high pressure by synchrotron x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy up to 60 GPa .	The interaction of coexisting structural instabilities in multiferroic materials gives rise to intriguing coupling phenomena and extraordinarily rich phase diagrams , both in bulk materials and strained thin films .	Here we investigate the multiferroic BiMnO3 with its peculiar 6s2 electrons and four interacting mechanisms : electric polarity , octahedra tilts , magnetism , and cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion .	We show that BiMnO3 displays under pressure a rich sequence of five phases with a great variety of structures and properties , including a metallic phase above 53 GPa and , between 37 and 53 GPa , a strongly elongated monoclinic phase that allows ferroelectricity , which contradicts the traditional expectation that ferroelectricity vanishes under pressure .	Between 7 and 37 GPa , the Pnma structure remains remarkably stable but shows a reduction of the Jahn-Teller distortion in a way that differs from the behavior observed in the archetypal orthorhombic Jahn-Teller distorted perovskite LaMnO3 .
4	We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism for the light quarks and show that staggered chiral perturbation theory for the $ m_ { \pi } $ dependence is almost identical to continuum chiral perturbation theory for $ f_0 $ , $ f_B $ and $ f_ { \pi } $ .	The exclusive semileptonic decay $ B \rightarrow \pi \ell \nu $ is a key process for the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $ V_ { ub } $ from the comparison of experimental rates as a function of $ q^2 $ with theoretically determined form factors .	The sensitivity of the form factors to the $ u/d $ quark mass has meant significant systematic uncertainties in lattice QCD calculations at unphysically heavy pion masses .	Here we give the first lattice QCD calculations of this process for u/d quark masses going down to their physical values , calculating the $ f_0 $ form factor at zero recoil to 3\ % .	We are able to resolve a long-standing controversy by showing that the soft-pion theorem result $ f_0 ( q^2_ { max } ) = f_B/f_ { \pi } $ does hold as $ m_ { \pi } \rightarrow 0 $ .
0	The purpose of this document is to describe the upgrade of the CRESST dark matter search at LNGS .	The proposed strategy will allow to explore a region of the parameter space for spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering corresponding to WIMP masses below 10GeV/c $ ^\text { 2 } $ , that has not been covered by other experiments .	These results can be achieved only with outstanding detector performances in terms of threshold and background .	This proposal shows how CRESST can match these performance requirements , adding a unique piece of information to the dark matter puzzle .	The results of this program will fix a new state-of-the-art in the low mass WIMP exploration , opening new perspectives of understanding the dark matter scenario .
2	For two identical systems , the resulting d.c. Josephson effect formally represents a constant quasiparticle Josephson current across the weak link , which turns out to be unobservable in an experiment .	We discuss an experiment in which two magnetic insulators that both show a field-induced magnetic-ordering transition are weakly coupled to one another and are placed into an ex- ternal magnetic field .	If the respective magnetic states can be interpreted as phase coherent Bose-Einstein condensates of magnetic bosonic quasiparticles , one expects the occurrence of Josephson effects .	For magnetic insulators with different critical fields , a spontaneous alternating quasiparticle current develops with a leading oscillation frequency { \omega } a.c. that is determined by the difference between the critical fields .	As a result of the coupling , additional sidebands appear in the energy spectrum of the coupled device that would be absent without phase coherence .
1	96 , 190602 ( 2006 ) ] .	We present here a detailed study of the behaviour of a three dimensional Brownian motor based on cold atoms in a double optical lattice [ P. Sjolund et al. , Phys.Rev.Lett .	This includes both experiments and numerical simulations of a Brownian particle .	The potentials used are spatially and temporally symmetric , but combined spatiotemporal symmetry is broken by phase shifts and asymmetric transfer rates between potentials .	The diffusion of atoms in the optical lattices is rectified and controlled both in direction and speed along three dimensions .
4	This self consistent treatment should also be applicable to other physical systems that can be mapped onto similar sine-Gordon models , in the intermediate-coupling regime .	We study theoretically the effect of interactions between quantum phase slips in a short superconducting wire beyond the dilute phase slip approximation .	In contrast to the smooth transition in dissipative Josephson junctions , our analysis shows that treating these interactions in a self consistent manner leads to a very sharp transition with a critical resistance of $ R_Q= h/ ( 4e^2 ) $ .	The addition of the quasi-particles resistance at finite temperature leads to a quantitative agreement with recent experiments on short MoGe nanowires .	Our treatment is complementary to the theory of the thermal activation of phase slips , which is only valid for temperature at the vicinity of the mean field metal to superconductor transition .
3	We apply our technique to the Social Golfer Problem and we also use it to break symmetries of the problem .	On the one hand , Constraint Satisfaction Problems allow one to declaratively model problems .	On the other hand , propositional satisfiability problem ( SAT ) solvers can handle huge SAT instances .	We thus present a technique to declaratively model set constraint problems and to encode them automatically into SAT instances .	Our technique is simpler , more declarative , and less error-prone than direct and improved hand modeling .
0	The set of the first Hilbert coefficients of parameter ideals relative to a module -- its Chern coefficients -- over a local Noetherian ring codes for considerable information about its structure -- noteworthy properties such as that of Cohen-Macaulayness , Buchsbaumness , and of having finitely generated local cohomology .	The authors have previously studied the ring case .	By developing a robust setting to treat these coefficients for unmixed rings and modules , the case of modules is analyzed in a more transparent manner .	Another series of integers arise from partial Euler characteristics and are shown to carry similar properties of the module .	The technology of homological degree theory is also introduced in order to derive bounds for these two sets of numbers .
2	Because of that , $ ^ { 163 } $ Ho is the best candidate to perform experiments to investigate the value of the electron neutrino mass based on the analysis of the calorimetrically measured spectrum .	The isotope $ ^ { 163 } $ Ho undergoes an electron capture process with a recommended value for the energy available to the decay , $ Q_ { \rm EC } $ , of about 2.5 keV .	According to the present knowledge , this is the lowest $ Q_ { \rm EC } $ value for electron capture processes .	We present for the first time the calorimetric measurement of the atomic de-excitation of the $ ^ { 163 } $ Dy daughter atom upon the capture of an electron from the 5s shell in $ ^ { 163 } $ Ho , OI-line .	The measured peak energy is 48 eV .
4	This notion may be a proper extension of classical nondeterminism .	Does the notion of a quantum randomized or nondeterministic algorithm make sense , and if so , does quantum randomness or nondeterminism add power ?	Although reasonable quantum random sources do not add computational power , the discussion of quantum randomness naturally leads to several definitions of the complexity of quantum states .	Unlike classical string complexity , both deterministic and nondeterministic quantum state complexities are interesting .	A notion of \emph { total quantum nondeterminism } is introduced for decision problems .
3	We find that CSTB cosmos is dual -- in Wands 's sense -- to the slow-roll inflation model as can be easily seen from this unified parameter space .	We investigate the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in a bounce cosmos modeled by a scalar field coupled to the string tachyon field ( CSTB cosmos ) .	By explicit computation of its primordial spectral index we show the power spectrum of curvature perturbations , generated during the tachyon matter dominated contraction phase , to be nearly scale invariant .	We propose a unified space of parameters for a systematic study of inflationary/bouncing cosmologies .	Guaranteed by the dynamical attractor behavior of CSTB Cosmos , this scale invariance is free of the fine-tuning problem , in contrast to the slow-roll inflation model .
0	We investigate the effect of temperature on the dynamic properties of magnetic vortices in small disks .	Our calculations use a stochastic version of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert ( LLG ) equation , valid for finite temperatures well below the Curie critical temperature .	We show that a finite temperature induces a vortex precession around the center of the disk , even in the absence of other excitation sources .	We discuss the origin and implications of the appearance of this new dynamics .	We also show that a temperature gradient plays a role similar to that of a small constant magnetic field .
1	Our proposal allows to reduce the Newtonian Noise ( NN ) which limits all ground based GW detectors below few Hertz , including previous atom interferometry-based concepts .	We propose a new detection strategy for gravitational waves ( GWs ) below few Hertz based on a correlated array of atom interferometers ( AIs ) .	Using an array of long baseline AI gradiometers yields several estimations of the NN , whose effect can thus be reduced via statistical averaging .	Considering the km baseline of current optical detectors , a NN rejection of factor 2 could be achieved , and tested with existing AI array geometries .	Exploiting the correlation properties of the gravity acceleration noise , we show that a 10-fold or more NN rejection is possible with a dedicated configuration .
4	They are compared with those of the hot gas as derived from an accurate re-analysis of the XMM and Chandra nuclear X-ray spectra .	The near infrared ( IR ) absorption spectra of starburst galaxies show several atomic and molecular lines from red supergiants which can be used to infer reliable stellar abundances .	The metals locked in stars give a picture of the galaxy metallicity prior to the last burst of star formation .	The enrichment of the new generation of stars born in the last burst can be traced by measuring the hot gas in the X-rays .	For the first time detailed stellar abundances in the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy M82 have been obtained .
2	Then , one approach to identify the non-locality of nature is to characterize closed sets of non-local correlations .	No-signaling boxes are the abstract objects for studying non-locality , and wirings are local operations on the space of no-signaling boxes .	This means that , no matter how non-local the nature is , the set of physical non-local correlations must be closed under wirings .	Although non-trivial examples of wirings of no-signaling boxes are known , there is no systematic way to study wirings .	In particular , given a set of no-signaling boxes , we do not know a general method to prove that it is closed under wirings .
4	For the spinning brane , when one or more rotation parameters are nonzero , the brane has a net electric charge which is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation parameters , while the static brane has no net electric charge .	We obtain two new classes of magnetic brane solutions in third order Lovelock gravity .	The first class of solutions yields an $ ( n+1 ) $ -dimensional spacetime with a longitudinal magnetic field generated by a static source .	We generalize this class of solutions to the case of spinning magnetic branes with one or more rotation parameters .	These solutions have no curvature singularity and no horizons , but have a conic geometry .
3	The results are compared with the case of a conformally coupled field .	We study the back reaction effect of massless minimally coupled scalar field at finite temperatures in the background of Einstein universe .	Substituting for the vacuum expectation value of the components of the energy-momentum tensor on the RHS of the Einstein equation , we deduce a relationship between the radius of the universe and its temperature .	This relationship exhibit a maximum temperature , below the Planck scale , at which the system changes its behaviour drastically .	An investigation into the values of the cosmological constant exhibit a remarkable difference between the conformally coupled case and the minimally coupled one .
4	In addition to supporting previous claims for this as-yet unexplained effect , these measurements also cast new light on its mechanism .	Charge-stabilized colloidal spheres dispersed in weak 1:1 electrolytes are supposed to repel each other .	Consequently , experimental evidence for anomalous long-ranged like-charged attractions induced by geometric confinement inspired a burst of activity .	This has largely subsided because of nagging doubts regarding the experiments ' reliability and interpretation .	We describe a new class of thermodynamically self-consistent colloidal interaction measurements that confirm the appearance of pairwise attractions among colloidal spheres confined by one or two bounding walls .
2	We show that under the application of magnetic field the curve of the second order AF phase transitions passes into a curve of the first order ones at the tricritical point leading to a violation of the critical universality of the fluctuation theory .	Low-temperature specific-heat measurements on YbRh2Si2 at the second order antiferromagnetic ( AF ) phase transition reveal a sharp peak at TN=72 mK .	The corresponding critical exponent alpha turns out to be alpha=0.38 , which differs significantly from that obtained within the framework of the fluctuation theory of second order phase transitions based on the scale invariance , where alpha=0.1 .	This change of the phase transition is generated by the fermion condensation quantum phase transition .	Near the tricritical point the Landau theory of second order phase transitions is applicable and gives alpha=1/2 .
2	The practical issue , with the NARMAX representation as with any other , is to identify an efficient structure , i.e. , one with a small number of terms and coefficients .	The problem of constructing data-based , predictive , reduced models for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is considered , under circumstances where one has observation data only for a small subset of the dynamical variables .	Accurate prediction is achieved by developing a discrete-time stochastic reduced system , based on a NARMAX ( Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous input ) representation .	This is accomplished here by estimating coefficients for an approximate inertial form .	The broader significance of the results is discussed .
4	We argue that for RHIC collisions the direction of this flow should make a cone at a specific large angle with the jet , of about $ 70^o $ , and thus lead to peaks in particle correlations at the angle $ \Delta\phi=\pi\pm 1.2 $ rad relative to the large- $ p_t $ trigger .	Quenching is a recently discovered phenomenon in which QCD jets created in heavy ion collisions deposit a large fraction or even all their energy and momentum into the produced matter .	At RHIC and higher energies , where that matter is a strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma ( sQGP ) with very small viscosity , we suggest that this energy/momentum propagate as a collective excitation or `` conical flow '' .	Similar hydrodynamical phenomena are well known , e.g.the so called sonic booms from supersonic planes .	We solve the linearized relativistic hydrodynamic equations to detail the flow picture .
1	Recent Hubble Space Telescope observations show that the transient consists of two components : a point source , which is known to be fading , and an extended source , which is possibly fading .	GRB 970228 is the first gamma ray burst for which prolonged post-burst transient x-ray , optical , and infrared emission has been detected .	I fit standard fireball remnant models to the first month of x-ray , optical , and infrared measurements , which may be done without assuming a GRB distance scale .	I show that its emission is consistent with that of the remnant of a relativistically expanding impulsive fireball in which a forward shock dominates the emission of the GRB event : the piston model .	However , two discrepant measurements may indicate that the post-burst flux varies by factors of approximately 3 on timescales of days or weeks .
0	The relativistic three dimensional ( 3D ) Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations for the $ ep $ scattering amplitude is derived based on unitarity condition in the usual quantum electrodynamic ( QED ) .	The $ ep $ scattering potential $ V_ { e'N ' , eN } $ consists of the leading one off mass shell photon exchange part and the nonlocal multi-particle exchange potential .	Unlike to the other field-theoretical equations , both protons in the unitarity condition and in $ V_ { e'N ' , eN } $ are on mass shell .	Therefore in this approach are not required the multi-variable input photon-nucleon vertexes with the off mass shell nucleons .	In the present formulation the standard leading one photon exchange potential $ V_ { OPE } $ is generated by the canonical equal-time anti commutator between the electron source and the interacted electron fields which are sandwiched by the one nucleon asymptotic states .
1	We address whether this process operates in real systems , by modeling the stellar kinematics of the old elliptical NGC 4365 .	Supermassive black holes in the centres of giant elliptical galaxies are thought to induce chaos and eliminate triaxiality in their hosts .	This galaxy has a mean stellar population age & gt ; 12 Gyr and is known for its kinematically decoupled core and skew rotation at larger radii .	We fit the two-dimensional mean velocity field obtained by the SAURON integral-field spectrograph , and the isophotal ellipticity and position-angle profiles , using the velocity field fitting approach .	We find NGC 4365 to be strongly triaxial ( triaxiality parameter T approximately 0.45 ) and somewhat flatter than it appears .
0	We have detected an Halpha bow shock nebula around PSR J1741-2054 , a pulsar discovered through its GeV gamma-ray pulsations .	The pulsar is only ~1.5 '' behind the leading edge of the shock .	Optical spectroscopy shows that the nebula is non-radiative , dominated by Balmer emission .	The Halpha images and spectra suggest that the pulsar wind momentum is equatorially concentrated and implies a pulsar space velocity ~150km/s , directed 15+/-10deg out of the plane of the sky .	The complex Halpha profile indicates that different portions of the post-shock flow dominate line emission as gas moves along the nebula and provide an opportunity to study the structure of this unusual slow non-radiative shock under a variety of conditions .
0	A theoretical study of the structure formation observed very recently [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	90 , 128303 ( 2003 ) ] in binary colloids is presented .	In our model solely the dipole-dipole interaction of the particles is considered , electrohidrodynamic effects are excluded .	Based on molecular dynamics simulations and analytic calculations we show that the total concentration of the particles , the relative concentration and the relative dipole moment of the components determine the structure of the colloid .	At low concentrations the kinetic aggregation of particles results in fractal structures which show a crossover behavior when increasing the concentration .
2	We also find that the Toomre 's Q values in the centers of Seyfert galaxies tend to be larger than unity , indicating the circumnuclear molecular gas disks around Seyfert nuclei would be gravitationally stable .	High resolution ( a few arcseconds ) observations of CO ( 1-0 ) and HCN ( 1-0 ) emission from nearby Seyfert galaxies have been conducted with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array .	Based on the observed CO distributions and kinematics , we suggest that a small scale ( a few 100 pc - a few kpc ) distortion of the underlying potential seems to be necessary for Seyfert activity , although it is not a sufficient condition .	The HCN/CO integrated intensity ratios ( R_HCN/CO ) range over an order of magnitude , from 0.086 to 0.6 .	The Seyfert galaxies with high R_HCN/CO may have an extended ( r ~ 100 pc scale ) envelope of obscuring material .
2	Wannier functions are obtained by transforming the Bloch functions calculated using the density functional theory based program .	A method to calculate the crystal field parameters { \it ab initio } is proposed and applied to trivalent rare earth impurities in yttrium aluminate and to Tb $ ^ { 3+ } $ ion in TbAlO $ _3 $ .	To determine crystal field parameters local Hamiltonian expressed in basis of Wannier functions is expanded in a series of spherical tensor operators .	The results show that the crystal field is continuously decreasing as the number of $ 4f $ electrons increases and that the hybridization of $ 4f $ states with the states of oxygen ligands is important .	Theory is confronted with experiment for Nd $ ^ { 3+ } $ and Er $ ^ { 3+ } $ ions in YAlO $ _3 $ and for Tb $ ^ { 3+ } $ ion in TbAlO $ _3 $ and a fair agreement is found .
1	We use the extragalactic source counts from ISOCAM in conjunction with K-band counts to predict the confusion due to galaxies in deep mid-IR observations .	Recent ISO-data has allowed for the first time observationally based estimates for source confusion in mid-infrared surveys .	We specifically concentrate on the near-future Space Infrared Telescope Facility ( SIRTF ) mission , and calculate expected confusion for the Infrared Array Camera ( IRAC ) onboard SIRTF .	A defining scientific goal of the IRAC instrument will be the study of high redshift galaxies using a deep , confusion limited wide field survey at 3-10 microns .	A deep survey can reach 3 $ \mu $ Jy sources with reasonable confidence in the shorter wavelength IRAC bands .
4	Throughout , the ionized gas contribution is negligible ( $ \lesssim $ 3 % ) .	We present S\'IGAME simulations of the [ CII ] 157.7 $ \mu $ fine structure line emission from cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( SPH ) simulations of seven main sequence galaxies at z=2 .	Using sub-grid physics prescriptions the gas in our simulations is modeled as a multi-phased interstellar medium ( ISM ) comprised of molecular gas residing in giant molecular clouds , an atomic gas phase associated with photo-dissociation regions ( PDRs ) at the cloud surfaces , and a diffuse , ionized gas phase .	Adopting logotropic cloud density profiles and accounting for heating by the local FUV radiation field and cosmic rays by scaling both with local star formation rate ( SFR ) volume density , we calculate the [ CII ] emission using a photon escape probability formalism .	The [ CII ] emission peaks in the central $ \lesssim $ 1 kpc of our galaxies as do the SFR radial profiles , with most [ CII ] ( $ \gtrsim $ 70 % ) originating in the molecular gas phase , whereas further out ( $ \gtrsim $ 2 kpc ) , the atomic/PDR gas dominates ( $ \gtrsim $ 90 % ) the [ CII ] emission , no longer tracing on-going star formation .
0	Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized genomic research .	16S rRNA amplicon sequencing using paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq platform from Illumina , Inc. , is being used to characterize the composition and dynamics of extremely complex/diverse microbial communities .	For this analysis on the Illumina platform , merging and quality filtering of paired-end reads are essential first steps in data analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability of downstream analysis .	We have developed the Merging and Filtering Tool ( MeFiT ) to combine these pre-processing steps into one simple , intuitive pipeline .	MeFiT provides an open-source solution that permits users to merge and filter paired end illumina reads based on user-selected quality parameters .
0	The dynamics of a self-gravitating neutron gas in presence of a magnetic field is being studied taking the equation of state of a magnetized neutron gas obtained in a previous study [ 2 ] .	We work in a Bianchi I spacetime characterized by a Kasner metric , this metric allow us to take into account the anisotropy that introduces the magnetic field .	The set of Einstein-Maxwell field equations for this gas becomes a dynamical system in a 4-dimensional phase space .	We get numerical solutions of the system .	In particular there is a unique point like solution for different initial conditions .
2	From a more conceptual point of view , differential forms are functions on the superspace of maps from the odd line to M and the action of Diff ( the odd line ) on forms is equivalent to deRham differential and to degrees of forms .	We study `` higher-dimensional '' generalizations of differential forms .	Just as differential forms can be defined as the universal commutative differential algebra containing C^\infty ( M ) , we can define differential gorms as the universal commutative bidifferential algebra .	Gorms are functions on the superspace of maps from the odd plane to M and we study the action of Diff ( the odd plane ) on gorms ; it contains more than just degrees and differentials .	By replacing 2 with arbitrary n , we get differential worms .
0	We demonstrate the in situ detection of cold 87 Rb atoms near a dielectric surface using the absorption of a weak , resonant evanescent wave .	We have used this technique in time of flight experiments determining the density of atoms falling on the surface .	A quantitative understanding of the measured curve was obtained using a detailed calculation of the evanescent intensity distribution .	We have also used it to detect atoms trapped near the surface in a standing-wave optical dipole potential .	This trap was loaded by inelastic bouncing on a strong , repulsive evanescent potential .
1	The 8-m-long , 350-MHz RFQ structure accelerates a dc , 75-keV , 110-mA H+ beam from the LEDA injector with & gt ; 90 % transmission .	The Low-Energy Demonstration Accelerator ( LEDA ) radio-frequency quadrupole ( RFQ ) is a 100 % duty factor ( CW ) linac that delivers & gt ; 100 mA of H+ beam at 6.7 MeV .	LEDA [ 1,2 ] consists of a 75-keV proton injector , 6.7-MeV , 350-MHz CW RFQ with associated high-power and low-level rf systems , a short high-energy beam transport ( HEBT ) and high-power ( 670-kW CW ) beam stop .	The beam emittance is inferred from wire scanner measurements of the beam profile at a single location in the HEBT .	The beam profile is measured as a function of the magnetic field gradient in one of the HEBT quadrupoles .
1	In this paper we have discussed its quantum aspects through the introduction of Planck scale objects , i.e. , via noncommutativity and the well known BV quantization .	The so-callled Jackiw-Pi ( JP ) model for massive vector fields is a three dimensional , gauge invariant and parity preserving model which was discussed in several contexts .	Namely , we have constructed the JP noncommutative space-time version and we have provided the BV quantization of the commutative JP model and we have discussed its features .	The noncommutativity has introduced interesting new objects in JP 's Planck scale framework .	The anomaly issue was discussed .
4	Bistability in the low noise limit can be interpreted in terms of jumping processes across barriers activated by stochastic fluctuations .	The response of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal model subjected to stochastic uncorrelated spike trains originating from a large number of inhibitory and excitatory post-synaptic potentials is analyzed in detail .	The model is examined in its three fundamental dynamical regimes : silence , bistability and repetitive firing .	Its response is characterized in terms of statistical indicators ( interspike-interval distributions and their first moments ) as well as of dynamical indicators ( autocorrelation functions and conditional entropies ) .	In the silent regime , the coexistence of two different coherence resonances is revealed : one occurs at quite low noise and is related to the stimulation of subthreshold oscillations around the rest state ; the second one ( at intermediate noise variance ) is associated with the regularization of the sequence of spikes emitted by the neuron .
3	It was shown that aggregation process includes two different stages : fast , resulting in formation of loose aggregates ( $ { L } $ -aggregates ) and slow , resulting in formation of compacted aggregates ( $ { C } $ -aggregates ) .	The nonocomposites on the base of long ( 5-10 $ \mu $ m , $ { o } $ -MWCNTs ) and short ( 2 $ \mu $ m , $ { m } $ -MWCNTs ) multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) hosted by nematic 5CB were investigated in details by means of polarizing microscopy , studies of electrical conductivity and electro-optical behaviour .	The spontaneous self-organization of MWCNTs was observed and investigated both theoretically and experimentally .	The simple Smoluchowski approach was used for estimation of the half-time of aggregation .	Both $ { L } $ - and $ { C } $ - aggregates possess extremely ramified fractal borders .
4	It is shown that the contribution from the low $ \ell $ -level is larger than that from the high $ \ell $ -level in the massive case .	Motivated by the brane-world scenarios , we study the absorption problem when the spacetime background is $ ( 4+n ) $ -dimensional Schwarzschild black hole .	We compute the low-energy absorption cross sections for the brane-localized massive scalar , brane-localized massive Dirac fermion , and massive bulk scalar .	For the case of brane-localized massive Dirac fermion we introduce the particle 's spin in the traditional Dirac form without invoking the Newman-Penrose method .	Our direct introduction of spin enables us to compute contributions to the $ j $ th-level partial absorption cross section from orbital angular momenta $ \ell = j \pm 1/2 $ .
4	Prompt hadron ratios are important for hadronisation models , while the $ \bar p/p $ ratio is a good observable to test models of baryon number transport .	The LHCb detector with its unique pseudorapidity coverage allows to perform soft-QCD measurements in the kinematic forward region where QCD models have large uncertainties .	Selected analyses related to soft-Diffraction will be summarised in these proceedings .	Energy flow and charged particle multiplicity have been measured separately in different event classes .	They give input for modelling the underlying event in pp collisions .
2	In particular , we prove that the right tail of this distribution is Gaussian : for $ t & gt ; 0 $ , \ [ P [ \lambda_ { max } & lt ; t ] =1-\frac { 1 } { 4 } \mbox { erfc } ( t ) +O\left ( e^ { -2t^2 } \right ) .	Let $ \sqrt { N } +\lambda_ { max } $ be the largest real eigenvalue of a random $ N\times N $ matrix with independent $ N ( 0,1 ) $ entries ( the `real Ginibre matrix ' ) .	We study the large deviations behaviour of the limiting $ N\rightarrow \infty $ distribution $ P [ \lambda_ { max } & lt ; t ] $ of the shifted maximal real eigenvalue $ \lambda_ { max } $ .	\ ] This is a rigorous confirmation of the corresponding result of Forrester and Nagao .	We also prove that the left tail is exponential : for $ t & lt ; 0 $ , \ [ P [ \lambda_ { max } & lt ; t ] = e^ { \frac { 1 } { 2\sqrt { 2\pi } } \zeta\left ( \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right ) t+O ( 1 ) } , \ ] where $ \zeta $ is the Riemann zeta-function .
3	It is then suggested that the actual thermodynamic behavior for a harmonic oscillator is given by the function satisfying the Wien displacement result which provides the smoothest possible interpolation between scale-decoupled energy equipartition at low frequency and scale-invariant zero-point energy at high frequency .	A new thermodynamic analysis is presented for the intimate connections between blackbody radiation and zero-point radiation within classical physics .	First , using the thermodynamic behavior of an oscillator under an adiabatic change of frequency , we show that the thermodynamic functions can all be derived from a single function of w/T , analogous to Wien 's displacement theorem .	The high- and low-frequency limits allow asymptotic energy forms involving T alone or w alone , corresponding to energy equipartition and zero-point energy .	This leads to the Planck spectrum .
3	We find no correlation for at least 200 days prior to a glitch in the pulsar at MJD 55022 , following which the correlation becomes strong .	PSR J0742-2822 exhibits two distinct emission states that are identified by discrete changes in the observed pulse profile .	These changes have previously been shown to correlate with changes in the derivative of the pulse frequency .	In this paper , we use observations with the Parkes radio telescope at a centre frequency of 1369 and 3100 MHz to produce high phase resolution polarisation profiles for the two modes and perform a detailed study of the correlation between observed pulse shape and spin-down rate .	This suggests a link between the emission state switching phenomenon and glitch events .
4	Finally , the theory is extended to include 2-spinors and 4-spinors .	Pandres has developed a theory in which the geometrical structure of a real four-dimensional space-time is expressed by a real orthonormal tetrad , and the group of diffeomorphisms is replaced by a larger group called the conservation group .	This paper extends the geometrical foundation for Pandres ' theory by developing an appropriate covariant derivative which is covariant under all local Lorentz ( frame ) transformations , including complex Lorentz transformations , as well as conservative transformations .	After defining this extended covariant derivative , an appropriate Lagrangian and its resulting field equations are derived .	As in Pandres ' theory , these field equations result in a stress-energy tensor that has terms which may automatically represent the electroweak field .
4	Furthermore , we show that conformal algebra holds even in the system perturbed by the cosmological constant vertex operator as in the case of the Liouville theory shown by Curtright and Thorn .	We study vertex operators in 4D conformal field theory derived from quantized gravity , whose dynamics is governed by the Wess-Zumino action by Riegert and the Weyl action .	Conformal symmetry is equal to diffeomorphism symmetry in the ultraviolet limit , which mixes positive-metric and negative-metric modes of the gravitational field and thus these modes can not be treated separately in physical operators .	In this paper , we construct gravitational vertex operators such as the Ricci scalar , defined as space-time volume integrals of them are invariant under conformal transformations .	Short distance singularities of these operator products are computed and it is shown that their coefficients have physically correct sign .
3	The fully coupled electromechanical nature of the system is described by including both mechanical and electrical kinematical descriptors and both direct and inverse piezoelectric effects .	The present work attempts to present a consistent and efficient approach to piezoelectric laminated beams .	The influence of hypotheses on three-dimensional sectional deformations and stress distributions on the estimate of the beam electromechanical properties is analyzed .	By exploiting a mixed variational formulation and Lagrange multipliers method , an Euler- Bernoulli-like beam model which accounts for transverse interactions between different is presented .	For a sandwich piezoelectric beam and for a two-layers beam , expressions of the beam constitutive coefficients are provided and the main features of the proposed model are highlighted .
4	energies of 10.538 GeV allows for determinations of experimental moments and their correlations with small errors and that there is no need to rely on theoretical input above the charmonium resonances .	We determine the MS-bar charm quark mass from a charmonium QCD sum rules analysis .	On the theoretical side we use input from perturbation theory at O ( alpha_s^3 ) .	Improvements with respect to previous O ( alpha_s^3 ) analyses include ( 1 ) an account of all available e+e- hadronic cross section data and ( 2 ) a thorough analysis of perturbative uncertainties .	Using a data clustering method to combine hadronic cross section data sets from different measurements we demonstrate that using all available experimental data up to c.m .
0	We present a theory of the elementary spin excitations in transition metal ferromagnet nanoparticles which achieves a unified and consistent quantum description of both collective and quasiparticle physics .	The theory starts by recognizing the essential role played by spin-orbit interactions in determining the energies of ferromagnetic resonances in the collective excitation spectrum and the strength of their coupling to low-energy particle-hole excitations .	We argue that a crossover between Landau-damped ferromagnetic resonance and pure-state collective magnetic excitations occurs as the number of atoms in typical transition metal ferromagnet nanoparticles drops below approximately $ 10^4 $ , approximately where the single-particle level spacing , $ \delta $ , becomes larger than , $ \sqrt { \alpha } E_ { \rm res } $ , where $ E_ { \rm res } $ is the ferromagnetic resonance frequency and $ \alpha $ is the Gilbert damping parameter .	We illustrate our ideas by studying the properties of semi-realistic model Hamiltonians , which we solve numerically for nanoparticles containing several hundred atoms .	For small nanoparticles , we find one isolated ferromagnetic resonance collective mode below the lowest particle-hole excitation energy , at $ E_ { \rm res } \approx 0.1 $ meV .
2	We characterize certain recursion families within R ( n ) by introducing `` simultaneous parameters '' that appear both within the recursion itself and that also specify structural properties of the corresponding tree .	We apply a tree-based methodology to solve new , very broadly defined families of nested recursions of the general form R ( n ) =sum_ { i=1 } ^k R ( n-a_i-sum_ { j=1 } ^p R ( n-b_ { ij } ) ) , where a_i are integers , b_ { ij } are natural numbers , and k , p are natural numbers that we use to denote `` arity '' and `` order , '' respectively , and with some specified initial conditions .	The key idea of the tree-based solution method is to associate such recursions with infinite labelled trees in a natural way so that the solution to the recursions solves a counting question relating to the corresponding trees .	First , we extend and unify recently discovered results concerning two families of arity k=2 , order p=1 recursions .	Next , we investigate the solution of nested recursion families by taking linear combinations of solution sequence frequencies for simpler nested recursions , which correspond to superpositions of the associated trees ; this leads us to identify and solve two new recursion families for arity k=2 and general order p. Finally , we extend these results to general arity k & gt ; 2 .
3	On the basis of the present limited sample it appears that an extinction of 1 - 2 magnitudes at 1500 A may be typical of Lyman break galaxies .	We present the first results from a program of near-infrared spectroscopy aimed at studying the familiar rest-frame optical emission lines from the H II regions of Lyman break galaxies at z = 3 .	By targeting redshifts which bring the lines of interest into gaps between the strong OH sky emission , we have been successful in detecting Balmer and [ O III ] emission lines in all five galaxies observed so far with CGS4 on UKIRT .	For a Salpeter IMF and a H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc , q_0 = 0.1 cosmology , the Hbeta luminosities uncorrected for dust extinction imply star formation rates of 20 - 270 solar masses per year .	This value is consistent with recent estimates of dust obscuration in star forming galaxies at z & lt ; 1 , and does not require a substantial revision of the broad picture of star formation over the Hubble time proposed by Madau et al . ( 1996 ) .
1	If the topology of a network ( or link capacities ) is dynamically changing or unknown , it is not so trivial to predict statistical properties on the maximum flow of the network .	The capacity ( or maximum flow ) of an unicast network is known to be equal to the minimum s-t cut capacity due to the max-flow min-cut theorem .	In this paper , we present a probabilistic analysis for evaluating the accumulate distribution of the minimum s-t cut capacity on random graphs .	The graph ensemble treated in this paper consists of weighted graphs with arbitrary specified degree distribution .	The main contribution of our work is a lower bound for the accumulate distribution of the minimum s-t cut capacity .
1	This paper proposes a novel traffic signal controller with two fuzzy layers for signalizing the roundabout .	Due to that the existing traffic facilities can hardly be extended , developing traffic signal control methods is the most important way to improve the traffic efficiency of modern roundabouts .	The outer layer of the controller computes urgency degrees of all the phase subsets and then activates the most urgent subset .	This mechanism helps to instantly respond to the current traffic condition of the roundabout so as to improve real-timeness .	The inner layer of the controller computes extension time of the current phase .
2	Here we use such a system , in which quantum photon-number fluctuations significantly drive the center of mass of an atomic ensemble inside a Fabry-Perot cavity .	Accessing distinctly quantum aspects of the interaction between light and the position of a mechanical object has been an outstanding challenge to cavity-optomechanical systems .	Only cold-atom implementations of cavity optomechanics have indicated effects of the quantum fluctuations in the optical radiation pressure force .	We show that the optomechanical response both amplifies and ponderomotively squeezes the quantum light field .	We also demonstrate that classical optical fluctuations can be attenuated by 26 dB or amplified by 20 dB with a weak input pump power of & lt ; 40 pW , and characterize the optomechanical amplifier 's frequency-dependent gain and phase response in both the amplitude and phase-modulation quadratures .
2	We have computed the RGI quark masses and then we have connected the results to the MSbar scheme .	I discuss the results of a new calculation of the charm and bottom quark masses in the quenched approximation and in the continuum limit of lattice QCD .	The work has been done by the APE group at the `` Tor Vergata '' University making use of the step scaling method , previously introduced to deal with two scale problems , that allows to take the continuum limit of the lattice data .	The continuum numbers are m_b^ { RGI } = 6.73 ( 16 ) GeV for the b-quark and m_c^ { RGI } = 1.681 ( 36 ) GeV for the c-quark , corresponding respectively to m_b^ { MSbar } ( m_b^ { MSbar } ) = 4.33 ( 10 ) GeV and m_c^ { MSbar } ( m_c^ { MSbar } ) = 1.319 ( 28 ) GeV .	The latter result , in agreement with current estimates , is for us a check of the method .
1	In the spin- $ 1 \over 2 $ chain , the system is gapless for $ \delta=0 $ and $ J_2 & lt ; J_ { 2c } =0.241 $ , and is gapped everywhere else in the $ J_2 - \delta $ plane .	We use the density matrix renormalization group method to study the ground state `phase ' diagram and some low-energy properties of isotropic antiferromagnetic spin- $ 1 \over 2 $ and spin- $ 1 $ chains with a next-nearest neighbor exchange $ J_2 ~ $ and an alternation $ \delta $ of the nearest neighbor exchanges .	At $ J_ { 2c } $ , for small $ \delta $ , the gap increases as $ \delta^ { \alpha } $ , where $ \alpha = 0.667 \pm 0.001 $ .	$ 2J_2 + \delta = 1 $ is a disorder line .	To the left of this line , the structure factor $ S ( q ) $ peaks at $ q_ { max } = \pi $ ( Neel `phase ' ) , while to the right , $ q_ { max } $ decreases from $ \pi $ to $ \pi/2 $ ( spiral `phase ' ) as $ J_2 $ increases .
0	Images obtained by drift-scanning with a stationary telescope are affected by the declination-dependent curvature of star trails .	The image displacement to curvature and drift rate variation increases with the angular field of view and can lead to significant loss of resolution with modern large-format CCD arrays .	We show that these effects can be essentially eliminated by means of an optical corrector design in which individual lenses are tilted and decentered .	A specific example is presented , of a four-element corrector designed for the Large-Zenith Telescope .	The design reduces curvature errors to less than 0.074 arcsec over a 10 arcmin x 20 arcmin field of view centered at 49 degrees declination .
4	It turns out that the scale-factor is a measure of complexity of the species .	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are small non-coding RNAs which regulate gene expression by binding to the 3 ' UTR of the corresponding messenger RNAs .	We construct miRNA co-target networks for 22 different species using a target prediction database , MicroCosm Tagets .	The miRNA pairs of individual species having one or more common target genes are connected and the number of co-targets are assigned as the weight of these links .	We show that the link-weight distributions of all the species collapse remarkably onto each other when scaled suitably .
3	Plan reuse may offer an interesting alternative to plan generation in some settings .	Planning is a notoriously difficult computational problem of high worst-case complexity .	Researchers have been investing significant efforts to develop heuristics or restrictions to make planning practically feasible .	Case-based planning is a heuristic approach where one tries to reuse previous experience when solving similar problems in order to avoid some of the planning effort .	We provide theoretical results that identify situations in which plan reuse is provably tractable .
2	The average entanglement entropy is analyzed for a generic conformal field theory in four dimensions .	We consider the situation when a globally defined four-dimensional field system is separated on two entangled sub-systems by a dynamical ( random ) two-dimensional surface .	The reduced density matrix averaged over ensemble of random surfaces of fixed area and the corresponding average entropy are introduced .	Two important particular cases are considered .	In the first , both the intrinsic metric on the entangling surface and the spacetime metric are fluctuating .
4	In addition , we can efficiently compute these centrality values for all temporal vertices .	Structure of real networked systems , such as social relationship , can be modeled as temporal networks in which each edge appears only at the prescribed time .	Understanding the structure of temporal networks requires quantifying the importance of a temporal vertex , which is a pair of vertex index and time .	In this paper , we define two centrality measures of a temporal vertex based on the fastest temporal paths which use the temporal vertex .	The definition is free from parameters and robust against the change in time scale on which we focus .
0	A Bayesian framework is attractive in the context of prediction , but a fast recursive update of the predictive distribution has apparently been out of reach , in part because Monte Carlo methods are generally used to compute the predictive .	This paper shows that online Bayesian prediction is possible by a characterizing the Bayesian predictive update in terms of a bivariate copula , making it unnecessary to pass through the posterior to update the predictive .	In standard models , the Bayesian predictive update corresponds to familiar choices of copula but , in nonparametric problems , the appropriate copula may not have a closed-form expression .	In such cases , our new perspective suggests a fast recursive approximation to the predictive density , in the spirit of Newton 's predictive recursion algorithm , but without requiring evaluation of normalizing constants .	Consistency of the new algorithm is shown , and numerical examples demonstrate its quality performance in finite-samples compared to fully Bayesian and kernel methods .
2	The subsequent relaxation back to thermal equilibrium is monitored over time .	We investigate the decay of highly excited states of ultracold fermions in a three-dimensional optical lattice .	Starting from a repulsive Fermi-Hubbard system near half filling , we generate additional doubly occupied sites ( doublons ) by lattice modulation .	The measured doublon lifetime covers two orders of magnitude .	In units of the tunneling time h/J it is found to depend exponentially on the ratio of on-site interaction energy U to kinetic energy J .
3	The dwarf sungrazers ' perihelion longitude is statistically invariable , but their perihelion latitude increases systematically with Omega .	We investigate the relationships among the angular orbital elements -- - the longitude of the ascending node , Omega , the inclination , i , and the argument of perihelion , omega -- - of the Kreutz system 's faint , dwarf sungrazers observed only with the SOHO/STEREO coronagraphs ; their published orbits were derived using a parabolic , purely gravitational approximation .	In a plot of i against Omega the bright Kreutz sungrazers ( such as C/1843 D1 , C/1882 R1 , C/1963 R1 , etc . )	fit a curve of fixed apsidal orientation , whereas the dwarf members are distributed along a curve that makes with the apsidal curve an angle of 15 deg .	We find that this trend can be explained by a strong erosion-driven nongravitational acceleration normal to the orbit plane , confirmed for several test dwarf Kreutz sungrazers by orbital solutions with nongravitational terms incorporated directly in the equations of motion on a condition of fixed apsidal orientation .
0	At classical level , dynamical derivation of the properties and conservation laws for topologically non-trivial systems from Noether theorem versus the derivation of the system 's properties on topological grounds are considered as distinct .	We do celebrate any agreements in results derived from these two distinct approaches : i.e.the dynamical versus the topological approach .	Here we consider the Corrigan-Olive-Fairlie-Nuyts solution based on which we study the stability of the 't Hooft- Polyakov outer field , known as its Higgs vacuum , and derive its stability , dynamically , from the equations of motion rather than from the familiar topological approach .	Then we use our derived result of the preservation of the Higgs vacuum asymptotically to derive the stability of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole , even if inner core is perturbed , where we base that on observing that the magnetic charge must be conserved if the Higgs vacuum is preserved asymptotically .	We also , alternatively , note stability of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole and the conservation of its magnetic charge by again using the result of the Higgs vacuum asymptotic preservation to use Eq .
2	But we consider the case where the average degree of each node is of order of the size of the graph ( unlike SWGs , which are sparse ) .	We study the properties of random graphs where for each vertex a { \it neighbourhood } has been previously defined .	The probability of an edge joining two vertices depends on whether the vertices are neighbours or not , as happens in Small World Graphs ( SWGs ) .	This allows us to calculate the mean distance and clustering , that are qualitatively similar ( although not in such a dramatic scale range ) to the case of SWGs .	We also obtain analytically the distribution of eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrices .
1	Two-step growth process is found to be a key to achieve interfacial-layer-free epitaxial Bi2Se3 films on Si substrates .	Atomically sharp epitaxial growth of Bi2Se3 films is achieved on Si ( 111 ) substrate with MBE ( Molecular Beam Epitaxy ) .	With a single-step high temperature growth , second phase clusters are formed at an early stage .	On the other hand , with low temperature growth , the film tends to be disordered even in the absence of a second phase .	With a low temperature initial growth followed by a high temperature growth , second-phase-free atomically sharp interface is obtained between Bi2Se3 and Si substrate , as verified by RHEED ( Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction ) , TEM ( Transmission Electron Microscopy ) and XRD ( X-Ray Diffraction ) .
4	For any $ N $ , there are no instabilities in the sphaleronic sector if all the magnetic gauge field functions $ \omega _ { j } $ have no zeros , and satisfy a set of $ N-1 $ inequalities .	We investigate the stability of spherically symmetric , purely magnetic , soliton and black hole solutions of four-dimensional $ { \mathfrak { su } } ( N ) $ Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ .	These solutions are described by $ N-1 $ magnetic gauge field functions $ \omega _ { j } $ .	We consider linear , spherically symmetric , perturbations of these solutions .	The perturbations decouple into two sectors , known as the sphaleronic and gravitational sectors .
2	Context-aware pervasive systems rely on information about the context and user preferences to adapt their behavior .	Nowadays computing becomes increasingly mobile and pervasive .	One of the important steps in pervasive computing is context-awareness .	However , context-aware applications do not always behave as user 's desire , and can cause users to feel dissatisfied with unexpected actions .	To solve these problems , context-aware systems must provide mechanisms to adapt automatically when the context changes significantly .
4	Both the inverse diffusivity and the relaxation time follow a power law behavior for densities $ \rho\le 0.5 $ .	We introduce a three-dimensional lattice gas model to study the glass transition .	In this model the interactions come from the excluded volume and particles have five arms with an asymmetrical shape , which results in geometric frustration that inhibits full packing .	Each particle has two degrees of freedom , the position and the orientation of the particle .	We find a second order phase transition at a density $ \rho\approx 0.305 $ , this transition decouples the orientation of the particles which can rotate without interaction in this degree of freedom until $ \rho=0.5 $ is reached .
2	( 2004 ) ) of an early phase corresponding to the main growth of the host galaxy and formation of the central black hole .	We report on the first SCUBA detection of a Type 2 QSO at z=3.660 in the Chandra Deep Field South .	This source is X-ray absorbed , shows only narrow emission lines in the optical spectrum and is detected in the sub-mm : it is the ideal candidate in an evolution scheme for AGN ( e.g.Fabian ( 1999 ) ; Page et al .	The overall photometry ( from the radio to the X-ray energy band ) of this source is well reproduced by the spectral energy distribution ( SED ) of NGC 6240 , while it is incompatible with the spectrum of a Type 1 QSO ( 3C273 ) or a starburst galaxy ( Arp 220 ) .	Its sub-mm ( 850 \mu m ) to X-ray ( 2 keV ) spectral slope ( alpha_SX ) is close to the predicted value for a Compton-thick AGN in which only 1 % of the nuclear emission emerges through scattering .
4	While the latter could reach a few percent level in fine-tuned scenarios , the requirement of naturalness reduces these FCNC rates into the modest range B ( h- & gt ; b\bar { s } ) ~ 10^ { -4 } -10^ { -3 } .	We analyze the maximum branching ratios for the Flavor Changing Neutral Current ( FCNC ) decays of the neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ( MSSM ) into bottom quarks , h - & gt ; b\bar { s } ( h=h^0 , H^0 , A^0 ) .	We consistently correlate these decays with the radiative B-meson decays ( b- & gt ; s\gamma ) .	A full-fledged combined numerical analysis is performed of these high-energy and low-energy FCNC decay modes in the MSSM parameter space .	Our calculation shows that the available data on B ( b- & gt ; s \gamma ) severely restricts the allowed values of B ( h- & gt ; b\bar { s } ) .
0	We report a detailed study of UGe $ _ { 2 } $ single crystals using infrared reflectivity and spectroscopic ellipsometry .	The optical conductivity suggests the presence of a low frequency interband transition and a narrow free-carrier response with strong frequency dependence of the scattering rate and effective mass .	We observe sharp changes in the low frequency mass and scattering rate below the upper ferromagnetic transition $ T_C = 53 K $ .	The characteristic changes are exhibited most strongly at an energy scale of around 12 meV ( 100 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ ) .	They recover their unrenormalized value above $ T_C $ and for $ \omega & gt ; $ 40 meV .
3	The procedure for finding the corresponding mapping coefficients is iterative .	The central problem of strip theory is the calculation of potential flowaround 2D sections .	One particular method of solutions to this problem is conformal mapping of the body section to the unit circle over which a solution of potential flow is available .	Here , a new multiparameter conformal mapping method is presented that can map any arbitrary section onto a unit circle with good accuracy .	The suggested mapping technique is shown to be capable of appropriately mapping any chined , bulbous , and large and fine sections .
2	These show different paths with respect to temperature : In the ZFC/ZFH process , weak SHG was observed at low temperature , while in the FH/ZFC process , relatively high SHG appears in a limited temperature range below TF depending on the field strength , and in the FC and FH/FC processes , the SHG exhibits ferroelectric-like temperature dependence : it appears at the freezing temperature of 50K , increases with decreasing temperature and has a tendency of saturation .	Incipient ferroelectric KTaO3 with off-center Li impurity of the critical concentration of 2.8 mol % was investigated in order to clarify the dipole glass state under electric field .	Using optical second-harmonic generation ( SHG ) microscope , we observed a marked history dependence of SHG intensity through zero-field cooling ( ZFC ) , zero-field heating ( ZFH ) , field heating after ZFC ( FH/ZFC ) and FH after field cooling ( FH/FC ) .	These experimental results strongly suggest that dipole glass state or polar nano-clusters which gradually freezes with decreasing temperature is transformed into semi-macroscopic polar state under the electric field .	However at sufficiently low temperature , the freezing is so strong that the electric field can not enlarge the polar clusters .
2	The small turbulence in stable Taylor-Couette flow is caused by Ekman flow where $ ( \delta v/v ) ^2 \sim 10^ { -3 } $ .	The $ \Omega $ -phase of the liquid sodium $ \alpha $ - $ \Omega $ dynamo experiment at NMIMT in cooperation with LANL has successfully demonstrated the production of a high toroidal field , $ B_ { \phi } \simeq 8\times B_r $ from the radial component of an applied poloidal magnetic field , $ B_r $ .	This enhanced toroidal field is produced by rotational shear in stable Couette flow within liquid sodium at $ Rm \simeq 120 $ .	This high $ \Omega $ -gain in low turbulence flow contrasts with a smaller $ \Omega $ -gain in higher turbulence , Helmholtz-unstable shear flows .	This result supports the ansatz that large scale astrophysical magnetic fields are created within semi-coherent large scale motions in which turbulence plays only a smaller diffusive role that enables magnetic flux linkage .
4	These exotics can be pair produced at the LHC via electroweak interactions and their subsequent decays produce a host of multi-lepton signals .	There exist tree-level generalizations of the Type-I and Type-III seesaw mechanisms that realize neutrino mass via low-energy effective operators with d & gt ; 5 .	However , these generalizations also give radiative masses that can dominate the seesaw masses in regions of parameter space -- - i.e.they are not purely seesaw models , nor are they purely radiative models , but instead they are something in between .	A recent work detailed the remaining minimal models of this type .	Here we study the remaining model with d=9 and investigate the collider phenomenology of the exotic quadruplet fermions it predicts .
0	We discuss unoriented quivers with flavour that arise from D3-branes at local orbifold singularities , in the presence of Omega-planes and non-compact D7-branes .	We produce a wide class of unoriented quiver gauge theories , including new instances of N=1 superconformal theories .	We then consider unoriented D-brane instanton corrections of both `gauge ' and `exotic ' kinds .	In particular , we show that conformal symmetry can be dynamically broken via the generation of exotic superpotentials .	Finally we discuss aspects of the recently proposed N=1 remnant of N=4 S-duality .
4	For a 500 GeV $ \mu\bar { \mu } $ collider , the cross section for $ H\gamma $ associated production approaches 0.1 fb .	We present cross sections for the reaction $ \mu\bar { \mu } \to H\gamma $ over a range of $ \mu\bar { \mu } $ collider energies .	The amplitudes for this process receive tree level contributions and one-loop contributions , which are of comparable magnitude .	The tree level amplitudes are dominated by helicity non-flip terms and the one-loop amplitudes are dominated by helicity flip terms .	As a consequence , the interference terms between the tree level and one-loop contributions are negligible .
3	We propose a new , compact and Lorentz covariant formula for the tree-level NMHV amplitudes for arbitrary numbers and types of external particles .	We argue that the scattering amplitudes in the maximally supersymmetric N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory possess a new symmetry which extends the previously discovered dual conformal symmetry .	To reveal this property we formulate the scattering amplitudes as functions in the appropriate dual superspace .	Rewritten in this form , all tree-level MHV and next-to-MHV amplitudes exhibit manifest dual superconformal symmetry .	The dual conformal symmetry is broken at loop level by infrared divergences .
0	Using first-principles calculation based on density functional theory we probe the electronic , bulk mechanical as well as magnetic properties of Co $ _ { 2 } $ PtGa as well as other related Heusler alloys ( X $ _ { 2 } $ PtGa , X being Cr , Mn , Fe , Ni , Cu ) .	Our calculation predicts that all these systems possess inverse Heusler alloy structure in their respective ground states .	Application of tetragonal distortion lowers the energy with respect to the cubic phase for all the materials .	The equilibrium volumes of both the phases are nearly same .	These observations indicate that they are prone to undergo martensitic transition .
1	Along the lines of previous preon models positing a substructure to explain these aspects , Bilson-Thompson showed how the first family of elementary particles is realized as the crossings of braids made of three strands , with charges resulting from twists of those strands with certain conditions ; in this topological model , there are only two distinct neutrino states .	The Standard Model of particle physics provides very accurate predictions of phenomena occurring at the sub-atomic level , but the reason for the choice of symmetry group and the large number of particles considered elementary , is still unknown .	Modeling the particles as braids implies these braids must be the representation space of a Lie algebra , giving the symmetries of the Standard Model .	In this paper , this representation is made explicit , obtaining the raising operators associated with the Lie algebra of $ SU ( 5 ) $ , one of the earliest grand unified theories .	Because the braids form a group , the action of these operators are braids themselves , leading to their identification as gauge bosons .
2	In the recently published Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) catalogue , we found 52 stars with transiting planets .	Debris discs are known to exist around many planet-host stars , but no debris dust has been found so far in systems with transiting planets .	Using publicly available catalogues , we searched for infrared excesses in such systems .	Two systems with one transiting `` hot Jupiter '' each , TrES-2 and XO-5 , exhibit small excesses both at 12 and 22 microns at a & gt ; 3 sigma level .	Provided that one or both of these detections are real , the frequency of warm excesses in systems with transiting planets of 2-4 % is comparable to that around solar-type stars probed at similar wavelengths with Spitzer 's MIPS and IRS instruments .
4	Numerical results reveal the outperformance of the proposed OLR against known linear receivers , mostly in environments with high interference and certain user mobility , as well as that massive MIMO is preferable even in time-varying channel conditions .	We consider the uplink of non-cooperative multi-cellular systems deploying multiple antenna elements at the base stations ( BS ) , covering both the cases of conventional and very large number of antennas .	Given the inevitable pilot contamination and an arbitrary path-loss for each link , we address the impact of time variation of the channel due to the relative movement between users and BS antennas , which limits system 's performance even if the number antennas is increased , as shown .	In particular , we propose an optimal linear receiver ( OLR ) maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ( SINR ) .	Closed-form lower and upper bounds are derived as well as the deterministic equivalent of the OLR is obtained .
0	We study a spin 1 Bose condensate small enough to be treated as a single magnetic `domain ' : a system that we term a microcondensate .	Because all particles occupy a single spatial mode , this quantum many body system has a well defined classical limit consisting of three degrees of freedom , corresponding to the three macroscopically occupied spin states .	We study both the classical limit and its quantization , finding an integrable system in both cases .	Depending on the sign of the ratio of the spin interaction energy and the quadratic Zeeman energy , the classical limit displays either a separartrix in phase space , or Hamiltonian monodromy corresponding to non-trivial phase space topology .	We discuss the quantum signatures of these classical phenomena using semiclassical quantization as well as an exact solution using the Bethe ansatz .
4	Besides indicating the robustness of the model to describe earthquake dynamics , those findings reinforce that conservative and non conservative versions of the OFC model are qualitatively different .	We show that the well established Olami-Feder-Christensen ( OFC ) model for the dynamics of earthquakes is able to reproduce a new striking property of real earthquake data .	Recently , it has been pointed out by Abe and Suzuki that the epicenters of earthquakes could be connected in order to generate a graph , with properties of a scale-free network of the Barabasi-Albert type .	However , only the non conservative version of the Olami-Feder-Christensen model is able to reproduce this behavior .	The conservative version , instead , behaves like a random graph .
0	We study the problem of finding large cuts in $ d $ -regular triangle-free graphs .	In prior work , Shearer ( 1992 ) gives a randomised algorithm that finds a cut of expected size $ ( 1/2 + 0.177/\sqrt { d } ) m $ , where $ m $ is the number of edges .	We give a simpler algorithm that does much better : it finds a cut of expected size $ ( 1/2 + 0.28125/\sqrt { d } ) m $ .	As a corollary , this shows that in any $ d $ -regular triangle-free graph there exists a cut of at least this size .	Our algorithm can be interpreted as a very efficient randomised distributed algorithm : each node needs to produce only one random bit , and the algorithm runs in one synchronous communication round .
0	Subdiffusive fractional equations are not structurally stable with respect to spatial perturbations to the anomalous exponent ( Phys.Rev .	E 85 , 031132 ( 2012 ) ) .	The question arises of applicability of these fractional equations to model real world phenomena .	To rectify this problem we propose the inclusion of the random death process into the random walk scheme from which we arrive at the modified fractional master equation .	We analyze the asymptotic behavior of this equation , both analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation , and show that this equation is structurally stable against spatial variations of anomalous exponent .
3	24 ( 1996 ) 992-1024 ] does not hold when the stochastic regression model includes an unknown intercept or when the characteristic polynomial of the unstable autoregressive model has a unit root .	This paper studies the residual empirical process of long- and short-memory time series regression models and establishes its uniform expansion under a general framework .	The results are applied to the stochastic regression models and unstable autoregressive models .	For the long-memory noise , it is shown that the limit distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic studied in Ho and Hsing [ Ann.Statist .	To this end , two new statistics are proposed to test for the distribution of the long-memory noises of stochastic regression models and unstable autoregressive models .
4	All of these quantities were computed for couplings around the unitary regime in the range -0.5 \le ( k_F a ) ^ { -1 } \le 0.2 , where a is the s-wave scattering length and k_F is the Fermi momentum of a non-interacting gas at the same density .	The Quantum Monte Carlo method for spin 1/2 fermions at finite temperature is formulated for dilute systems with an s-wave interaction .	The motivation and the formalism are discussed along with descriptions of the algorithm and various numerical issues .	We report on results for the energy , entropy and chemical potential as a function of temperature .	We give upper bounds on the critical temperature T_c for the onset of superfluidity , obtained by studying the finite size scaling of the condensate fraction .
0	It is argued that every measurement is made in a certain scale .	The scale in which present measuments are made is called present scale which gives present knowledge .	Quantities at the limits to present measurement may be observables in other scales .	Cantor 's series of infinites is used to describe scales of measurement .	Continuum Hypothesis and Schroedinger Cat are discussed .
0	Based on the use of different exponential bases to define class-dependent error bounds , a new and highly efficient asymmetric boosting scheme , coined as AdaBoostDB ( Double-Base ) , is proposed .	Supported by a fully theoretical derivation procedure , unlike most of the other approaches in the literature , our algorithm preserves all the formal guarantees and properties of original ( cost-insensitive ) AdaBoost , similarly to the state-of-the-art Cost-Sensitive AdaBoost algorithm .	However , the key advantage of AdaBoostDB is that our novel derivation scheme enables an extremely efficient conditional search procedure , dramatically improving and simplifying the training phase of the algorithm .	Experiments , both over synthetic and real datasets , reveal that AdaBoostDB is able to save over 99 % training time with regard to Cost-Sensitive AdaBoost , providing the same cost-sensitive results .	This computational advantage of AdaBoostDB can make a difference in problems managing huge pools of weak classifiers in which boosting techniques are commonly used .
0	Non-modal amplification of disturbances in streamwise-constant channel flows of Oldroyd-B fluids is studied from an input-output point of view by analyzing the responses of the velocity components to spatio-temporal body forces .	These inputs into the governing equations are assumed to be harmonic in the spanwise direction and stochastic in the wall-normal direction and in time .	An explicit Reynolds number scaling of frequency responses from different forcing to different velocity components is developed , showing the same $ Re $ -dependence as in Newtonian fluids .	It is found that some of the frequency response components peak at non-zero temporal frequencies .	This is in contrast to Newtonian fluids , where peaks are always observed at zero frequency , suggesting that viscoelastic effects introduce additional timescales and promote development of flow patterns with smaller time constants than in Newtonian fluids .
1	First , a tip-substrate configuration is used ; second , calculations are carried in the presence of an external potential bias ; third , the image potential that reflects the interaction of the electron with the mobile metal electrons is taken into account in the static image approximation .	This paper presents results of numerical simulations of electron tunneling through water that extend our previous calculations on such systems in several ways .	Finally , all-to-all transmission probability calculations are performed in order to get an order-of-magnitude estimate of the current-voltage characteristics of this junction model .	The computed currents are within the range of the few available experimental observations on scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) currents in water , indicating that our calculation may have taken into account all the important physical attributes of such systems .	In addition we examine the effect of the water medium on the spatial distribution of the tunneling flux .
3	This places the source in the category of X-ray bursters showing high-energy emission .	We study the 4-200 keV spectral and temporal behaviour of the low mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 with INTEGRAL during 2003-2005 .	This source as been observed in both the soft ( banana ) and hard ( island ) spectral states .	A high energy tail , above 50 keV , in the hard state has been observed for the first time .	The tail can be modeled as a soft power law component , with the photon index of ~2.4 , on top of thermal Comptonization emission from a plasma with the electron temperature of kT_e~6 keV and optical depth of \tau~4 .
4	( 1997 ) addresses this naturally .	Recent observations suggest that dwarf galaxies pervade the universe , for they have been encountered in large numbers in all the environments .	However , we present evidence that suggests dwarf galaxies may be subject to strong dynamical processes in high density environments , the combined effects of multiple encounters and the tidal effects due to the potential well of rich clusters could result in the effective disruption of dwarf galaxies in the clusters ' central regions .	Alternatively , the lack of dwarf galaxies in rich environments has been interpreted in terms of a `` density-morphology relation '' : dwarf galaxies prefer low density environments ( Phillipps et al.1998 ) .	We argue that such an explanation can not account for the relationship between the cD halo luminosity and the gas mass in the ICM , whereas the dwarf disruption scenario proposed by Lopez-Cruz et al .
1	For moderate laser power ( $ & lt ; $ 85 mW ) we are able to capture around 40 % of the cold atoms .	We report measurements on the guiding of cold $ ^ { 87 } $ Rb atoms from a magneto-optical trap by a continuous light beam over a vertical distance of 6.5 mm .	Although the guide is red-detuned , the optical scattering rate at this detuning ( $ \approx $ 70 GHz ) is acceptably low .	For lower detuning ( $ & lt ; $ 30 GHz ) a larger fraction was guided but radiation pressure starts to push the atoms upward , effectively lowering the acceleration due to gravity .	The measured guided fraction agrees well with an analytical model .
4	The underlying mechanism is found to be the match and mismatch of the spectra of lattice vibration in two parts .	We study thermal rectifying effect in two dimensional ( 2D ) systems consisting of the Frenkel Kontorva ( FK ) lattice and the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam ( FPU ) lattice .	It is found that the rectifying effect is related to the asymmetrical interface thermal resistance .	The rectifying efficiency is typically about two orders of magnitude which is large enough to be observed in experiment .	The dependence of rectifying efficiency on the temperature and temperature gradient is studied .
3	Fortunately , loop quantum cosmology ( LQC ) has the potential to serve as a bridge connecting the classical theory and quantum gravity .	Wormhole and time machine are very interesting objects in general relativity .	However , they need exotic matters which are impossible in classical level to support them .	But if we introduce the quantum effects of gravity into the stress-energy tensor , these peculiar objects can be constructed self-consistently .	Therefore it provides a simple way for the study of quantum effect in the semiclassical case .
0	This paper is concerned with the death-birth updating process .	This model is an example of a spatial game in which players located on the~ $ d $ -dimensional integer lattice are characterized by one of two possible strategies and update their strategy at rate one by mimicking one of their neighbors chosen at random with a probability proportional to the neighbor 's payoff .	To understand the role of space in the form of local interactions , the process is compared with its non-spatial deterministic counterpart for well-mixing populations , which is described by the replicator equation .	To begin with , we prove that , provided the range of the interactions is sufficiently large , both strategies coexist on the lattice for a parameter region where the replicator equation also exhibits coexistence .	Then , we identify parameter regions in which there is a dominant strategy that always wins on the lattice whereas the replicator equation displays either coexistence or bistability .
3	For dimensions less than $ d_c=2 $ we find a strong -- coupling fixed point , which diverges at $ d=2 $ , indicating that there is non -- perturbative strong -- coupling behavior for all $ d \geq 2 $ .	A systematic analysis of the Burgers -- Kardar -- Parisi -- Zhang equation in $ d+1 $ dimensions by dynamic renormalization group theory is described .	The fixed points and exponents are calculated to two -- loop order .	We use the dimensional regularization scheme , carefully keeping the full $ d $ dependence originating from the angular parts of the loop integrals .	At $ d=1 $ our method yields the identical fixed point as in the one -- loop approximation , and the two -- loop contributions to the scaling functions are non -- singular .
0	In this letter we discuss a relevance of the 3D Perfect Bose gas ( PBG ) condensation in extremely elongated vessels for the study of anisotropic condensate coherence and the `` quasi-condensate '' .	To this end we analyze the case of exponentially anisotropic ( van den Berg ) boxes , when there are two critical densities $ \rho_c & lt ; \rho_m $ for a generalised Bose-Einstein Condensation ( BEC ) .	Here $ \rho_c $ is the standard critical density for the PBG .	We consider three examples of anisotropic geometry : slabs , squared beams and `` cigars '' to demonstrate that the `` quasi-condensate '' which exists in domain $ \rho_c & lt ; \rho & lt ; \rho_m $ is in fact the van den Berg-Lewis-Pul\'e generalised condensation ( vdBLP-GC ) of the type III with no macroscopic occupation of any mode .	We show that for the slab geometry the second critical density $ \rho_m $ is a threshold between quasi- two-dimensional ( quasi-2D ) condensate and the three dimensional ( 3D ) regime when there is a coexistence of the `` quasi-condensate '' with the standard one-mode BEC .
4	A scenario for the possible breakdown of the theory for a very long time is outlined .	For the Nonlinear Shr\ '' odinger Equation with disorder it was found numerically that in some regime of the parameters Anderson localization is destroyed and subdiffusion takes place for a long time interval .	It was argued that the nonlinear term acts as random noise .	In the present work the properties of this effective noise are studied numerically .	Some assumptions made in earlier work were verified , the dependence of various quantities on the localization length of the linear problem were computed .
2	The bulk four-dimensional theory has four supercharges ; half-criticality of the non-Abelian strings would imply then N=1 supersymmetry on the world sheet , i.e.two supercharges .	We consider non-Abelian 1/2 BPS flux tubes ( strings ) in a deformed N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory , with mass terms mu_ { 1,2 } of the adjoint fields breaking N=2 down to N=1 .	The main feature of the non-Abelian strings is the occurrence of orientational moduli associated with the possibility of rotations of their color fluxes inside a global SU ( N ) group .	In fact , superalgebra of the reduced moduli space has four supercharges .	Internal dynamics of the orientational moduli are described by two-dimensional CP ( N-1 ) model on the string world sheet .
4	Also shown are MACHO data of the first microlensing event ever detected substantially before peak amplification , the first detection of parallax effects in a microlensing event , and the first caustic crossing to be resolved in a microlensing event .	We review recent gravitational microlensing results from the EROS , MACHO , and OGLE collaborations , and present some details of the very latest MACHO results toward the Galactic Bulge .	The MACHO collaboration has now discovered in excess of 40 microlensing events toward the Galactic Bulge during the 1993 observing season .	A preliminary analysis of this data suggests a much higher microlensing optical depth than predicted by standard galactic models suggesting that these models will have to be revised .	This may have important implications for the structure of the Galaxy and its dark halo .
4	For hyperbolic and parabolic lattices S_0 it has been proved by the author before ( 1980 , 1995 ) .	By the fundamental result of I.I .	Piatetsky-Shapiro and I.R .	Shafarevich ( 1971 ) , the automorphism group Aut ( X ) of a K3 surface X over C and its action on the Picard lattice S_X are prescribed by the Picard lattice S_X .	We use this result and our method ( 1980 ) to show finiteness of the set of Picard lattices S_X of rank $ \ge 3 $ such that the automorphism group Aut ( X ) of the K3 surface X has a non-trivial invariant sublattice S_0 in S_X where the group Aut ( X ) acts as a finite group .
1	Here we study the surface energy of the two-component superconductor and show that the sign of surface energy is determined not only by the Ginzburg-Landau parameters $ \kappa_i ( i=1,2 ) $ of two superconducting components , but also by a temperature independent parameter $ \kappa_\xi $ , which is defined as the ratio of the coherence lengths of two components .	Existence of thermodynamically stable composite vortices in a two-component superconductor may form distinctive vortex patterns , and may lead to type-1.5 superconductivity .	Since the negative surface energy conduces to the invasion of thermodynamically stable composite vortices into a superconductor , the criterions for stability of composite vortex are these three independent dimensionless parameters .	We find that there can exist thermodynamically stable composite vortex in a type-1+type-2 or type-2+type-2 material .	We also predict that unusual vortex patterns like those observed in $ MgB_2 $ ( V. Moshchalkov et al , Phys.Rev .
1	A relatively small electron-phonon contribution into the pair-transfer interaction can cause effects of observed magnitude .	Isotope effects in a multiband superconductor with a leading interband pairing channel are investigated .	A multiband model which interpolates the cuprate properties is used for illustrative calculations .	Isotope exponents of the transition temperature ( $ \alpha $ ) , supercarrier density ( $ \alpha_n $ ) , paired carrier effective mass ( $ \alpha_m $ ) and of the penetration depth ( $ \alpha_ { \lambda } $ ) on the doping scale have been obtained .	The known opposite trend of $ \alpha $ and $ T_c $ is reflected .
1	We will prove that this is not just a possible , but a necessary consequence of information transfer from A to B .	It is widely known that `collapse of the wave function ' on a quantum system A may be brought about by an interaction with another quantum system B .	We generalize this in order to explain why coherences are normally not observed in macroscopic quantum systems .	Finally , we provide a quantitative insight into the balance between information gain and state disturbance .	We define the quality of an information transfer .
2	It is shown that this extended model possesses a classically flat `` shifted '' trajectory which acquires a slope via one-loop radiative corrections and can be used as inflationary path .	A new shifted hybrid inflationary scenario is introduced which , in contrast to the older one , relies only on renormalizable superpotential terms .	This scenario is automatically realized in a concrete extension of the `` minimal '' supersymmetric Pati-Salam model which naturally leads to a moderate violation of Yukawa unification so that , for mu & gt ; 0 , the predicted b-quark mass is acceptable even with universal boundary conditions .	The constraints from the cosmic background explorer can be met with natural values of the relevant parameters .	Also , there is no disastrous production of magnetic monopoles after inflation since the Pati-Salam gauge group is already broken on the `` shifted '' path .
0	We analyze the cosmological signatures visible to an observer in a Coleman-de Luccia bubble when another such bubble collides with it .	We use a gluing procedure to generalize the results of Freivogel , Horowitz , and Shenker to the case of a general cosmological constant in each bubble and study the resulting spacetimes .	The collision breaks the isotropy and homogeneity of the bubble universe and provides a cosmological `` axis of evil '' which can affect the cosmic microwave background in several unique and potentially detectable ways .	Unlike more conventional perturbations to the inflationary initial state , these signatures can survive even relatively long periods of inflation .	In addition , we find that for a given collision the observers in the bubble with smaller cosmological constant are safest from collisions with domain walls , possibly providing another anthropic selection principle for small positive vacuum energy .
1	The data provide the first opportunity to track the evolution of the principal spectral features .	We present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova GW Librae during its rare April 2007 super-outburst and compare these with quiescent epochs .	In the early stages of the outburst , the optically thick disc dominates the optical and the line components show clear orbital radial velocity excursions .	In the course of several weeks , optically thin regions become more prominent as strong emission lines replace the broad disc absorption .	Post-outburst spectroscopy covering the I-band illustrates the advantages of CaII relative to the commonly used Balmer lines when attempting to constrain binary parameters .
3	Discrete properties of the lattice allow the prediction of scales at which microscopic to cosmic structures should occur .	Spacetime is represented by ordered sequences of topologically closed Poincare sections of the primary space constructed of primary empty cells .	These mappings are constrained to provide homeomorphic structures serving as frames of reference in order to account for the successive positions of any objects present in the system .	Mappings from one to the next section involve morphisms of the general structures .	Deformations of primary cells by exchange of empty set cells allow a cell to be mapped into an image cell in the next section as far as mapped cells remain homeomorphic .
2	These parametric models are used to infer ages , star formation rates and stellar masses for a mock data set drawn from a hierarchical semi-analytic model of galaxy evolution .	We explore methods to improve the estimates of star formation rates and mean stellar population ages from broadband photometry of high redshift star-forming galaxies .	We use synthetic spectral templates with a variety of simple parametric star formation histories to fit broadband spectral energy distributions .	Traditional parametric models generally assume an exponentially declining rate of star-formation after an initial instantaneous rise .	Our results show that star formation histories with a much more gradual rise in the star formation rate are likely to be better templates , and are likely to give better overall estimates of the age distribution and star formation rate distribution of Lyman break galaxies .
0	It is believed that albatrosses power their flight through dynamic soaring , a technique where energy is extracted from horizontally blowing shear winds .	The Rayleigh model of dynamic soaring , also called the two layer model , makes a 2-dimensional approximation of the wind field and glider trajectory .	This note considers the `` Rayleigh problem '' of finding the minimum wind necessary for the existence of energy neutral gliding cycles .	We utilize a 3-degree of freedom glider model with quadratic drag .	Asymptotic solutions in the limit of large glide ratios are obtained .
3	For a fixed bulk concentration we find that upon increasing the fluid particle size one strongly increases the local concentration nearby the colloidal surface and that the particles become laterally ordered .	In this Letter we investigate the mechanism for overcharging of a single spherical colloid in the presence of aqueous salts within the framework of the primitive model by molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations as well as integral-equation theory .	We find that the occurrence and strength of overcharging strongly depends on the salt-ion size , and the available volume in the fluid .	To understand the role of the excluded volume of the microions , we first consider an uncharged system .	For a charged system the first surface layer is built up predominantly by strongly correlated counterions .
1	We find that OH and CN , usually used in Zeeman observations of the line-of-sight magnetic field , have an abundance that decreases toward the center of the core much faster than the density increases .	We study the effect that non-equilibrium chemistry in dynamical models of collapsing molecular cloud cores has on measurements of the magnetic field in these cores , the degree of ionization , and the mean molecular weight of ions .	As a result , Zeeman observations tend to sample the outer layers of the core and consistently underestimate the core magnetic field .	The degree of ionization follows a complicated dependence on the number density at central densities up to 10^5 cm^ { -3 } for magnetic models and 10^6 cm^ { -3 } in non-magnetic models .	At higher central densities the scaling approaches a power-law with a slope of -0.6 and a normalization which depends on the cosmic-ray ionization rate { \zeta } and the temperature T as ( { \zeta } T ) ^1/2 .
4	It is shown that in the case of two specific geometries both effects are separable .	We investigate both experimentally and theoretically , the magneto-gyrotropic photogalvanic effect in zinc-blende based quantum wells with $ C_ { 2v } $ point-group symmetry using optical excitation in the terahertz frequency range .	The investigated frequencies cause intra-subband but no inter-band and inter-subband transitions .	While at normal incidence the photocurrent vanishes at zero magnetic field , it is shown that an in-plane magnetic field generates photocurrents both for polarized and unpolarized excitation .	In general the spin-galvanic effect , caused by circularly polarized light , and the magneto-gyrotropic effect , caused by unpolarized excitation , is superimposed .
0	We provide a quantitative description and statistical interpretation of the optical continuum variability of quasars .	The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) has obtained repeated imaging in five UV-to-IR photometric bands for 33,881 spectroscopically confirmed quasars .	About 10,000 quasars have an average of 60 observations in each band obtained over a decade along Stripe 82 ( S82 ) , whereas the remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps .	The observed time lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years , and constrain quasar variability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years , and at rest-frame wavelengths from 1000A to 6000A .	We publicly release a user-friendly catalog of quasars from the SDSS Data Release 7 that have been observed at least twice in SDSS or once in both SDSS and the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey , and we use it to analyze the ensemble properties of quasar variability .
4	Further experimental implications are given .	We construct a quantum Ginsburg-Landau theory to study the quantum phase transition from the excitonic superfluid ( ESF ) to a possible pseudo-spin density wave ( PSDW ) at some intermediate distances driven by the magneto-roton minimum collapsing at a finite wavevector .	We analyze the properties of the PSDW and explicitly show that a square lattice is the favorite lattice .	We suggest that correlated hopping of vacancies in the active and passive layers in the PSDW state leads to very large and temperature dependent drag consistent with the experimental data .	Comparisons with previous microscopic numerical calculations are made .
2	The compression was found to be extremely strong from 1846 to 2035 UT when the dense plasma of fast erupting filament produced the solar wind dynamic pressure Pd peaked up to & gt ; 100 nPa and , in the first time , the upstream solar wind was observed at geosynchronous orbit during almost 2 hours .	Dynamics of the dayside magnetosphere and proton radiation belt was analyzed during unusual magnetic storm on 21 January 2005 .	We have found that during the storm from 1712 to 2400 UT , the subsolar magnetopause was continuously located inside geosynchronous orbit due to strong compression .	Under the extreme compression , the outer magnetosphere at L & gt ; 5 was pushed inward and the outer radiation belt particles with energies of several tens of keV moved earthward , became adiabatically accelerated and accumulated in the inner magnetosphere at L & lt ; 4 that produced the intensified ring current with an exceptionally long lifetime .	The observations were compared with predictions of various empirical and first principles models .
1	Their own geometric properties , however , have not been studied much .	Chains of minimal degree rational curves have been used as an important tool in the study of Fano manifolds .	The goal of the paper is to introduce an infinitesimal method to study chains of minimal rational curves via varieties of minimal rational tangents and their higher secants .	For many examples of Fano manifolds this method can be used to compute the minimal length of chains needed to join two general points .	One consequence of our computation is a bound on the multiplicities of divisors at a general point of the moduli of stable bundles of rank two on a curve .
4	We will show that if the linear sampling matrix satisfy certain assumptions and the regularizing norm is decomposable , proximal-gradient homotopy algorithm converges with a \emph { linear rate } even though the objective function is not strongly convex .	In this paper we study the convergence rate of proximal-gradient homotopy algorithm for norm-regularized linear least squares problems .	Homotopy algorithm reduces the regularization parameter in a series of steps , and uses proximal-gradient algorithm to solve the problem at each step .	Proximal-gradient algorithm has a linear rate of convergence given that the objective function is strongly convex and the gradient of the smooth component of the objective function is Lipschitz continuous .	In general , the objective function in this type of problems is not strongly convex , especially when the problem is high-dimensional .
4	In this paper , we enumerate desirable asymptotic behavior that may be of interest for modeling graph data , including sparsity and several types of power laws .	Network data appear in a number of applications , such as online social networks and biological networks , and there is growing interest in both developing models for networks as well as studying the properties of such data .	Since individual network datasets continue to grow in size , it is necessary to develop models that accurately represent the real-life scaling properties of networks .	One behavior of interest is having a power law in the degree distribution .	However , other types of power laws that have been observed empirically and considered for applications such as clustering and feature allocation models have not been studied as frequently in models for graph data .
3	Galaxies with -21 & lt ; M_r & lt ; -18 mainly have exponential profiles in low density environments and de Vaucouleurs profiles in high density environments .	Using a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) Data Release 4 , we study the trends relating surface brightness profile type and apparent axis ratio to the local galaxy environment .	We use the SDSS parameter `fracDeV ' to quantify the profile type .	We find that galaxies with M_r & gt ; -18 are mostly described by exponential profiles in all environments .	The most luminous galaxies , with M_r & lt ; -21 , are mostly described by de Vaucouleurs profiles in all environments .
2	It will be proved that the cohomological vector fields induce the finite dimensional Leibniz algebras by the derived bracket construction .	By using help of algebraic operad theory , Leibniz algebra theory and symplectic-Poisson geometry are connected .	We introduce the notion of cohomological vector field defined on nongraded symplectic plane .	This proposition is a Leibniz analogue of the cohomological field theory in the category of Lie algebras .	The basic properties of the cohomological fields will be studied , in particular , we discuss a factorization problem with the cohomological fields and introduce the notion of double-algebra in the category of Leibniz algebras .
1	The Higgs mass parameter is generated at one loop level by two different , moderately fine-tuned sources of the global symmetry breaking .	We propose a novel mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking in supersymmetric models , as the one recently discussed by Birkedal , Chacko and Gaillard , in which the Standard Model Higgs doublet is a pseudo-Goldstone boson of some global symmetry .	The mechanism works for scalar superpartner masses of order 10 TeV , but gauginos can be light .	The scale at which supersymmetry breaking is mediated to the visible sector has to be low , of order 100 TeV .	Fine-tuning in the scalar potential is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than in the MSSM with similar soft scalar masses .
1	Gas dynamical motion of interstellar medium driven by gamma ray burst is investigated in 2D approximation for different initial density distributions of host galaxy matter and different total energy of gamma ray burst .	Interaction of cosmological gamma ray burst radiation with the dense interstellar medium of host galaxy is considered .	The maximum velocity of motion of interstellar medium is $ 1.8\cdot10^4 $ km/s .	Light curves of gamma ray burst afterglow are calculated for set of non homogeneous density , distribution gamma ray burst total energy , and different viewing angles .	Spectra of gamma ray burst afterglow are modeled taking into account conversion of hard photons ( soft X-ray , hard UV ) to soft UV and optics photons .
4	We also suggest a new interaction , acting only among neutrinos , that could induce a neutrino Majorana mass of order 1 eV .	We investigate the possibility that neutrinos form superfluid-type condensates in background cosmological densities .	Such condensates could give rise to small neutrino masses and splittings , as well as an important contribution , perhaps , to the cosmological constant .	We discuss various channels in the context of the standard model .	Many of these do not support a condensate , but some mixed-flavor channels do .
0	In this paper we derive information theoretic performance bounds to sensing and reconstruction of sparse phenomena from noisy projections .	We consider two settings : output noise models where the noise enters after the projection and input noise models where the noise enters before the projection .	We consider two types of distortion for reconstruction : support errors and mean-squared errors .	Our goal is to relate the number of measurements , $ m $ , and $ \snr $ , to signal sparsity , $ k $ , distortion level , $ d $ , and signal dimension , $ n $ .	We consider support errors in a worst-case setting .
0	Imperfections in the crystal structure , such as point defects , can strongly modify the optical and transport properties of materials .	Here , we study the effect of point defects on the optical and DC conductivities of single layers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides with the form $ M $ S $ _2 $ , where $ M $ =Mo or W. The electronic structure is considered within a six bands tight-binding model , which accounts for the relevant combination of $ d $ orbitals of the metal $ M $ and $ p $ orbitals of the chalcogen $ S $ .	We use the Kubo formula for the calculation of the conductivity in samples with different distributions of disorder .	We find that $ M $ and/or S defects create mid-gap states that localize charge carriers around the defects and which modify the optical and transport properties of the material , in agreement with recent experiments .	Furthermore , our results indicate a much higher mobility for $ p $ -doped WS $ _2 $ in comparison to MoS $ _2 $ .
4	Grain differential sizes as well as the effect of radiation pressure are taken into account .	The vertical thickness of debris discs is often used as a measure of these systems ' dynamical excitation and as clues to the presence of hidden massive perturbers such as planetary embryos .	However , this argument could be flawed because the observed dust should be naturally placed on inclined orbits by the combined effect of radiation pressure and mutual collisions .	We critically reinvestigate this issue and numerically estimate what the `` natural '' vertical thickness of a collisionally evolving disc is , in the absence of any additional perturbing body .	We use a deterministic collisional code , following the dynamical evolution of a population of indestructible test grains suffering mutual inelastic impacts .
0	Multiview light sheet fluorescence microscopy ( LSFM ) allows to image developing organisms in 3D at unprecedented temporal resolution over long periods of time .	The resulting massive amounts of raw image data requires extensive processing interactively via dedicated graphical user interface ( GUI ) applications .	The consecutive processing steps can be easily automated and the individual time points can be processed independently , which lends itself to trivial parallelization on a high performance cluster ( HPC ) .	Here we introduce an automated workflow for processing large multiview , multi-channel , multi-illumination time-lapse LSFM data on a single workstation or in parallel on a HPC .	The pipeline relies on snakemake to resolve dependencies among consecutive processing steps and can be easily adapted to any cluster environment for processing LSFM data in a fraction of the time required to collect it .
1	However , the amount of collected data is increasing , which makes analysis more difficult .	Huge datasets in cyber security , such as network traffic logs , can be analyzed using machine learning and data mining methods .	Many machine learning methods have not been designed for big datasets , and consequently are slow and difficult to understand .	We address the issue of efficient network traffic classification by creating an intrusion detection framework that applies dimensionality reduction and conjunctive rule extraction .	The system can perform unsupervised anomaly detection and use this information to create conjunctive rules that classify huge amounts of traffic in real time .
3	By taking global sections of a D-module , we obtain a functor $ \Gamma : D_\kappa ( Gr_G ) -mod\to { \mathfrak g } _\kappa-mod $ .	Let $ { \mathfrak g } $ be a simple Lie algebra .	For a level $ \kappa $ ( thought of as a symmetric $ { \mathfrak g } $ -invariant form of $ { \mathfrak g } $ ) , let $ \hat { \mathfrak g } _\kappa $ be the corresponding affine Kac-Moody algebra .	Let $ Gr_G $ be the affine Grassmannian of $ { \mathfrak g } $ , and let $ D_\kappa ( Gr_G ) -mod $ be the category of $ \kappa $ -twisted right D-modules on $ Gr_G $ .	It is known that this functor is exact and faithful when $ \kappa $ is negative or irrational .
2	To gain awareness about the action value the agents accumulate in their memory the rewards obtained from taking a specific action at each moment of time .	A continuous time model for multiagent systems governed by reinforcement learning with scale-free memory is developed .	The agents are assumed to act independently of one another in optimizing their choice of possible actions via trial-and-error search .	The contribution of the rewards in the past to the agent current perception of action value is described by an integral operator with a power-law kernel .	Finally a fractional differential equation governing the system dynamics is obtained .
0	Given any finite simplicial complex \Delta , we show how to construct a new simplicial complex \Delta_ { \chi } that is balanced and vertex decomposable .	Moreover , we show that the h-vector of the simplicial complex \Delta_ { \chi } is precisely the f-vector , denoted f ( \Delta ) , of the original complex \Delta .	We deduce this result by relating f ( \Delta ) with the graded Betti numbers of the Alexander dual of \Delta_ { \chi } .	Our construction generalizes the `` whiskering '' construction of Villarreal , and Cook and Nagel .	As a corollary of our work , we add a new equivalent statement to a theorem of Bj\ '' orner , Frankl , and Stanley that classifies the f-vectors of simplicial complexes .
0	We consider a server serving a time-slotted queued system of multiple packet-based flows , with exogenous packet arrivals and time-varying service rates .	At each time , the server can observe instantaneous service rates for only a subset of flows ( from within a fixed collection of observable subsets ) before scheduling a flow in the subset for service .	We are interested in queue-length aware scheduling to keep the queues short , and develop scheduling algorithms that use only partial service rate information from subsets of channels to minimize the likelihood of queue overflow in the system .	Specifically , we present a new joint subset-sampling and scheduling algorithm called Max-Exp that uses only the current queue lengths to pick a subset of flows , and subsequently schedules a flow using the Exponential rule .	When the collection of observable subsets is disjoint , we show that Max-Exp achieves the best exponential decay rate , among all scheduling algorithms using partial information , of the tail of the longest queue in the system .
2	There exist 6 kinds of orientational domains , which are related with a permutation or a mirror symmetry .	A simple planar model for an orientational ordering of threefold molecules on a triangular lattice modelling a close-packed ( 111 ) plane of fullerite is considered .	The system has 3-sublattice ordered ground state which includes 3 different molecular orientations .	Interdomain walls are found to be rather narrow .	The model molecules have two-well orientational potential profiles , which are slightly effected by a presence of a straight domain wall .
0	With the wealth of high-throughput sequencing data generated by recent large-scale consortia , predictive gene expression modelling has become an important tool for integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenetic data .	However , sequencing data-sets are characteristically large , and previously modelling frameworks are typically inefficient and unable to leverage multi-core or distributed processing architectures .	In this study , we detail an efficient and parallelised MapReduce implementation of gene expression modelling .	We leverage the computational efficiency of this framework to provide an integrative analysis of over fifty histone modification data-sets across a variety of cancerous and non-cancerous cell-lines .	Our results demonstrate that the genome-wide relationships between histone modifications and mRNA transcription are lineage , tissue and karyotype-invariant , and that models trained on matched epigenetic/transcriptomic data from non-cancerous cell-lines are able to predict cancerous expression with equivalent genome-wide fidelity .
0	We present a deep image of the radio galaxy MRC 1138-262 taken with the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) at a redshift of z = 2.2 .	The galaxy is known to have properties of a cD galaxy progenitor and be surrounded by a 3 Mpc-sized structure , identified with a protocluster .	The morphology shown on the new deep HST/ACS image is reminiscent of a spider 's web .	More than 10 individual clumpy features are observed , apparently star-forming satellite galaxies in the process of merging with the progenitor of a dominant cluster galaxy 11 Gyr ago .	There is an extended emission component , implying that star formation was occurring over a 50 times 40 kpc region at a rate of more than 100 M_sun/yr .
1	We show that the class of languages recognized by quantum multi-prover interactive proof systems , QMIP , is equal to MIP* , the class of languages recognized by classical multi-prover interactive proof systems where the provers share entanglement .	The way entanglement influences the power of quantum and classical multi-prover interactive proof systems is a long-standing open question .	After the recent result by Jain , Ji , Upadhyay and Watrous showing that QIP=IP , our work completes the picture from the verifier 's perspective by showing that also in the setting of multiple provers with shared entanglement , a quantum verifier is no more powerful than a classical one : QMIP=MIP* .	Our techniques are based on the adaptation of universal blind quantum computation ( a protocol recently introduced by us ) to the context of interactive proof systems .	We show that in the multi-prover scenario , shared entanglement has a positive effect in removing the need for a quantum verifier .
2	Also , the existence of a family of global attractors is shown to exist .	Under consideration is the damped semilinear wave equation \ [ u_ { tt } +u_t-\Delta u + u + f ( u ) =0 \ ] on a bounded domain $ \Omega $ in $ \mathbb { R } ^3 $ with a perturbation parameter $ \varepsilon & gt ; 0 $ occurring in an acoustic boundary condition , limiting ( $ \varepsilon=0 $ ) to a Robin boundary condition .	With minimal assumptions on the nonlinear term $ f $ , the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions is shown for each $ \varepsilon\in [ 0,1 ] $ .	After proving a general result concerning the upper-semicontinuity of a one-parameter family of sets , the result is applied to the family of global attractors .	Because of the complicated boundary conditions for the perturbed problem , fractional powers of the Laplacian are not well-defined ; moreover , because of the restrictive growth assumptions on $ f $ , the family of global attractors is obtained from the asymptotic compactness method developed by J .
0	We classify two classes of B_2-graded Lie algebras which have a second compatible grading by an abelian group A : ( a ) graded-simple Lie algebras for A torsion-free and ( b ) division-A-graded Lie algebras .	Our results describe the centreless cores of a class of affine reflection Lie algebras , hence apply in particular to the centreless cores of extended affine Lie algebras , the so-called Lie tori , for which we recover results of Allison-Gao and Faulkner .	Our classification ( b ) extends a recent result of Benkart-Yoshii .	Both classifications are consequences of a new description of Jordan algebras covered by a triangle , which correspond to these Lie algebras via the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction .	The Jordan algebra classifications follow from our results on graded-triangulated Jordan triple systems .
0	We reconsider the problem of the superconducting proximity effect in a diffusive ferromagnet bounded by tunneling interfaces , using spin-dependent boundary conditions .	This introduces for each interface a phase-shifting conductance Gphi which results from the spin dependence of the phase shifts acquired by the electrons upon scattering on the interface .	We show that Gphi strongly affects the density of states and supercurrents predicted for superconducting/ferromagnetic hybrid circuits .	We show the relevance of this effect by identifying clear signatures of Gphi in the data of T. Kontos et al [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	86 , 304 ( 2001 ) , ibid .
4	1 ; SF rate ~ 2 Msuns/yr ) .	We detail the rich molecular story of NGC 1266 , its serendipitous discovery within the ATLAS3D survey ( Cappellari et al .	2011 ) and how it plays host to an AGN-driven molecular outflow , potentially quenching all of its star formation ( SF ) within the next 100 Myr .	While major mergers appear to play a role in instigating outflows in other systems , deep imaging of NGC 1266 as well as stellar kinematic observations from SAURON , have failed to provide evidence that NGC 1266 has recently been involved in a major interaction .	The molecular gas and the instantaneous SF tracers indicate that the current sites of star formation are located in a hypercompact disk within 200 pc of the nucleus ( Fig .
1	This includes discussion of the high energy behaviour of total cross-sections , the triple pomeron limit of the diffractive dissociation and the single particle distributions in the central region .	Elements of the pomeron phenomenology within the Regge pole exchange picture are recalled .	The BFKL pomeron and QCD expectations for the small $ x $ behaviour of the deep inelastic scattering structure functions are discussed .	The dedicated measurements of the hadronic final state in deep inelastic scattering at small $ x $ probing the QCD pomeron are described .	The deep inelastic diffraction is also discussed .
3	The stars in our sample show well defined correlations between Al , Na and Si ; Al is anticorrelated with O and Mg .	We study the distribution of aluminum abundances among red giants in the peculiar globular cluster NGC 1851 .	Aluminum abundances were derived from the strong doublet Al I 8772-8773 A measured on intermediate resolution FLAMES spectra of 50 cluster stars acquired under the Gaia-ESO public survey .	We coupled these abundances with previously derived abundance of O , Na , Mg to fully characterize the interplay of the NeNa and MgAl cycles of H-burning at high temperature in the early stellar generation in NGC 1851 .	The average value of the [ Al/Fe ] ratio steadily increases going from the first generation stars to the second generation populations with intermediate and extremely modified composition .
1	In both filters , only the galaxy 's central regions were detected .	We have observed the Blue Compact Dwarf ( BCD ) galaxy He 2-10 in the 10 microns mid-infrared ( MIR ) atmospheric window using broad-band filters centered at lambda=10.1 microns and lambda=11.65 microns .	One of the UV emitting regions is not detected , implying an older age .	The central region contains two resolved components which have the same MIR properties but different Halpha fluxes .	We interpret these properties in terms of differing star forming histories .
2	In the long time limit the spatial density profile becomes scale invariant .	We study the pairwise annihilation process $ A+A\to $ inert of a number of random walkers , which originally are localized in a small region in space .	The size of the colony and the typical distance between particles increases with time and , consequently , the reaction rate goes down .	The mean-field approximation of this scenario bears some surprises .	It predicts an upper critical dimension $ d_c=2 $ , with logarithmic corrections at the critical dimension and nontrivial scaling behavior for d & lt ; 2 .
3	Their radius provides a dynamically generated minimal length acting as a universal short-distance cut-off .	The recently proposed UV self-complete quantum gravity program is a new and very interesting way to envision Planckian/trans-Planckian physics .	in this new framework , high energy scattering is dominated by the creation of micro black holes , and it is experimentally impossible to probe distances shorter than the horizon radius .	In this letter we present a model which realizes this idea through the creation of self-regular quantum black holes admitting a minimal size extremal configuration .	We propose a quantisation scheme for this new kind of microscopic objects based on a Bohr-like approach , which does not require a detailed knowledge of quantum gravity .
2	In such a scenario $ \tilde u_1\to t \tilde\chi^0_1 $ is kinematically not allowed and searches for $ \tilde u_1\to W b \tilde\chi^0_1 $ and $ \tilde u_1\to c \tilde\chi^0_1 $ are performed .	In this article we calculate the 1-loop supersymmetric QCD ( SQCD ) corrections to the decay $ \tilde u_1\to c \tilde\chi^0_1 $ in the MSSM with generic flavour structure .	This decay mode is phenomenologically important if the mass difference between the lightest squark $ \tilde u_1 $ ( which is assumed to be mainly stop-like ) and the neutralino LSP $ \tilde \chi^0_1 $ is smaller than the top mass .	A large decay rate for $ \tilde u_1\to c \tilde\chi^0_1 $ can weaken the LHC bounds from $ \tilde u_1\to W b \chi^0_1 $ which are usually obtained under the assumption $ { \rm Br } [ \tilde u_1\to W b \chi^0_1 ] =100\ % $ .	We find the SQCD corrections enhance $ \Gamma [ \tilde u_1\to c \tilde\chi^0_1 ] $ by approximately 10\ % if the flavour-violation originates from bilinear terms .
3	Such flows are often experimentally unstable even in the absence of a linear instability .	We discuss non-self-gravitating hydrodynamic disks in the thin disk limit .	These systems are stable according to the Rayleigh criterion , and yet there is some evidence that the dissipative and transport processes in these disks are hydrodynamic in nature at least some of the time .	We draw on recent work on the hydrodynamics of laboratory shear flows .	The transition to turbulence in these systems , as well as the large linear transient amplification of initial disturbances , may depend upon the non-self-adjoint nature of the differential operator that describes the dynamics of perturbations to the background state .
3	( Since we do not include a model of confinement , our study is restricted to the analysis of quark matter .	In a recent work we introduced a nonlocal version of the Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio ( NJL ) model that was designed to generate a quark self-energy in Euclidean space that was similar to that obtained in lattice simulations of QCD .	In the present work we carry out related calculations in Minkowski space , so that we can study the effects of the significant vector and axial-vector interactions that appear in extended NJL models and which play an important role in the study of the $ \rho $ , $ \omega $ and $ a_1 $ mesons .	We study the modification of the quark self-energy in the presence of matter and find that our model reproduces the behavior of the quark condensate predicted by the model-independent relation $ & lt ; \bar qq & gt ; _ { \rho } = & lt ; \bar qq & gt ; _0 ( 1-\sigma_N\rho_N/f_ { \pi } ^2m_ { \pi } ^2 + ... ) $ , where $ \sigma_N $ is the pion-nucleon sigma term and $ \rho_N $ is the density of nuclear matter .	We provide some discussion of the modification of the above formula for quark matter . )
4	The comparison with the observed properties of the wb electron in ice suggests that this species is an s-like wavefunction filling a water vacancy .	Ionization of polar liquids and glasses often yields metastable electron centers collectively known as weakly bound ( wb ) electrons that absorb to the red of the ground state of the solvated/trapped electron .	Formation of these species is thought to be the initial stage of electron localization in such media .	Although these commonly occurring species have distinctive absorption spectra , no insight into their structure currently exists .	In this Letter , we address the structure of the wb electron in low-temperature ice-Ih theoretically , using a combination of mixed quantum-classical ( MQC ) floating set of Gaussian orbitals ( FSGO ) - Metropolis Monte Carlo ( MC ) method and embedded cluster density functional theory ( DFT ) post treatment .
4	Alternatively , we discuss some specific signatures that shear-free models would imprint on the temperature spectrum of CMB .	If the spacetime metric has anisotropic spatial curvature , one can afford to expand the universe isotropically , provided that the energy-momentum tensor satisfy a certain con- straint .	This leads to the so-called shear-free metrics , which have the interesting property of violating the cosmological principle while still preserving the isotropy of the cosmic mi- crowave background ( CMB ) radiation .	In this work we show that shear-free cosmologies correspond to an attractor solution in the space of models with anisotropic spatial curva- ture .	Through a rigorous definition of linear perturbation theory in these spacetimes , we show that shear-free models represent a viable alternative to describe the large-scale evo- lution of the universe , leading , in particular , to a kinematically equivalent Sachs-Wolfe effect .
2	Many decades of work have been devoted to this kind of research , most of it forgotten by the greater part of the astrophysical community nowadays .	An extraordinary event took place recently in Ireland .	A group of independent and professional researchers met to discuss an old heterodox topic with important consequences in astrophysics and , especially , in cosmology : possible causes of the redshifts in the spectra of astrophysical objects other than a Doppler or expanding universe mechanism .	But the question is still open , the debate is still alive , as was shown by the participants in the present Workshop .	There is no smoke without fire , and the existence of many facts and theories on alternative origins of redshifts may point to some new pathways in physics that deserve further attention .
4	At the upper threshold , on the other hand , a single unbounded cluster forms which overwhelms all the others and occupies a finite fraction of the volume as well as of the boundary connections .	The percolation transitions on hyperbolic lattices are investigated numerically using finite-size scaling methods .	The existence of two distinct percolation thresholds is verified .	At the lower threshold , an unbounded cluster appears and reaches from the middle to the boundary .	This transition is of the same type and has the same finite-size scaling properties as the corresponding transition for the Cayley tree .
1	Twelve different weak rates are calculated for each nucleus as a function of temperature and density .	Allowed weak interaction rates for sd-shell nuclei in stellar environment are calculated using a generalized form of proton-neutron quasiparticle RPA model with separable Gamow-Teller forces .	This project consists of calculation of weak rates for a total of 709 nuclei with masses ranging from A = 18 to 100 .	This paper contains calculated weak rates for sd-shell nuclei .	The calculated capture and decay rates take into consideration the latest experimental energy levels and ft value compilations .
2	The attack can be for multiple reasons .	Tremendous and extraordinary growths in the field of internet , intranet , extranet and its users have developed an innovative era of great global competition and contention .	Denial of service attack by multiple nodes is accomplished of disturbing the services of rival servers .	So it is a major threat for cloud environment .	Due to low effectiveness and large storage conventional defending approaches can not be easily applied in cloud security .
4	We also study the effect of non-linear quenching ; the power law of the defects then depends on the degree of non-linearity .	In this review , we study some aspects of the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems .	In particular , we consider the effect of varying a parameter in the Hamiltonian of a quantum system which takes it across a quantum critical point or line .	We study both sudden and slow quenches in a variety of systems including one-dimensional ultracold atoms in an optical lattice , an infinite range ferromagnetic Ising model , and some exactly solvable spin models in one and two dimensions ( such as the Kitaev model ) .	We show that quenching leads to the formation of defects whose density has a power-law dependence on the quenching rate ; the power depends on the dimensionalities of the system and of the critical surface and on some of the exponents associated with the critical point which is being crossed .
2	It may also occur naturally ( without application of a field ) at very low tempe rature with quantum tunneling and at higher temperature with thermal excitation .	The physics of magnetic state change or reversal in single domain magnetic grains ( called Stoner particles ) is interesting from the fundamental as well as the applied points of view .	A change in magnetization can be finely tuned with a specific time variation o f an externally applied magnetic field .	The optimal ( usually shortest ) time altering the magn etisation along with the smallest applied magnetic field are sought in technological applications s uch as high-density reading or writing of information , spintronics , quantum inform ation and quantum communication systems .	This work reviews the magnetization change with a time dependent field and tem perature and discusses the time it takes to alter the magnetization as a function of the control parameter chosen , temperature and material parameters .
4	The power of the method is demonstrated for a non-integrable system with two degrees of freedom .	The dynamics of quantum systems can be approximated by the time propagation of Gaussian wave packets .	Applying a time dependent variational principle , the time evolution of the parameters of the coupled Gaussian wave packets can be calculated from a set of ordinary differential equations .	Unfortunately , the set of equations is ill-behaved in most practical applications , depending on the number of propagated Gaussian wave packets , and methods for regularization are needed .	We present a general method for regularization based on applying adequate nonholonomic inequality constraints to the evolution of the parameters , keeping the equations of motion well-behaved .
1	However , to date all analyses of fluctuation corrections neglect the finite ranged nature of the Coulomb interaction .	Quantum fluctuations are of central importance in itinerant ferromagnets ; in the case of the Stoner Hamiltonian , with contact interactions , they deliver a rich phase diagram featuring a first order ferromagnetic transition preempted by a spin spiral and a paired density wave .	We develop the formalism to consider the effects of fluctuations with a realistic screened Coulomb potential .	The finite ranged interaction suppresses the tricritical point temperature of the first order ferromagnetic transition , bringing theory into line with experiment , whilst retaining the exotic spin spiral and paired density wave .	In an ultracold atomic gas a finite ranged interaction damps the competing molecular instability , permitting the observation of ferromagnetic correlations .
0	This paper is concerned with two questions in the decoherent histories approach to quantum mechanics : the emergence of approximate classical predictability , and the fluctuations about it necessitated by the uncertainty principle .	We consider histories characterized by position samplings at $ n $ moments of time .	We use this to construct a probability distribution on the value of ( discrete approximations to ) the field equations , $ F = m \ddot x + V ' ( x ) $ , at $ n-2 $ times .	We find that it is peaked around $ F=0 $ ; thus classical correlations are exhibited .	We show that the width of the peak $ \Delta F $ is largely independent of the initial state and the uncertainty principle takes the form $ 2 \sigma^2 \ ( \Delta F ) ^2 \ge { \hbar^2 / t^2 } $ , where $ \sigma $ is the width of the position samplings , and $ t $ is the timescale between projections .
1	This very richness makes their interpretation challenging since the low radio opacity means that a radio image represents the sum of all emission regions along the line-of-sight .	The radio continuum emission from the Galaxy has a rich mix of thermal and non-thermal emission .	These challenges make the existing narrow-band radio surveys of the Galactic plane difficult to interpret : e.g.a small region of emission might be a supernova remnant ( SNR ) or an HII region , or a complex combination of both .	Instantaneous wide bandwidth radio observations in combination with the capability for high resolution spectral index mapping , can be directly used to disentangle these effects .	Here we demonstrate simultaneous continuum and spectral index imaging capability at the full continuum sensitivity and resolution using newly developed wide-band wide-field imaging algorithms .
3	Hence , the system there can be modeled as a free Fermi gas of { \em electrons } ( with an appropriate boundary condition ) .	We study bulk and edge correlations in the compressible half-filled state , using a modified version of the plasma analogy .	The corresponding plasma has anomalously weak screening properties , and as a consequence we find that the correlations along the edge do not decay algebraically as in the Laughlin ( incompressible ) case , while the bulk correlations decay in the same way .	The results suggest that due to the strong coupling between charged modes on the edge and the neutral Fermions in the bulk , reflected by the weak screening in the plasma analogue , the ( attractive ) correlation hole is not well defined on the edge .	We finally comment on a possible scenario , in which the Laughlin-like dynamical edge correlations may nevertheless be realized .
4	Our work paves the way for practical high temperature radiative thermal energy transfer applications of hyperbolic metamaterials .	We explore the near-field radiative thermal energy transfer properties of hyperbolic metamaterials .	The presence of unique electromagnetic states in a broad bandwidth leads to super-planckian thermal energy transfer between metamaterials separated by a nano-gap .	We consider practical phonon-polaritonic metamaterials for thermal engineering in the mid-infrared range and show that the effect exists in spite of the losses , absorption and finite unit cell size .	For thermophotovoltaic energy conversion applications requiring energy transfer in the near-infrared range we introduce high temperature hyperbolic metamaterials based on plasmonic materials with a high melting point .
2	In particular , the proof of this theorem does not use any deep results in Teichmueller theory , Kleinian group theory , or the coarse geometry of A ( F , p ) .	Let F be a surface and suppose that \phi : F - & gt ; F is a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism fixing a puncture p of F. The mapping torus M = M_\phi is hyperbolic and contains a maximal cusp C about the puncture p. We show that the area ( and height ) of the cusp torus bounding C is equal to the stable translation distance of \phi acting on the arc complex A ( F , p ) , up to an explicitly bounded multiplicative error .	Our proof relies on elementary facts about the hyperbolic geometry of pleated surfaces .	A similar result holds for quasi-Fuchsian manifolds N = ( F x R ) .	In that setting , we find a combinatorial estimate for the area ( and height ) of the cusp annulus in the convex core of N , up to an explicitly bounded multiplicative and additive error .
1	Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy ( STM ) and Spectroscopy ( STS ) , supported by Density Functional Theory ( DFT ) calculations , the simple substitution of carbon by nitrogen atoms has been identifi ? ed as the most common doping con ? guration .	Nitrogen-doped epitaxial graphene grown on SiC ( 000 ? 1 ) was prepared by exposing the surface to an atomic nitrogen flux .	High-resolution images reveal a reduction of local charge density on top of the nitrogen atoms , indicating a charge transfer to the neighboring carbon atoms .	For the fi ? rst time , local STS spectra clearly evidenced the energy levels associated with the chemical doping by nitrogen , localized in the conduction band .	Various other nitrogen-related defects have been observed .
2	With the estimated mass information and the augmented passivity-based controller , the aerial manipulator can fly with the unknown object .	This paper presents an estimation and control algorithm for an aerial manipulator using a hexacopter with a 2-DOF robotic arm .	The unknown parameters of a payload are estimated by an on-line estimator based on parametrization of the aerial manipulator dynamics .	Simulation for an aerial manipulator is performed to compare estimation performance between the proposed control algorithm and conventional adaptive sliding mode controller .	Experimental results show a successful flight of a custom-made aerial manipulator while the unknown parameters related to an additional payload were estimated satisfactorily .
2	For solar flares we observe also systematic trends for the flare length scale L ( T_p ) ~ T_p^0.9 and the flare duration t_F ( T_p ) ~ T_p^0.9 as a function of the flare peak temperature .	In this study we compile for the first time comprehensive data sets of solar and stellar flare parameters , including flare peak temperatures T_p , flare peak volume emission measures EM_p , and flare durations t_f from both solar and stellar data , as well as flare length scales L from solar data .	Key results are that both the solar and stellar data are consistent with a common scaling law of EM_p ~ T_p^4.7 , but the stellar flares exhibit ~250 times higher emission measures ( at the same flare peak temperature ) .	Using the theoretical RTV scaling law and the fractal volume scaling observed for solar flares , i.e. , V ( L ) ~ L^2.4 , we predict a scaling law of EM_p ~ T_p^4.3 , which is consistent with observations , and a scaling law for electron densities in flare loops , n_p ~ T_p^2/L ~ T_p^1.1 .	The RTV-predicted electron densities were also found to be consistent with densities inferred from total emission measures , n_p= ( EM_p/q_V*V ) ^1/2 , using volume filling factors of q_V=0.03-0.08 constrained by fractal dimensions measured in solar flares .
2	For the time dependent amplitudes of the expansion of the fields in the basis functions of the vector Helmholtz equations a set of Langevin equations is obtained that allowed us , with the help of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem , to find the spectral densities of the correlation functions of the amplitudes .	The correlation theory of the thermal hydrodynamic fluctuations of liquids with internal spin within a spherical cavity is developed .	For the hydrodynamic fields of such a liquid , linearized equations with random thermal sources are used .	The spectra of the fluctuations of hydrodynamic fields are found in the form of a superposition of spectral amplitudes of the expansion with weights expressed as bilinear combinations of the proper coordinate functions and their derivatives .	The correlation functions of the field of the translational velocity and internal spin of the liquid in one spatial point are analyzed .
4	We find that the measurement errors considered have relatively little impact on the constraining power of shear peak counts for LSST .	The statistics of peak counts in reconstructed shear maps contain information beyond the power spectrum , and can improve cosmological constraints from measurements of the power spectrum alone if systematic errors can be controlled .	We study the effect of galaxy shape measurement errors on predicted cosmological constraints from the statistics of shear peak counts with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ( LSST ) .	We use the LSST image simulator in combination with cosmological N-body simulations to model realistic shear maps for different cosmological models .	We include both galaxy shape noise and , for the first time , measurement errors on galaxy shapes .
1	Under a random walk model the probability that all pandemics between times 0 and 300 occur by time 150 is 1/2 .	We propose two simple probability models to compute the probability of an influenza pandemic .	Under a Poisson model with mean inter arrival time of 30 years the probability that no pandemic occurs during at least 60 years is 14 % .	These probabilities are much higher than generally perceived .	So yes the next influenza pandemic will happen but maybe much later than generally thought .
1	The usual information theoretic approach assumes full cooperation among users for codebook and rate selection .	This work considers coordination and bargaining between two selfish users over a Gaussian interference channel .	In the scenario investigated here , each user is willing to coordinate its actions only when an incentive exists and benefits of cooperation are fairly allocated .	The users are first allowed to negotiate for the use of a simple Han-Kobayashi type scheme with fixed power split .	Conditions for which users have incentives to cooperate are identified .
2	First-principles methods have only recently been developed to calculate the full ME response tensor $ \alpha $ including both electronic and ionic ( i.e. , lattice-mediated ) contributions .	Magnetoelectric ( ME ) materials are of fundamental interest and have been investigated for their broad potential for technological applications .	The search for , and eventually the theoretical design of , materials with large ME couplings present challenging issues .	The latter is proportional to both the Born dynamical electric charge $ Z^ { \rm e } $ and its analogue , the dynamical magnetic charge $ Z^ { \rm m } $ .	Here we present a theoretical study of the magnetic charge $ Z^ { \rm m } $ and the mechanisms that could enhance it .
3	The FOF proceeds with originally independent connection and metric structures of the space-time manifold .	Solutions with degenerate metric ( $ det ( g_ { \mu\nu } ) =0 $ or $ g_ { \mu\nu } =0 $ ) in the first order formalism ( FOF ) are physically acceptable : they may describe topology changes ( Horowitz ) and reduction of `` metrical dimension '' ( Tseytlin ) of space-time .	The latter implies disappearance of the volume element $ \sqrt { -g } d^4x $ of 4-D space-time .	We pay attention that besides $ \sqrt { -g } $ , the 4-D space-time differentiable manifold possesses also a `` manifold volume measure '' ( MVM ) described by a 4-form which is sign indefinite and generically independent of the metric .	We bring up the question whether the FOF should be supplemented with degrees of freedom of MVM .
4	The advantages of using such pairs of estimators with corresponding optimal designs for the comparison of regression models are illustrated via numerical examples .	We consider the problem of efficient statistical inference for comparing two regression curves estimated from two samples of dependent measurements .	Based on a representation of the best pair of linear unbiased estimators in continuous time models as a stochastic integral , an efficient pair of linear unbiased estimators with corresponding optimal designs for finite sample size is constructed .	This pair minimises the width of the confidence band for the difference between the estimated curves .	We thus extend results readily available in the literature to the case of correlated observations and provide an easily implementable and efficient solution .
4	We discuss the application of TMine to the next iteration of the event analysis ( Pass 8 ) , the LAT charged particle analyses , and the classification of unassociated LAT gamma-ray sources .	The Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) event analysis is the final stage in the event reconstruction responsible for the creation of high-level variables ( e.g. , event energy , incident direction , particle type , etc . ) .	We discuss the development of TMine , a powerful new tool for designing and implementing event classification analyses ( e.g. , distinguishing photons from charged particles ) .	TMine is structured on ROOT , a data analysis framework that is the de-facto standard for current high energy physics experiments ; thus , TMine fits naturally into the ROOT-based data processing pipeline of the LAT .	TMine provides a visual development environment for the LAT event analysis and utilizes advanced multivariate classification algorithms implemented in ROOT .
1	Extending recent works , we first provide a comprehensive analysis of thermal production of the DFSZ axino considering all the possible scattering , decay and inverse decay processes depending on various mass parameters and the reheat temperature .	We study the cosmological impact of the supersymmetric DFSZ axion model .	Although it is hard for the DFSZ axino to be in thermal equilibrium , its coupling is still large enough to generate huge axino population which can turn into overabundant neutralino density .	We examine the neutralino parameter space to identify the dark matter property depending on the Peccei-Quinn scale .	As the Peccei-Quinn scale becomes higher resulting in longer axino lifetime , the neutralino dark matter appears in a lighter Higgsino-like LSP region or a more restricted Bino-like LSP region allowing a resonant annihilation through a CP-odd Higgs boson to meet stronger reannihilation .
1	The normal crossings condition considered by Goward is weakened to the condition that components of the generating divisors meet as complete intersections .	We generalize an algorithm by Goward for principalization of monomial ideals in nonsingular varieties to work on any scheme of finite type over a field .	This leads to a substantial generalization of the notion of monomial scheme ; we call the resulting schemes `c.i.monomial ' .	We prove that c.i .	monomial schemes in arbitrarily singular varieties can be principalized by a sequence of blow-ups at codimension 2 c.i .
3	The first one is the matrix model computing the partition function of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in three dimensions with one adjoint hypermultiplet and N_f fundamentals , which has a conjectured M-theory dual , and which we call the N_f matrix model .	Some matrix models admit , on top of the usual 't Hooft expansion , an M-theory-like expansion , i.e.an expansion at large N but where the rest of the parameters are fixed , instead of scaling with N. These models , which we call M-theoretic matrix models , appear in the localization of Chern-Simons-matter theories , and also in two-dimensional statistical physics .	Generically , their partition function receives non-perturbative corrections which are not captured by the 't Hooft expansion .	In this paper , we discuss general aspects of these type of matrix integrals and we analyze in detail two different examples .	The second one , which we call the polymer matrix model , computes form factors of the 2d Ising model and is related to the physics of 2d polymers .
2	The perturbative one-loop mass renormalization is comparable to that for Wilson quarks and considerably smaller than that for Kogut-Susskind quarks .	We compute the one-loop self-energy correction to the massive domain wall quark propagator .	Combining this calculation with simulations at several gauge couplings , we estimate the strange quark mass in the continuum limit .	Also , scaling violations appear mild in comparison to other errors at present .	Given their good chiral behavior and these features , domain wall quarks are attractive for evaluating the light quark masses .
2	We show that when properly normalised , their location converges , in the vanishing noise limit , to the sum of an asymptotically geometric random variable and a Gumbel random variable .	When two synchronised phase oscillators are perturbed by weak noise , they display occasional losses of synchrony , called phase slips .	The slips can be characterised by their location in phase space and their duration .	The duration also converges to a Gumbel variable with different parameters .	We relate these results to recent works on the phenomenon of log-periodic oscillations and on links between transition path theory and extreme-value theory .
1	In the presence of a boundary , with the so-called method of images it is possible to study the surface critical behaviour of these systems , and the conformal boundary conditions can be related to the bulk operator content of the theory .	Critical systems are described by conformal field theories , whose dynamics can be exactly solved in two dimensions .	After an overview of the basic concepts of bulk and boundary conformal field theory , we present an explicit calculation of some two-point correlation functions in Virasoro minimal models with boundary .	In the second part of the thesis , we summarize the known results about perturbed conformal field theories , which describe the dynamics of systems away from the critical point .	We concentrate on cases in which the off-critical massive field theory is integrable , with a corresponding purely elastic and factorized scattering theory , focusing our attention on the bootstrap approach .
4	We find that the source of ultra-low temperature heavy particle barrier crossing is intrinsic and no external bias is necessary for atomic intermixing and surface alloying in Pt/Al although the dynamic barrier height is few eV .	During the course of atomic transport in a host material , impurity atoms need to surmount an energy barrier driven by thermodynamic bias or at ultra-low temperatures by quantum tunneling .	In the present article we demonstrate using atomistic simulations that at ultra-low temperature transient inter-layer atomic transport is also possible without tunneling when the Pt/Al ( 111 ) impurity/host system self-organizes itself spontaneously into an intermixed configuration .	No such extremely fast athermal concerted process has been reported before at ultra low temperatures .	The outlined novel transient atomic exchange mechanism could be of general validity .
3	These data were interpreted with the magnetic Doppler imaging technique .	Intermediate-mass , chemically peculiar stars with strong magnetic fields give us an excellent opportunity to study the topology of their surface magnetic fields and the interplay between magnetic geometries and abundance inhomogeneities in their atmospheres .	We reconstruct detailed maps of the surface magnetic field and abundance distributions for the magnetic Ap star HD 125248 .	We performed the analysis based on phase-resolved , four Stokes parameter spectropolarimetric observations obtained with the HARPSpol instrument .	We improved the atmospheric parameters of the star , T_eff = 9850K +/- 250K and logg = 4.05 +/- 0.10 .
4	Finally , we also provide a lower bound for bipartite shareability of quantum correlation beyond entanglement in a tripartite system .	In this paper , we present the concept of the one-way unlocalizable quantum discord and investigate its properties .	We provide a polygamy inequality for it in tripartite pure quantum system of arbitrary dimension .	Several tradeoff relations between the one-way unlocalizable quantum discord and other correlations are given .	If the von Neumann measurement is on a part of the system , we give two expressions of the one-way unlocalizable quantum discord in terms of partial distillable entanglement and quantum disturbance .
0	Acoustic models using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis ( PLDA ) capture the correlations within feature vectors using subspaces which do not vastly expand the model .	This allows high dimensional and correlated feature spaces to be used , without requiring the estimation of multiple high dimension covariance matrices .	In this letter we extend the recently presented PLDA mixture model for speech recognition through a tied PLDA approach , which is better able to control the model size to avoid overfitting .	We carried out experiments using the Switchboard corpus , with both mel frequency cepstral coefficient features and bottleneck feature derived from a deep neural network .	Reductions in word error rate were obtained by using tied PLDA , compared with the PLDA mixture model , subspace Gaussian mixture models , and deep neural networks .
4	Due to the age-velocity dispersion relation , a greater fraction of younger stars reach |z| & gt ; 2 kpc at the outer region , because of the lower gravitational restoring force of the disk , i.e.flaring .	We analyze the radial and vertical metallicity and [ alpha/Fe ] gradients of the disk stars of a disk galaxy simulated in a fully cosmological setting with the chemodynamical galaxy evolution code , GCD+ .	We study how the radial abundance gradients vary as a function of height above the plane and find that the metallicity ( [ alpha/Fe ] ) gradient becomes more positive ( negative ) with increasing height , changing sign around 1.5 kpc above the plane .	At the largest vertical height ( 2 & lt ; |z| & lt ; 3 kpc ) , our simulated galaxy shows a positive radial metallicity gradient .	We find that the positive metallicity gradient is caused by the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relation , where the younger stars have higher metallicity and lower velocity dispersion .
1	We show that it puts an interesting bound on the mass of the second generation leptoquarks .	The recent measurement on the muon anomalous magnetic moment $ a_\mu $ shows a $ 2.6\sigma $ deviation from the standard model value .	To account for the data the leptoquark must have both the left- and right-handed couplings to the muon .	Assuming that the couplings have electromagnetic strength , the mass is restricted in the range $ 0.7 { \rm TeV } & lt ; M_ { \rm LQ } & lt ; 2.2 $ TeV at 95 % C.L .	We also discuss constraints coming from other low energy and high energy experiments .
2	We introduce several new techniques of analysis , and we find that both the primary and secondary features in the star 's fluctuation spectra are aliases of their actual values .	The `` drifting '' subpulses exhibited by some radio pulsars have fascinated both observers and theorists for 30 years , and have been widely regarded as one of the most critical and potentially insightful aspects of their emission .	Here , we report on detailed studies of pulsar B0943+10 , whose nearly coherent sequences of `` drifting '' subpulses have permitted us to identify their origin as a system of subbeams that appear to circulate around the star 's magnetic axis .	We have also developed a method of tracing the underlying pattern responsible for the observed sequences , using a `` cartographic '' transform and its inverse , permitting us to study the characteristics of the polar-cap emission `` map '' and to confirm that such a `` map '' in turn represents the observed sequence .	We apply these techniques to the study of three different Arecibo observations .
0	We consider a one-dimensional lattice model with the nearest-neighbor interaction $ V_1 $ and the next-nearest neighbor interaction $ V_2 $ with filling factor 1/2 at zero temperature .	The particles are assumed to be spinless fermions or hard-core bosons .	Using very simple assumptions we are able to predict the basic structure of the insulator-metal phase diagram for this model .	Computations of the flux sensitivity support the main features of the proposed diagram and show that the system maintains metallic properties at arbitrarily large values of $ V_1 $ and $ V_2 $ along the line $ V_1-2V_2=\gamma J $ , where $ J $ is the hopping amplitude , and $ \gamma\approx1.2 $ .	We think that close to this line the system is a `` weak '' metal in a sense that the flux sensitivity decreases with the size of the system not exponentially but as $ 1/L^\alpha $ with $ \alpha & gt ; 1 $ .
1	Temperature features can provide evidence of merging events which shock heat the intracluster gas .	X-ray observations were used to examine the complex temperature structure of Abell 85 , a cool-core galaxy cluster .	Temperature maps were made from both \textit { Chandra } and \textit { XMM-Newton } obervations .	The combination of a new , long-exposure \textit { XMM } observation and an improved temperature map binning technique produced the highest fidelity temperature maps of A85 to date .	Hot regions were detected near the subclusters to the South and Southwest in both the \textit { Chandra } and \textit { XMM } temperature maps .
0	Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern in the United States and globally .	While influenza vaccines are the single most effective intervention to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality , there is considerable debate surrounding the merits and consequences of repeated seasonal vaccination .	Here , we describe a two-season influenza epidemic contact network model and use it to demonstrate that increasing the level of continuity in vaccination across seasons reduces the burden on public health .	We show that revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the overall number of susceptible individuals , but also because it better protects highly-connected individuals , who would otherwise make a disproportionately large contribution to influenza transmission .	Our work thus contributes a population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza vaccination and advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual vaccine histories .
0	We find a class of exact solutions of noncommutative gauge theories corresponding to unstable non-BPS solitons .	In the two-dimensional euclidean ( or 2+1 dimensional lorentzian ) U ( 1 ) theory we find localized solutions carrying nonzero magnetic flux .	In four euclidean dimensions we find non-BPS solutions with the same Pontrjagin charge but greater energy than the usual self-dual Yang-Mills instanton .	We conjecture that these solutions and generalizations thereof correspond to nonsupersymmetric configurations of D- ( p-2k ) branes ( or intersections thereof ) in a D-p brane in the noncommutative scaling limit of large B-field .	In the particular case of a 0-brane on a 2-brane the analysis of small fluctuations reveals an infinite tower of states which agrees exactly with that of the 0-2 CFT in the scaling limit .
1	We find that in the Milky Way , early-type WN stars evolve from stars with masses as low as 20Mo .	Here we examine 12 Galactic clusters and OB associations containing Wolf-Rayet stars ( W-Rs ) and/or Luminous Blue Variables ( LBVs ) , in order to assess the progentor masses of these evolved massive stars .	Some early-type WN stars are found in clusters with very high turn-off masses , supporting our earlier results that the `` WNE '' class of W-Rs is a common stage in the evolution of stars with a wide range of mases .	In contrast , the late-type WNs ( particularly those of WN7 class ) and the LBVs are only found in clusters with the very highest turn-off masses , suggesting that only the most massive stars evolve to these objects .	An examination of the environment of the archetype LBV Eta Car reveals that this star is coeval with the rest of the Tr14/16 association , suggesting that its LBV properties is a normal consequence of evolution , and has little to do with the possibility that it is a binary .
3	Seismology is the most efficient way to probe directly the internal structure of giant planets.Aims .	Context .	Due to its great mass and its rapid formation , Jupiter has played a crucial role in shaping the Solar System .	The knowledge of its internal structure would strongly constrain the solar system formation mechanism .	SYMPA is the first instrument dedicated to the observations of free oscillations of Jupiter .
1	It is known that a point sequence in R^d that is order-type homogeneous forms the vertex set of a convex polytope that is combinatorially equivalent to a cyclic polytope in R^d .	Let OT_d ( n ) be the smallest integer N such that every N-element point sequence in R^d in general position contains an order-type homogeneous subset of size n , where a set is order-type homogeneous if all ( d+1 ) -tuples from this set have the same orientation .	Two famous theorems of Erdos and Szekeres from 1935 imply that OT_1 ( n ) = Theta ( n^2 ) and OT_2 ( n ) = 2^ ( Theta ( n ) ) .	For d \geq 3 , we give new bounds for OT_d ( n ) .	In particular : 1 .
3	It turns out that the equivariant cohomology module of these manifolds is often torsion free , but not free over the cohomology of the group .	We consider closed manifolds , which occur as intersections of products of spheres of the same dimension with certain hyperplanes .	Among those are the so called ( big ) polygon- and chain spaces .	The equivariant cohomology with respect to natural actions of 2-tori is calculated and related to the notion of syzygy .	Coefficients are taken in the field with two elements .
1	Some writers ( wrongly ? )	If the use of the apostrophe in contemporary English often marks the Saxon genitive , it may also indicate the omission of one or more let-ters .	use it to mark the plural in symbols or abbreviations , visual-ised thanks to the isolation of the morpheme `` s '' .	This punctuation mark was imported from the Continent in the 16th century .	During the 19th century its use was standardised .
0	We study the logistic map $ f ( x ) =\lambda x ( 1-x ) $ on the unit square at the chaos threshold .	By using the methods of symbolic dynamics , the information content of an orbit of a dynamical system is defined as the Algorithmic Information Content ( AIC ) of a symbolic sequence .	We give results for the behaviour of the AIC for the logistic map .	Since the AIC is not a computable function we use , as approximation of the AIC , a notion of information content given by the length of the string after it has been compressed by a compression algorithm , and in particular we introduce a new compression algorithm called CASToRe .	The information content is then used to characterise the chaotic behaviour .
3	As in previous work , we invariably find that the primary instability has a diagonal wavevector $ ( \pm Q_0 , \pm Q_0 ) $ and a $ d $ -form factor .	We examine trends in the wavevectors and form-factors of charge density wave instabilities of three-band models of the underdoped cuprates .	For instabilities from a high temperature state with a large Fermi surface , we extend a study by Bulut et al .	( arXiv:1305.3301 ) to include a direct antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the Cu sites .	The experimentally observed wavevectors along the principal axes $ ( \pm Q_0,0 ) $ , $ ( 0 , \pm Q_0 ) $ have higher energy , but they also have a predominantly $ d $ -form factor .
4	We show that the SIDM signal could be distinguished from that of DM particles with contact interactions by considering the time-average energy spectrum in experiments employing different target materials , or the average and modulated spectra in a single experiment .	Self-interacting dark matter ( SIDM ) is a simple and well-motivated scenario that could explain long-standing puzzles in structure formation on small scales .	If the required self-interaction arises through a light mediator ( with mass $ \sim 10 $ MeV ) in the dark sector , this new particle must be unstable to avoid overclosing the universe .	The decay of the light mediator could happen due to a weak coupling of the hidden and visible sectors , providing new signatures for direct detection experiments .	The SIDM nuclear recoil spectrum is more peaked towards low energies compared to the usual case of contact interactions , because the mediator mass is comparable to the momentum transfer of nuclear recoils .
2	Tuning of the output frequency with high precision is achieved via a tunable rf offset lock .	We present and characterize a laser system for the spectroscopy on highly-charged ^209Bi^82+ ions at a wavelength of 243.87 nm .	For absolute frequency stabilization , the laser system is locked to a near-infra-red laser stabilized to a rubidium transition line using a transfer cavity based locking scheme .	A sample-and-hold technique gives an extended tuning range of several THz in the UV .	This scheme is universally applicable to the stabilization of laser systems at wavelengths not directly accessible to atomic or molecular resonances .
0	We derive the thermodynamic curvature of a two dimensional ideal anyon gas of particles obeying fractional statistics .	The statistical interactions of anyon gas can be attractive or repulsive .	For attractive statistical interactions , thermodynamic curvature is positive and for repulsive statistical interactions , it is negative , which indicates a more stable anyon gas .	There is a special case between the two where the thermodynamic curvature is zero .	Small deviations from the classical limit will also be explored .
2	We prove that they are determined by Maxwell 's equations , so they represent the electric and magnetic fields in the new frame and the force $ \vec { F } $ is the well known from experiments Lorentz force .	The Coulomb force , established in the rest frame of a source-charge $ Q $ , when transformed to a new frame moving with a velocity $ \vec { V } $ has a form $ \vec { F } = q\vec { { E } } + q\vec { v } \times \vec { { B } } $ , where $ \vec { { E } } =\vec { E } '_\parallel + \gamma\vec { E } '_\perp $ and $ \vec { { B } } = \vec { \frac { V } { c^2 } } \times \vec { { E } } $ and $ \vec { E } ' $ is the electric field in the rest frame of the source .	The quantities $ \vec { E } $ and $ \vec { B } $ are then manifestly interdependent .	In this way Maxwell 's equations may be discovered theoretically for this particular situation of uniformly moving sources .	The general solutions of the discovered Maxwell 's equations lead us to fields produced by accelerating sources .
4	We then go on to describe a number of additional algebraic types for the various alignment configurations .	We develop a dimension-independent theory of alignment in Lorentzian geometry , and apply it to the tensor classification problem for the Weyl and Ricci tensors .	First , we show that the alignment condition is equivalent to the PND equation .	In 4D , this recovers the usual Petrov types .	For higher dimensions , we prove that , in general , a Weyl tensor does not possess aligned directions .
4	We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be $ k $ -metric dimensional and we obtain several results on the $ k $ -metric dimension .	As a generalization of the concept of a metric basis , this article introduces the notion of $ k $ -metric basis in graphs .	Given a connected graph $ G= ( V , E ) $ , a set $ S\subseteq V $ is said to be a $ k $ -metric generator for $ G $ if the elements of any pair of different vertices of $ G $ are distinguished by at least $ k $ elements of $ S $ , i.e. , for any two different vertices $ u , v\in V $ , there exist at least $ k $ vertices $ w_1 , w_2 , ... , w_k\in S $ such that $ d_G ( u , w_i ) \ne d_G ( v , w_i ) $ for every $ i\in \ { 1 , ... , k\ } $ .	A metric generator of minimum cardinality is called a $ k $ -metric basis and its cardinality the $ k $ -metric dimension of $ G $ .	A connected graph $ G $ is $ k $ -metric dimensional if $ k $ is the largest integer such that there exists a $ k $ -metric basis for $ G $ .
3	In the non-mean-field parameter region the FP above is unstable , and we determined exactly all other FPs : to our knowledge , this is the first time that all perturbative FPs for the full set of RG equations of a spin glass in a field have been characterized in the non-mean-field region .	By using renormalization-group ( RG ) methods , we study a non-mean-field model of a spin glass built on a hierarchical lattice , the hierarchical Edwards-Anderson model in a magnetic field .	We investigate the spin-glass transition in a field by studying the existence of a stable critical RG fixed point ( FP ) with perturbation theory .	In the parameter region where the model has a mean-field behavior - corresponding to $ d \geq 4 $ for a $ d $ -dimensional Ising model - we find a stable FP that corresponds to a spin-glass transition in a field .	We find that all potentially stable FPs in the non-mean-field region have a nonzero imaginary part : this constitutes , to the best of our knowledge , the first demonstration for a spin glass in a field that there is no perturbative FP corresponding to a spin-glass transition in the non-mean-field region .
3	Typically 20 or more pulses have been followed for each model , allowing us to calculate the third dredge-up parameter for each case .	We present new evolutionary sequences for low and intermediate mass stars for three different metallicities , Z = 0.02,0.008 and 0.004 .	We evolve the models from the pre-main sequence to the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase .	We have two sequences of models for each mass , one which includes mass loss and one without mass loss .	Using the results from this large and homogeneous set of models , we present an approximate fit for the core mass at the first thermal pulse , as well as for the third dredge-up efficiency parameter , and the core mass at the first third dredge-up episode as a function of metallicity and total mass .
1	Traditional model selection criteria can fail to enforce parsimony or result in poorly separated components of limited practical use .	Choosing the number of components remains a central but elusive challenge in mixture models .	Non-local priors ( NLPs ) are a family of distributions that encourage parsimony by enforcing a separation between the models under consideration .	We formalize NLPs in the context of mixtures and show how they lead to extra parsimony and well-separated components that have non-negligible weight , hence interpretable as distinct subpopulations .	We derive tractable expressions and suggest default prior settings aimed at detecting multi-modal densities .
3	Compared with current assessment methods which are limited to isometric embeddings , the NIEQA method has a much larger application range due to two features .	Manifold learning is a hot research topic in the field of computer science .	A crucial issue with current manifold learning methods is that they lack a natural quantitative measure to assess the quality of learned embeddings , which greatly limits their applications to real-world problems .	In this paper , a new embedding quality assessment method for manifold learning , named as Normalization Independent Embedding Quality Assessment ( NIEQA ) , is proposed .	First , it is based on a new measure which can effectively evaluate how well local neighborhood geometry is preserved under normalization , hence it can be applied to both isometric and normalized embeddings .
2	By jointly analyzing this absorption line with those from OVII , OVIII , and NeIX ions in the same spectrum , we obtain an abundance ratio as Fe/Ne=0.8 ( 0.4 , 2.1 ) in units of the Anders & amp ; Grevesse solar value ( 90 % confidence intervals ) .	The iron depletion level and the gas-phase iron abundance in the hot ~10^6 K interstellar medium ( ISM ) is critical to the understanding of its energy balance as well as the thermal sputtering , cooling , and heating processes of dust grains .	Here we report on the first detection of the Fe XVII absorption line at 15.02 A from the hot ISM in the spectrum of the low mass X-ray binary 4U~1820-303 observed with Chandra X-Ray Observatory .	We find that the result is robust with respect to different assumed gas temperature distributions .	The obtained Fe/Ne abundance ratio , albeit with large uncertainties , is consistent with the solar value , indicating that there is very little or no iron depleted into dust grains , i.e. , most of or all of the dust grains have been destroyed in the hot ISM .
3	For a more specific model with environmental spins in a transverse field , LZ transitions are studied in the case of well-separated resonances in the LZ grid .	Landau-Zener ( LZ ) transitions of a two-level system ( e. g. , electronic spin in molecular magnets ) coupled to one or many environmental spins ( e. g. , nuclear spins ) are studied .	For rather general interactions the LZ problem is reduced to that of a Landau-Zener grid .	It is shown analytically that environmental spins initially in their ground state do not influence the staying probability P. This changes if they are prepared in a statistical ensemble .	The full evolution of the system is described as a succession of elemenary transitions at avoided crossings and free evolution between them .
0	Networks describe various complex natural systems including social systems .	We investigate the social network of co-occurrence in Reuters-21578 corpus , which consists of news articles that appeared in the Reuters newswire in 1987 .	People are represented as vertices and two persons are connected if they co-occur in the same article .	The network has small-world features with power-law degree distribution .	The network is disconnected and the component size distribution has power law characteristics .
3	We also compare other properties of the six models .	In structure-based models of proteins , one often assumes that folding is accomplished when all contacts are established .	This assumption may frequently lead to a conceptual problem that folding takes place in a temperature region of very low thermodynamic stability , especially when the contact map used is too sparse .	We consider six different structure-based models and show that allowing for a small , but model-dependent , percentage of the native contacts not being established boosts the folding temperature substantially while affecting the time scales of folding only in a minor way .	We show that the choice of the description of the backbone stiffness has a substantial effect on the values of characteristic temperatures that relate both to equilibrium and kinetic properties .
3	The question of the decay of excited states through Hawking radiation is raised .	Evidence is given that some particles with large charges in gauge theories , including 4d N=4 SU ( 3 ) and 5d theories with N=1 supersymmetry , have macroscopic entropy .	The ground state entropy is found to be extensive in the charges .	The mass gap for excitation is estimated and is of the same order as the binding energy .	The analysis is based on the model of ( p , q ) string webs and on various other results .
3	This is because the AGB stellar evolution is strongly affected by the mass-loss process from the stars .	Due to their brightness in infrared , asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) stars are in important evolutionary stage to be understood at this wavelength .	In particular , in next decades , when the infrared optimised telescopes , such as the JWST and the ELT are in operation , it will be essential to include the AGB phase more precisely into the population synthesis models .	However , the AGB phase is still one of the remaining major problems in the stellar evolution .	It is important to describe mass loss more accurately so as to incorporate it into stellar evolutionary models .
0	New dynamical models for dust-driven winds of oxygen-rich AGB stars are presented which include frequency-dependent Monte Carlo radiative transfer by means of a sparse opacity distribution technique and a time-dependent treatment of the nucleation , growth and evaporation of inhomogeneous dust grains composed of a mixture of Mg2SiO4 , SiO2 , Al2O3 , TiO2 , and solid Fe .	The frequency-dependent treatment of radiative transfer reveals that the gas is cold close to the star ( 700-900 K at 1.5-2 R* ) which facilitates the nucleation process .	The dust temperatures are strongly material-dependent , with differences as large as 1000 K for different pure materials , which has an important influence on the dust formation sequence .	Two dust layers are formed in the dynamical models : almost pure glassy Al2O3 close to the star ( r & gt ; 1.5 R* ) and the more opaque Fe-poor Mg-Fe-silicates further out .	Solid Fe or Fe-rich silicates are found to be the only condensates that can efficiently absorb the stellar light in the near IR .
3	The model may be applied to spins traveling in a varying magnetic field , or to photons passing through a fiber whose birefringence fluctuates over the time separation between photons .	We present a model of an N-qubit channel where consecutive qubits experience correlated random rotations .	Our model is an extension to the standard decoherence-free subsystems approach ( DFS ) which assumes that all the qubits experience the same disturbance .	The variation of rotations acting on consecutive qubits is modeled as diffusion on the SU ( 2 ) group .	We derive an explicit formula describing the action of the channel on an arbitrary N-qubit state .
2	It also preserves gauge invariance and produces explicitly convergent results despite some apparent divergencies at the classical turning points .	We present the first calculation of the $ \hbar^4 $ -Wigner -- Kirkwood corrections to a relativistic system of fermions in the presence of external scalar and vector potentials .	The method we propose allows to compute efficiently semiclassical corrections to one body operators such as mean energies and local densities .	As a byproduct we obtain the $ \hbar^4 $ corrections stemming from the polarization of the Dirac sea .	We apply our results to the relativistic $ \sigma $ - $ \omega $ Lagrangian in the Hartree valence approximation .
0	The first-principles electronic structure calculations made substantial contribution to study of high $ T_c $ iron-pnictide superconductors .	By the calculations , LaFeAsO was first predicted to be an antiferromagnetic semimetal , and the novel bi-collinear antiferromagnetic order was predicted for $ \alpha $ -FeTe .	Moreover , based on the calculations the underlying mechanism was proposed to be Arsenic-bridged antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the next-nearest neighbor Fe moments .	In this article , this physical picture is further presented and discussed in association with the elaborate first-principles calculations on LaFePO .	The further discussion of origin of the magnetism in iron-pnictides and in connection with superconductivity is presented as well .
2	In this paper , we make explicit the key aspects of the dynamics that makes such a compensation possible .	Finding control fields ( pulse sequences ) that can compensate for the dispersion in the parameters governing the evolution of a quantum system is an important problem in coherent spectroscopy and quantum information processing .	The use of composite pulses for compensating dispersion in system dynamics is widely known and applied .	We highlight the role of Lie algebras and non-commutativity in the design of a compensating pulse sequence .	Finally we investigate three common dispersions in NMR spectroscopy , the Larmor dispersion , rf-inhomogeneity and strength of couplings between the spins .
1	Soft SUSY breaking terms for these models are calculated in the u - moduli dominant SUSY breaking approach ( in type IIA ) .	We present some phenomenology of a new class of intersecting D-brane models .	In this case , the dependence of the soft terms on the Yukawas and Wilson lines drops out .	These soft terms have a different pattern compared to the usual heterotic string models .	Phenomenological implications for dark matter are discussed .
2	In this paper , we provide characterizations and descriptions of incremental stability in terms of existence of coordinate-invariant notions of incremental Lyapunov functions and contraction metrics , respectively .	Incremental stability is a property of dynamical and control systems , requiring the uniform asymptotic stability of every trajectory , rather than that of an equilibrium point or a particular time-varying trajectory .	Similarly to stability , Lyapunov functions and contraction metrics play important roles in the study of incremental stability .	Most design techniques providing controllers rendering control systems incrementally stable have two main drawbacks : they can only be applied to control systems in either parametric-strict-feedback or strict-feedback form , and they require these control systems to be smooth .	In this paper , we propose a design technique that is applicable to larger classes of ( not necessarily smooth ) control systems .
3	By adjusting couplings , the doublet mass can be exponentially suppressed .	A novel mechanism to realize the triplet-doublet splitting in supersymmetric SU ( 5 ) grand unified theories is proposed in the framework of higher dimensional theories where chiral multiplets are localized due to kink configuration of a SU ( 5 ) singlet .	An adjoint Higgs field which spontaneously breaks the SU ( 5 ) gauge symmetry is assumed to be involved with the localization process , splitting the wave functions of the color-triplet Higgs from its doublet counterpart .	The resulting effective four-dimensional theory does not possess manifest SU ( 5 ) invariance .	We also show that dimension 5 proton decay from triplet Higgs exchange can be suppressed to a negligible level .
0	75As nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) experiments were performed on Ba ( Fe1-xMnx ) 2As2 ( xMn = 2.5 % , 5 % and 12 % ) single crystals .	The Fe layer magnetic susceptibility far from Mn atoms is probed by the75As NMR line shift and is found similar to that of BaFe2As2 , implying that Mn does not induce charge doping .	A satellite line associated with the Mn nearest neighbours ( n.n . )	of 75As displays a Curie-Weiss shift which demonstrates that Mn carries a local magnetic moment .	This is confirmed by the main line broadening typical of a RKKY-like Mn-induced staggered spin polarization .
2	In our models we have taken into account also the self-gravity of the disk .	We have constructed general relativistic models of a stationary , axially symmnetric , Keplerian thin disk around a rotating black hole .	We computed profiles of a spectral line , emitted in the inner region of the disk .	The aim of this work is to study gravitational effects on the line profiles in connection with the X-ray features observed in spectra of active galactic nuclei .	In some cases , the calculated profiles are clearly affected by the disk gravity but relativistic dragging effects are found to be negligible .
4	Equations of perturbed velocity and the perturbed gravitational potential in the zero-shear gauge exactly coincide with the Newtonian equations which remain valid even to 1PN order ( the same is true for perturbed velocity in the comoving gauge ) , and equations of perturbed density in the zero-shear gauge and the uniform-expansion gauge coincide to 1PN order .	We compare the cosmological first-order post-Newtonian ( 1PN ) approximation with the relativistic cosmological linear perturbation theory in a zero-pressure medium with the cosmological constant .	We compare equations and solutions in several different gauge conditions available in both methods .	In the PN method we have perturbation equations for density , velocity and gravitational potential independently of the gauge condition to 1PN order .	However , correspondences with these 1PN equations are available only in certain gauge conditions in the perturbation theory .
1	Here we describe the procedures involved in developing a benchmark and issues involved .	Benchmarking of 3D Shape retrieval allows developers and researchers to compare the strengths of different algorithms on a standard dataset .	We then discuss some of the current 3D shape retrieval benchmarks efforts of our group and others .	We also review the different performance evaluation measures that are developed and used by researchers in the community .	After that we give an overview of the 3D shape retrieval contest ( SHREC ) tracks run under the EuroGraphics Workshop on 3D Object Retrieval and give details of tracks that we organized for SHREC 2010 .
3	The weak long-range attractions damp the dynamics and the diffusion of the particles in gas- , super critical fluid- and in liquid states .	Molecular Dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones system with different range of attraction show that the attractive forces modify the radial distribution of the particles .	For condensed liquids only , the forces within the the first coordination shell ( FCS ) are important , but for gases and moderate condensed fluids , even the attractive forces outside the FCS play a role .	The changes in the distribution caused by neglecting the attractive forces , lead to a too high pressure .	The values of self-diffusion coefficients ( SDC ) agree qualitatively with a modified Cohen-Turnbull model .
2	Above $ v_ { h } $ , our time-dependent simulations in harmonic traps indicate that traveling solitons decay by radiating sound waves .	We investigate traveling solitons of a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled Fermi superfluid in both topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes by solving the static and time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations .	We find a critical velocity $ v_ { h } $ for traveling solitons that is much smaller than the value predicted using the Landau criterion due to the presence of spin-orbit coupling , which strongly upshifts the energy level of the soliton-induced Andreev bound states towards the quasi-particle scattering continuum .	In the topological phase , we predict the existence of peculiar Majorana solitons , which host two Majorana fermions and feature a phase jump of $ \pi $ across the soliton , irrespective of the velocity of travel .	These unusual properties of Majorana solitons may open an alternative way to manipulate Majorana fermions for fault-tolerant topological quantum computations .
4	Further the increased MR of up to 60 % is seen above 300 K for higher silver added samples in an applied field of 7 Tesla .	We report the synthesis , ( micro ) structural , magneto-transport and magnetization of polycrystalline La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 : Agx composites with x = 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4 .	The temperature coefficient of resistance ( TCR ) near ferromagnetic ( FM ) transition is increased significantly with addition of Ag .	The FM transition temperature ( TFM ) is also increased slightly with Ag addition .	Magneto-transport measurements revealed that magneto-resistance MR is found to be maximum near TFM .
4	Coupling the two-level system to the remaining degrees of freedom renders the Rabi oscillations damped .	Cold atoms provide a unique arena to study many-body systems far from equilibrium .	Furthermore , novel phases in cold atom systems are conveniently investigated by dynamical probes pushing the system out of equilibrium .	Here , we discuss the pumping of doubly-occupied sites in a fermionic Mott insulator by a periodic modulation of the hopping amplitude .	We show that deep in the insulating phase the many-body system can be mapped onto an effective two-level system which performs coherent Rabi oscillations due to the driving .
0	Plateau 's problem is not a single conjecture or theorem , but rather an abstract framework , encompassing a number of different problems in several related areas of mathematics .	In its most general form , Plateau 's problem is to find an element of a given collection \ ( \cal { C } \ ) of `` surfaces '' specified by some boundary constraint , which minimizes , or is a critical point of , a given `` area '' function \ ( F : \cal { C } \to \R \ ) .	In addition , one should also show that any such element satisfies some sort of regularity , that it be a sufficiently smooth manifold away from a well-behaved singular set .	The choices apparent in making this question precise lead to a great many different versions of the problem .	Plateau 's problem has generated a large number of papers , inspired new fields of mathematics , and given rise to techniques which have proved useful in applications further afield .
0	We present the first analysis of extended stellar kinematics of elliptical galaxies where a Yukawa -- like correction to the Newtonian gravitational potential derived from f ( R ) -gravity is considered as an alternative to dark matter .	In this framework , we model long-slit data and planetary nebulae data out to 7 Re of three galaxies with either decreasing or flat dispersion profiles .	We use the corrected Newtonian potential in a dispersion-kurtosis Jeans analysis to account for the mass-anisotropy degeneracy .	We find that these modified potentials are able to fit nicely all three elliptical galaxies and the anisotropy distribution is consistent with that estimated if a dark halo is considered .	The parameter which measures the `` strength '' of the Yukawa-like correction is , on average , smaller than the one found previously in spiral galaxies and correlates both with the scale length of the Yukawa-like term and the orbital anisotropy .
3	By densifying short 2212 wires before reaction through cold isostatic pressing ( CIPping ) , the void space was almost removed and the gas bubble density was reduced significantly , resulting in a doubled engineering critical current density ( JE ) of 810 A/mm2 at 5 T , 4.2 K. Here we report on densifying Bi-2212 wire by swaging , which increased JE ( 4.2 K , 5 T ) from 486 A/mm2 for as-drawn wire to 808 A/mm2 for swaged wire .	Bi-2212 round wire is made by the powder-in-tube technique .	An unavoidable property of powder-in-tube conductors is that there is about 30 % void space in the as-drawn wire .	We have recently shown that the gas present in the as-drawn Bi-2212 wire agglomerates into large bubbles and that they are presently the most deleterious current limiting mechanism .	This result further confirms that enhancing the filament packing density is of great importance for making major JE improvement in this round-wire magnet conductor .
4	Instead it is higher at the island center and scales up with island size , which we confirmed experimentally using laser ablation assays and immunofluorescence .	We generated a new computational approach to analyze the biomechanics of epithelial cell islands that combines both vertex and contact-inhibition-of-locomotion models to include both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion .	Examination of the distribution of cell protrusions ( adhesion to the substrate ) in the model predicted high order profiles of cell organization that agree with those previously seen experimentally .	Cells acquired an asymmetric distribution of protrusions ( and traction forces ) that decreased when moving from the edge to the island center .	Our in silico analysis also showed that tension on cell-cell junctions ( and monolayer stress ) is not homogeneous across the island .
2	Due to the difficulty of researching particular trajectories , biologists and computer scientists aim at predicting the most probable trajectories of systems under study .	Dynamics of biological-ecological systems is strongly depending on spatial dimensions .	Most of powerful simulators in ecology take into account for system spatiality thus embedding stochastic processes .	Doing that , they considerably reduce computation times .	However , because of the largeness of space , the execution time remains usually polynomial in time .
2	Explicit expressions for the effective neutrino diagonal and transition magnetic moments for the flavor basis in terms of these values for the mass states are obtained .	We consider neutrino mixing and oscillations in presence of an arbitrary constant magnetic field with nonzero transversal $ B_ { \perp } $ and longitudinal $ B_ { \parallel } $ components with respect to the direction of neutrino propagation .	The electromagnetic interaction of neutrinos is determined by diagonal and transition neutrino magnetic moments that are introduced for the neutrino mass states .	The effective evolution Hamiltonian for the flavor neutrino and the corresponding oscillation probability are derived .	The role of the longitudinal magnetic field component is examined .
0	We present an early result from an automated search of Kepler eclipsing binary systems for circumbinary companions .	An intriguing tertiary signal has been discovered in the short period eclipsing binary KIC002856960 .	This third body leads to transit-like features in the light curve occurring every 204.2 days , while the two other components of the system display eclipses on a 6.2 hour period .	The variations due to the tertiary body last for a duration of \sim1.26 days , or 4.9 binary orbital periods .	During each crossing of the binary orbit with the tertiary body , multiple individual transits are observed as the close binary stars repeatedly move in and out of alignment with the tertiary object .
4	As examples we discuss the Sauter and single-soliton field cases .	Schwinger pair creation in a purely time-dependent electric field can be described through a quantum Vlasov equation describing the time evolution of the single-particle momentum distribution function .	This equation exists in two versions , both of which can be derived by a Bogoliubov transformation , but whose equivalence is not obvious .	For the spinless case , we show here that the difference between these two evolution equations corresponds to the one between the `` in-out '' and `` in-in '' formalisms .	We give a simple relation between the asymptotic distribution functions generated by the two Vlasov equations .
4	As an example of an application of these data we further study the distribution of galaxy luminosities across the different elements of the cosmic web , finding that , while more luminous objects are found preferentially in the most dense environments , there is no further segregation by tidal environment .	We present a method to recover and study the projected gravitational tidal forces from a galaxy survey containing little or no redshift information .	The method and the physical interpretation of the recovered tidal maps as a tracer of the cosmic web are described in detail .	We first apply the method to a simulated galaxy survey and study the accuracy with which the cosmic web can be recovered in the presence of different observational effects , showing that the projected tidal field can be estimated with reasonable precision over large regions of the sky .	We then apply our method to the 2MASS survey and present a publicly available full-sky map of the projected tidal forces in the local Universe .
0	We calculate the masses of the resonances D_ { s0 } ^* ( 2317 ) and D_ { s1 } ( 2460 ) as well as their bottom partners as bound states of a kaon and a D^*- and B^*-meson , respectively , in unitarized chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order .	After fixing the parameters in the D_ { s0 } ^* ( 2317 ) channel , the calculated mass for the D_ { s1 } ( 2460 ) is found in excellent agreement with experiment .	The masses for the analogous states with a bottom quark are predicted to be M_ { B^*_ { s0 } } = ( 5696\pm 40 ) MeV and M_ { B_ { s1 } } = ( 5742\pm 40 ) MeV in reasonable agreement with previous analyses .	In particular , we predict M_ { B_ { s1 } } -M_ { B_ { s0 } ^* } =46\pm 1 MeV .	We also explore the dependence of the states on the pion and kaon masses .
3	Here , by acknowledging the fact that the effective interparticle interaction ( i.e. , the vertex function ) becomes smaller above three dimensions , we propose an alternative way to reorganize Feynman diagrams and develop a theoretical framework for interacting Fermi gases beyond the ladder approximation .	Interacting Fermi systems in the strongly correlated regime play a fundamental role in many areas of physics and are of particular interest to the condensed matter community .	Though weakly inter- acting fermions are understood , strongly correlated fermions are difficult to describe theoretically as there is no small interaction parameter to expand about .	Existing strong coupling theories rely heavily on the so-called many-body T-matrix approximation that sums ladder-type Feynman diagrams .	As an application , we solve the equation of state for three- and two-dimensional strongly interacting fermions and find excellent agreement with experimental [ Science 335 , 563 ( 2012 ) ] and other theoretical results above the temperature 0.5TF .
1	If some of the superpartners are at the multi-TeV scale , they will escape direct detection at planned future colliders .	Measurements of supersymmetric particle couplings provide important verification of supersymmetry .	However , such particles induce nondecoupling corrections in processes involving the accessible superparticles through violations of the supersymmetric equivalence between gauge boson and gaugino couplings .	These violations are analogous to the oblique corrections in the electroweak sector of the standard model , and can be parametrized in terms of super-oblique parameters .	The $ e^- e^- $ collision mode of a future linear collider is shown to be an excellent environment for such high precision measurements of these SUSY parameters , which will provide an important probe of superparticles beyond reachable energies .
0	During the products design , the design office defines dimensional and geometrical parameters according to the use criteria and the product functionality .	The manufacturing department must integrate the manufacturing and the workpiece position dispersions during the choice of tools and machines operating modes and parameters values to respect the functional constraints .	In this paper , we suggest to model the turning dispersions taking into account not only geometrical specifications of position or orientation but also the experience of method actors .	A representation using the principle of know-how maps in two or three dimensions is privileged .	The most interesting aspect is that these maps include tacit and explicit knowledge .
2	Identification of neurons within such Nissl-stained sections is inherently difficult due to the variability in neuron staining , the overlap of neurons , the presence of partial or damaged neurons at tissue surfaces , and the presence of non-neuron objects , such as glial cells , blood vessels , and random artifacts .	Individual locations of many neuronal cell bodies ( & gt ; 10^4 ) are needed to enable statistically significant measurements of spatial organization within the brain such as nearest-neighbor and microcolumnarity measurements .	In this paper , we introduce an Automated Neuron Recognition Algorithm ( ANRA ) which obtains the ( x , y ) location of individual neurons within digitized images of Nissl-stained , 30 micron thick , frozen sections of the cerebral cortex of the Rhesus monkey .	To overcome these challenges and identify neurons , ANRA applies a combination of image segmentation and machine learning .	The steps involve active contour segmentation to find outlines of potential neuron cell bodies followed by artificial neural network training using the segmentation properties ( size , optical density , gyration , etc . )
1	At the vortex core center , an enhanced density-of-states ( DOS ) is observed at energies near 7 meV .	We report on low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM ) studies of the electronic structure of vortex cores in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d ( BSCCO ) .	Spectroscopic imaging at these energies reveals an exponential decay of these 'core states ' with a decay length of 2.2 ( 3 ) nm .	The four-fold symmetry sometimes predicted for d-wave vortices is not seen in spectroscopic vortex images .	A locally nodeless order parameter induced by the magnetic field may be consistent with these measurements .
3	The dependence of these effects on the strength of strain , its applied direction and the twist angle is carefully clarified .	By means of atomistic tight-binding calculations , we investigate the effects of uniaxial strain on the electronic bandstructure of twisted graphene bilayer .	We find that the bandstructure is dramatically deformed and the degeneracy of the bands is broken by strain .	As a conseqence , the number of Dirac cones can double and the van Hove singularity points are separated in energy .	As an important result , we demonstrate that the position of van Hove singularities can be modulated by strain , suggesting the possibility of observing this phenomenon at low energy in a large range of twist angle ( i.e. , larger than $ 10^\circ $ ) .
3	$ $ Note that these inequalities imply that $ \kappa ( p ) $ is not third differentiable .	Consider percolation on the triangular lattice .	Let $ \kappa ( p ) $ be the free energy at the zero field .	We show that $ $ |\kappa '' ' ( p ) | \leq |p-p_c|^ { -1/3+o ( 1 ) } \mbox { if } p \neq p_c. $ $ Furthermore , we show that there is a sequence $ \epsilon_n \downarrow 0 $ such that $ $ \kappa '' ' ( p_c+\epsilon_n ) \leq -\epsilon_n^ { -1/3+o ( 1 ) } \mbox { and } \kappa '' ' ( p_c-\epsilon_n ) \geq \epsilon_n^ { -1/3+o ( 1 ) } .	This answers affirmatively a conjecture , asked by Sykes and Essam a half century ago , whether $ \kappa ( p ) $ has a singularity at the criticality .
1	However , not all on-demand transport services are equal .	On-demand transport services in the form of dial-a-ride and taxis are crucial parts of the transport infrastructure in all major cities .	In particular , not-for-profit dial-a-ride services with coordinated drivers significantly differ from profit-motivated taxi services with uncoordinated drivers .	As such , there are two key threads of research for efficient scheduling , routing , and pricing for passengers : dial-a-ride services ( first thread ) ; and taxi services ( second thread ) .	Unfortunately , there has been only limited development of algorithms for joint optimization of scheduling , routing , and pricing ; largely due to the widespread assumption of fixed pricing .
3	Based on the experimental results , there exist regions of non-uniformity along the length of superconductor in the coil , resulting in non-ideal superconducting properties of the coil .	Direct current ( DC ) characterization of high temperature superconducting ( HTS ) coils is important for HTS applications , such as electric machines , superconducting magnetic energy storage ( SMES ) and transformers .	In this paper , DC characterization of a circular , epoxy-impregnated HTS coil made from YBCO coated conductor for use as a prototype axial flux HTS electric machine is presented .	Multiple voltage taps were utilized within the coil during measurement to help provide further detailed information on its DC behavior as a function of length .	By studying the current-voltage ( I-V ) curves across different regions , it is found that a decreasing n-value and critical current exists in the non-uniform parts of the HTS coil .
4	Isochoric cooling keeps the ionization fraction remains quite high at $ T\simlt10^4 $ K : up to $ \sim0.01 $ at $ T\simeq 10^3 $ K and $ Z\simlt 0.1 Z_\odot $ , and even higher at higher metallicity , contrary to isobaric cooling where it at least an order of magnitude lower .	We present self-consistent calculations of non-equilibrium ( time-dependent ) cooling rates for a dust-free collisionally controlled gas in wide temperature ( $ 10 K\le T\le 10^8 K $ ) and metallicity ( $ 10^ { -4 } Z_\odot \le Z \le 2 Z_\odot $ ) ranges .	We confirm that molecular hydrogen dominates cooling at $ 10^2 \simlt T\simlt 10^4 $ K and $ Z\simlt 10^ { -3 } Z_\odot $ .	We find that the contribution from H $ _2 $ into cooling rate around $ T\sim ( 4-5 ) \times 10^3 $ K stimulates thermal instability in the metallicity range $ Z\simlt 10^ { -2 } Z_\odot $ .	Isobaric cooling rates are generally lower than isochoric ones , because the associated increase of gas density leads to both more efficient hydrogen recombination and equilibration of the fine-structure level populations .
2	Thus , it is our belief that it is now time for researchers and security experts to turn to nature in the search for novel inspirations for defense systems .	The alarming rise in the quantity of malware in the last few years poses a serious challenge to the security community and requires urgent response .	However , current countermeasures seem to be no longer effective .	Nature has provided species with a whole range of offensive and defensive techniques , which have been developing and improving in the course of billions of years of evolution .	The extremely diverse living conditions have promoted a large variation in the devised bio-security solutions .
2	The ring melts were found to diffuse faster than their linear counterparts , with the self-diffusion coefficient for both architectures scaling as approximately N to the -2.4 power for large N. The mean-square displacement of the center-of-mass of the rings follows a sub-diffusive behavior for times and distances beyond the mean-square gyration radius , neither compatible with the Rouse nor the reptation model .	Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the dynamic properties of melts of nonconcatenated ring polymers and compared to melts of linear polymers .	The longest rings were composed of N=1600 monomers per chain which corresponds to roughly 57 entanglement lengths for comparable linear polymers .	The rings relax stress much faster than linear polymers and the zero-shear viscosity was found to vary as approximately N to the 1.4 power which is much weaker than the N to the 3.4 power of linear chains , not matching any commonly known model for polymer dynamics when compared to the observed mean-square displacements .	These findings are discussed in view of the conformational properties of the rings presented in the preceding paper ( DOI : 10.1063/1.3587137 ) .
1	The technique can be extended to full Brillouin zone by including more coupled bands into consideration .	The $ k \cdot p $ is a versatile technique that describes the semiconductor band structure in the vicinity of the bandgap .	For completeness , a detailed formulation is provided where the associated $ k \cdot p $ parameters are extracted from the local empirical pseudopotential method in the form of band edge energies and generalized momentum matrix elements .	We demonstrate the systematic improvement of the technique with the proper choice of the band edge states for the group-IV indirect bandgap semiconductors : Si , Ge , diamond and SiC of the 3C cubic phase .	The full zone agreement is observed to span an energy window of more than 20 eV for Si , and 40 eV for the diamond with the 15-band pseudopotential-based $ k \cdot p $ approach .
2	A comprehensive equation of state ( EOS ) table with 391 density-temperature points is constructed and the results are presented in form of two-dimensional free energy fit for interpolation .	Using density functional molecular dynamics simulations , we determine the equation of state for hydrogen-helium mixtures spanning density-temperature conditions typical of giant planet interiors , ~0.2-9 g/cc and 1000-80000 K for a typical helium mass fraction of 0.245 .	In addition to computing internal energy and pressure , we determine the entropy using an ab initio thermodynamic integration technique .	Deviations between our ab initio EOS and the semi-analytical EOS model by Saumon and Chabrier are analyzed in detail , and we use the results for initial revision of the inferred thermal state of giant planets with known values for mass and radius .	Changes are most pronounced for planets in the Jupiter mass range and below .
3	The HI follows the spiral arms , and streaming motions of up to ~15 kms ( projected ) can be identified from the velocity field .	New high resolution , high sensitivity WSRT HI synthesis observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 3631 are presented .	In the total atomic hydrogen map , the spiral arms are well distinguished from the interarm regions , while the sensitivity allows detection of HI in all but a few isolated regions of the areas between the spiral arms .	Most of the atomic hydrogen is located within the optical disc , but the HI extends to some 1.5R_opt .	Assuming a constant inclination angle of 17 deg , a rotation curve is derived which is slightly falling in the outer parts of the disc .
4	In particular , we give an asymptotic formula for the volume of B ( n ) .	Let m , n be positive integers .	Define T ( m , n ) to be the transportation polytope consisting of the m x n non-negative real matrices whose rows each sum to 1 and whose columns each sum to m/n .	The special case B ( n ) =T ( n , n ) is the much-studied Birkhoff-von Neumann polytope of doubly-stochastic matrices .	Using a recent asymptotic enumeration of non-negative integer matrices ( Canfield and McKay , 2007 ) , we determine the asymptotic volume of T ( m , n ) as n goes to infinity , with m=m ( n ) such that m/n neither decreases nor increases too quickly .
0	The stability of a metal thin films on a dielectric substrate is conditioned by the magnitude of the interactive forces at the interface .	In the case of a non-reactive interface and weak adhesion , the minimization of free surface energy gives rise to an instability of the thin film .	In order to study these effects , Pt thin films with a thickness of 50 nm were deposited via ion-beam sputtering on yttria stabilized zirconia single crystals .	All Pt films were subjected to heat treatments up to 973 K for 2 h. The morphological evolution of Pt thin films has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and standard image analysis techniques .	Three main observations have been made : i ) the deposition method has a direct impact on the morphological evolution of the film during annealing .
3	While world-line representations are natural in the Hamiltonian formulation , they can also be constructed directly in Euclidean space .	Developments in algorithms over the past decade suggest that there is a new computational approach to a class of quantum field theories .	This approach is based on rewriting the partition function in a representation similar to the world-line representation and hence we shall call it the `` WL-approach '' .	This approach is likely to be more powerful than the conventional approach in some regions of parameter space , especially in the presence of chemical potentials or massless fermions .	We first describe the approach and its advantages by considering the classical XY model in the presence of a chemical potential .
2	The high value for K_2 is , in part , due to the high binary inclination of the system but may also indicate a high neutron star mass .	We measured the radial velocity curve of the companion of the neutron star X-ray transient XTE J2123-058 .	Its semi-amplitude ( K_2 ) of 298.5 +/- 6.9 km/s is the highest value that has been measured for any neutron star LMXB .	The mass function ( f_2 ) of 0.684 +/- 0.047 solar masses , along with our constraints on the companion 's spectral type ( K5V-K9V ) and previous constraints on the inclination , gives a likely range of neutron star masses from 1.2 to 1.8 solar masses .	We also derive a source distance of 8.5 +/- 2.5 kpc , indicating that XTE J2123-058 is unusually far , 5.0 +/- 1.5 kpc , from the Galactic plane .
2	The method implies reconstruction of the magnetic field change inside the hole .	Flux penetration into type-II superconducing films is simulated for transverse applied magnetic field and flux creep dynamics .	The films contain macroscopic , non-conducting holes and we suggest a new method to introduce the holes in the simulation formalism .	We find that in the region between the hole and the edge the current density is compressed so that the flux density is slightly reduced , but the traffic of flux is significantly increased .	The results are in good agreement with magneto-optical studies of flux distributions in YBCO films .
0	QJT ( Quantum Jet Theory ) is the quantum theory of jets , which can be canonically identified with truncated Taylor series .	Ultralocality requires a novel quantization scheme , where dynamics is treated as a constraint in the history phase space .	QJT differs from QFT since it involves a new datum : the expansion point .	This difference is substantial because it leads to new gauge and diff anomalies , which are necessary to combine background independence with locality .	Physically , the new ingredient is that the observer 's trajectory is explicitly introduced and quantized together with the fields .
4	In the alternative approach , it is demonstrated that even simple versions of modified gravity may lead to the unification of matter dominated and accelerated phases at the price of the introduction of compensating dark energy .	We develop the general scheme for modified $ f ( R ) $ gravity reconstruction from any realistic FRW cosmology .	We formulate several versions of modified gravity compatible with Solar System tests where the following sequence of cosmological epochs occurs : a. matter dominated phase ( with or without usual matter ) , transition from decceleration to acceleration , accelerating epoch consistent with recent WMAP data b .	$ \Lambda $ CDM cosmology without cosmological constant .	As a rule , such modified gravities are expressed implicitly ( in terms of special functions ) with late-time asymptotics of known type ( for instance , the model with negative and positive powers of curvature ) .
3	The system is solved by relaxing the constraint that each survey imposes upon the cosmic fields .	The least-action principle ( LAP ) method is used on four galaxy redshift surveys to measure the density parameter Omega_m and the matter and galaxy-galaxy power spectra .	The datasets are PSCz , ORS , Mark III and SFI .	The LAP method is applied on the surveys simultaneously , resulting in an overconstrained dynamical system that describes the cosmic overdensities and velocity flows .	A least-squares optimization of the errors that arise in the process yields the cosmic fields and the value of Omega_m that is the best fit to the ensemble of datasets .
1	Recently , pulsed photoionization light gratings have demonstrated their suitability for high mass matter-wave physics .	Extending the range of quantum interferometry to a wider class of composite nanoparticles requires new tools to diffract matter waves .	Here we extend quantum interference experiments to a new class of particles by introducing photofragmentation beam splitters into time-domain matter-wave interferometry .	Photofragmentation gratings can act on objects as different as van der Waals clusters and biomolecules which are thermally unstable and often resilient to single-photon ionization .	We present data that demonstrate this coherent beam splitting mechanism with clusters of hexafluorobenzene and we show single-photon depletion gratings based both on fragmentation and ionization for clusters of vanillin .
0	We find an exotic spin excitation in a magnetically ordered system with spin orbit magnetism in 2D , where the order parameter has a net spin current and no net magnetization .	Starting from a Fermi liquid theory , similar to that for a weak ferromagnet , we show that this excitation emerges from an exotic magnetic Fermi liquid state that is protected by a generalized Pomeranchuck condition .	We derive the propagating mode using the Landau kinetic equation , and find that the dispersion of the mode has a $ \sqrt q $ behavior in leading order in 2D .	We find an instability toward superconductivity induced by this exotic mode , and a further analysis based on the forward scattering sum rule strongly suggests that this superconductivity has p-wave pairing symmetry .	We perform similar studies in the 3D case , with a slightly different magnetic system and find that the mode leads to a Lifshitz-like instability most likely toward an inhomogeneous magnetic state in one of the phases .
0	We present photometric and spectroscopic optical and near-infrared ( NIR ) observations ( Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory , Chile ( ESO ID 63.H-0493 and 64.H-0382 ) ) taken during the outburst of the microquasar V4641 Sgr = SAX J1819.3-2525 ( in'tzand et al. , 2000 ) in September 1999 .	We observed an increase in the J-Ks colour between 5 and 8 days after the outburst , which we interpret as likely evidence for the presence of dust around the source .	We also observed an extraordinarily strong , broad and variable H_alpha line , with a velocity width of 4560 km/s suggesting the presence of a high-velocity outflow component .	We constrain the distance of the system between 3 and 8 kpc , locating it further away than previously derived from radio observations ( Hjellming et al. , 2000 ) , but consistent with Orosz et al . ( 2001 ) .	We then discuss the nature of this system , showing that the companion star is either a B3-A2 main sequence star , or a B3-A2 sub-giant crossing the Hertzsprung gap .
3	25 ( 2013 ) 395-407 ] , the proposed estimator is also asymptotically indistinguishable from the empirical distribution function based on the unobserved errors .	We propose kernel estimator for the distribution function of unobserved errors in autoregressive time series , based on residuals computed by estimating the autoregressive coefficients with the Yule-Walker method .	Under mild assumptions , we establish oracle efficiency of the proposed estimator , that is , it is asymptotically as efficient as the kernel estimator of the distribution function based on the unobserved error sequence itself .	Applying the result of Wang , Cheng and Yang [ J. Nonparametr.Stat .	A smooth simultaneous confidence band ( SCB ) is then constructed based on the proposed smooth distribution estimator and Kolmogorov distribution .
1	The SNR is in seen projection against ( and appears to be interacting with ) the bright HII region NGC592 .	We present and interpret new X-ray data for M33SNR21 , the brightest X-ray supernova remnant ( SNR ) in M33 .	Data for this source were obtained as part of the Chandra ACIS Survey of M33 ( ChASeM33 ) Very Large Project .	The nearly on-axis Chandra data resolve the SNR into a ~5 '' diameter ( 20 pc at our assumed M33 distance of 817+/-58 kpc ) slightly elliptical shell .	The shell is brighter in the east , which suggests that it is encountering higher density material in that direction .
3	This permits the usage of simple agglomerative clustering on the surviving hypotheses for accurate model selection .	Random hypothesis sampling lies at the core of many popular robust fitting techniques such as RANSAC .	In this paper , we propose a novel hypothesis sampling scheme based on incremental computation of distances between partial rankings ( top- $ k $ lists ) derived from residual sorting information .	Our method simultaneously ( 1 ) guides the sampling such that hypotheses corresponding to all true structures can be quickly retrieved and ( 2 ) filters the hypotheses such that only a small but very promising subset remain .	The outcome is a highly efficient multi-structure robust estimation technique .
0	We report results from Spitzer observations of SNR 0509-68.7 , also known as N103B , a young Type Ia supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud that shows interaction with a dense medium in its western hemisphere .	Our images show that N103B has strong IR emission from warm dust in the post-shock environment .	The post-shock gas density we derive , 45 cm $ ^ { -3 } $ , is much higher than in other Type Ia remnants in the LMC , though a lack of spatial resolution may bias measurements towards regions of higher than average density .	This density is similar to that in Kepler 's SNR , a Type Ia interacting with a circumstellar medium .	Optical images show H $ \alpha $ emission along the entire periphery of the western portion of the shock , with [ O III ] and [ S II ] lines emitted from a few dense clumps of material where the shock has become radiative .
0	Correlation and spectral analysis represent the standard tools to study interdependence in statistical data .	However , for the stochastic processes with heavy-tailed distributions such that the variance diverges , these tools are inadequate .	The heavy-tailed processes are ubiquitous in nature and finance .	We here discuss codifference as a convenient measure to study statistical interdependence , and we aim to give a short introductory review of its properties .	By taking different known stochastic processes as generic examples , we present explicit formulas for their codifferences .
1	For fixed $ x $ , the process $ F ( t ) =u ( x , t ) $ has a nontrivial quartic variation .	We consider the solution $ u ( x , t ) $ to a stochastic heat equation .	It follows that $ F $ is not a semimartingale , so a stochastic integral with respect to $ F $ can not be defined in the classical It\^ { o } sense .	We show that for sufficiently differentiable functions $ g ( x , t ) $ , a stochastic integral $ \int g ( F ( t ) , t ) \ , dF ( t ) $ exists as a limit of discrete , midpoint-style Riemann sums , where the limit is taken in distribution in the Skorokhod space of cadlag functions .	Moreover , we show that this integral satisfies a change of variable formula with a correction term that is an ordinary It\^ { o } integral with respect to a Brownian motion that is independent of $ F $ .
2	PQCA are QCA of a particular form , where incoming information is scattered by a fixed unitary U before being redistributed and rescattered .	This research describes a three dimensional quantum cellular automaton ( QCA ) which can simulate all other 3D QCA .	This intrinsically universal QCA belongs to the simplest subclass of QCA : Partitioned QCA ( PQCA ) .	Our construction is minimal amongst PQCA , having block size 2 x 2 x 2 and cell dimension 2 .	Signals , wires and gates emerge in an elegant fashion .
4	The CO polarization direction appears to vary smoothly from an hourglass field around the core to an arc-like morphology wrapping around the outflow , suggesting a helical structure of magnetic fields that inherits the poloidal fields at the launching point and consists of toroidal fields at a farther distance of outflow .	We present Submillimeter Array ( SMA ) polarization observations of the CO $ J $ = 3 -- 2 line toward the NGC1333 IRAS 4A .	The CO Stokes $ I $ maps at an angular resolution of $ \sim $ 1 $ \arcsec $ reveal two bipolar outflows from the binary sources of the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A .	The kinematic features of the CO emission can be modeled by wind-driven outflows at $ \sim $ 20 $ \arcdeg $ inclined from the plane of the sky .	Close to the protostars the CO polarization , at an angular resolution of $ \sim $ $ 2\farcs3 $ , has a position angle approximately parallel to the magnetic field direction inferred from the dust polarizations .
3	Here we propose a novel approach for the reconstruction of serial real-time MRI data which integrates the deformations between nearby frames into the data consistency term .	Real-time magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) methods generally shorten the measuring time by acquiring less data than needed according to the sampling theorem .	In order to obtain a proper image from such undersampled data , the reconstruction is commonly defined as the solution of an inverse problem , which is regularized by a priori assumptions about the object .	While practical realizations have hitherto been surprisingly successful , strong assumptions about the continuity of image features may affect the temporal fidelity of the estimated images .	The method is not required to be affine or rigid and does not need additional measurements .
3	When a time-dependent magnetic flux ( TDMF ) is applied to one of the qubits , a well-chosen frequency of the TDMF can be used to compensate the initial detuning and to couple two qubits .	We propose an experimentally realizable method to control the coupling between two flux qubits .	In our proposal , the bias fluxes are always fixed for these two inductively-coupled qubits .	The detuning of these two qubits can be initially chosen to be sufficiently large , so that their initial interbit coupling is almost negligible .	This proposed method avoids fast changes of either qubit frequencies or the amplitudes of the bias magnetic fluxes through the qubit loops , and also offers a remarkable way to implement any logic gate as well as tomographically measure flux qubit states .
4	The companion does not contribute to the optical light of the system , except through a distinct reflection effect .	We report the discovery of an eclipsing binary -- PTF1 J072456 $ + $ 125301 -- composed of a subdwarf B ( sdB ) star ( $ g'=17.2^m $ ) with a faint companion .	Subdwarf B stars are core helium-burning stars , which can be found on the extreme horizontal branch .	About half of them reside in close binary systems , but few are known to be eclipsing , for which fundamental stellar parameters can be derived.\newline We conducted an analysis of photometric data and spectra from the Palomar 60 '' and the 200 '' Hale telescope respectively .	A quantitative spectral analysis found an effective temperature of $ T_ { \text { eff } } =33900\pm350 $ \ , K , log g = $ 5.74\pm0.08 $ and log ( $ n_ { \text { He } } /n_ { \text { H } } ) = -2.02 \pm0.07 $ , typical for an sdB star .
3	We show that under very simple and natural assumption it links the sfermion mass pattern to those of fermions in a remarkable way .	The concept of non-abelian horizontal symmetry $ SU ( 3 ) _H $ can greatly help in understanding the fermion and sfermion flavour structures in supersymmetric grand unification .	For the sake of demonstration the $ SU ( 5 ) \times SU ( 3 ) _H $ model , suggested earlier in ref .	\cite { PLB85 } , is revisited .	All dangerous supersymmetric flavour-changing contributions are naturally suppressed in a general case , independently of the concrete texture for fermion mass matrices .
0	The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in an ionized plasma is considered with a focus on the generation of magnetic field via the Biermann battery mechanisms .	The problem is studied through direct numerical simulations of two counter-directed flows in 2D geometry .	The simulations demonstrate the formation of eddies and their further interaction resulting in a large single vortex .	At early stages , the generated magnetic field evolves due to the baroclinic term in the induction equation , revealing significantly different structures from the vorticity field , despite the fact that magnetic field and vorticity obey identical equations .	At later times , the magnetic field exhibits complex behavior and continues to grow even after a hydrodynamic vortex has developed .
3	In this work , ab initio computational methods are used to examine the energy potentials and electronic properties of different extents of oxidation in GaN .	GaN is a wide-bandgap semiconductor used in high-efficiency LEDs and solar cells .	The solid is produced industrially at high chemical purities by deposition from a vapour phase , and oxygen may be included at this stage .	Oxidation represents a potential path for tuning its properties without introducing more exotic elements or extreme processing conditions .	Solid-state vibrational properties of Ga , GaN , Ga2O3 and a single substitutional oxygen defect have been studied using the harmonic approximation with supercells .
1	We discuss in details two-components ( P-odd ) and four-components ( P-even ) fermion fields .	We investigate ( 2+1 ) -dimensional QED coupled with Dirac fermions both at zero and finite temperature .	We focus on P-odd and P-even Dirac fermions in presence of an external constant magnetic field .	In the spontaneous generation of the magnetic condensate survives even at infinite temperature .	We also discuss the spontaneous generation of fermion mass in presence of an external magnetic field .
0	It is argued that the surface radius of a compact source can not be less than its gravitational radius due to the strong gravitational time dilation effects .	The such `` topological '' difference between the Newtonian and relativistic gravity leads to the known observable effects .	The hierarchy of supercompact stars , more massive than neutron stars , such as heavy baryon , quark ( subquark ? )	and other heavy particle stars is predicted instead of the black holes .	The lack of the cosmological singularity and a gravitational nature of the regularizations of loop divergencies in quantum field theory are also discussed .
1	Four active regions emerging near the solar limb have been considered .	The dynamics of horizontal plasma flows during the first hours of the emergence of active region magnetic flux in the solar photosphere have been analyzed using SOHO/MDI data .	It has been found that extended regions of Doppler velocities with different signs are formed in the first hours of the magnetic flux emergence in the horizontal velocity field .	The flows observed are directly connected with the emerging magnetic flux ; they form at the beginning of the emergence of active regions and are present for a few hours .	The Doppler velocities of flows observed increase gradually and reach their peak values 4-12 hours after the start of the magnetic flux emergence .
3	In this paper , we study random walks on T-fractal and provided general methods to calculate the MTT for any target node and the MDT for any source node .	Efficiently controlling the diffusion process is crucial in the study of diffusion problem in complex systems .	In the sense of random walks with a single trap , mean trapping time ( MTT ) and mean diffusing time ( MDT ) are good measures of trapping efficiency and diffusion efficiency respectively .	They both vary with the location of the node .	Using the MTT and the MDT as the measure of trapping efficiency and diffusion efficiency respectively , we compare the trapping efficiency and diffusion efficiency among all nodes of T-fractal and find the best ( or worst ) trapping sites and the best ( or worst ) diffusing sites .
2	The information , characterized by a quantity called the inefficiency , embedded in the agent 's strategies performance turns out to be very different from that of the other agents .	We study a version of the minority game in which one agent is allowed to join the game in a random fashion .	It is shown that in the crowded regime , i.e. , for small values of the memory size $ m $ of the agents in the population , the agent performs significantly well if she decides to participate the game randomly with a probability $ q $ { \em and } she records the performance of her strategies only in the turns that she participates .	Detailed numerical studies reveal a relationship between the success rate of the agent and the inefficiency .	The relationship can be understood analytically in terms of the dynamics in which the various possible histories are being visited as the game proceeds .
0	Recently an orthogonal basis of $ \mathcal { W } _N $ -algebra ( AFLT basis ) labeled by $ N $ -tuple Young diagrams was found in the context of 4D/2D duality .	Recursion relations among the basis are summarized in the form of an algebra SH $ ^c $ which is universal for any $ N $ .	We show that it has an $ \mathfrak { S } _3 $ automorphism which is referred to as triality .	We study the level-rank duality between minimal models , which is a special example of the automorphism .	It is shown that the nonvanishing states in both systems are described by $ N $ or $ M $ Young diagrams with the rows of boxes appropriately shuffled .
1	The system is composed of three absorbing clouds where 137 H2 and HD absorption features were detected .	Molecular hydrogen transitions in the sub-damped Lyman alpha absorber at redshift z = 2.69 , toward the background quasar SDSS J123714.60+064759.5 , were analyzed in order to search for a possible variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio mu over a cosmological time-scale .	The observations were taken with the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph with a signal-to-noise ratio of 32 per 2.5 km/s pixel , covering the wavelengths from 356.6 to 409.5 nm .	A comprehensive fitting method was used to fit all the absorption features at once .	Systematic effects of distortions to the wavelength calibrations were analyzed in detail from measurements of asteroid and `solar twin ' spectra , and were corrected for .
1	In these arrays , we have identified a transition between a symmetric dipole oscillation ( DO ) and a symmetry-breaking Bloch oscillation ( BO ) under appropriate conditions .	We study the optical oscillations of supermodes in planar optical waveguide arrays with parabolically graded propagation constant in individual waveguide interacting through nearest neighbor couplings .	There exist obvious correspondences between gradon localization and various optical oscillations .	By virtue of an analogue between the oscillation of optical system and that of a plane pendulum , we propose a shift of the graded profile to cause a transition from BO to DO .	We confirm the optical transition by means of Hamiltonian optics , as well as by the field evolution of the supermodes .
2	Second , it remains unclear how close it matches the task loss such as the top-k error rate or other non-differentiable evaluation metrics which we aim to optimize ultimately .	Despite being the standard loss function to train multi-class neural networks , the log-softmax has two potential limitations .	First , it involves computations that scale linearly with the number of output classes , which can restrict the size of problems we are able to tackle with current hardware .	In this paper , we introduce an alternative classification loss function , the Z-loss , which is designed to address these two issues .	Unlike the log-softmax , it has the desirable property of belonging to the spherical loss family ( Vincent et al. , 2015 ) , a class of loss functions for which training can be performed very efficiently with a complexity independent of the number of output classes .
4	To study experimentally the effect of inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum , the method of modeling in the millimeter wave range is applied .	The influence of random surface inhomogeneities on spectral properties of open microresonators is studied both theoretically and experimentally .	To solve the equations governing the dynamics of electromagnetic fields the method of eigen-mode separation is applied previously developed with reference to inhomogeneous systems subject to arbitrary external static potential .	We prove theoretically that it is the gradient mechanism of wave-surface scattering which is the highly responsible for non-dissipative loss in the resonator .	The influence of side-boundary inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum is shown to be described in terms of effective renormalization of mode wave numbers jointly with azimuth indices in the characteristic equation .
0	I consider the possibility that Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays are accelerated in Gamma Ray Bursts located in the Galactic corona , thus circumventing the problem raised by Greisen -- Zatsepin -- Kuz'min cutoff .	The acceleration of UHECRs could occur in the pulsars which , in the coronal GRB model , produce them : the same parameters that permit fitting GRBs ' observations in the model of Podsiadlowski , Rees and Ruderman ( 1995 ) lead to an estimate of the highest achievable energies corresponding to that of the Bird et al ( 1994 ) event , and to very low luminosities in cosmic rays .	I show that , if the observations of Milgrom and Usov ( 1995a ) are confirmed , the extragalactic GRBs ' model for the acceleration of UHECRs is untenable , but the same constraint does not apply to the coronal model .	Also , I show that the efficiency of particle acceleration needs be much smaller ( and less demanding ) than in cosmological models of GRBs .	Uncertainties remain about the ensuing cosmic ray spectral distribution .
1	Five orbits of HST time were used to obtain spectra at five parallel slit configurations , at a position angle of 58 degrees , with spatial resolution 0.2 arcseconds across and 0.1 arcseconds along each slit .	Using The Hubble Space Telescope 's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph HST 's STIS , observations of the OIII emission from the narrow-line region ( NLR ) of NGC 4151 were obtained and radial velocities determined .	A spectral resolving power of ~ 9,000 with the G430M grating gave velocity measurements accurate to ~ 34 km/s .	A kinematic model was generated to match the radial velocities , for comparison to previous kinematic models of biconical radial outflow developed for low-dispersion spectra at two slit positions .	The new high-resolution spectra permit the measurement of accurate velocity dispersions for each radial-velocity component .
4	Despite the fact that G can fail to be conjugate in \GL_ { 2d } ( Q_\ell ) to a subgroup of \Sp_ { 2d } ( Z_\ell ) , we prove that it can nevertheless be embedded in \Sp_ { 2d } ( F_\ell ) in such a way that the characteristic polynomials are preserved ( mod \ell ) , as long as \ell & gt ; 3 .	It is well-known that every finite subgroup of GL_d ( Q_ { \ell } ) is conjugate to a subgroup of GL_d ( Z_ { \ell } ) .	However , this does not remain true if we replace general linear groups by symplectic groups .	We say that G is a group of inertia type if G is a finite group which has a normal Sylow-p-subgroup with cyclic quotient .	We show that if \ell & gt ; d+1 , and G is a subgroup of Sp_ { 2d } ( Q_ { \ell } ) of inertia type , then G is conjugate in GL_ { 2d } ( Q_ { \ell } ) to a subgroup of \Sp_ { 2d } ( Z_ { \ell } ) .
0	We present a model that realizes both resonance-Regge ( Veneziano ) and parton-hadron ( Bloom-Gilman ) duality .	We first review the features of the Veneziano model and we discuss how parton-hadron duality appears in the Bloom-Gilman model .	Then we review limitations of the Veneziano model , namely that the zero-width resonances in the Veneziano model violate unitarity and Mandelstam analyticity .	We discuss how such problems are alleviated in models that construct dual amplitudes with Mandelstam analyticity ( so-called DAMA models ) .	We then introduce a modified DAMA model , and we discuss its properties .
3	Several experiments have now confirmed the observation of neutrino oscillations by detecting neutrinos from secondary nuclear processes in the Sun ; this is the first direct spectral measurement of the neutrinos from the keystone proton-proton fusion .	The Sun is fueled by a series of nuclear reactions that produce the energy that makes it shine .	The primary reaction is the fusion of two protons into a deuteron , a positron and a neutrino .	These neutrinos constitute the vast majority of neutrinos reaching Earth , providing us with key information about what goes on at the core of our star .	This observation is a crucial step towards the completion of the spectroscopy of pp-chain neutrinos , as well as further validation of the LMA-MSW model of neutrino oscillations .
0	This paper uses natural language processing to create the first machine-coded democracy index , which I call Automated Democracy Scores ( ADS ) .	The ADS are based on 42 million news articles from 6,043 different sources and cover all independent countries in the 1993-2012 period .	Unlike the democracy indices we have today the ADS are replicable and have standard errors small enough to actually distinguish between cases .	The ADS are produced with supervised learning .	Three approaches are tried : a ) a combination of Latent Semantic Analysis and tree-based regression methods ; b ) a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation and tree-based regression methods ; and c ) the Wordscores algorithm .
3	Several decreasing values between 5.19 and 4.506 were published in the years between .	We show that a randomly chosen 3-CNF formula over n variables with clauses-to-variables ratio at least 4.4898 is , as n grows large , asymptotically almost surely unsatisfiable .	The previous best such bound , due to Dubois in 1999 , was 4.506 .	The first such bound , independently discovered by many groups of researchers since 1983 , was 5.19 .	The probabilistic techniques we use for the proof are , we believe , of independent interest .
1	2013 ) is a code written in standard Fortran 77 and aimed at finding the best atmospheric parameters and the abundance of individual elements by using the equivalent widths ( EWs ) of metallic lines , providing graphical and statistical tools to evaluate the goodness of the solution .	GALA ( Mucciarelli et al .	The derivation of the abundances is performed by using a modified version of the WIDTH9 code ( originally developed by R. L. Kurucz ) in its Linux version ( Sbordone et al.2004 ) .	In the current release , GALA can manage the classical grid of ATLAS9 models computed by ( Castelli & amp ; Kurucz , 2004 ) , the grid of new ATLAS9 models computed for the APOGEE survey ( Mezsaros et al. , 2012 ) and the MARCS models with the standard composition ( Gustafsson et al. , 2008 ) .	When the ATLAS9 models are used , new model atmospheres are calculated starting from an existing guess model and according to the pre-tabulated Opacity Distribution Functions ( ODF ) and Rosseland opacity tables .
0	The field equations of the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation are presented in different representations , related to each other by conformal transformations of the metric .	One of the representations resembles the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory , and is the starting point for the generation of exact electrostatic and magnetostatic exterior solutions .	The corresponding solutions for each specific theory can be obtained by transforming back to the original canonical representation , and the conversions are given for the theories of Jordan-Brans-Dicke , Barker , Schwinger , and conformally invariant coupling .	The electrostatic solutions represent the exterior metrics and fields of configurations where the gravitational and electric equipotential surfaces have the same symmetry .	A particular family of electrostatic solutions is developed , which includes as special case the spherically symmetric solutions of the scalar-tensor theories .
2	The quantum spin-liquid state found in the Hubbard model is shown to be robust against weak spin-orbit interaction , and is not adiabatically connected to the spin-Hall insulating state .	We consider the Kane-Mele model with spin-orbit coupling supplemented by a Hubbard U term .	On the basis of projective auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations on lattice sizes up to 15 x 15 , we map out the phase diagram .	Beyond a critical value of U & gt ; U_c both states are unstable toward magnetic ordering .	Within the quantum spin-Hall state we study the spin , charge and single-particle dynamics of the helical Luttinger liquid by retaining the Hubbard interaction only on the edge of a ribbon .
3	These do not have analogue within the classical relaxation-dephasing picture , but are inherently quantum many-body effects .	The classical Bloch equations of spin magnetization transport is extended to fully time-dependent and highly-nonlinear nonequilibrium spin magnetization quantum distribution function transport ( SMQDFT ) equations .	The relevant variables are the spinor correlation functions which separate into charge and spin magnetization distributions that becomes highly coupled in SMQDFT equa- tions .	The leading terms consist of the Boltzmann kinetic equation with spin-orbit coupling in a magnetic eld together with spin-dependent scattering terms which contribute to the torque .	These should incorporate the spatiotemporal-dependent phase-space dynam- ics of Elliot-Yafet and Dyakonov-Perel scatterings .
4	Our measurements show the appearance of a hitherto unobserved channel of electronic backscattering along surface q-vector \Gamma\kappa .	In topological insulators ( TI ) , strong spin-orbit coupling results in non-trivial scattering processes of the surface states , whose effects include suppressed back scattering1 , 2 , 3 , 4 weak anti-localization5 , 6 and the possibility of an exotic Kondo effect that mimics graphene7 .	Introducing time reversal breaking perturbations and establishing long-range magnetic order has been theorized to lead to the formation of quantized magnetoelectric phenomena8 , fractionalized charge excitations , and the appearance of quantum wire states9 .	A key , elusive , step in exploring these and other novel electronic phases is the experimental observation of charge backscattering due to spin-flip processes at the surface of a magnetically-doped TI .	Here we utilize Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( FT-STS ) to probe the surface of a magnetically doped TI , Bi2-xFexTe3+d .
1	One effect of the disorder is that conduction through the array is possible only for voltages across the array that exceed a critical voltage $ V_T $ .	We investigate the zero-temperature transport of electrons in a model of quantum dot arrays with a disordered background potential .	We investigate the behavior of arrays in three voltage regimes : below , at and above the critical voltage .	For voltages less than $ V_T $ , we find that the features of the invasion of charge onto the array depend on whether the dots have uniform or varying capacitances .	We compute the first conduction path at voltages just above $ V_T $ using a transfer-matrix style algorithm .
2	For non-discrete groups we investigate the subalgebra of regular convolution dominated operators $ CD_ { reg } ( G ) $ .	For a locally compact group $ G $ we consider the algebra $ CD ( G ) $ of convolution dominated operators on $ L^ { 2 } ( G ) $ : An operator $ A : L^2 ( G ) \to L^2 ( G ) $ is called convolution dominated if there exists $ a\in L^1 ( G ) $ such that for all $ f \in L^2 ( G ) $ $ |Af ( x ) | \leq a * |f| ( x ) $ , for almost all $ x \in G $ .	In the case of discrete groups those operators can be dealt with quite sufficiently if the group in question is rigidly symmetric .	For amenable $ G $ which is rigidly symmetric as a discrete group , we show that any element of $ CD_ { reg } ( G ) $ is invertible in $ CD_ { reg } ( G ) $ if it is invertible as a bounded operator on $ L^2 ( G ) $ .	We give an example of a symmetric group $ E $ for which the convolution dominated operators are not inverse-closed in the bounded operators on $ L^2 ( E ) $ .
4	We show , constructively , that graphs of bounded threshold-rank satisfy a weak Szemeredi regularity lemma analogous to the one proved by Frieze and Kannan [ FK99 ] for dense graphs .	Kolla and Tulsiani [ KT07 , Kolla11 } and Arora , Barak and Steurer [ ABS10 ] introduced the technique of subspace enumeration , which gives approximation algorithms for graph problems such as unique games and small set expansion ; the running time of such algorithms is exponential in the threshold-rank of the graph .	Guruswami and Sinop [ GS11 , GS12 ] , and Barak , Raghavendra , and Steurer [ BRS11 ] developed an alternative approach to the design of approximation algorithms for graphs of bounded threshold-rank , based on semidefinite programming relaxations in the Lassere hierarchy and on novel rounding techniques .	These algorithms are faster than the ones based on subspace enumeration and work on a broad class of problems .	In this paper we develop a third approach to the design of such algorithms .
4	This provides a systematic scheme which is supposed to exactly converge to the critical parameters of the transition in the large trap-size limit .	We investigate the critical behavior of trapped particle systems at the low-temperature superfluid transition .	In particular , we consider the three-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of a trapping harmonic potential coupled with the particle density , which is a realistic model of cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices .	We present a numerical study based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations , analyzed in the framework of the trap-size scaling ( TSS ) .	We show how the critical parameters can be derived from the trap-size dependences of appropriate observables , matching them with TSS .
3	We develop efficient MCMC algorithms for learning NMDR models from partially observed node relationships .	We introduce the nonparametric metadata dependent relational ( NMDR ) model , a Bayesian nonparametric stochastic block model for network data .	The NMDR allows the entities associated with each node to have mixed membership in an unbounded collection of latent communities .	Learned regression models allow these memberships to depend on , and be predicted from , arbitrary node metadata .	Retrospective MCMC methods allow our sampler to work directly with the infinite stick-breaking representation of the NMDR , avoiding the need for finite truncations .
4	Our solutions can be classified into two branches , which reduce to the self-accelerating and normal solutions in the limit of the original five-dimensional DGP model .	The self-accelerating branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati ( DGP ) five-dimensional braneworld has provided a compelling model for the current cosmic acceleration .	Recent observations , however , have not favored it so much .	We discuss the solutions which contain a de Sitter 3-brane in the cascading DGP braneworld model , which is a kind of higher-dimensional generalizations of the DGP model , where a $ p $ -dimensional brane is placed on a $ ( p+1 ) $ -dimensional one and the $ p $ -brane action contains the $ ( p+1 ) $ -dimensional induced scalar curvature term .	In the simplest six-dimensional model , we derive the solutions .
0	Conventional renormalization methods in statistical physics and lattice quantum field theory assume a flat metric background .	We outline here a generalization of such methods to models on discretized spaces without metric background .	Cellular decompositions play the role of discretizations .	The group of scale transformations is replaced by the groupoid of changes of cellular decompositions .	We introduce cellular moves which generate this groupoid and allow to define a renormalization groupoid flow .
3	The data stream is composed of Gaussian instrumental noise plus an unknown BBH waveform .	The Mock LISA Data Challenge is a worldwide effort to solve the LISA data analysis problem .	We present here our results for the Massive Black Hole Binary ( BBH ) section of Round 1 .	Our results cover Challenge 1.2.1 , where the coalescence of the binary is seen , and Challenge 1.2.2 , where the coalescence occurs after the simulated observational period .	Our search algorithm is based on a variant of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that uses Metropolis-Hastings sampling and thermostated frequency annealing .
1	We consider the cosmic inflation driven by a multiple number of the inflaton fields , which decay into both radiation and pressureless matter components .	We study the evolution of the curvature perturbation on the super-horizon scales starting from the inflationary epoch until there remains only a single dynamical degree of freedom , presureless matter , in the universe .	We present a complete set of the exact background and perturbation equations which describe the evolution of the universe throughout its history .	By applying these equations to the simple but reasonable model of multi-field chaotic inflation , we explicitly show that the total curvature perturbation is continuously varying because of the non-adiabatic components of the curvature perturbation generated by the multiple inflaton fields throughout the whole evolution of the universe .	We also provide an useful analytic estimation of the total as well as matter and radiation curvature perturbations , assuming that matter is completely decoupled from radiation from the beginning .
2	Its signature feature is the emergence of a self-organized critical state .	We explore a simple lattice field model intended to describe statistical properties of high frequency financial markets .	The model is relevant in the cross-disciplinary area of econophysics .	This implies scale invariance of the model , without tuning parameters .	Prominent results of our simulation are time series of gains , prices , volatility , and gains frequency distributions , which all compare favorably to features of historical market data .
1	In the experiment , a superconducting qubit was strongly coupled to a microwave cavity , the conventional arrangement of circuit quantum electrodynamics .	We demonstrate amplification ( and attenuation ) of a probe signal by a driven two-level quantum system in the Landau-Zener regime .	Two different types of flux qubits show a similar result , lasing at the points where amplification takes place .	The experimental data are explained by the interaction of the probe signal with Rabi-like oscillations .	The latter are created by constructive interference of Landau-Zener-St\ '' { u } ckelberg-Majorana ( LZSM ) transitions during the driving period of the qubit .
0	A master equation is formulated to model the states of the grain charge in a general multi-component plasma , where there are electrons and various kinds of positive or negative ions that are singly or multiply charged .	A Fokker-Planck equation is developed from the master equation through the system-size expansion method .	The Fokker-Planck equation has a Gaussian solution with a mean and variance governed by two initial-value differential equations involving the rates of the attachment of ions and electrons to the dust grain .	Grain charging in a plasma containing electrons , protons and alpha particles with Maxwellian distributions is considered as an example problem .	The Gaussian solution is in very good agreement with the master equation solution numerically obtained for this problem .
1	We call $ X $ a dynamic bridge , because its terminal value $ Z_1 $ is not known in advance .	Given a Markovian Brownian martingale $ Z $ , we build a process $ X $ which is a martingale in its own filtration and satisfies $ X_1 = Z_1 $ .	We compute explicitly its semimartingale decomposition under both its own filtration $ \cF^X $ and the filtration $ \cF^ { X , Z } $ jointly generated by $ X $ and $ Z $ .	Our construction is heavily based on parabolic PDE 's and filtering techniques .	As an application , we explicitly solve an equilibrium model with insider trading , that can be viewed as a non-Gaussian generalization of Back and Pedersen 's \cite { BP } , where insider 's additional information evolves over time .
2	The class labels $ \ell_i\in\ { -1 , 1\ } $ are also unknown and the main interest is to estimate them .	Consider a two-class clustering problem where we observe $ X_i = \ell_i \mu + Z_i $ , $ Z_i \stackrel { iid } { \sim } N ( 0 , I_p ) $ , $ 1 \leq i \leq n $ .	The feature vector $ \mu\in R^p $ is unknown but is presumably sparse .	We are interested in the statistical limits .	In the two-dimensional phase space calibrating the rarity and strengths of useful features , we find the precise demarcation for the Region of Impossibility and Region of Possibility .
4	This means that the predictive part for the future is not reliable either .	A two-wave dynamo model was recently proposed by Zharkova et al .	( 2015 , Zh15 henceforth ) , which aims at long-term predictions of solar activity for millennia ahead and backwards .	Here we confront the backward model predictions for the last 800 years with known variability of solar activity , using both direct sunspot observations since 1610 and reconstructions based on cosmogenic radionuclide data .	We show that the Zh15 model fails to reproduce the well-established features of the solar activity evolution during the last millennium .
3	These high-intensity GeV-range proton drivers are particularly challenging , encountering duty cycle and space-charge limits in the synchrotron and machine size concerns in the weaker-focusing cyclotrons ; a 10-20 MW proton driver is not presently considered technically achievable with conventional re-circulating accelerators .	Accelerators are playing increasingly important roles in basic science , technology , and medicine including nuclear power , industrial irradiation , material science , and neutrino production .	Proton and light-ion accelerators in particular have many research , energy and medical applications , providing one of the most effective treatments for many types of cancer .	Ultra high-intensity and high-energy ( GeV ) proton drivers are a critical technology for accelerator-driven sub-critical reactors ( ADS ) and many HEP programs ( Muon Collider ) .	One , as-yet , unexplored re-circulating accelerator , the Fixed-field Alternating Gradient , or FFAG , is an attractive alternative to the cyclotron .
3	The torus is hundreds of pc across and collimates the starburst-driven nuclear outflow .	Chandra observations of the core of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 reveal a heavily absorbed source of hard X-rays embedded within the nuclear starburst region .	The source has an unabsorbed , 2 to 10 keV luminosity of & gt ; =10^39 erg/s and photoionizes the surrounding gas .	We observe this source through a dusty torus with a neutral absorbing column density of NH ~ 2x10^23 cm^-2 .	We suggest that the ionizing source is an intermediate-mass black hole or a weakly accreting supermassive black hole , which may signal the beginnings or endings of AGN activity .
1	For that purpose a corrugated silver film was deposited on the top of a heterostructure consisting of GaAs/GaAlAs quantum wells .	We report on the strong coupling between inorganic quantum well excitons and surface plasmons .	The formation of plasmon/heavy-hole exciton/light-hole exciton mixed states is demonstrated with reflectometry experiments .	The interaction energies amount to 21 meV for the plasmon/light-hole exciton and 22 meV for the plasmon/heavy-hole exciton .	Some particularities of the plasmon-exciton coupling were also discussed and qualitatively related to the plasmon polarization .
4	We see evidence for a colour bi-modality for our sample of disk galaxies , with a `` red sequence '' that is both bulge and bar-dominated , and a `` blue cloud '' which has little , or no , evidence for a ( classical ) bulge or bar .	We present first results from Galaxy Zoo 2 , the second phase of the highly successful Galaxy Zoo project ( www.galaxyzoo.org ) .	Using a volume-limited sample of 13665 disk galaxies ( 0.01 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.06 and M_r & lt ; -19.38 ) , we study the fraction of galaxies with bars as a function of global galaxy properties like colour , luminosity and bulge prominence .	Overall , 29.4+/-0.5 % of galaxies in our sample have a bar , in excellent agreement with previous visually classified samples of galaxies ( although this overall fraction is lower than measured by automated bar-finding methods ) .	We see a clear increase in the bar fraction with redder ( g-r ) colours , decreased luminosity and in galaxies with more prominent bulges , to the extent that over half of the red , bulge-dominated , disk galaxies in our sample possess a bar .
4	Remarkably , this metric is shown to have attractive properties such as quasi-concavity with respect to the transmit power and a unique maximum , allowing to derive an optimal power control scheme .	In this work , we propose a new energy efficiency metric which allows one to optimize the performance of a wireless system through a novel power control mechanism .	The proposed metric possesses two important features .	First , it considers the whole power of the terminal and not just the radiated power .	Second , it can account for the limited buffer memory of transmitters which store arriving packets as a queue and transmit them with a success rate that is determined by the transmit power and channel conditions .
3	Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics , such as packet rate , others can be severely distorted .	The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router .	Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes .	The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis , and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics .	However , it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns .
2	Observations in the Swift era have revealed chromatic afterglow behaviors at least in some GRBs , casting doubts on the EFS origin of GRB afterglows .	The external forward shock ( EFS ) models have been the standard paradigm to interpret the broad-band afterglow data of gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) .	One prediction of the models is that some afterglow temporal breaks at different energy bands should be achromatic .	In this paper , we perform a systematic study to address the question : how bad/good are the external forward shock models ?	Our sample includes 85 GRBs well-monitored X-ray and optical lightcurves .
2	We set 90 % C.L .	From e+e- collision data acquired with the CLEO detector at CESR , we observe the non-D Dbar decay psi ( 3770 ) - & gt ; gamma chi_c1 with a statistical significance of 6.6 standard deviations , using the two-photon cascades to J/psi and J/psi- & gt ; l+l- .

2	Optical properties are evaluated either by solving the Bethe -- Salpeter equation or by using the adiabatic local density approximation .	{ \tt yambo } is an { \it ab initio } code for calculating quasiparticle energies and optical properties of electronic systems within the framework of many-body perturbation theory and time-dependent density functional theory .	Quasiparticle energies are calculated within the $ GW $ approximation for the self-energy .	{ \tt yambo } is a plane-wave code that , although particularly suited for calculations of periodic bulk systems , has been applied to a large variety of physical systems .	{ \tt yambo } relies on efficient numerical techniques devised to treat systems with reduced dimensionality , or with a large number of degrees of freedom .
0	We have theoretically studied how the azimuthal phase structure of an electron vortex beam excites surface plasmons on metal particles of different geometries as observed in electron energy loss spectroscopy .	To do so , we have developed a semi-classical approximation combining an azimuthal phase factor and the dielectric formalism .	Our results indicate that the vortex beam order may be used to modify and control surface plasmon multipole excitation in nanoparticles .	In favorable cases , specific plasmon modes can even attain enhancement factor of several orders of magnitude .	Since , electron vortex beams interact with particles mostly through interference effects due to azimuthal symmetries , i.e.in the plane perpendicular to the electron beam , anisotropy information ( longitudinal and transversal ) of the sample can be derived in EELS studies by comparing non-vortex and vortex beam measurements .
0	Metallic-Cavity lasers or plasmonic nanolasers of sub-wavelength sizes have attracted great attentions in recent years , with the ultimate goal of achieving continuous wave ( CW ) , room temperature ( RT ) operation under electrical injection .	Despite great efforts , a conclusive and convincing demonstration of this goal has proven challenging .	By overcoming several fabrication challenges imposed by the stringent requirement of such small scale devices , we were finally able to achieve this ultimate goal .	Our metallic nanolaser with a cavity volume of 0.67 { \lambda } 3 ( { \lambda } =1591 nm ) shows a linewidth of 0.5 nm at RT , which corresponds to a Q-value of 3182 compared to 235 of the cavity Q , the highest Q under lasing condition for RT CW operation of any sub-wavelength laser .	Such record performance provides convincing evidences of the feasibility of RT CW metallic nanolasers , thus opening a wide range of practical possibilities of novel nanophotonic devices based on metal-semiconductor structures .
3	We examine the nucleon structure and the thermodynamical properties of symmetric nuclear matter , particular attention is paid to the symmetry energy and to the eventual phase transition to deconfined quark matter .	Non-perturbative QCD vacuum effects at finite density are parametrized by means of a bag constant $ B $ .	It is extracted from a Nambu- Jona Lasinio model with two or three flavors .	The parameter $ B $ is used in an effective quark-meson coupling model to study the nuclear phenomenology .	An alternative sketch of the binding mechanism of symmetric nuclear matter emerges within this approach .
1	The accuracy of the method , however , relies strongly on the tracking precision .	The precise tracking of micron sized colloidal particles - held in the vicinity of each other using optical tweezers - is an elegant way to gain information about the particle-particle pair interaction potential .	Particularly the elimination of systematic errors in the position detection due to overlapping particle diffraction patterns remains a great challenge .	Here we propose a template based particle finding algorithm that circumvents these problems by tracking only a fraction of the particle image that is insignificantly affected by nearby colloids .	Under realistic experimental conditions we show that our algorithm significantly reduces systematic errors compared to standard tracking methods .
0	We introduce new clustering coefficients for weighted networks .	They are continuous and robust against edge weight changes .	Recently , generalized clustering coefficients for weighted and directed networks have been proposed .	These generalizations have a common property , that their values are not continuous .	They are sensitive with edge weight changes , especially at zero weight .
2	We also apply this result to the context of Bianchi 's identification , independent of unknown Planck scale physics , of the first order variation of Bekenstein Hawking area with that of vacuum entanglement entropy .	The entanglement entropy of a free quantum field in a coherent state is independent of its stress energy content .	We use this result to highlight the fact that while the Einstein equations for first order variations about a locally maximally symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields seem to follow from Jacobson 's principle of maximal vacuum entanglement entropy , their possible derivation from this principle for the physically relevant case of finite but small variations remains an open issue .	We argue that under certain technical assumptions this identification seems not to be extendible to the context of finite but small variations to coherent states .	Our particular method of estimation of entanglement entropy variation reveals the existence of certain contributions over and above those appearing in Jacobson 's and Bianchi 's works .
4	This result demonstrates both the effectiveness of the approach to obtain new algorithms that use as few assumptions as necessary , and its manageability since the amount of developed code remains human readable .	We present a unified formal framework for expressing mobile robots models , protocols , and proofs , and devise a protocol design/proof methodology dedicated to mobile robots that takes advantage of this formal framework .	As a case study , we present the first formally certified protocol for oblivious mobile robots evolving in a two-dimensional Euclidean space .	In more details , we provide a new algorithm for the problem of universal gathering mobile oblivious robots ( that is , starting from any initial configuration that is not bivalent , using any number of robots , the robots reach in a finite number of steps the same position , not known beforehand ) without relying on a common orientation nor chirality .	We give very strong guaranties on the correctness of our algorithm by proving formally that it is correct , using the COQ proof assistant .
4	In this paper , we investigate analytically the critical phenomena in the model , having both randomness and frustration and we report some analytical results for it .	We introduce a solvable quantum antiferromagnetic model .	The model , with Ising spins in a transverse field , has infinite range antiferromagnetic interactions with random fields on each site , following an arbitrary distribution .	As is well-known , frustration in the random field Ising model gives rise to a many-valley structure in the spin-configuration space .	In addition , the antiferromagnetism also induces a regular frustration even for the ground state .
2	For Radio Galaxies , feedback studies have mainly focused on jet/cavity systems in the most massive and X-ray luminous galaxy clusters .	One of the main debated astrophysical problems is the role of the AGN feedback in galaxy formation .	It is known that massive black holes have a profound effect on the formation and evolution of galaxies , but how black holes and galaxies communicate is still an unsolved problem .	The recent high-resolution detection of warm absorbers in some Broad Line Radio Galaxies allow us to investigate the interplay between the nuclear engine and the surrounding medium from a different perspective .	We report on the detection of warm absorbers in two Broad Line Radio Galaxies , 3C 382 and 3C 390.3 , and discuss the physical and energetic properties of the absorbing gas .
0	The Lorentz transformation is derived without assuming the existence of Maxwell 's equations , or that the speed of light is a constant , or even that light exists .	This leads us logically to sonsider the existence of a primal field called stuff which at every space-time point is traveling in every posssible direction with the speed of light .	All physical quantities are to be derived from operations on the stuff field .	To familiarize ourselves with the implications of the new paradigm equations are developed for a world of time and only one spatial dimension .	These non-linear equations lead to the existence of quantized particles , of light , and of gravity .
2	The work conducts a standard analysis of the network and then divides players according to different groups based on their activity .	This work analyzes friendship network from a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game ( MMORPG ) .	The network is based on data from a private server that was active from 2007 until 2011 .	Work checks how friendship network can be correlated to the clan ( a self-organized group of players who often form a league and play on the same side in a match ) network .	Main part of the work is the recommendation method for players that are not part of any clan and it is based on communities of friendship network .
4	Finally , we present a relation between the c-function and the ( matter induced ) beta function of Newton 's constant , allowing us to use heat kernel techniques to compute the RG running of the c-function .	After showing how to prove the integrated c-theorem within the functional RG framework based on the effective average action , we derive an exact RG flow equation for Zamolodchikov 's c-function in two dimensions by relating it to the flow of the effective average action .	In order to obtain a non-trivial flow for the c-function , we will need to understand the general form of the effective average action away from criticality , where nonlocal invariants , with beta functions as coefficients , must be included in the ansatz to be consistent .	We then apply our construction to several examples : exact results , local potential approximation and loop expansion .	In each case we construct the relative approximate c-function and find it to be consistent with Zamolodchikov 's c-theorem .
3	The induced noise is of the 1/f^2 type and will be interpreted in terms of two different models .	We present a set of experimental results concerning the power spectrum of current noise , detected on a granular high Tc superconductor submitted either to a slowly varying magnetic field or to a varying current intensity .	Experiments were performed on a YBCO specimen suitably treated in order to weaken the weak links without affecting the oxygen content of grains .	The weakening of the intergrain region allowed the use of very small magnetic fields and currents to induce the resistive transition of the specimen and to observe current noise .	One of the model is based on the enhancement of the noise due to the clustering of the resistive transition of the weak links , produced by correlation effects related to the strong nonlinearity of their Josephson type I-V characteristics .
2	In this paper , we consider a simple subdivision algorithm whose primitives are purely numerical ( e.g. , function evaluation ) .	Let f be a univariate polynomial with real coefficients , f in R [ X ] .	Subdivision algorithms based on algebraic techniques ( e.g. , Sturm or Descartes methods ) are widely used for isolating the real roots of f in a given interval .	The complexity of this algorithm is adaptive because the algorithm makes decisions based on local data .	The complexity analysis of adaptive algorithms ( and this algorithm in particular ) is a new challenge for computer science .
0	Cooperation among wireless nodes has been recently proposed for improving the physical layer ( PHY ) security of wireless transmission in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers .	While existing PHY security literature answered the question `` what are the link-level secrecy rate gains from cooperation ?	'' , this paper attempts to answer the question of `` how to achieve those gains in a practical decentralized wireless network and in the presence of a cost for information exchange ? '' .	For this purpose , we model the PHY security cooperation problem as a coalitional game with non-transferable utility and propose a distributed algorithm for coalition formation .	Through the proposed algorithm , the wireless users can cooperate and self-organize into disjoint independent coalitions , while maximizing their secrecy rate taking into account the security costs during information exchange .
3	In this paper , we use tools from Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory to show that sampling and search problems are essentially equivalent .	In a sampling problem , we are given an input x , and asked to sample approximately from a probability distribution D_x .	In a search problem , we are given an input x , and asked to find a member of a nonempty set A_x with high probability .	( An example is finding a Nash equilibrium . )	More precisely , for any sampling problem S , there exists a search problem R_S such that , if C is any `` reasonable '' complexity class , then R_S is in the search version of C if and only if S is in the sampling version .
3	Using new 3D , time-dependent modeling software , we derive the properties of the F-star ( diameter , limb darkening ) , determine previously unknown orbital elements ( $ \Omega $ , $ i $ ) , and access the global structures of the optically thick portion of the eclipsing disk using both geometric models and approximations of astrophysically relevant density distributions .	We report on a total of 106 nights of optical interferometric observations of the $ \epsilon $ Aurigae system taken during the last 14 years by four beam combiners at three different interferometric facilities .	This long sequence of data provides an ideal assessment of the system prior to , during , and after the recent 2009-2011 eclipse .	We have reconstructed model-independent images from the 10 in-eclipse epochs which show that a disk-like object is indeed responsible for the eclipse .	These models may be useful in future hydrodynamical modeling of the system .
2	The derivation of these bounds combines elements of information theory with the Chen-Stein method for Poisson approximation .	This paper considers the entropy of the sum of ( possibly dependent and non-identically distributed ) Bernoulli random variables .	Upper bounds on the error that follows from an approximation of this entropy by the entropy of a Poisson random variable with the same mean are derived .	The resulting bounds are easy to compute , and their applicability is exemplified .	This conference paper presents in part the first half of the paper entitled `` An information-theoretic perspective of the Poisson approximation via the Chen-Stein method '' ( see : arxiv:1206.6811 ) .
4	The embedding allows to recover the formal apparatus of QM within the ESR model , and the reinterpretation of QM allows to construct a noncontextual hidden variables theory which justifies the assumptions introduced in the ESR model and proves its objectivity .	Most scholars concerned with the foundations of quantum mechanics ( QM ) think that contextuality and nonlocality ( hence nonobjectivity of physical properties ) are unavoidable features of QM which follow from the mathematical apparatus of QM .	Moreover these features are usually considered as basic in quantum information processing .	Nevertheless they raise still unsolved problems , as the objectification problem in the quantum theory of measurement .	The extended semantic realism ( ESR ) model offers a possible way out from these difficulties by embedding the mathematical formalism of QM into a broader mathematical formalism and reinterpreting quantum probabilities as conditional on detection rather than absolute .
0	We consider the early time regime of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang ( KPZ ) equation in $ 1+1 $ dimensions in curved ( or droplet ) geometry .	We show that for short time $ t $ , the probability distribution $ P ( H , t ) $ of the height $ H $ at a given point $ x $ takes the scaling form $ P ( H , t ) \sim \exp { \left ( -\Phi_ { \rm drop } ( H ) /\sqrt { t } \right ) } $ where the rate function $ \Phi_ { \rm drop } ( H ) $ is computed exactly .	While it is Gaussian in the center , i.e. , for small $ H $ , the PDF has highly asymmetric non-Gaussian tails which we characterize in detail .	This function $ \Phi_ { \rm drop } ( H ) $ is surprisingly reminiscent of the large deviation function describing the stationary fluctuations of finite size models belonging to the KPZ universality class .	Thanks to a recently discovered connection between KPZ and free fermions , our results have interesting implications for the fluctuations of the rightmost fermion in a harmonic trap at high temperature and the full couting statistics at the edge .
3	If , for example , their frequencies can be identified with the Keplerian frequencies of matter in orbit around a 1.4 Solar-mass neutron star , then the radius of the star would have to be less than 15 km , which directly constrains the equation of state of bulk nuclear-density matter , and for an only slightly tighter orbit or slightly more massive neutron star the orbital radius would equal the Schwarzschild-geometry general-relativistic marginally stable orbit ( 12.5 km for a 1.4 Solar mass object ) .	In early 1996 a series of discoveries begun with NASA 's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer of a new , up to then unknown astrophysical phenomenon .	It turned out that accreting low magnetic-field neutron stars show quasi-periodic oscillations in their X-ray flux at rates of up to more than a kilohertz .	These kHz QPO , now reported from eleven different systems , are among the fastest phenomena in the sky and can provide us with new information about the fundamental properties of neutron stars and help testing general relativity in the strong-field regime .	So far all models that have been put forward for explaining the new phenomenon have encountered problems .
4	In equilibrium , agents choose to declare beliefs on future random outcomes different from their actual probability assessments , and the risk-sharing securities are endogenously bounded , implying ( amongst other things ) loss of efficiency .	The large majority of risk-sharing transactions involve few agents , each of whom can heavily influence the structure and the prices of securities .	This paper proposes a game where agents ' strategic sets consist of all possible sharing securities and pricing kernels that are consistent with Arrow-Debreu sharing rules .	First , it is shown that agents ' best response problems have unique solutions , even when the underlying probability space is infinite .	The risk-sharing Nash equilibrium admits a finite-dimensional characterisation and it is proved to exist for general number of agents and be unique in the two-agent game .
4	Taking into account the results of all the methods , we propose optimum values for the position and inclination angles of all the galaxies in our sample .	We have compiled a new sample of galaxies with published catalogs of HII region coordinates .	This sample , together with the former catalog of Garcia-Gomez and Athanassoula ( 1991 ) will form the basis for subsequent studies of the spiral structure in disc galaxies .	In this paper we address the problem of the deprojection of the galaxy images .	For this purpose we use two deprojection methods based on the HII region distribution and compare the results with the values found in the literature using other deprojection methods .
1	I show here how to compute one-loop corrections to these relations for any four-dimensional model based on a classical vacuum of the heterotic string .	Like grand unification of old , string unification predicts simple tree-level relations between the couplings of all unbroken gauge groups such as $ SU ( 3 ) _C $ or $ SU ( 2 ) _W\ ) $ .	The result can be used to calculate both $ \sin^2\theta_W $ and $ \Lambda_ { \rm QCD } $ in terms of $ \alpha_ { \rm QED } $ and $ \mpl\ ) $ .	The original version of this paper was written in 1987 and published in Nuclear Physics in 1988 .	That version had a few factor-of-two errors , which lead some people into confusion .
3	We use the momentum-dependent Paris potential and its local on-shell equivalent as obtained with the Gelfand-Levitan and Marchenko inversion formalism for the two nucleon Schroedinger equation .	The sensitivity of nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering to the off-shell behavior of realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions is investigated when on-shell equivalent nucleon-nucleon potentials are used .	The study is based on applications of the full-folding optical model potential for an explicit treatment of the off-shell behavior of the nucleon-nucleon effective interaction .	Applications were made at beam energies between 40 and 500 MeV for proton scattering from 40Ca and 208Pb .	Full-folding calculations for nucleon-nucleus scattering show small fluctuations in the corresponding observables .
1	B 48 ( 1986 ) 133 -- 169 ] local influence approach based on normal curvature is an important diagnostic tool for assessing local influence of minor perturbations to a statistical model .	Cook 's [ J. Roy.Statist.Soc.Ser .	However , no rigorous approach has been developed to address two fundamental issues : the selection of an appropriate perturbation and the development of influence measures for objective functions at a point with a nonzero first derivative .	The aim of this paper is to develop a differential -- geometrical framework of a perturbation model ( called the perturbation manifold ) and utilize associated metric tensor and affine curvatures to resolve these issues .	We will show that the metric tensor of the perturbation manifold provides important information about selecting an appropriate perturbation of a model .
2	The adversary , however , is incapable of changing the value of any meter data and can only block recorded measurements on certain lines from being transmitted to the control center .	A coordinated cyber-attack on grid meter readings and breaker statuses can lead to incorrect state estimation that can subsequently destabilize the grid .	This paper studies cyber-attacks by an adversary that changes breaker statuses on transmission lines to affect the estimation of the grid topology .	The proposed framework , with limited resource requirements as compared to standard data attacks , thus extends the scope of cyber-attacks to grids secure from meter corruption .	We discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for feasible attacks using a novel graph-coloring based analysis and show that an optimal attack requires breaker status change at only ONE transmission line .
1	400 ks observations of WR 6 by the XMM-Newton-telescope resulted in a superb quality high-resolution X-ray spectrum .	We present the first high-resolution X-ray spectrum of a putatively single Wolf-Rayet star .	Spectral analysis reveals that the X-rays originate far out in the stellar wind , more than 30 stellar radii from the photosphere , and thus outside the wind acceleration zone where the line-driving instability could create shocks .	The X-ray emitting plasma reaches temperatures up to 50\ , MK , and is embedded within the un-shocked , `` cool '' stellar wind as revealed by characteristic spectral signatures .	We detect a fluorescent Fe line at approx 6.4 keV .
1	An instance of such a problem consists of a set of variables V and a set of constraints C , where each constraint is an ordered triple of distinct elements from V. The goal is to construct a linear order alpha on V such that , for each constraint ( a , b , c ) in C , the ordering of a , b , c induced by alpha is in Pi .	A ternary permutation constraint satisfaction problem ( CSP ) is specified by a subset Pi of the symmetric group S_3 .	Excluding symmetries and trivial cases there are 11 such problems , and their complexity is well known .	Here we consider the variant of the problem , denoted 2-Pi , where we are allowed to construct two linear orders alpha and beta and each constraint needs to be satisfied by at least one of the two .	We give a full complexity classification of all 11 2-Pi problems , observing that in the switch from one to two linear orders the complexity landscape changes quite abruptly and that hardness proofs become rather intricate .
3	Mutual planetary interactions during migration led one of the Neptunes to be ejected in less than 10 Myr of evolution , causing Jupiter to jump by about 0.3 au in semi-major axis .	In this work , we investigate the evolution of a primordial belt of asteroids , represented by a large number of massless test particles , under the gravitational effect of migrating Jovian planets in the framework of the jumping-Jupiter model .	We perform several simulations considering test particles distributed in the Main Belt , as well as in the Hilda and Trojan groups .	The simulations start with Jupiter and Saturn locked in the mutual 3:2 mean motion resonance plus 3 Neptune-mass planets in a compact orbital configuration .	This introduces a large scale instability in the studied populations of small bodies .
4	In contrast , the best existing method requires $ O ( nnz ( M ) + \frac { nr^2 } { \epsilon^4 } ) $ time to compute an approximation in Frobenius norm .	In this work , we propose a new randomized algorithm for computing a low-rank approximation to a given matrix .	Taking an approach different from existing literature , our method first involves a specific biased sampling , with an element being chosen based on the leverage scores of its row and column , and then involves weighted alternating minimization over the factored form of the intended low-rank matrix , to minimize error only on these samples .	Our method can leverage input sparsity , yet produce approximations in { \em spectral } ( as opposed to the weaker Frobenius ) norm ; this combines the best aspects of otherwise disparate current results , but with a dependence on the condition number $ \kappa = \sigma_1/\sigma_r $ .	In particular we require $ O ( nnz ( M ) + \frac { n\kappa^2 r^5 } { \epsilon^2 } ) $ computations to generate a rank- $ r $ approximation to $ M $ in spectral norm .
2	We found that experimental points are lying approximately on the negative binomial distribution ( NBD ) curve , indicating a scaling behavior .	The article focuses on study of clan model parameters and their target dependence in light of void probability scaling for heavy ( Ag and Br ) and light ( C , N and O ) groups of targets present in nuclear emulsion detector using 84 Kr 36 at around 1 A GeV .	The variation of scaled rapidity gap ( rap gap ) probability with single moment combination has been studied .	The average clan multiplicities for interactions , increases with the pseudo-rapidity interval was also observed .	The values of average multiplicity for AgBr targets are larger than those for CNO target and also average number of particles per clan increases with increase in pseudo-rapidity interval .
4	It is proposed that these terms can be incorporated using an optimized local effective potential .	A novel treatment of non-adiabatic couplings is proposed .	The derivation starts from the long-known , but not well-known , fact that the wave function of the complete system of elctrons and nuclei can be written , without approximation , as a Born-Oppenheimer-type product of a nuclear wavefunction , X ( R ) , and an electronic one , Phi_R ( r ) , which depends parametrically on the nuclear configuration R. From the variational principle we deduce formally exact equations for Phi_R ( r ) and X ( R ) .	The algebraic structure of the exact nuclear equation coincides with the corresponding one in the adiabatic approximation .	The electronic equation , however , contains terms not appearing in the adiabatic case , which couple the electronic and the nuclear wavefunctions and account for the electron-nuclear correlation beyond the Born-Oppenheimer level .
2	Since we show that the polymeric effects only change the number of microstates of a statistical system , working in this coordinate is quite reasonable from the statistical point of view .	In this paper , we formulate statistical mechanics of the polymerized systems in the semiclassical regime .	On the corresponding polymeric symplectic manifold , we set up a noncanonical coordinate system in which all of the polymeric effects are summarized in the density of states .	The results show that the number of microstates decreases due to existence of an upper bound for the momentum of the test particles in the polymer framework .	We obtain a corresponding canonical partition function by means of the deformed density of states .
3	Estimates for the vector mesons are close to the empirical values .	Taking the effective interaction between a quark and an anti-quark from previous work , the dependendence on a regularization scale is removed in line with the renormalization group .	In order to emphasize the essential point , the full spinor interaction is replaced by a model which includes only the Coulomb and the hyperfine interaction .	By adjusting the effective quark masses , the only free parameters of the theory , the mass and the size of the pion are reproduced , as well as the mass of all other pseudo-scalar mesons .	The model exposes screening rather than strict confinement .
3	The valence-mechanism contribution to the mentioned intensity is also evaluated .	A temperature version of the shell-optical-model approach for describing the low-energy compound-to-compound transitions induced by external single-particle fields is given .	The approach is applied to evaluate the mean intensity of the P-odd mixing of nuclear compound states .	Unified description for the mixing and electromagnetic transitions allows one to evaluate the mean intensity without the use of free parameters .	Calculation results are compared with the data deduced from cross sections of relevant neutron-induced reactions .
0	It has been shown that the orbits of motion for a wide class of nonrelativistic Hamiltonian systems can be described as geodesic flows on a manifold and an associated dual .	This method can be applied to a four dimensional manifold of orbits in spacetime associated with a relativistic system .	We show that a relativistic Hamiltonian which generates Einstein geodesics , with the addition of a world scalar field , can be put into correspondence with another Hamiltonian with conformally modified metric .	Such a construction could account for part of the requirements of Bekenstein for achieving the MOND theory of Milgrom in the post-Newtonian limit .	The constraints on the MOND theory imposed by the galactic rotation curves , through this correspondence , would then imply constraints on the structure of the world scalar field .
0	We couple a laser-based , space-resolved dynamic light scattering apparatus to a universal testing machine for mechanical extensional tests .	We perform simultaneous optical and mechanical measurements on polyether ether ketone , a semi-crystalline polymer widely used in the industry .	Due to the high turbidity of the sample , light is multiply scattered by the sample and the diffusing wave spectroscopy ( DWS ) formalism is used to interpret the data .	Space-resolved DWS yields spatial maps of the sample strain and of the microscopic dynamics .	An excellent agreement is found between the strain maps thus obtained and those measured by a conventional stereo-correlation bench .
2	Remarkably , in the normal form , our result has the special feature of being a sufficient optimality condition for linearconvex problems , a feature that the classical Pontryagin maximum principle had whereas the nonsmooth version had not .	We derive a variant of the nonsmooth maximum principle for problems with pure state constraints .	The interest of our result resides on the nonsmoothness itself since , when applied to smooth problems , it coincides with known results .	This work is distinct to previous work in the literature since , for state constrained problems , we add the Weierstrass conditions to adjoint inclusions using the joint subdifferentials with respect to the state and the control .	Our proofs use old techniques developed in [ 16 ] , while appealing to new results in [ 7 ] .
3	The energy sensitivity is demonstrated through the 5.9 keV gamma spectrum of 55Fe , where the energy resolution is sufficient to identify the escape peak .	Understanding the ability to measure and discriminate particle events at the lowest possible energy is an essential requirement in developing new experiments to search for weakly interacting massive particle ( WIMP ) dark matter .	In this paper we detail an assessment of the potential sensitivity below 10 keV in the 1 m^3 DRIFT-II directionally sensitive , low pressure , negative ion time projection chamber ( NITPC ) , based on event-by-event track reconstruction and calorimetry in the multiwire proportional chamber ( MWPC ) readout .	By application of a digital smoothing polynomial it is shown that the detector is sensitive to sulfur and carbon recoils down to 2.9 and 1.9 keV respectively , and 1.2 keV for electron induced events .	The effect a lower energy sensitivity on the WIMP exclusion limit is demonstrated .
2	Unfortunately , it turns out that after the necessary corrections we have done no more than give an easier proof of Gleason 's theorem under stronger assumptions .	We analyse an argument of Deutsch , which purports to show that the deterministic part of classical quantum theory together with deterministic axioms of classical decision theory , together imply that a rational decision maker behaves as if the probabilistic part of quantum theory ( Born 's law ) is true .	We uncover two missing assumptions in the argument , and show that the argument also works for an instrumentalist who is prepared to accept that the outcome of a quantum measurement is random in the frequentist sense : Born 's law is a consequence of functional and unitary invariance principles belonging to the deterministic part of quantum mechanics .	However , for some special cases the proof method gives positive results while using different assumptions to Gleason .	This leads to the conjecture that the proof could be improved to give the same conclusion as Gleason under unitary invariance together with a much weaker functional invariance condition .
4	The present work suggests the prospect of describing giant resonance properties realistically and consistently within extended RPA theories .	We examine the response of closed-shell nuclei using a correlated interaction , derived with the Unitary Correlation Operator Method ( UCOM ) from the Argonne V18 potential , in second RPA ( SRPA ) calculations .	The same correlated two-body interaction is used to derive the Hartree-Fock ground state and the SRPA equations .	Our results show that the coupling of particle-hole states to higher-order configurations produces sizable effects compared with first-order RPA .	A much improved description of the isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole resonances is obtained , thanks in part to the more fundamental treatment of the nucleon effective mass offered by SRPA .
2	The key insight in Canary is to reverse the responsibilities between controllers and workers .	We present Canary , a scheduling architecture that allows high performance analytics workloads to scale out to run on thousands of cores .	Canary is motivated by the observation that a central scheduler is a bottleneck for high performance codes : a handful of multicore workers can execute tasks faster than a controller can schedule them .	Rather than dispatch tasks to workers , which then fetch data as necessary , in Canary the controller assigns data partitions to workers , which then spawn and schedule tasks locally .	We evaluate three benchmark applications in Canary on up to 64 servers and 1,152 cores on Amazon EC2 .
3	The gas temperature in this region is approximately 540K , and the HI abundance in the interclump gas in the PDR is 5-10 % of the available hydrogen nuclei .	We present HI 21cm observations of the Orion Nebula , obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array , at an angular resolution of 7.2 '' x5.7 '' and a velocity resolution of 0.77 km/s .	Our data reveal HI absorption towards the radio continuum of the HII region , and HI emission arising from the Orion Bar photon-dominated region ( PDR ) and from the Orion-KL outflow .	In the Orion Bar PDR , the HI signal peaks in the same layer as the H2 near-infrared vibrational line emission , in agreement with models of the photodissociation of H2 .	Most of the gas in this region therefore remains molecular .
4	Equatorially attached convection is considered which evolves from inertial mode convection .	The chapter begins with a description of the annulus model of rotationg convection .	The basic equations for the spherical problem are then introduced and the onset of columnar convection in spherical shells is discussed .	The onset of inertial mode convection is described which prevails at very low Prandtl numbers .	The properties of finite amplitude convection are outlined for a wide range of Prandtl numbers .
1	We use the new method presented in a previous paper [ J. Stat.Phys .	Combining analytical and numerical methods , we study within the framework of the homogeneous non-linear Boltzmann equation , a broad class of models relevant for the dynamics of dissipative fluids , including granular gases .	124 , 549 ( 2006 ) ] and extend our results to a different heating mechanism , namely a deterministic non-linear friction force .	We derive analytically the high energy tail of the velocity distribution and compare the theoretical predictions with high precision numerical simulations .	Stretched exponential forms are obtained when the non-equilibrium steady state is stable .
4	These are the volume growth parameters , boundary regularity type properties and non-empty interior type constraints .	The Abelian Sandpile Model is a discrete diffusion process defined on graphs ( Dhar \cite { DD90 } , Dhar et al .	\cite { DD95 } ) which serves as the standard model of self-organized criticality .	The transience class of a sandpile is defined as the maximum number of particles that can be added without making the system recurrent ( \cite { BT05 } ) .	We demonstrate a class of sandpile which have polynomially bound transience classes by identifying key graph properties that play a role in the rapid diffusion process .
0	An analysis of the Dicke model , N two-level atoms interacting with a single radiation mode , is done using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation .	The main aim of the paper is to show that , changing the quantization axis with respect to the common usage , it is possible to prove a general result either for N or the coupling constant going to infinity for the exact solution of the model .	This completes the analysis , known in the current literature , with respect to the same model in the limit of N and volume going to infinity , keeping the density constant .	For the latter the proper axis of quantization is given by the Hamiltonian of the two-level atoms and for the former the proper axis of quantization is defined by the interaction .	The relevance of this result relies on the observation that a general measurement apparatus acts using electromagnetic interaction and so , one can states that the thermodynamic limit is enough to grant the appearance of classical effects .
2	The new version avoids the use of empirical mixing parameters , and is expected to be more robust than the original version .	Pulay 's Residual Metric Minimization ( RMM ) method is one of the standard techniques for achieving self consistency in ab initio electronic structure calculations .	We describe a reformulation of Pulay 's RMM which guarantees reduction of the residual at each step .	We present practical tests of the new method implemented in a standard code based on density-functional theory ( DFT ) , pseudopotentials , and plane-wave basis sets .	The tests show improved speed in achieving self consistency for a variety of condensed-matter systems .
3	A soft excess is detected in all three Type 1 sources .	XMM-Newton spectra of five red , 2MASS AGN , selected from a sample observed by Chandra to be relatively X-ray bright and to cover a range of hardness ratios , confirm the presence of substantial absorbing material in three sources with optical classifications ranging from Type 1 to Type 2 .	A flat ( hard ) , power law continuum is observed in the other two .	The combination of X-ray absorption and broad optical emission lines suggests either a small ( nuclear ) absorber or a favored viewing angle so as to cover the X-ray source but not the broad emission line region ( BELR ) .	We speculate that this may arise in an extended region of ionised gas , perhaps linked with the polarised ( scattered ) optical light present in these sources .
0	We analyze the spectrum of the electric-current autocorrelation function ( noise power ) in the Anderson impurity model biased by a finite transport voltage .	Special emphasis is placed on the interplay of non-equilibrium effects and electron-electron interactions .	Analytic results are presented for a perturbation expansion in the interaction strength $ U $ .	Compared to the non-interacting setup we find a suppression of noise for finite frequencies in equilibrium and an amplification in non-equilibrium .	Furthermore , we use a diagrammatic resummation scheme to obtain non-perturbative results in the regime of intermediate $ U $ .
0	Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) images are used to identify and study star cluster candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy M101 .	About 3000 round , slightly-resolved cluster candidates are identified in 10 ACS pointings covering an area of 106 arcmin^2 .	The cluster candidates ' color and size distributions are consistent with those of star clusters in other nearby spirals .	The majority of the M101 candidates are blue and more likely to be associated with the galaxy 's spiral arms , implying that they are young .	The galaxy-luminosity-normalized number of `young massive clusters ' in M101 is similar to that found in other spirals , as is the cluster density at a fiducial absolute magnitude .
0	In this paper we study the thermalization of a spatially homogeneous system in a strongly coupled CFT .	The non-equilibrium initial state is created by switching on a relevant perturbation in the CFT vacuum during Delta t & gt ; = t & gt ; = -Delta t. Via AdS/CFT , the thermalization process corresponds to the gravitational collapse of a tachyonic scalar field ( m^2 = -3 ) in the Poincare patch of AdS_5 .	In the limit Delta t & lt ; 0.02/T , the thermalization time t_T is found to be quantitatively the same as that of a non-equilibrium state created by a marginal perturbation discussed in Ref . [ 5 ] .	In the case Delta t & gt ; = 1/T , we also obtain double-collapse solutions but with a non-equilibrium intermediate state at t = 0 .	In all the cases our results show that the system thermalizes in a typical time t_T ~ O ( 1 ) /T .
0	Thick , high quality 4H-SiC epilayers have been grown in a vertical hot-wall chemical vapor deposition system at a high growth rate on ( 0001 ) 80 off-axis substrates .	We discuss the use of dichlorosilane as the Si-precursor for 4H-SiC epitaxial growth as it provides the most direct decomposition route into SiCl2 , which is the predominant growth species in chlorinated chemistries .	A specular surface morphology was attained by limiting the hydrogen etch rate until the system was equilibrated at the desired growth temperature .	The RMS roughness of the grown films ranged from 0.5-2.0 nm with very few morphological defects ( carrots , triangular defects , etc . )	being introduced , while enabling growth rates of 30-100 \mum/hr , 5-15 times higher than most conventional growths .
3	We compare fits made to the non-thermal component using two models , a simple power law and SRCUT .	( Abridged ) We are conducting a survey of Galactic shell-type supernova remnants ( SNRs ) known or suspected to possess non-thermal components to their X-ray emission using new and archived observations made with such X-ray satellites as ROSAT , ASCA , RXTE , Chandra and XMM-Newton .	This research is intended to probe the phenomenon of cosmic-ray acceleration by Galactic SNRs and estimate the maximum energy of cosmic-ray electrons accelerated by these sources .	To illustrate this work , we examine the X-ray spectrum of the northwestern rim of an SNR suspected to have a non-thermal component to its X-ray emission , G156.2+5.7 ( RX J04591+5147 ) , over the energy range of approximately 0.7-12.0 keV using observations made by the ASCA GIS and the RXTE PCA .	Both models give acceptable fits : the photon index derived from the fit made with the power law model , 2.0 ( +0.2 , -0.5 ) , is comparable to values obtained for the bright rims of other SNRs with hard X-ray spectra .
3	The event shape distributions are compared with perturbative QCD predictions , which include resummed contributions and analytical power law corrections , the latter accounting for non-perturbative hadronisation effects .	Deep-inelastic ep scattering data taken with the H1 detector at HERA and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 106 pb^ { -1 } are used to study the differential distributions of event shape variables .	These include thrust , jet broadening , jet mass and the C-parameter .	The four-momentum transfer Q is taken to be the relevant energy scale and ranges between 14 GeV and 200 GeV .	The data clearly exhibit the running of the strong coupling alpha_s ( Q ) and are consistent with a universal power correction parameter alpha_0 for all event shape variables .
3	Melting spreads with a front that propagates at the transverse sound speed .	The spatiotemporal development of melting is studied experimentally in a 2D dusty plasma suspension .	Starting with an ordered lattice , and then suddenly applying localized shear , a pair of counter-propagating flow regions develop .	A transition between two melting stages is observed before a steady state is reached .	Unexpectedly , coherent longitudinal waves are excited in the flow region .
0	We discuss the rationale and the present status of a large redshift survey aiming at measuring distances for all the clusters of galaxies detected by the ROSAT X -- ray All -- Sky Survey in the southern hemisphere , with flux larger than $ \sim 2\times 10^ { -12 } $ erg s $ ^ { -1 } $ cm $ ^ { -2 } $ .	The survey is being performed using three ESO telescopes in parallel .	The final sample will contain about 700 clusters .	It will represent a unique database for the study of the spatial distribution of clusters , their X -- ray luminosity function and their intrinsic physical properties .	Serendipitous results obtained so far include two new gravitational arc systems in two clusters of galaxies .
2	These general congestion effects are particularly relevant in graphs in which the cost to move from one node to another may for instance depend on the proportion of players in both the source node and the target node .	This paper presents a general existence and uniqueness result for mean field games equations on graphs ( $ \mathcal { G } $ -MFG ) .	In particular , our setting allows to take into account congestion effects of almost any form .	Existence is proved using a priori estimates and a fixed point argument \`a la Schauder .	We propose a new criterion to ensure uniqueness in the case of Hamiltonian functions with a complex ( non-local ) structure .
2	As a follow up , here we used the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate the existence of one of these candidate planets , UCF-1.01 , by searching for two transit signals as it passed in front of its host star .	The detection of small planets orbiting nearby stars is an important step towards the identification of Earth twins .	In previous work using the Spitzer Space Telescope , we found evidence to support at least one sub-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting the nearby mid-M dwarf star GJ 436 .	Interpretation of the data hinges critically on correctly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light curves .	Building on previous HST work , we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need to explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent systematic .
1	In a study of the HI velocity profiles we identify a cool and warm neutral component in the Interstellar Medium of NGC 6822 .	We investigate the star formation threshold in NGC 6822 , a nearby Local Group dwarf galaxy , on sub-kpc scales using high-resolution , wide-field , deep HI , Halpha and optical data .	We show that the velocity dispersion of the cool component ( ~4 km/s ) when used with a Toomre-Q criterion gives an optimal description of ongoing star formation in NGC 6822 , superior to that using the more conventional dispersion value of 6 km/s .	However , a simple constant surface density criterion for star formation gives an equally superior description .	We also investigate the two-dimensional distribution of Q and the star formation threshold and find that these results also hold locally .
0	In this paper , we study the problem of computing by relaxation hierarchies the infimum of a real polynomial function f on a closed basic semialgebraic set and the points where this infimum is reached , if they exist .	We show that when the infimum is reached , a relaxation hierarchy constructed from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker ideal is always exact and that the vanishing ideal of the KKT minimizer points is generated by the kernel of the associated moment matrix in that degree , even if this ideal is not zero-dimensional .	We also show that this relaxation allows to detect when there is no KKT minimizer .	We prove that the exactness of the relaxation depends only on the real points which satisfy these constraints.This exploits representations of positive polynomials as elementsof the preordering modulo the KKT ideal , which only involves polynomials in the initial set of variables .	Applications to global optimization , optimization on semialgebraic sets defined by regular sets of constraints , optimization on finite semialgebraic sets , real radical computation are given .
2	The Kondo minimum shifts from 22.5 K at ambient pressure to 19.2 K at a pressure of 10 Kbar .	We report the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the resistivity of the heavy fermion Kondo lattice compound Yb $ _2 $ Fe $ _3 $ Si $ _5 $ in the temperature range 2-300 K and in pressures upto 10 Kbar .	At ambient pressure the resistivity shows a prominent Kondo effect .	The depth of the Kondo minimum also progressively decreases with pressure .	These results suggest a possible weakening of the Kondo effect with the application of pressure .
3	For the special case of spin-independent hopping we analytically determine the number of solutions of the resulting self-consistency equations and the nature of the possible ground states at weak coupling .	In order to describe unbalanced ultracold fermionic quantum gases on optical lattices in a harmonic trap , we investigate an attractive ( $ U & lt ; 0 $ ) asymmetric ( $ t_\uparrow\neq t_\downarrow $ ) Hubbard model with a Zeeman-like magnetic field .	In view of the model 's spatial inhomogeneity , we focus in this paper on the solution at Hartree-Fock level .	The Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is diagonalized with particular emphasis on superfluid phases .	Numerical results for unbalanced Fermi-mixtures are presented within the local density approximation .
3	We achieve this with a holographic approach that allows over 100 modes to be encoded on a single hologram , across a wide wavelength range , in a wavelength independent manner .	Mode division multiplexing ( MDM ) is mooted as a technology to address future bandwidth issues , and has been successfully demonstrated in free space using spatial modes with orbital angular momentum ( OAM ) .	To further increase the data transmission rate , more degrees of freedom are required to form a densely packed mode space .	Here we move beyond OAM and demonstrate multiplexing and demultiplexing using both the radial and azimuthal degrees of freedom .	Our results offer a new tool that will prove useful in realising higher bit rates for next generation optical networks .
1	We fully characterize behavior of the minimax risk for different relationships between regularity parameters and norm indexes in definitions of the functional class and of the risk .	We address the problem of adaptive minimax density estimation on $ \bR^d $ with $ \bL_p $ -- loss on the anisotropic Nikol'skii classes .	In particular , we show that there are four different regimes with respect to the behavior of the minimax risk .	We develop a single estimator which is ( nearly ) optimal in orderover the complete scale of the anisotropic Nikol'skii classes .	Our estimation procedure is based on a data-driven selection of an estimator from a fixed family of kernel estimators .
1	This calculation generalizes the analysis of the shutter problem and sets the basis for the calculation of the transmission of general wave packets , aiming to work out the explicit contribution of the resonant ( Gamow ) states .	We analytically compute the time evolution of an initial infinite plane wave in the presence of a 1-dimensional square quantum barrier .	The method relies mainly on the analytical properties of the Green function .	The role of separate boundary conditions on the Green function and on the evolution equation is highlighted .	As in previous works on related problems , only the determination of the resonant momenta requires numerical methods .
4	Furthermore , we have determined abundances of light metals , which had been poorly known before .	High-resolution UV spectra , obtained with HST and FUSE , enable us to analyse hot hydrogen-rich central stars in detail .	Up to now , optical hydrogen and helium lines have been used to derive temperature and surface gravity .	Those lines , however , are rather insensitive ; in particular , neutral helium lines have completely vanished in the hottest central stars .	Therefore , we have concentrated on ionization balances of metals , which have a rich line spectrum in the UV , to establish a new temperature scale for our sample .
4	Here general relativity and the technical language of general covariance is seen not to be fundamental but a phenomenological construct , arising as an amalgam of two distinct phenomena : the `gravitational ' characteristics of the emergent quantum foam for which `matter ' acts as a sink , and the classical `spacetime ' measurement protocol , but with the later violated by quantum measurement processes .	Progress in the new information-theoretic process physics is reported in which the link to the phenomenology of general relativity is made .	In process physics the fundamental assumption is that reality is to be modelled as self-organising semantic ( or internal or relational ) information using a self-referentially limited neural network model .	Previous progress in process physics included the demonstration that space and quantum physics are emergent and unified , with time a distinct non-geometric process , that quantum phenomena are caused by fractal topological defects embedded in and forming a growing three-dimensional fractal process-space , which is essentially a quantum foam .	Other features of the emergent physics were : quantum field theory with emergent flavour and confined colour , limited causality and the Born quantum measurement metarule , inertia , time-dilation effects , gravity and the equivalence principle , a growing universe with a cosmological constant , black holes and event horizons , and the emergence of classicality .
3	We interpret the Hirzebruch class of a crepant resolution specializing the orbifold elliptic genus constructed by Borisov and Libgober .	We study properties of the Hirzebruch class of quotient singularities $ C^n/G $ , where $ G $ is a finite matrix group .	The main aim of this paper is to show a relation between this invariant and the Molien series of $ G $ , which can be thought of as an incarnation of the McKay correspondence .	We also observe symmetries of the Hirzebruch class which can be proved using the interpretation in terms of Molien series .	The results are illustrated with several examples , in particular of 4-dimensional symplectic quotient singularities .
1	We introduce the notion of \emph { admissible rank } of a point $ P $ with respect to $ X $ to be the minimal cardinality of a set of points of $ X ( \CC ) $ such that $ P\in \langle S \rangle $ that is stable under conjugation .	Let $ X ( \RR ) $ be a geometrically connected variety defined over $ \RR $ and such that the set of all its ( also complex ) points $ X ( \CC ) $ is non-degenerate .	Any set evincing the admissible rank can be equipped with a \emph { label } keeping track of the number of its complex and real points .	We show that in the case of generic identifiability there is an open dense euclidean subset of points with certain admissible rank for any possible label .	Moreover we show that if $ X $ is a rational normal curve than there always exists a label for the generic element .
0	We present a reformulation of the canonical quantization of gravity , as referred to the minisuperspace ; the new approach is based on fixing a Gaussian ( or synchronous ) reference frame and then quantizing the system via the reconstruction of a suitable constraint ; then the quantum dynamics is re-stated in a generic coordinates system and it becomes dependent on the lapse function .	The analysis follows a parallelism with the case of the non-relativistic particle and leads to the minisuperspace implementation of the so-called { \em kinematical action } as proposed in \cite { M02 } ( here almost coinciding also with the approach presented in \cite { KT91 } ) .	The new constraint leads to a Schr\ '' odinger equation for the system.i.e.to non-vanishing eigenvalues for the super-Hamiltonian operator ; the physical interpretation of this feature relies on the appearance of a `` dust fluid '' ( non-positive definite ) energy density , i.e.a kind of `` materialization '' of the reference frame .	As an example of minisuperspace model , we consider a Bianchi type IX Universe , for which some dynamical implications of the revised canonical quantum gravity are discussed .	We also show how , on the classical limit , the presence of the dust fluid can have relevant cosmological issues .
2	However , this long-range interaction is not strong enough to suppress disorder fluctuations .	We derive an order-parameter field theory for a quantum phase transition between a disordered metal and an exotic ( non-s-wave ) superconductor .	Mode coupling effects between the order parameter and other fermionic soft modes lead to an effective long-range interaction between the anomalous density fluctuations which is reflected in singularities in the free energy functional .	The asymptotic critical region is characterized by run-away flow to large disorder .	For weak coupling , this asymptotic region is very narrow .
2	We are interested in two different micromagnet shapes : cylindrical ( micro-disk ) and rectangular geometry .	We investigate the possibility of trapping quasi-particles possessing spin degree of freedom in hybrid structures .	The hybrid system we are considering here is composed of a semi-magnetic quantum well placed a few nanometers below a ferromagnetic micromagnet .	We show that in the case of a micro-disk , the spin object is localized in all three directions and therefore zero-dimensional states are created , and in the case of an elongated rectangular micromagnet , the quasi-particles can move freely in one direction , hence one-dimensional states are formed .	After calculating profiles of the magnetic field produced by the micromagnets , we analyze in detail the possible light absorption spectrum for different micromagnet thicknesses , and different distances between the micromagnet and the semimagnetic quantum well .
2	( 2005a , b ) in which a correlation was found on large angular scales between the WMAP data and the anisotropy structure in a low density Bianchi universe .	We generalize the predictions for the CMB anisotropy patterns arising in Bianchi type VIIh universes to include a dark energy component .	We consider these models in light of the result of Jaffe et al .	We find that by including a term Omega_L & gt ; 0 , the same best-fit anisotropy pattern is reproduced by several combinations of cosmological parameters .	This sub-set of models can then be further constrained by current observations that limit the values of various cosmological parameters .
3	This provides a well-defined method to compute the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants .	In this paper we study the BPS state counting in the geometry of local obstructed curve with normal bundle O+O ( -2 ) .	We find that the BPS states have a framed quiver description .	Using this quiver description along with the Seiberg duality and the localization techniques , we can compute the BPS state indices in different chambers dictated by stability parameter assignments .	This method can be generalized to other affine ADE quiver theories .
0	We present a novel type of longitudinal Zeeman slower .	The magnetic field profile is generated by a 3D array of permanent spherical magnets , which are self-assembled into a stable structure .	The simplicity and stability of the design make it quick to assemble and inexpensive .	In addition , as with other permanent magnet slowers , no electrical current or water cooling is required .	We describe the theory , assembly , and testing of this new design .
0	For a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter we evaluate Wightman function , vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor induced by a $ Z_ { 2 } $ -symmetric brane with finite thickness located on $ ( D+1 ) $ -dimensional AdS bulk .	For the general case of static plane symmetric interior structure the expectation values in the region outside the brane are presented as the sum of free AdS and brane induced parts .	For a conformally coupled massless scalar the brane induced part in the vacuum energy-momentum tensor vanishes .	In the limit of strong gravitational fields the brane induced parts are exponentially suppressed for points not too close to the brane boundary .	As an application of general results a special model is considered in which the geometry inside the brane is a slice of the Minkowski spacetime orbifolded along the direction perpendicular to the brane .
1	The photon energies for allowed ( $ n ' = n $ ) M1 transitions are very small , so hindered ( $ n ' & lt ; n $ ) transitions could be more favorable for discovering the $ \eta_b ( 1S,2S ) $ .	The rates for magnetic dipole ( M1 ) transitions $ \Upsilon ( nS ) \to \eta_b ( n 'S ) + \gamma $ , $ n ' \le n $ , are compared .	The question then arises whether $ \Upsilon ( 2S ) $ or $ \Upsilon ( 3S ) $ is a better source of $ \eta_b ( 1S ) $ .	Whereas one nonrelativistic model favors $ \eta_b ( 1S ) $ production from $ \Upsilon ( 2S ) $ , this advantage is lost when relativistic corrections are taken into account , and is not common to all sets of wave functions even in the purely nonrelativistic limit .	Thus , the prospects for discovering $ \eta_b ( 1S ) $ in $ \Upsilon ( 3S ) $ radiative decays could be comparable to those in $ \Upsilon ( 2S ) $ decays .
4	Being able to locate a breathing person who is not otherwise moving , without calibration , is important for applications in search and rescue , health care , and security .	This paper explores using RSS measurements on many links in a wireless network to estimate the breathing rate of a person , and the location where the breathing is occurring , in a home , while the person is sitting , laying down , standing , or sleeping .	The main challenge in breathing rate estimation is that `` motion interference '' , i.e. , movements other than a person 's breathing , generally cause larger changes in RSS than inhalation and exhalation .	We develop a method to estimate breathing rate despite motion interference , and demonstrate its performance during multiple short ( 3-7 minute ) tests and during a longer 66 minute test .	Further , for the same experiments , we show the location of the breathing person can be estimated , to within about 2 m average error in a 56 square meter apartment .
3	The proposed channel estimation scheme does not need any priori channel information .	Channel estimation is one of the most important parts in current mobile communication systems .	Among the huge contributions in channel estimation studies , the discrete Fourier transform ( DFT ) -based channel estimation has attracted lots of interests since it can not only be easily implemented but also have acceptable performance in practical systems .	In this paper , we propose an improved DFT-based channel estimation scheme that tries to clean the reference signals in the time domain before being used for interpolation using the estimated noise variance from reference signals on multiple orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( OFDM ) symbols via the property of DFT .	We validate the proposed channel estimation scheme in various channel models via simulations and comparison with conventional channel estimation schemes .
2	This paper presents an e-prescription system that addresses some challenges pertaining to the prescription privacy protection in the process of drug prescription .	Over the years health care has seen major improvement due to the introduction information and communication technology with electronic medical prescription being one the areas benefiting from it .	Within the overall context of protection of health care information , privacy of prescription data needs special treatment .	The developed system uses spread spectrum image steganography algorithm with Advanced Encryption Standard ( AES ) key implementation to provide a secure means of delivering medical prescription to the parties involved .	The architecture for encoding and decoding was implemented with an electronic health record .
0	A possible mechanism of electronic phase separation in the systems with orbital ordering is analyzed .	We suggest a simple model taking into account an interplay between the delocalization of charge carriers introduced by doping and the cooperative ordering of local lattice distortions .	The proposed mechanism is quite similar to the double exchange usually invoked for interpretation of phase separation in doped magnetic oxides like manganites , but can be efficient even in the absence of any magnetic ordering .	It is demonstrated that the delocalized charge carriers favor the formation of nanoscale inhomogeneities with the orbital structure different from that in the undoped material .	The directional character of orbitals leads to inhomogeneities of different shapes and sizes .
4	The old stellar populations of M31 globular clusters and elliptical galaxies are more similar to each other than each is to the Galactic stellar population .	Observations in integrated light ( 2200-4800 A , 8 to 11 A resolution , S/N & gt ; 20 ) of 4 M31 globular clusters and of the cores of six gE galaxies made with the HST/FOS are presented and analyzed .	These data are supplemented by IUE observations of M32 , Galactic globulars and stars .	From these data we measure UV colors and absorption line strength ( ALS ) indices , including the key NH feature at 3360 A .	We find that our data divide the M31 globular clusters , Galactic globular clusters/Galactic stars , and gE galaxies into three different stellar populations .
2	The overall pattern of the copper ions is that of a three-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland network .	The Ba3Cu3In4O12 stands for unique topology of the magnetic subsystem .	It consists of rotated by 90\Box $ ^b $ relative to each other `` paper-chain '' columns made of vertex-sharing CuIO4 and CuIIO4 planar units .	At high temperatures , the magnetic susceptibility follows the Curie-Weiss law with positive Weiss temperature indicating strong predominance of ferromagnetic coupling .	At low temperatures , however , this compound reaches the antiferromagnetically ordered state and experiences non-trivial succession of two spin-flop and two spin-flip transitions reaching full saturation in modest magnetic fields .
4	In this paper , we provide a complete description and comparison of the secret bit rate for continuous-wave and pulsed laser EQKD systems .	Advances in quantum physics and computational complexity threaten the security of present day cryptographic systems and have driven the development of quantum key distribution ( QKD ) .	Entangled quantum key distribution ( EQKD ) is a secure protocol that is based on fundamental quantum mechanics and is not vulnerable to these threats .	The primary figure of merit for QKD systems is ability to generate secret bits .	However , to date , methods that have been developed to simulate the secret bit rate generation for EQKD systems have been limited by techniques that do not provide a complete description of the quantum state produced by the source .
3	The interference of an auxiliary continuous wave laser , which is sent through the same interferometers as the excitation pulses , is used to synthesize reference frequencies for lock-in detection of the photocurrent FWM signal .	Multidimensional Coherent Optical Photocurrent Spectroscopy ( MD-COPS ) is implemented using unstabilized interferometers .	Photocurrent from a semiconductor sample is generated using a sequence of four excitation pulses in a collinear geometry .	Each pulse is tagged with a unique radio frequency through acousto-optical modulation ; the Four-Wave Mixing ( FWM ) signal is then selected in the frequency domain .	This scheme enables the partial compensation of mechanical fluctuations in the setup , achieving sufficient phase stability without the need for active stabilization .
1	With the number of steps growing only as the cube of the number of variables , the adiabatic method gives solution probabilities close to 1 for problem sizes feasible to evaluate via simulation on current computers .	The discrete formulation of adiabatic quantum computing is compared with other search methods , classical and quantum , for random satisfiability ( SAT ) problems .	However , for these sizes the minimum energy gaps of most instances are fairly large , so the good performance scaling seen for small problems may not reflect asymptotic behavior where costs are dominated by tiny gaps .	Moreover , the resulting search costs are much higher than for other methods .	Variants of the quantum algorithm that do not match the adiabatic limit give lower costs , on average , and slower growth than the conventional GSAT heuristic method .
3	For environments in which the origin is connected to infinity by bonds with positive conductances , we study the decay of the $ 2n $ -step return probability $ P_\omega^ { 2n } ( 0,0 ) $ .	We consider the nearest-neighbor simple random walk on $ \Z^d $ , $ d\ge2 $ , driven by a field of bounded random conductances $ \omega_ { xy } \in [ 0,1 ] $ .	The conductance law is i.i.d .	subject to the condition that the probability of $ \omega_ { xy } & gt ; 0 $ exceeds the threshold for bond percolation on $ \Z^d $ .	We prove that $ P_\omega^ { 2n } ( 0,0 ) $ is bounded by a random constant times $ n^ { -d/2 } $ in $ d=2,3 $ , while it is $ o ( n^ { -2 } ) $ in $ d\ge5 $ and $ O ( n^ { -2 } \log n ) $ in $ d=4 $ .
3	We assume that we start the system with $ N_A ( x,0- ) $ $ A $ -particles at $ x $ , and that the $ N_A ( x,0- ) , x\in\mathbb { Z } ^d $ , are i.i.d. , mean- $ \mu_A $ Poisson random variables .	We consider the following interacting particle system : There is a `` gas '' of particles , each of which performs a continuous-time simple random walk on $ \mathbb { Z } ^d $ , with jump rate $ D_A $ .	These particles are called $ A $ -particles and move independently of each other .	They are regarded as individuals who are ignorant of a rumor or are healthy .	In addition , there are $ B $ -particles which perform continuous-time simple random walks with jump rate $ D_B $ .
0	The Pierre Auger Observatory has been collecting data in a stable manner since January 2004 .	We present here a study of the cosmic ray composition using events recorded in hybrid mode during the first years of data taking .	These are air showers observed by the fluorescence detector as well as the surface detector , so the depth of shower maximum , Xmax , is measured directly .	The cosmic ray composition is studied in different energy ranges by comparing the observed average Xmax with predictions from air shower simulations for different nuclei .	The change of & lt ; Xmax & gt ; with energy ( elongation rate ) is used to derive estimates of the change in primary composition .

4	The effective electron temperature through the MTSI does not depend much on the Mach number , although that through the BI increases with the Mach number as in the past studies .	Efficiency of electron heating through microinstabilities generated in the transition region of a quasi-perpendicular shock for wide ange of Mach numbers is investigated by utilizing PIC ( Particle-In-Cell ) simulation and model analyses .	In the model analyses saturation levels of effective electron temperature as a result of microinstabilities are estimated from an extended quasilinear ( trapping ) analysis for relatively low ( high ) Mach number shocks .	Here , MTSI ( modified two-stream instability ) is assumed to become dominant in low Mach number regime , while BI ( Buneman instability ) to become dominant in high Mach number regime , respectively .	It is revealed that Mach number dependence of the effective electron temperature in the MTSI dominant case is essentially different from that in the BI dominant case .
2	For typical RXTE ASM count rates , the luminosity variations of LMC X-3 are due to changes of the phenomenological disk blackbody temperature .	We present the analysis of an RXTE monitoring campaign of the canonical soft state black hole candidates LMC X-1 and LMC X-3 .	In contrast to LMC X-1 , which does not exhibit any periodic spectral changes , we find that LMC X-3 exhibits stron spectral variability on time scales of days to weeks .	During episodes of especially low luminosity ( ASM count rates & lt ; 0.6 counts/sec ) , kT strongly decreases and the power law significantly hardens to a photon index of ~1.8 .	These changes are consistent with state changes of LMC X-3 from the soft state to the canonical hard state of galactic black hole candidates .
4	Also , the role of the fringing magnetic field ( present in the second example ) on these levels is discussed .	We study the bound states of a two dimensional free electron gas ( 2DEG ) subjected to a perpendicular inhomogeneous magnetic field .	An analytical transfer matrix ( ATM ) based exact quantization formula is derived for magnetic fields that vary ( arbitrarily ) along one spatial direction .	As illustrative examples , we consider ( 1 ) a class of symmetric power law magnetic fields confined within a strip , followed by the problem of a ( 2 ) 2DEG placed under a thin ferromagnetic film , which are hitherto unexplored .	The exact Landau levels for either cases are obtained .
1	The incoming flow of high-precision cosmological data , such as those from the Planck satellite and small scale Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) experiments , calls for greater accuracy in the inflationary predictions .	Within the class of inflationary models , k-inflation represents the most general single field framework that can be associated with an effective quadratic action for the curvature perturbations and a varying speed of sound .	In this work , we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to-leading order scalar and tensor primordial power spectra in k-inflation needed in order to obtain robust constraints on the inflationary theory .	The method used is the uniform approximation together with a second order expansion in the Hubble and sound flow functions .	Our result is checked in various limits in which it reduces to already known situations .
0	We model how the mid-infrared colors of Young Stellar Objects ( YSOs ) vary with stellar temperature .	The spectral energy distribution ( SED ) of each object has contributions from thermal emission of circumstellar dust , from direct stellar photospheric emission , and from scattered stellar emission .	We first isolate the effects of stellar contributions ( direct+scattered ) to the SED using homologous `` Class I '' models , where the shape of the thermal contribution to the SED remains constant .	Stellar light contributes relatively more to the MIR emission of YSOs with lower temperature stars ( Tstar ~4000 K ) because the emission peak wavelength of the star is closer to that of the thermal radiation .	Next we consider realistic Class 0 , I , and II source models and find that the other dominant effect of varying stellar temperature on YSO SEDs is that of the inner disk wall : In high-Tstar models , the dust destruction radius is much further out with a consequently larger inner disk wall that contributes relatively more to the 2-10 um flux .
2	This `forced weakening ' method unifies several existing approaches , and multiplies the range of possible weakening laws .	Mean field slider block models have provided an important entry point for understanding the behavior of discrete driven threshold systems .	We present a method of constructing these models with an arbitrary frictional weakening function .	Forced weakening also results in Abelian rupture propagation , so that an avalanche size depends only on the initial stress distribution .	We demonstrate how this may be used to accurately predict the long-time event statistics of a simulation .
1	Within the turn-around radius dark matter flows in a self-similar fashion into a stationary Navarro-Frenk-White halo and the baryonic gas shocks .	We study the complete dynamical evolution of hot interstellar gas in massive elliptical galaxies born into a simple flat universe beginning with an overdense perturbation .	After a few gigayears , when enough gas accumulates within the accretion shock , the de Vaucouleurs stellar system is constructed and the energy from Type II supernovae is released .	The stars and dark halo are matched to NGC 4472 .	Gas continues to enter the galaxy by secondary infall and by stellar mass loss based on a Salpeter IMF .
2	Since they possess oscillating electric fields in a magnetic field , they dissipate their energies in magnetized conducting media .	Axions are possible candidates of dark matter in the present Universe .	They have been argued to form axionic boson stars with small masses $ \sim 10^ { -12 } M_ { \odot } $ .	We show that colliding with a magnetized white dwarf , the axionic boson stars dissipate their energies and heat the white dwarf .	Consequently the white dwarf cooled sufficiently can emit detectable amount of radiations with the collision .
2	Due to variations across the field of view , a unique wavelength solution is determined for each lenslet characterized by a two-dimensional position , the spectral dispersion , and the rotation of the spectrum with respect to the detector axes .	We present the wavelength calibration for the lenslet-based Integral Field Spectrograph ( IFS ) that serves as the science instrument for the Gemini Planet Imager ( GPI ) .	The GPI IFS features a 2.7 '' x 2.7 '' field of view and a 190 x 190 lenslet array ( 14.3 mas/lenslet ) operating in $ Y $ , $ J $ , $ H $ , and $ K $ bands with spectral resolving power ranging from $ R $ $ \sim $ 35 to 78 .	The four free parameters are fit using a constrained Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization algorithm , which compares an individual lenslet 's arc lamp spectrum to a simulated arc lamp spectrum .	This method enables measurement of spectral positions to better than 1/10th of a pixel on the GPI IFS detector using Gemini 's facility calibration lamp unit GCAL , improving spectral extraction accuracy compared to earlier approaches .
4	This PDE can be used to derive all $ n $ -time moments of the process $ E $ .	Let $ \ { D ( s ) , s \geq 0 \ } $ be a L\'evy subordinator , that is , a non-decreasing process with stationary and independent increments and suppose that $ D ( 0 ) = 0 $ .	We study the first-hitting time of the process $ D $ , namely , the process $ E ( t ) = \inf \ { s : D ( s ) & gt ; t \ } $ , $ t \geq 0 $ .	The process $ E $ is , in general , non-Markovian with non-stationary and non-independent increments .	We derive a partial differential equation for the Laplace transform of the $ n $ -time tail distribution function $ P [ E ( t_1 ) & gt ; s_1 , ... , E ( t_n ) & gt ; s_n ] $ , and show that this PDE has a unique solution given natural boundary conditions .
3	Our main result is that in contrast with the case of independent sources , the presence of source correlations can significantly increase the price of anarchy .	We consider the min-cost multicast problem ( under network coding ) with multiple correlated sources where each terminal wants to losslessly reconstruct all the sources .	We study the inefficiency brought forth by the selfish behavior of the terminals in this scenario by modeling it as a noncooperative game among the terminals .	The degradation in performance due to the lack of regulation is measured by the { \it Price of Anarchy } ( POA ) , which is defined as the ratio between the cost of the worst possible \textit { Wardrop equilibrium } and the socially optimum cost .	Towards establishing this result , we first characterize the socially optimal flow and rate allocation in terms of four intuitive conditions .
2	We present an algorithm to compute harmonic weak Maass forms numerically , based on the automorphy method due to Hejhal and Stark .	Harmonic weak Maass forms of half-integral weight are the subject of many recent works .	They are closely related to Ramanujan 's mock theta functions , their theta lifts give rise to Arakelov Green functions , and their coefficients are often related to central values and derivatives of Hecke L-functions .	As explicit examples we consider harmonic weak Maass forms of weight 1/2 associated to the elliptic curves 11a1 , 37a1 , 37b1 .	We made extensive numerical computations and the data we obtained is presented in the final section of the paper .
4	We then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer simulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expanding supernova ejecta .	One of the most important questions regarding the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) is whether mergers of two white dwarfs can lead to explosions that reproduce observations of normal events .	Here we present a fully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses of $ 0.9 \mathrm { M_\odot } $ and $ 1.1 \mathrm { M_\odot } $ combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions .	A well-tested combination of codes is used to study the system .	We start with the dynamical inspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under the plausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging .
2	This regime has been recently achieved in semiconductor nanostructures , where a quantum dot is trapped in a planar microcavity .	The Jaynes-Cummings model , describing the interaction between a single two-level system and a photonic mode , has been used to describe a large variety of systems , ranging from cavity quantum electrodynamics , trapped ions , to superconducting qubits coupled to resonators .	Recently there has been renewed interest in studying the quantum strong-coupling ( QSC ) regime , where states with photon number greater than one are excited .	Here we study the quantum strong-coupling regime by calculating its photoluminescence ( PL ) properties under a pulsed excitation .	We discuss the changes in the PL as the QSC regime is reached , which transitions between a peak around the cavity resonance to a doublet .
2	Here we analytically prove that , unlike the entropy itself , the entropy variation rate ( $ B=dS_ { a } /dt $ ) defies the monotonicity for multiple reservoirs ( $ n\geq2 $ ) .	For an isolated assembly that comprises a system and its surrounding reservoirs , the total entropy ( $ S_ { a } $ ) always monotonically increases as time elapses .	This phenomenon is known as the second law of thermodynamics ( $ S_ { a } \geq0 $ ) .	In other words , there always exist minima .	For example , when a system is heated by two reservoirs from $ T=300\ , K $ initially to $ T=400\ , K $ at the final steady state , $ B $ decreases steadily first .
0	It is argued that the `problem of time ' in quantum gravity necessitates a refinement of the local inertial structure of the world , demanding a replacement of the usual Minkowski line element by a 4+2n dimensional pseudo-Euclidean line element , with the extra 2n being the number of internal phase space dimensions of the observed system .	In the refined structure , the inverse of the Planck time takes over the role of observer-independent conversion factor usually played by the speed of light , which now emerges as an invariant but derivative quantity .	In the relativistic theory based on the refined structure , energies and momenta turn out to be invariantly bounded from above , and lengths and durations similarly bounded from below , by their respective Planck scale values .	Along the external timelike world-lines , the theory naturally captures the `flow of time ' as a genuinely structural attribute of the world .	The theory also predicts expected deviations -- suppressed quadratically by the Planck energy -- from the dispersion relations for free fields in the vacuum .
2	We conclude that this region is located at ~10 parsecs , the distance coinciding with the location of the hot dust region .	Recent multi-wavelength observations of 3C454.3 , in particular during its giant outburst in 2005 , put severe constraints on the location of the 'blazar zone ' , its dissipative nature , and high energy radiation mechanisms .	As the optical , X-ray , and millimeter light-curves indicate , significant fraction of the jet energy must be released in the vicinity of the millimeter-photosphere , i.e.at distances where , due to the lateral expansion , the jet becomes transparent at millimeter wavelengths .	This location is consistent with the high amplitude variations observed on ~10 day time scale , provided the Lorentz factor of a jet is ~20 .	We argue that dissipation is driven by reconfinement shock and demonstrate that X-rays and gamma-rays are likely to be produced via inverse Compton scattering of near/mid IR photons emitted by the hot dust .
1	We further give FJ quantization of this system .	We obtain a new symplectic Lagrangian density and deduce Faddeev-Jackiw ( FJ ) generalized brackets of the gauge invariant self-dual fields interacting with gauge fields .	Furthermore , the FJ method is compared with Dirac method , the results show the two methods are equivalent in the quantization of this system .	And by the practical research in this letter , it can be found that the FJ method is really simpler than the Dirac method , namely , the FJ method obviates the need to distinguish primary and secondary constraints and first- and second-class constraints .	Therefore , the FJ method is a more economical and effective method of quantization .
0	Holography inspired stringy hadrons ( HISH ) is a set of models that describe hadrons : mesons , baryons and glueballs as strings in four dimensional space time .	The models are based on a `` map '' from stringy hadrons of holographic confining backgrounds .	In this note we review the `` derivation '' of the models .	We start with a brief reminder of the passage from the AdS5xS5 string theory to certain flavored confining holographic models .	We then describe the string configurations in holographic backgrounds that correspond to a Wilson line , a meson , a baryon and a glueball .
3	On the other hand , we have considered the conjunction { \em et ( and ) } as the head of the coordinate structure , so that coordinate structures stem simply from the subcategorization specifications of { \em et } and the general schemata of a head saturation .	We propose a treatment of coordination based on the concepts of functor , argument and subcategorization .	Its formalization comprises two parts which are conceptually independent .	On one hand , we have extended the feature structure unification to disjunctive and set values in order to check the compatibility and the satisfiability of subcategorization requirements by structured complements .	Both parts have been encoded within HPSG using the same resource that is the subcategorization and its principle which we have just extended .
2	To some extent this can be overcome with a laser guide star ( LGS ) .	Adaptive optics ( AO ) systems allow a telescope to reach its diffraction limit at near infrared wavelengths .	But to achieve this , a bright natural guide star ( NGS ) is needed for the wavefront sensing , severely limiting the fraction of the sky over which AO can be used .	While the laser can be pointed anywhere in the sky , one still needs to have a natural star , albeit fainter , reasonably close to correct the image motion ( tip-tilt ) to which laser guide stars are insensitive .	There are in fact many astronomical targets without suitable tip-tilt stars , but for which the enhanced resolution obtained with the Laser Guide Star Facility ( LGSF ) would still be very beneficial .
0	We study the influence of the environment on the evolution of galaxies by investigating the luminosity function ( LF ) of galaxies of different morphological types and colours at different environmental density levels .	We construct the LFs separately for galaxies of different morphology ( spiral and elliptical ) and of different colours ( red and blue ) using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) , correcting the luminosities for the intrinsic absorption .	We use the global luminosity density field to define different environments , and analyse the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and colour .	The smoothed bootstrap method is used to calculate confidence regions of the derived luminosity functions .	We find a strong environmental dependency for the LF of elliptical galaxies .
0	The space of m-ary differential operators acting on weighted densities is a ( m+1 ) -parameter family of modules over the Lie algebra of vector fields .	For almost all the parameters , we construct a canonical isomorphism between this space and the corresponding space of symbols as sl ( 2 ) -modules .	This yields to the notion of the sl ( 2 ) -equivariant symbol calculus for m-ary differential operators .	We show , however , that these two modules can not be isomorphic as sl ( 2 ) -modules for some particular values of the parameters .	Furthermore , we use the symbol map to show that all modules of second-order m-ary differential operators are isomorphic to each other , except for few modules called singular .
0	We investigate the stochastic dynamics of entities which are confined to a set of islands , between which they migrate .	They are assumed to be one of two types , and in addition to migration , they also reproduce and die .	Systems which fall into this class are common in biology and social science , occurring in ecology , population genetics , epidemiology , biochemistry , linguistics , opinion dynamics , and other areas .	In all these cases the governing equations are intractable , consisting as they do of multidimensional Fokker-Planck equations or , equivalently , coupled nonlinear stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise .	We develop a methodology which exploits a separation in time scales between fast and slow variables to reduce these equations so that they resemble those for a single island , which are amenable to analysis .
3	To investigate this , we make use of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations .	The theory for the formation of the first population of stars ( Pop III ) predicts a IMF composed predominantly of high-mass stars , in contrast to the present-day IMF , which tends to yield stars with masses less than 1 M_Solar .	The leading theory for the transition in the characteristic stellar mass predicts that the cause is the extra cooling provided by increasing metallicity and in particular the cooling provided at high densities by dust .	The aim of this work is to test whether dust cooling can lead to fragmentation and be responsible for this transition .	We follow the thermodynamic evolution of the gas by solving the full thermal energy equation , and also track the evolution of the dust temperature and the chemical evolution of the gas .
0	Aims .	The aim of this paper is to analyse the previously discovered discontinuity of the periodicity of the GeV $ \gamma $ -ray emission of the radio-loud X-ray binary LS I +61 { \deg } 303 and to determine its physical origin.Methods .	We used wavelet analysis to explore the temporal development of periodic signals .	The wavelet analysis was first applied to the whole data set of available Fermi-LAT data and then to the two subsets of orbital phase intervals $ \Phi = 0.0 - 0.5 $ and $ \Phi = 0.5 - 1.0 $ .	We also performed a Lomb-Scargle timing Analysis .
2	Our morphological and photometric analysis reveals that EROJ003707 is an L* early-type disk-galaxy and we estimate that ~10 per cent of EROs with ( R-K ) & gt ; =5.3 and K & lt ; =21 may have similar properties .	We present near-infrared spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) imaging of EROJ003707+0909.5 , the brightest of three gravitationally-lensed images of an Extremely Red Object ( ERO ) at z=1.6 , in the field of the massive cluster A68 ( z=0.255 ) .	We exploit the superlative resolution of our HST data and the enhanced spatial resolution and sensitivity afforded by the lens amplification to reconstruct the source-plane properties of this ERO .	The unique association of passive EROs with elliptical galaxies therefore appears to be too simplistic .	We speculate on the evolution of EROJ003707 : if gas continues to cool onto this galaxy in the manner predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation models , then by the present day , EROJ003707 could evolve into a very luminous spiral galaxy .
4	In particular , we have a notion of an adjoint pair of functors being a 'module ' over another such pair .	We define the notion of an additive model category , and we prove that any additive , stable , combinatorial model category has a natural enrichment over symmetric spectra based on simplicial abelian groups .	As a consequence , every object in such a model category has a naturally associated endomorphism ring inside this spectra category .	We establish the basic properties of this enrichment .	We also develop some enriched model category theory .
2	They introduce additional parton distributions , like the photon distribution in the nucleon , and lead to additional mixing effects .	We study the systematic inclusion of QED corrections in the evolution of parton distributions .	O ( alpha ) corrections modify the evolution equation for parton distributions .	We discuss the modifications for a realistic model of N_f , up up-type flavours and N_f , down down-type flavours .	We have implemented these corrections into a numerical program and we quantify the size of these effects in a toy model .
4	We show that solutions to the QHJE can be constructed by a simple prescription starting from the propagator of the associated Schroedinger equation .	Quantum canonical transformations have attracted interest since the beginning of quantum theory .	Based on their classical analogues , one would expect them to provide a powerful quantum tool .	However , the difficulty of solving a nonlinear operator partial differential equation such as the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation ( QHJE ) has hindered progress along this otherwise promising avenue .	We overcome this difficulty .
1	In this paper , we will give analytical formulae to calculate the synchronous modes ' loss factors .	Wakefields in a rectangular accelerating structure can be calculated in time domain by directly solving Maxwell 's equations by a 3D code .	From these analytical formulae on can get the delta function wakefields .	The relations between the loss factors ( wakefields ) and the structure geometrical dimensions are well established .	These analytical expressions of loss factors can be used also in a single rectangular resonant cavity .
0	In the light of the new 13 TeV dilepton data set with $ 3.2\ , { \rm fb^ { -1 } } $ integrated luminosity from the ATLAS collaboration , we derive limits on the $ Z^ { \prime } $ mass in the context of left-right symmetric models and exploit the complementarity with dijet and $ lljj $ data , as well as neutrinoless double beta decay .	We keep the ratio of the left- and right-handed gauge coupling free in order to take into account different patterns of left-right symmetry breaking .	By combining the dielectron and dimuon data we can exclude $ Z^ { \prime } $ masses below $ 3 $ ~TeV for $ g_R=g_L $ , and for $ g_R \sim 1 $ we rule out masses up to $ \sim 4 $ ~TeV .	Those comprise the strongest direct bounds on the $ Z^ { \prime } $ mass from left-right models up to date .	We show that in the usual plane of right-handed neutrino and charged gauge boson mass , dilepton data can probe a region of parameter space inaccessible to neutrinoless double beta decay and $ lljj $ studies .
4	Finally , our results suggest a remarkably simple general mapping between energy loss expressions for static and dynamical QCD media .	The computation of radiative energy loss in a finite size QCD medium with dynamical constituents is a key ingredient for obtaining reliable predictions for jet quenching in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions .	We here present a theoretical formalism for the calculation of the first order in opacity radiative energy loss of a quark jet traveling through a finite size dynamical QCD medium .	We show that , while each individual contribution to the energy loss is infrared divergent , the divergence is naturally regulated once all diagrams are taken into account .	Finite size effects are shown to induce a non-linear path length dependence of the energy loss , recovering both the incoherent Gunion-Bertsch limit , as well as destructive Landau-Pomeanchuk-Migdal limit .
4	events is predicted , using control samples in the data , to arise from standard model processes , and one event is observed in the data .	A search for supersymmetry is presented using a sample of events with b jets and missing transverse momentum .	The search uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 inverse picobarns , collected with the CMS detector .

4	Dukes. , European J. Combin .	Let $ W $ be a finite Coxeter group and $ X $ a subset of $ W $ .	The length polynomial $ L_ { W , X } ( t ) $ is defined by $ L_ { W , X } ( t ) = \sum_ { x \in X } t^ { \ell ( x ) } $ , where $ \ell $ is the length function on $ W $ .	In this article we derive expressions for the length polynomial where $ X $ is any conjugacy class of involutions , or the set of all involutions , in any finite Coxeter group $ W $ .	In particular , these results correct errors in the paper `` Permutation statistics on involutions '' , W.M.B .
1	For the first time $ \omega $ mesons could be reconstructed in a heavy-ion reaction at a bombarding energy which is well below the production threshold in free nucleon-nucleon collisions .	We present results on dielectron production in Ar+KCl collisions at 1.76A GeV .	The omega multiplicity has been extracted and compared to the yields of other particles , in particular of the phi meson .	At intermediate e+e- invariant masses , we find a strong enhancement of the pair yield over a reference spectrum from elementary nucleon-nucleon reactions suggesting the onset of non-trivial effects of the nuclear medium .	Transverse-mass spectra and angular distributions have been reconstructed in three invariant mass bins .
0	The idea that dark matter forms part of a larger dark sector is very intriguing , given the high degree of complexity of the visible sector .	In this paper , we discuss lepton jets as a promising signature of an extended dark sector .	As a simple toy model , we consider an $ \mathcal { O } ( \text { GeV } ) $ DM fermion coupled to a new $ U ( 1 ) ' $ gauge boson ( dark photon ) with a mass of order GeV and kinetically mixed with the Standard Model photon .	Dark matter production at the LHC in this model is typically accompanied by collinear radiation of dark photons whose decay products can form lepton jets .	We analyze the dynamics of collinear dark photon emission both analytically and numerically .
1	Subsequently , the number of condensed atoms ( $ N_0 $ ) grows even though the temperature ( $ T $ ) rises and the total atom number decays .	By quenching the strength of interactions in a partially condensed Bose gas we create a `` super-saturated '' vapor which has more thermal atoms than it can contain in equilibrium .	We show that the non-equilibrium evolution of the system is isoenergetic and for small initial $ N_0 $ observe a clear separation between $ T $ and $ N_0 $ dynamics , thus explicitly demonstrating the theoretically expected `` two-step '' picture of condensate growth .	For increasing initial $ N_0 $ values we observe a crossover to classical relaxation dynamics .	The size of the observed quench-induced effects can be explained using a simple equation of state for an interacting harmonically-trapped atomic gas .
3	) , 21 show extended MIR emission on single dish images .	Recent mid-infrared ( MIR ) interferometric observations showed in few active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) that the bulk of the infrared emission originates from the polar region above the putative torus , where only little dust should be present .	Here , we investigate whether such strong polar dust emission is common in AGN .	Out of 149 Seyferts in the MIR atlas of local AGN ( Asmus et al .	In 18 objects , the extended MIR emission aligns with the system axis position angle , established by [ OIII ] , radio , polarisation and maser based position angle measurements .
4	Some of the structures look similar to $ \delta $ spots observed in the Sun .	We perform direct numerical simulations of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics with external random forcing and in the presence of gravity .	The domain is divided into two parts : a lower layer where the forcing is helical and an upper layer where the helicity of the forcing is zero with a smooth transition in between .	At early times , a large-scale helical dynamo develops in the bottom layer .	At later times the dynamo saturates , but the vertical magnetic field continues to develop and rises to form dynamic bipolar structures at the top , which later disappear and reappear .
3	To this end we identify an appropriate quantity , which we term $ D $ , that represents the correlation correction of the condensate order parameter , as it does the self-energy for the Green 's function .	Among the various numerical techniques to study the physics of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems , the self-energy functional approach ( SFA ) has become increasingly important .	In its previous form , however , SFA is not applicable to Bose-Einstein condensation or superfluidity .	In this paper we show how to overcome this shortcoming .	An appropriate functional is derived , which is stationary at the exact physical realizations of $ D $ and of the self-energy .
0	Using time-dependent density-functional theory we calculate from first principles the rate of energy transfer from a moving proton or antiproton to the electrons of an insulating material , LiF .	The behavior of the electronic stopping power versus projectile velocity displays an effective threshold velocity of ~0.2 a.u .	for the proton , consistent with recent experimental observations , and also for the antiproton .	The calculated proton/antiproton stopping-power ratio is ~2.4 at velocities slightly above the threshold ( v~0.4 a.u .	) , as compared to the experimental value of 2.1 .
4	Their velocities are suggestive of an origin on the front and back side of an expanding biconical outflow emanating from the Galactic Center .	Giant lobes of plasma extend 55 degrees above and below the Galactic Center , glowing in emission from gamma rays ( the Fermi Bubbles ) to microwaves ( the WMAP haze ) and polarized radio waves .	We use ultraviolet absorption-line spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope to constrain the velocity of the outflowing gas within these regions , targeting the quasar PDS 456 ( Galactic coordinates l , b=10.4 , +11.2 degrees ) .	This sightline passes through a clear biconical structure seen in hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission near the base of the northern Fermi Bubble .	We report two high-velocity metal absorption components , at v_LSR=-235 and +250 km/s , which can not be explained by co-rotating gas in the Galactic disk or halo .
3	Galaxies have been classified in four spectral classes , using their colours and redshift , and LFs have been derived in the U , B , V , R and I rest frame bands from z=0.05 to z=1.5 .	From the first epoch observations of the VVDS up to z=1.5 we have derived luminosity functions ( LF ) of different spectral type galaxies .	The VVDS data , covering ~70 % of the life of the Universe , allow for the first time to study from the same sample and with good statistical accuracy the evolution of the LFs by galaxy type in several rest frame bands from a purely magnitude selected sample .	The magnitude limit of the VVDS allows the determination of the faint end slope of the LF with unprecedented accuracy .	We find a significant steepening of the LF going from early to late types .
4	As a special case , these yield explicit formulas for Tukey 's h pdf and cdf - to the author 's knowledge for the first time in the literature .	I present a parametric , bijective transformation to generate heavy tail versions Y of arbitrary RVs X ~ F. The tail behavior of the so-called 'heavy tail Lambert W x F ' RV Y depends on a tail parameter delta & gt ; = 0 : for delta = 0 , Y = X , for delta & gt ; 0 Y has heavier tails than X .	For X being Gaussian , this meta-family of heavy-tailed distributions reduces to Tukey 's h distribution .	Lambert 's W function provides an explicit inverse transformation , which can be estimated by maximum likelihood .	This inverse can remove heavy tails from data , and also provide analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution ( cdf ) and probability density function ( pdf ) .
4	Toda and Liouville models are generalized to noncommutative plane and the solutions are provided by the uniton method .	We consider the Dunne-Jackiw-Pi-Trugenberger model of a U ( N ) Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to a nonrelativistic complex adjoint matter on noncommutative space .	Soliton configurations of this model are related the solutions of the chiral model on noncommutative plane .	A generalized Uhlenbeck 's uniton method for the chiral model on noncommutative space provides explicit Chern-Simons solitons .	Fundamental solitons in the U ( 1 ) gauge theory are shaped as rings of charge `n ' and spin `n ' where the Chern-Simons level `n ' should be an integer upon quantization .
2	The most investigated technologies are reviewed : topographic , phase-change , magnetic , ferroelectric and atomic and molecular storage .	Probe-based data storage attracted many researchers from academia and industry , resulting in unprecendeted high data-density demonstrations .	This topical review gives a comprehensive overview of the main contributions that led to the major accomplishments in probe-based data storage .	Also , the positioning of probes and recording media , the cantilever arrays and parallel readout of the arrays of cantilevers are discussed .	This overview serves two purposes .
2	Inspired by hierarchical object representation and recent application of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ( DCNNs ) on human pose estimation , we propose a novel formulation that incorporates both hierarchical exemplar-based models and DCNNs in the spatial terms .	Exemplar-based models have achieved great success on localizing the parts of semi-rigid objects .	However , their efficacy on highly articulated objects such as humans is yet to be explored .	Specifically , we obtain more expressive spatial models by assuming independence between exemplars at different levels in the hierarchy ; we also obtain stronger spatial constraints by inferring the spatial relations between parts at the same level .	As our method strikes a good balance between expressiveness and strength of spatial models , it is both effective and generalizable , achieving state-of-the-art results on different benchmarks : Leeds Sports Dataset and CUB-200-2011 .
3	Methods : Data from the DRAO Synthesis Telescope , the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope , and the DRAO 26-m Telescope have been combined .	Context : Observations of polarized emission are a significant source of information on the magnetic field that pervades the Interstellar Medium of the Galaxy .	Despite the acknowledged importance of the magnetic field in interstellar processes , our knowledge of field configurations on all scales is seriously limited .	Aims : This paper describes an extensive survey of polarized Galactic emission at 1.4 GHz that provides data with arcminute resolution and complete coverage of all structures from the broadest angular scales to the resolution limit , giving information on the magneto-ionic medium over a wide range of interstellar environments .	Angular resolution is ~1 ' and the survey extends from l = 66 deg to l = 175 deg over a range -3 deg & lt ; b & lt ; 5 deg along the northern Galactic plane , with a high-latitude extension from l = 101 deg to l = 116 deg up to b = 17.5 deg .
1	These systems are such that the dynamics is completely determined by the number of oscillators N and a single scalar function $ g ( \varphi ) $ ( the coupling function ) .	In this paper we examine robust clustering behaviour with multiple nontrivial clusters for identically and globally coupled phase oscillators .	Previous work has shown that ( a ) any clustering can stably appear via choice of a suitable coupling function and ( b ) open sets of coupling functions can generate heteroclinic network attractors between cluster states of saddle type , though there seem to be no examples where saddles with more than two nontrivial clusters are involved .	In this work we clarify the relationship between the coupling function and the dynamics .	We focus on cases where the clusters are inequivalent in the sense of not being related by a temporal symmetry , and demonstrate that there are coupling functions that give robust heteroclinic networks between periodic states involving three or more nontrivial clusters .
3	These steady wind-like outflows are generally proton rich , characterized by only modest entropies , and consequently synthesize essentially nothing heavier than the Fe-group elements .	We consider nucleosynthesis in outflows originating from the inner regions of viscous accretion disks formed after the collapse of a rotating massive star .	We show that wind-like outflows driven by viscous and neutrino heating can efficiently synthesize Fe-group elements moving at near-relativistic velocities .	The mass of 56Ni synthesized and the asymptotic velocities attained in our calculations are in accord with those inferred from observations of SN1998bw and SN2003dh .	We also discuss bubble-like outflows resulting from rapid energy deposition in localized regions near or in the accretion disk .
4	If this effect is real then cosmological models are excluded for this burst because of absorption of UHE gamma rays by the intergalactic radiation fields .	A small air shower array operating over many years has been used to search for ultra-high energy ( UHE ) gamma radiation ( $ \geq 50 $ TeV ) associated with gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) detected by the BATSE instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory ( CGRO ) .	Upper limits for a one minute interval after each burst are presented for seven GRBs located with zenith angles $ \theta & lt ; 20^ { \circ } $ .	A $ 4.3\sigma $ excess over background was observed between 10 and 20 minutes following the onset of a GRB on 11 May 1991 .	The confidence level that this is due to a real effect and not a background fluctuation is 99.8\ % .
2	Furthermore , we introduce CP-violating and CP-conserving \tau-spin asymmetries which are generated already at the TREE-LEVEL in the reaction p \bar p - & gt ; sneutrino - & gt ; \tau^+ \tau^- +X if there is muon-sneutrino - \bar muon-sneutrino mixing and that vanish in the SM .	The sneutrino resonance reactions p \bar p - & gt ; sneutrino - & gt ; l^+ l^- +X , for l=e , \mu , \tau , in the MSSM without R-parity are considered .	We perform a cross-section analysis and show that present limits on some products of R-parity violating couplings in the sneutrino sector can be significantly improved in future upgraded Fermilab Tevatron runs .	We find , for example , that for muon-sneutrino masses in the range 150 GeV & lt ; m_ { muon-sneutrino } & lt ; 450 GeV , these spin asymmetries reach ~ 20 - 30 % and ~ 10 % for mass splitting between the muon-sneutrino CP-odd and CP-even states at the level of \Delta m ~ \Gamma and \Delta m ~ \Gamma/4 , respectively , where \Gamma is the muon-sneutrino width .	Both the CP-violating and the CP-conserving spin asymmetries should be detectable in future Tevatron runs even for a heavy sneutrino with a mass & lt ; 500 GeV .
1	These models are twisted local , but non-local .	We consider conformal nets on $ S^1 $ of von Neumann algebras , acting on the full Fock space , arising in free probability .	We extend to the non-local case the general analysis of the modular structure .	The local algebras turn out to be $ III_1 $ -factors associated with free groups .	We use our set up to show examples exhibiting arbitrarily large maximal temperatures , but failing to satisfy the split property , then clarifying the relation between the latter property and the trace class conditions on $ e^ { -\b L } $ , where $ L $ is the conformal Hamiltonian .
4	A number of other relatively bright cluster members also display excess emission in the $ K $ -- band , indicative of disks/envelopes around young massive stars .	We present high angular resolution near -- infrared images of the obscured Galactic Giant HII ( GHII ) region G333.1 -- 0.4 in which we detect an OB star cluster .	For G333.1 -- 0.4 , we find OB stars and other massive objects in very early evolutionary stages , possibly still accreting .	We obtained $ K $ -- band spectra of three stars ; two show O type photospheric features , while the third has no photospheric features but does show CO 2.3 $ \mu $ m band -- head emission .	This object is at least as hot as an early B type star based on its intrinsic luminosity and is surrounded by a circumstellar disc/envelope which produces near infrared excess emission .
0	Silicate carbon stars show the 10 micron silicate emission , despite their carbon-rich photospheres .	They are considered to have circumbinary or circum-companion disks , which serve as a reservoir of oxygen-rich material shed by mass loss in the past .	We present N-band spectro-interferometric observations of the silicate carbon star BM Gem using MIDI at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer ( VLTI ) .	Our aim is to probe the spatial distribution of oxygen-rich dust with high spatial resolution .	BM Gem was observed with VLTI/MIDI at 44 -- 62 m baselines using the UT2-UT3 and UT3-UT4 baseline configurations .
1	We study the effect of the magnetic field on the neutron star matter .	The magnetars are believed to be highly magnetized neutron stars having surface magnetic field 10^ { 14 } - 10^ { 15 } G. It is believed that at the center , the magnetic field may be higher than that at the surface .	We model the nuclear matter with the relativistic mean field approach considering the possibility of appearance of hyperons at higher density .	We find that the effect of magnetic field on the matter of neutron stars and hence on the mass-radius relation is important , when the central magnetic field is atleast of the order of 10^ { 17 } G. Very importantly , the effect of strong magnetic field reveals anisotropy to the system .	Moreover , if the central field approaches 10^ { 19 } G , then the matter becomes unstable which limits the maximum magnetic field at the center of magnetars .
1	They provide a simple framework for many phenomena , such as epidemic spreading and opinion formation .	Contact processes describe the transmission of distinct properties of nodes via the links of a network .	Combining contact processes with rules for topological evolution yields an adaptive network in which the states of the nodes can interact dynamically with the topological degrees of freedom .	By moment-closure approximation it is possible to derive low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of the adaptive network on a coarse-grained level .	In this chapter we discuss the approximation technique itself as well as its applications to adaptive networks .
3	The topic of this paper concerns a different approach leading to plasma confinement .	The energy production through thermo-nuclear fusion requires the confinement of the plasma into a bounded domain .	In most of the cases , such configurations are obtained by using strong magnetic fields .	Several models exist for describing the evolution of a strongly magnetized plasma , i.e. , guiding-center approximation , finite Larmor radius regime , etc .	More exactly we are interested in mathematical models with fast oscillating magnetic fields .
1	The source is already known to have a marginally-fainter absolute magnitude than similar T dwarfs with trigonometric parallax measurements , and has a tangential velocity consistent with old disk kinematics .	We explore and discount the hypothesis that the strong , continual H $ \alpha $ -emitting T dwarf 2MASS J12373919+6526148 can be explained as a young , low gravity , very low mass brown dwarf .	Applying the technique of Burgasser , Burrows & amp ; Kirkpatrick on new near infrared spectroscopy for this source , estimates of its { \teff } , $ \log { g } $ and metallicity ( [ M/H ] ) are obtained .	2M 1237+6526 has a { \teff } $ \approx $ 800-850 K. If [ M/H ] is solar , $ \log { g } $ is as high as $ \sim $ 5.5 ( cgs ) and this source is older than 10 Gyr .	We find a more plausible scenario to be a modestly subsolar metallicity ( [ M/H ] = -0.2 ) and moderate $ \log { g } $ $ \sim $ 5.0 , implying an age older than 2 Gyr and a mass greater than 0.035 M $ _ { \sun } $ .
4	We discuss how these effects could be used to create new types of devices such as current effect transistors .	Using numerical simulations , we show that a novel spontaneous transverse response can appear when a longitudinal drive is applied to type-II superconductors with honeycomb pinning arrays in a magnetic field near certain filling fractions .	This response is generated by dynamical symmetry breaking that occurs at fields away from commensurability .	We find a coherent strongly amplified transverse switching effect when an additional transverse ac current is applied .	The transverse ac drive can also be used to control switching in the longitudinal velocity response .
2	With the CO images , we discover two high-velocity bipolar molecular outflows , driven by the two sources .	We present interferometric observations in the 12CO ( 2-1 ) line and at 1.3 mm dust continuum of the low-mass protostellar binary system in the cometary globule CG30 , using the Submillimeter Array .	The dust continuum images resolve two compact sources ( CG30N and CG30S ) , with a linear separation of ~8700 AU and total gas masses of ~1.4 and ~0.6 M_sun , respectively .	The two outflows are nearly perpendicular to each other , showing a quadrupolar morphology .	The northern bipolar outflow extends along the southeast ( redshifted , with a velocity up to ~23 km/s ) and northwest ( blueshifted , velocity up to ~30 km/s ) directions , while the southern pair has an orientation from southwest ( blueshifted , velocity up to 13 km/s ) to northeast ( redshifted , velocity up to ~41 km/s ) .
3	We present then different approaches to solve partial differential equations , first limiting ourselves to the one-dimensional case , with one or several domains .	Equations arising in General Relativity are usually too complicated to be solved analytically and one has to rely on numerical methods to solve sets of coupled partial differential equations .	Among the possible choices , this paper focuses on a class called spectral methods where , typically , the various functions are expanded onto sets of orthogonal polynomials or functions .	A theoretical introduction on spectral expansion is first given and a particular emphasis is put on the fast convergence of the spectral approximation .	Generalization to more dimensions is then discussed .
1	In the proof , we used an erroneous closed-form expression of $ \alpha \sigma^2 $ for the genie-aided Cram\ ' { e } r-Rao bound $ \sigma^2 \textrm { Tr } ( \mathbf { A } ^*_\mathcal { I } \mathbf { A } _\mathcal { I } ) ^ { -1 } $ from Lemma 3.5 , which appears in Eqs . ( 20 ) and ( 29 ) .	In [ 1 ] , we proved the asymptotic achievability of the Cram\ ' { e } r-Rao bound in the compressive sensing setting in the linear sparsity regime .	The proof , however , holds if one avoids replacing $ \sigma^2 \textrm { Tr } ( \mathbf { A } ^*_\mathcal { I } \mathbf { A } _\mathcal { I } ) ^ { -1 } $ by the expression of Lemma 3.5 , and hence the claim of the Main Theorem stands true .	In Chapter 2 of the Ph .	D. dissertation by Behtash Babadi [ 2 ] , this error was fixed and a more detailed proof in the non-asymptotic regime was presented .
4	We also find that , although the deexcitation of the primary fragments should , in principle , blur these odd-even effects as the fragments follow their decay chains , the consistent treatment of pairing may significantly enhance these staggering effects on the final yields .	The fragmentation of thermalized sources is studied using a version of the Statistical Multifragmentation Model which employs state densities that take the pairing gap in the nuclear levels into account .	Attention is focused on the properties of the charge distributions observed in the breakup of the source .	Since the microcanonical version of the model used in this study provides the primary fragment excitation energy distribution , one may correlate the reduction of the odd-even staggering in the charge distribution with the increasing occupation of high energy states .	Thus , in the frame- work of this model , such staggering tends to disappear as a function of the total excitation energy of the source , although the energy per particle may be small for large systems .
0	High-resolution accelerometer and laser gyroscope measurements were performed in the vicinity of spinning rings at cryogenic temperatures .	After passing a critical temperature , which does not coincide with the material 's superconducting temperature , the angular acceleration and angular velocity applied to the rotating ring could be seen on the sensors although they are mechanically de-coupled .	A parity violation was observed for the laser gyroscope measurements such that the effect was greatly pronounced in the clockwise-direction only .	The experiments seem to compare well with recent independent tests obtained by the Canterbury Ring Laser Group and the Gravity-Probe B satellite .	All systematic effects analyzed so far are at least 3 orders of magnitude below the observed phenomenon .
2	The compound for x = 0.5 is identified as the one with the highest conductivity ( { \sigma } ~ 678 S/cm ) and lowest activation energy for polaron conductivity ( Ep = 39 meV ) .	The conductivity of the electron hole and polaron conductor La1-xSrxFe0.75Ni0.25O3- { \delta } , a potential cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells , was studied for 0 & lt ; x & lt ; 1 and for temperatures 300 K & lt ; T & lt ; 1250 K. In LaSrFe-oxide , an ABO3 type perovskite , A-site substitu-tion of the trivalent La3+ by the divalent Sr2+ causes oxidation of Fe3+ towards Fe4+ , which forms conducting electron holes .	Here we have in addition a B-site substitution by Ni .	The evolution of the electronic structure was monitored by soft x-ray Fe and oxygen K-edge spectroscopy .	Homogeneous trend for the oxida-tion state of the Fe was observed .
4	We also discuss the phase-space occupancy and entropy per particle .	The space-averaged phase-space density and entropy per particle are both fundamental observables which can be extracted from the two-particle correlation functions measured in heavy-ion collisions .	Two techniques have been proposed to extract the densities from correlation data : either by using the radius parameters from Gaussian fits to meson correlations or by using source imaging , which may be applied to any like pair correlation .	We show that the imaging and Gaussian fits give the same result in the case of meson interferometry .	We discuss the concept of an equivalent instantaneous source on which both techniques rely .
3	Percolation cluster includes spins with given energy .	In this paper we consider an approach , which allows researching a processes of order-disorder transition in various systems ( with any distribution of the exchange integrals signs ) in the frame of Ising model .	A new order parameters , which can give a description of a phase transitions , are found .	The common definition of these order parameters is the mean value of percolation cluster size .	The transition from absolute disorder to correlated phase could be studied with using of percolation theory methods .
2	Such changes in radius have been indirectly probed by the measurements of the changes in the time lag between the near-IR and UV/optical light variation .	The near-IR emission in Type 1 AGNs is thought to be dominated by the thermal radiation from dust grains that are heated by the central engine in the UV/optical and are almost at the sublimation temperature .	A brightening of the central source can thus further sublimate the innermost dust , leading to an increase in the radius of the near-IR emitting region .	Here we report direct evidence for such a receding sublimation region through the near-IR interferometry of the brightest Type 1 AGN in NGC4151 .	The increase in radius follows a significant brightening of the central engine with a delay of at least a few years , which is thus the implied destruction timescale of the innermost dust distribution .
4	This situation can be circumvented by adding traceless on-brane matter on the negative tension brane .	As a follow-up to our previous paper arxiv : 1309.4244 [ hep-th ] , we determine radion induced spherically symmetric solution using the gradient approximation scheme , when two warped $ 3 $ -branes are slant with respect to each other such that the radion field in this case is a radial co-ordinate varying function .	The slanting between the branes is assumed to be small .	In the absence of any on-brane matter except that induced effects of radion field , the resulting black hole is found to be extremal Reissner-Nordstrom whose mass is proportional to the slanting between the $ 3 $ -branes .	It is however seen that the inter-brane separation diminishes to zero for a particular value of radial co-ordinate which can be mimicked as intersection of the branes .
0	Just as $ ^3\roarrow { \rm He } $ can be approximately characterized as a polarized neutron target , polarized \Li6D has been advocated as a good { \em isoscalar } nuclear target for the extraction of the polarized gluon content of the nucleon .	The original argument rests upon a presumed `` alpha + deuteron '' picture of \Li6 , with the polarization of the nucleus carried by the polarization of the deuteron .	We have calculated the polarization of the constituents of \Li6 as a three-body bound state of $ \alpha + n + p $ interacting with local potentials fitted to the scattering data .	It is necessary to include partial waves up to $ j=17/2 $ ( 75 channels , or , when including the $ T=1 $ state , 150 channels ) in the Faddeev equations before the energy eigenvalue converges .	The longitudinal formfactors are then described well by the wave function .
4	Using the distributions of EWs of single-species features , we derive the distribution of column densities by a curve of growth ( CoG ) fit .	The extreme brightness of gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) afterglows and their simple spectral shape make them ideal beacons to study the interstellar medium of their host galaxies through absorption line spectroscopy .	Using 69 low-resolution GRB afterglow spectra , we conduct a study of the rest-frame equivalent width ( EW ) distribution of features with an average rest-frame EW larger than 0.5 A .	To compare an individual GRB with the sample , we develop EW diagrams as a graphical tool , and we give a catalogue with diagrams for the 69 spectra .	We introduce a line strength parameter ( LSP ) that allows us to quantify the strength of the absorption features as compared to the sample by a single number .
4	Conjecturally these two structures coincide with each other .	We introduce BV-algebra structures on the homology of the space of framed long knots in $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ in two ways .	The first one is given in a similar fashion to Chas-Sullivan 's string topology .	The second one is defined on the Hochschild homology associated with a cyclic , multiplicative operad of graded modules .	The latter can be applied to Bousfield-Salvatore spectral sequence converging to the homology of the space of framed long knots .
3	The superlattice show both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric transitions which is an evidence for the coexistence of both the properties .	Superlattices composed of ferromagnetic Pr0.85Ca0.15MnO3 and ferroelectric Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 layers were fabricated on ( 100 ) SrTiO3 substrates by a pulsed-laser deposition method .	The capacitance and resistive parts of the samples were analyzed from the complex impedance measurements , performed on the samples using a special experimental set-up .	The superlattice with larger ferroelectric thickness shows unique characteristics which are not present in the parent ferromagnetic thin film .	The high magnetoresistance ( 40 % at 80K ) shown by the superlattice can be attributed to the coupling between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric layers , i.e , to the magnetoelectric effect .
1	Its limitations in terms of flight path differences have already been investigated analytically for neutron beams with vanishing divergence .	The MIEZE ( Modulation of Intensity with Zero Effort ) technique is a variant of neutron resonance spin echo ( NRSE ) , which has proven to be a unique neutron scattering technique for measuring with high energy resolution in magnetic fields .	In the present work Monte-Carlo simulations for quasi-elastic MIEZE experiments taking into account beam divergence as well as the sample dimensions are presented .	One application of the MIEZE technique could be a dedicated NRSE-MIEZE instrument at the European Spallation Source ( ESS ) in Sweden .	The optimisation of a particular design based on Montel mirror optics with the help of Monte Carlo simulations will be discussed here in detail .
3	This is supported by numerical experiments .	We consider the effect of rain on wind wave generation and dissipation .	Rain falling on a wavy surface may have a marked tendency to dampen the shorter waves in the tail of the spectrum , the related range increasing with the rain rate .	Following the coupling between meteorological and wave models , we derive that on the whole this should imply stronger wind and higher waves in the most energetic part of the spectrum .	However , a verification based on the comparison between operational model results and measured data suggests that the opposite is true .
0	The competition between spin glass ( $ SG $ ) and antiferromagnetic order ( $ AF $ ) is analyzed in two sublattice fermionic Ising models in the presence of a transverse $ \Gamma $ and a parallel $ H $ magnetic fields .	The exchange interaction follows a Gaussian probability distribution with mean $ -4J_0/N $ and standard deviation $ J\sqrt { 32/N } $ , but only spins in different sublattices can interact .	The problem is formulated in a path integral formalism , where the spin operators have been expressed as bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields .	The results of two fermionic models are compared .	In the first one , the diagonal $ S^z $ operator has four states , where two eigenvalues vanish ( 4S model ) , which are suppressed by a restriction in the two states 2S model .
0	In this paper we are concerned with singular points of solutions to the { \it unstable } free boundary problem $ $ \Delta u = - \chi_ { \ { u & gt ; 0\ } } \qquad \hbox { in } B_1 .	$ $ The problem arises in applications such as solid combustion , composite membranes , climatology and fluid dynamics .	It is known that solutions to the above problem may exhibit singularities - that is points at which the second derivatives of the solution are unbounded - as well as degenerate points .	This causes breakdown of by-now classical techniques .	Here we introduce new ideas based on Fourier expansion of the nonlinearity $ \chi_ { \ { u & gt ; 0\ } } $ .
3	We demonstrate that the so claimed `` rigorous data selection criteria '' used by Schuermann et al .	We address a conflicting report on the value and uncertainty of the astrophysical cross section factor of the 12C ( a , g ) reaction extracted from existing data .	In sharp contrast to previously reported ambiguities ( by up to a factor 8 ) , Schuermann et al .	suggest an accuracy of 12 % .	relies on the s-factors extracted by Assuncao et al .
0	We consider equatorial motion of particles in the ergoregion of generic axially symmetric rotating black holes .	We introduce the notion of zero energy observers ( ZEOs ) as counterparts to known zero angular observers ( ZAMOs ) .	It is shown that the trajectory of a ZEO has precisely one turning point that lies on the boundary for photons and inside the ergoregion for massive particles .	As a consequence , such trajectories enter the ergosphere from the region under horizon and leave it crossing the horizon again .	The angular velocity of ZEO does not depend on the angular momentum .
1	The set of tools to extract the features that characterise polished surfaces of the granites is mainly based on mathematical morphology .	The purpose of this paper is to present a complete methodology based on a multidisciplinary approach , that goes from the extraction of features till the classification of a set of different portuguese granites .	The classification methodology is based on a genetic algorithm capable of search the input feature space used by the nearest neighbour rule classifier .	Results show that is adequate to perform feature reduction and simultaneous improve the recognition rate .	Moreover , the present methodology represents a robust strategy to understand the proper nature of the images treated , and their discriminant features .
2	Nonlinear asymptotic parameters are introduced softly : they do not destroy the self-optimized local behaviour of the wave function at vanishing interparticle distances .	A new variational basis with well-behaved local approximation properties and multiple output is proposed for Coulomb systems .	The trial function has proper behaviour at all Coulomb centres .	The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian on a finite Hilbert subspace gives a number of meaningful eigenvalues .	Thus together with the ground state some excited states are also reliably approximated .
2	The observation strategy has been carefully designed to provide even sampling on these three basic timescales and to provide a uniform sampling among the quasars We have found clear evidence that the X-ray steep , narrow H_beta , quasars systematically show larger amplitude variations than the X-ray flat broad H_beta quasars on timescales from 2 days to 20 days .	We have studied the variability of 6 low redshift , radio quiet `PG ' quasars on three timescales ( days , weeks , and months ) using the ROSAT HRI .	The quasars were chosen to lie at the two extreme ends of the ROSAT PSPC spectral index distribution and hence of the H $ \beta $ FWHM distribution .	On longer timescales we do not find significant differences between steep and flat quasars , although the statistics are poorer .	We suggest that the above correlation between variability properties and spectral steepness can be explained in a scenario in which the X-ray steep , narrow line objects are in a higher L/L_Edd state with respect to the X-ray flat , broad line objects .
2	Our case study is the two-loop amplitude for H - & gt ; gamma gamma , mediated by an infinitely heavy top loop , in the presence of gluonic corrections .	In this paper we illustrate the simplifications produced by FDR in NNLO computations .	We show with an explicit example that - due to its four-dimensionality - FDR does not require an order-by-order renormalization and that , unlike the one-loop case , FDR and dimensional regularization ( DR ) generate intermediate two-loop results which are no longer linked by a simple subtraction of the ultraviolet ( UV ) poles in epsilon .	We use this to elucidate how gauge invariance is preserved with no need of introducing counterterms in the Lagrangian .	In addition , we discuss a possible four-dimensional approach to the infrared ( IR ) problem compatible with the FDR treatment of the UV infinities .
3	To achieve this we employed mid-IR selection criteria to identity dusty evolved massive stars in two nearby galaxies .	The role of episodic mass loss in massive star evolution is one of the most important open questions of current stellar evolution theory .	Episodic mass loss produces dust and therefore causes evolved massive stars to be very luminous in the mid-infrared and dim at optical wavelengths .	We aim to increase the number of investigated luminous mid-IR sources to shed light on the late stages of these objects .	The method is based on mid-IR colors , using 3.6 { \mu } m and 4.5 { \mu } m photometry from archival Spitzer Space Telescope images of nearby galaxies and J-band photometry from 2MASS .
2	However , the apparently oracular powers expressed in the LEM , that for any proposition P either it or its negation , not P , is true can also be explained in terms of constructive evidence that does not refer to `` oracles for truth . ''	This article presents a computational semantics for classical logic using constructive type theory .	Such semantics seems impossible because classical logic allows the Law of Excluded Middle ( LEM ) , not accepted in constructive logic since it does not have computational meaning .	Types with virtual evidence and the constructive impossibility of negative evidence provide sufficient semantic grounds for classical truth and have a simple computational meaning .	This idea is formalized using refinement types , a concept of constructive type theory used since 1984 and explained here .
4	Using the hierarchical Normal-Gamma representation of the Student 's t-distribution , the Van Trees ' Bayesian Cram\ ' { e } r-Rao bounds ( BCRBs ) on the amplitude parameters and the noise hyper-parameter are derived .	Robust estimation is an important and timely research subject .	In this paper , we investigate performance lower bounds on the mean-square-error ( MSE ) of any estimator for the Bayesian linear model , corrupted by a noise distributed according to an i.i.d .	Student 's t-distribution .	This class of prior parametrized by its degree of freedom is relevant to modelize either dense or sparse ( accounting for outliers ) noise .
2	The quantronium is a Bloch transistor with two small junctions in series , defining an island , in parallel with a larger junction .	Bloch oscillations predicted to occur in current-biased single Josephson junctions have eluded direct observation up to now .	Here , we demonstrate similar Bloch oscillations in a slightly richer Josephson circuit , the quantronium .	In the ground state , the microwave impedance of the device is modulated periodically with the charge on the gate capacitor coupled to the transistor island .	When a current flows across this capacitor , the impedance modulation occurs at the Bloch frequency , which yields Bloch sidebands in the spectrum of a reflected continuous microwave signal .
4	Next , we build a model for predicting a successful introduction of clinical pharmacy to the clinical departments .	The survey data sets are important sources of data and their successful exploitation is of key importance for informed policy-decision making .	We present how a survey analysis approach initially developed for customer satisfaction research in marketing can be adapted for the introduction of clinical pharmacy services into hospital .	We use two analytical approaches to extract relevant managerial consequences .	With OrdEval algorithm we first evaluate the importance of competences for the users of clinical pharmacy and extract their nature according to the users expectations .
1	The case $ \Gamma =\Z_k $ has also been studied , from the algebraic point of view by V.Kac \cite { VK } and from the point of view of the differential geometry by Ledger , Obata , Kowalski or Wolf - Gray in terms of $ k $ -symmetric spaces .	The notion of a $ \Gamma $ -symmetric space is a generalization of the classical notion of a symmetric space , where a general finite abelian group $ \Gamma $ replaces the group $ Z_2 $ .	In this case , a $ k $ -manifold is an homogeneous reductive space and the classification of these varieties is given by the corresponding classification of graded Lie algebras .	The general notion of a $ \Gamma $ -symmetric space was introduced by R.Lutz .	We approach the classification of such spaces in the case $ \Gamma=Z_2^2 $ using recent results on the classification of complex $ Z_2^2 $ -graded simple Lie algebras .
3	We show , that the formation of certain types of order do not only depend on the thermodynamic phase diagrams as in bulk samples , but that the kinetic control may contribute to the phase formation in thin films .	Type , degree and evolution of structural order are important aspects for understanding and controlling the properties of highly spin polarized Heusler compounds , in particular with respect to the optimal film growth procedure .	In this work , we compare the structural order and the local magnetic properties revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy with the macroscopic properties of thin Co $ _2 $ FeAl $ _ { 0.5 } $ Si $ _ { 0.5 } $ Heusler films with varying thickness .	A detailed analysis of the measured NMR spectra presented in this paper enables us to find a very high degree of $ L2_1 $ type ordering up to 81 % concomitantly with excess Fe of 8 to 13 % at the expense of Al and Si .	It is an exciting finding that Co $ _2 $ FeAl $ _ { 0.5 } $ Si $ _ { 0.5 } $ can form an almost ideal $ L2_1 $ structure in films though with a considerable amount of Fe-Al/Si off-stoichiometry .
0	The CoRoT satellite exoplanetary team announces its sixth transiting planet in this paper .	We describe and discuss the satellite observations as well as the complementary ground-based observations - photometric and spectroscopic - carried out to assess the planetary nature of the object and determine its specific physical parameters .	The discovery reported here is a `hot Jupiter ' planet in an 8.9d orbit , 18 stellar radii , or 0.08 AU , away from its primary star , which is a solar-type star ( F9V ) with an estimated age of 3.0 Gyr .	The planet mass is close to 3 times that of Jupiter .	The star has a metallicity of 0.2 dex lower than the Sun , and a relatively high $ ^7 $ Li abundance .
3	The conjecture for arbitrary finitely generated group has its own importance to analyse potential counter-examples to the original conjecture .	The Andrews-Curtis conjecture asserts that , for a free group $ F_n $ of rank $ n $ and a free basis $ ( x_1 , ... , x_n ) $ , any normally generating tuple $ ( y_1 , ... , y_n ) $ is Andrews-Curtis equivalent to $ ( x_1 , ... , x_n ) $ .	This equivalence corresponds to the actions of $ \operatorname { Aut } F_n $ and of $ F_n $ on normally generating $ n $ -tuples .	The equivalence corresponding to the action of $ \operatorname { Aut } F_n $ on generating $ n $ -tuples is called Nielsen equivalence .	We study the Andrews-Curtis and Nielsen equivalence in the class of finitely generated groups for which every maximal subgroup is normal , including nilpotent groups and Grigorchuk groups .
0	Circumstellar debris disks older than a few Myr should be largely devoid of primordial gas remaining from the protoplanetary disk phase .	Tracing the origin of observed atomic gas in Keplerian rotation in the edge-on debris disk surrounding the ~12 Myr old star { \beta } Pictoris requires more detailed information about its spatial distribution than has previously been acquired by limited slit spectroscopy .	Especially indications of asymmetries and presence of Ca II gas at high disk latitudes call for additional investigation .	We set out to recover a complete image of the Fe I and Ca II gas emission around { \beta } Pic by spatially resolved , high-resolution spectroscopic observations to better understand the morphology and origin of the gaseous disk component .	The multiple fiber facility FLAMES/GIRAFFE at the VLT , with the large IFU ARGUS , was used to obtain spatially resolved optical spectra in four regions covering the northeast and southwest side of the disk .
4	Moreover , we have access to the full spectrum , which is reminiscent of linear confinement .	We consider the interplay between explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking in strongly coupled field theories .	Some well-known statements , such as the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation , descend directly from the Ward identities and have thus a general relevance .	Such Ward identities are recovered in gauge/gravity dual setups through holographic renormalization .	In a simple paradigmatic three dimensional toy-model , we find analytic expressions for the two-point correlators which match all the quantum field theoretical expectations .
4	With this `Laplace approximation ' all that is needed to compute the expected evidence is the Fisher matrix itself .	The Fisher matrix approach ( Fisher 1935 ) allows one to calculate in advance how well a given experiment will be able to estimate model parameters , and has been an invaluable tool in experimental design .	In the same spirit , we present here a method to predict how well a given experiment can distinguish between different models , regardless of their parameters .	From a Bayesian viewpoint , this involves computation of the Bayesian evidence .	In this paper , we generalise the Fisher matrix approach from the context of parameter fitting to that of model testing , and show how the expected evidence can be computed under the same simplifying assumption of a gaussian likelihood as the Fisher matrix approach for parameter estimation .
0	The multicolor Ramsey number $ r_k ( F ) $ of a graph $ F $ is the least integer $ n $ such that in every coloring of the edges of $ K_n $ by $ k $ colors there is a monochromatic copy of $ F $ .	In this short note we prove an upper bound on $ r_k ( F ) $ for a graph $ F $ with $ m $ edges and no isolated vertices of the form $ k^ { 6km^ { 2/3 } } $ addressing a question of Sudakov [ Adv.Math .	227 ( 2011 ) , no.1 , 601 -- 609 ] .	Furthermore , the constant in the exponent in the case of bipartite $ F $ and two colors is lowered so that $ r_2 ( F ) \le 2^ { ( 1+o ( 1 ) ) 2\sqrt { 2m } } $ improving the result of Alon , Krivelevich and Sudakov [ Combin.Probab.Comput.12 ( 2003 ) , no .	5 -- 6 , 477 -- 494 ] .
3	In the transparent spectral region ( the first and second laser harmonics ) of the heavy metal azide matrix the effect of covering the sample surface with a plate on initiation energy threshold was insignificant , whereas , in the region of bandgap absorption ( the fourth harmonic ) strong dependence of the initiation threshold on whether the surface under irradiation is uncovered or covered .	The behavior of silver and lead azides ( scaly and threadlike crystals , and compacted powders ) in initiation of explosive decomposition by laser pulsed radiation has been investigated .	Initiation energy thresholds in irradiation at wavelengths of 1064 nm , 532 nm , 354.7 nm , 266 nm corresponding to four laser radiation harmonics have been measured .	Samples both uncovered and covered with a transparent dielectric ( a quartz plate ) with the compressive force of up to 0.5GPa were initiated .	The results obtained have been considered with the account of the influence of the transparent plate on gas-dynamic unloading of the thermal site , which is formed in the bandgap absorption of laser radiation in a thin near-surface layer .
2	Experimental results are discussed in terms of different quantum markers , as teleportation fidelity , quantum discord and mutual information , and continuous variables ( CV ) entanglement criteria .	Quantum properties are soon subject to decoherence once the quantum system interacts with the classical environment .	In this paper we experimentally test how propagation losses , in a Gaussian channel , affect the bi-partite Gaussian entangled state generated by a sub-threshold type-II optical parametric oscillator ( OPO ) .	To analyse state properties we have retrieved the composite system covariance matrix by a single homodyne detector .	We experimentally found that , even in presence of a strong decoherence , the generated state never disentangles and keeps breaking the quantum limit for the discord .
1	We present a graph representation which allows for a clear understanding of modern monetary systems .	The nature of monetary arrangements is often discussed without any reference to its detailed construction .	First , we show that systems based on commodity money are incompatible with credit .	We then study the current chartalist systems based on pure fiat money , and we discuss the consolidation of the central bank with the Treasury .	We obtain a visual explanation about how commercial banks are responsible for endogenous money creation whereas the Treasury and the central bank are in charge of the total amount of net money .
3	Metastable de Sitter vacua behave differently depending on the uplifting mechanism .	We study the non-perturbative stability of the Large Volume Scenario ( LVS ) of IIB string compactifications , by analysing transitions mediated by the Brown-Teitelboim ( BT ) brane nucleations and by Coleman De Luccia tunneling ( CDL ) .	We find that , as long as the effective field theory description holds , the LVS AdS minima are stable despite being non-supersymmetric .	This opens the possibility of having a CFT dual .	We find explicit expressions for the different decay rates in terms of exponentials of the volume .
4	We show that this is not necessarily the case .	We introduce the new concept of binary particle as the basic matter unit that participates in weak interactions and not any one fermion singly .	We state the quantum numbers of this binary particle , and show the concept leads us to a natural explanation of the standard model puzzle of the origin of flavor mixing and the CKM matrix .	Certain other puzzles of the standard model such as the absence of flavor changing neutral currents ( FCNC ) , are also explained naturally by the binary particle model .	These puzzles are currently thought to be esoteric properties of electro weak interactions that have origins in physics beyond the standard model at some ultra high energy scales .
2	Conventional design requires exactly the same number of base functions as given data , and the result is not robust against outliers .	In this paper , we propose control theoretic smoothing splines with L1 optimality for reducing the number of parameters that describes the fitted curve as well as removing outlier data .	A control theoretic spline is a smoothing spline that is generated as an output of a given linear dynamical system .	To solve these problems , we propose to use L1 optimality , that is , we use the L1 norm for the regularization term and/or the empirical risk term .	The optimization is described by a convex optimization , which can be efficiently solved via a numerical optimization software .
1	In the metallic state above T_c the standard Landau 's Fermi-liquid theory of metals as typified by the temperature squared ( T^2 ) dependence of resistivity appears to break down .	In high transition temperature ( T_c ) superconductivity , charge doping is a natural tuning parameter that takes copper oxides from the antiferromagnet to the superconducting region .	Whether the origin of the non-Fermi-liquid behavior is related to physics specific to the cuprates is a fundamental question still under debate .	We uncover a new transformation from the non-Fermi- to a standard Fermi-liquid state driven not by doping but by magnetic field in the overdoped high-T_c superconductor Tl_2Ba_2CuO_ { 6+x } .	From the c-axis resistivity measured up to 45 T , we show that the Fermi-liquid features appear above a sufficiently high field which decreases linearly with temperature and lands at a quantum critical point near the superconductivity 's upper critical field -- with the Fermi-liquid coefficient of the T^2 dependence showing a power-law diverging behavior on the approach to the critical point .
2	In this paper , we revisit the issue by re-simulating a Milky Way class dark matter ( DM ) halo with unprecedented resolution .	Surprisingly little is known about the origin and evolution of the Milky Way 's satellite galaxy companions .	UV photoionisation , supernova feedback and interactions with the larger host halo are all thought to play a role in shaping the population of satellites that we observe today , but there is still no consensus as to which of these effects , if any , dominates .	Our set of cosmological hydrodynamic Adaptive Mesh Refinement ( AMR ) simulations , called the Nut suite , allows us to investigate the effect of supernova feedback and UV photoionisation at high redshift with sub-parsec resolution .	We subsequently follow the effect of interactions with the Milky Way-like halo using a lower spatial resolution ( 50pc ) version of the simulation down to z=0 .
1	We show that the gamma-ray albedo for the Main Belt , Trojans , and Kuiper Belt strongly depends on the small-body size distribution of each system .	We calculate the gamma-ray albedo flux from cosmic-ray ( CR ) interactions with the solid rock and ice in Main Belt asteroids ( MBAs ) , Jovian and Neptunian Trojan asteroids , and Kuiper Belt objects ( KBOs ) using the Moon as a template .	Based on an analysis of the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope ( EGRET ) data we infer that the diffuse emission from the MBAs , Trojans , and KBOs has an integrated flux of less than ~6x10^ { -6 } cm^ { -2 } s^ { -1 } ( 100-500 MeV ) , which corresponds to ~12 times the Lunar albedo , and may be detectable by the forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) .	If detected by GLAST , it can provide unique direct information about the number of small bodies in each system that is difficult to assess by any other method .	Additionally , the KBO albedo flux can be used to probe the spectrum of CR nuclei at close-to-interstellar conditions .
2	Leicht and R.M .	Robustness of network of networks ( NON ) has been studied only for dependency coupling ( J.X.Gao et .	al. , Nature Physics , 2012 ) and only for connectivity coupling ( E.A .	D Souza , arxiv:0907.0894 ) .	The case of network of n networks with both interdependent and interconnected links is more complicated , and also more closely to real-life coupled network systems .
3	This model structure is obtained by Bousfield localizing a model structure which is left determined with respect to a class of maps which is not the class of monomorphisms .	We proved in a previous work that Cattani-Sassone 's higher dimensional transition systems can be interpreted as a small-orthogonality class of a topological locally finitely presentable category of weak higher dimensional transition systems .	In this paper , we turn our attention to the full subcategory of weak higher dimensional transition systems which are unions of cubes .	It is proved that there exists a left proper combinatorial model structure such that two objects are weakly equivalent if and only if they have the same cubes after simplification of the labelling .	We prove that the higher dimensional transition systems corresponding to two process algebras are weakly equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic .
4	On the contrary , for positive $ \lambda $ , positions and areas are quantized .	The Snyder model is an example of noncommutative spacetime admitting a fundamental length scale $ \beta $ and invariant under Lorentz transformations , that can be interpreted as a realization of the doubly special relativity axioms .	Here , we consider its nonrelativistic counterpart , i.e.the Snyder model restricted to three-dimensional Euclidean space .	We discuss the classical and the quantum mechanics of a free particle in this framework , and show that they strongly depend on the sign of a coupling constant $ \lambda $ , appearing in the fundamental commutators and proportional to $ \beta^2 $ .	For example , if $ \lambda $ is negative , momenta are bounded .
0	The paper describes aHUGIN , a tool for creating adaptive systems .	aHUGIN is an extension of the HUGIN shell , and is based on the methods reported by Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen ( 1990a ) .	The adaptive systems resulting from aHUGIN are able to adjust the C011ditional probabilities in the model .	A short analysis of the adaptation task is given and the features of aHUGIN are described .	Finally a session with experiments is reported and the results are discussed .
2	Binary descriptors have recently gained more attention as a potential vehicle to achieve these goals .	In recent years , advances in medical imaging have led to the emergence of massive databases , containing images from a diverse range of modalities .	This has significantly heightened the need for automated annotation of the images on one side , and fast and memory-efficient content-based image retrieval systems on the other side .	One of the recently introduced binary descriptors for tagging of medical images are Radon barcodes ( RBCs ) that are driven from Radon transform via local thresholding .	Gabor transform is also a powerful transform to extract texture-based information .
4	From this , the possibility to control quantum fermionic dynamics by means of Feshbach resonances is suggested .	We study the exact dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-polarized gas of fermions in a double-well potential at zero and finite temperature .	Despite the system is made of non-interacting fermions , its dynamics can be quite complex , showing strongly aperiodic spatio-temporal patterns during the tunneling .	The extension of these results to the case of mixtures of spin-polarized fermions in interaction with self-trapped Bose-Einstein condensates ( BECs ) at zero temperature is considered as well .	In this case we show that the fermionic dynamics remains qualitatively similar to the one observed in absence of BEC but with the Rabi frequencies of fermionic excited states explicitly depending on the number of bosons and on the boson-fermion interaction strength .
2	The software lens model translation tool , HydraLens , was used to generate multiple models for four strong lens systems including COSMOS J095930+023427 , SDSS J1320+1644 , SDSSJ1430+4105 and J1000+0021 .	Analysis of strong gravitational lensing data is important in this era of precision cosmology .	The objective of the present study is to directly compare the analysis of strong gravitational lens systems using different lens model software and similarly parameterized models to understand the differences and limitations of the resulting models .	All four lens systems were modeled with PixeLens , Lenstool , glafic , and Lensmodel .	The input data and parameterization of each lens model was similar for the four model programs used to highlight differences in the output results .
2	In the formalism used in this study , while the interactions between matter and radiation are introduced in the comoving frame , the equations and the equations and the derivatives for the description of the global evolution of both matter and the radiation are given in the Kerr-Schild frame ( KSF ) which is a frame fixed to the coordinate describing the central black hole .	Equations of fully general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics around a rotating black hole are derived by using the Kerr-Schild coordinate where there is no coordinate singularity at the event horizon .	Since the radiation interacts with matter moving with relativistic velocities near the event horizon , the interplay between the radiation and the matter should be described fully relativistically .	As a frame fixed to the coordinate , we use the locally non-rotating reference frame ( LNRF ) representing a radially falling frame when the Kerr-Schild coordinate is used .	Around the rotating black hole , both the matter and the radiation are affected by the frame-dragging effects .
2	If magnetic field is smaller compared to the critical value , determined by frictional anisotropy , the relaxation of the correlation is non-oscillating in time .	We study the motion of charged Brownian particles in an external magnetic field .	It is found that a correlation appears between the components of particle velocity in the case of anisotropic friction , approaching asymptotically zero in the stationary limit .	However , in a larger magnetic field this relaxation becomes oscillating .	The phenomenon is related to the statistical dependence of the components of transformed random force caused by the simultaneous influence of magnetic field and anisotropic dissipation .
0	In principle , the MID-infrared Interferometric instrument ( MIDI ) at the Very Large Telescope Array ( VLTI ) should always measure the same calibrated total flux spectrum for a specific source , independent of the instrument settings and the baseline geometry .	In the data on the Circinus galaxy , however , there is ( a ) a general offset of the flux values for 2009 and ( b ) a slow drift of the total fluxes at short wavelengths during two nights ( 2008-04-17 and 2009-04-14 ) .	The latter seems to depend on the hour angle of the observation .	In this document , a more detailed analysis of these two effects is carried out and summarised .	The goal is to find an explanation for these variations in the photometry .
0	The exact computation of the number of distinct elements ( frequency moment $ F_0 $ ) is a fundamental problem in the study of data streaming algorithms .	We denote the length of the stream by $ n $ where each symbol is drawn from a universe of size $ m $ .	While it is well known that the moments $ F_0 , F_1 , F_2 $ can be approximated by efficient streaming algorithms , it is easy to see that exact computation of $ F_0 , F_2 $ requires space $ \Omega ( m ) $ .	In previous work , Cormode et al .	therefore considered a model where the data stream is also processed by a powerful helper , who provides an interactive proof of the result .
4	Unlike result established in Zhu and Marcotte ( 2000 ) , our continuity proof is constructed without assuming a priori uniform boundedness of the path flows .	This paper is concerned with a dynamic traffic network performance model , known as dynamic network loading ( DNL ) , that is frequently employed in the modeling and computation of analytical dynamic user equilibrium ( DUE ) .	As a key component of continuous-time DUE models , DNL aims at describing and predicting the spatial-temporal evolution of traffic flows on a network that is consistent with established route and departure time choices of travelers , by introducing appropriate dynamics to flow propagation , flow conservation , and travel delays .	The DNL procedure gives rise to the path delay operator , which associates a vector of path flows ( path departure rates ) with the corresponding path travel costs .	In this paper , we establish strong continuity of the path delay operator for networks whose arc flows are described by the link delay model ( Friesz et al. , 1993 ) .
1	It was found that to account for cosmological observations , the masses of the first Kaluza-Klein modes ( and thus the approximate size of the extra dimension ) should be in the range 600-1200 GeV when the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle ( LKP ) corresponds to the hypercharge boson and in the range 1 - 1.8 TeV when it corresponds to a neutrino .	Recently a new dark matter candidate has been proposed as a consequence of universal compact extra dimensions .	In this article , we compute the elastic scattering cross sections between Kaluza-Klein dark matter and nuclei both when the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle is a KK mode of a weak gauge boson , and when it is a neutrino .	We include nuclear form factor effects which are important to take into account due to the large LKP masses favored by estimates of the relic density .	We present both differential and integrated rates for present and proposed Germanium , NaI and Xenon detectors .
2	It has been found that minor phase of columbite NiNb2O6 tended to form together with the desired Ni4Nb2O9 phase , depending on sintering conditions .	The potential utilization of two-stage sintering for the production of highly dense and pure nickel diniobate ( Ni4Nb2O9 ) ceramics with low firing temperature was demonstrated .	Effects of designed sintering conditions on phase formation , densification and microstructure of the ceramics were characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , Archimedes method and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , respectively .	The optimization of sintering conditions could lead to a single-phase Ni4Nb2O9 ceramics with orthorhombic structure .	The ceramics doubly sintered at 950/1250 { \deg } C for 4 h exhibited maximum density value of 92 % .
0	We present a generalization of standard Turing machines based on allowing unusual tapes .	We present a set of reasonable constraints on tape geometry and classify all tapes conforming to these constraints .	Surprisingly , this generalization does not lead to yet another equivalent formulation of the notion of computable function .	Rather , it gives an alternative definition of the recursively enumerable Turing degrees that does not rely on oracles .	The definitions give rise to a number of questions about computable paths inside Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups , and several of these questions are answered .
2	The spectra are of extremely high quality , with typical S/N of 1000/A , and a wavelength coverage of 4000A-8800A .	The stellar populations of galaxies hold vital clues to their formation histories .	In this paper we present results based on modeling stacked spectra of early-type galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) as a function of velocity dispersion , sigma , from 90 km/s to 300 km/s .	Our population synthesis model includes variation in 16 elements from C to Ba , the shift in effective temperature , Delta ( Teff ) , of the stars with respect to a solar metallicity isochrone , amongst other parameters .	In our approach we fit the full optical spectra rather than a select number of spectral indices and are able to , for the first time , measure the abundances of the elements V , Cr , Mn , Co , and Ni from the integrated light of distant galaxies .
2	In this paper we combine radio data with new ROSAT HRI data to show that conditions in its inner core , less than 50 kpc , are complex and interesting .	The cluster Abell 2199 is one of the prototypical `` cooling flow '' clusters .	Its central cD galaxy is host to a steep-spectrum radio source , of the type associated with cooling cores .	Energy and momentum flux from the radio jet have been significant in the dynamics of the gas in the core .	In addition , the Faraday data detects a dynamically important magnetic field there .
3	The other set ( the `` damped modes '' ) retains a finite decay rate even for extremal Kerr black holes , and exists only for a subset of corotating modes .	We provide an in-depth investigation of quasinormal-mode oscillations of Kerr black holes with nearly extremal angular momenta .	We first discuss in greater detail the two distinct types of quasinormal mode frequencies presented in a recent paper ( arXiv:1212.3271 ) .	One set of modes , that we call `` zero-damping modes '' , has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit , and exists for all corotating perturbations ( i.e. , modes with azimuthal index m being nonnegative ) .	As the angular momentum approaches its extremal value , the frequency spectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modes are present .
1	This process is determined by four helicity amplitudes , three of which are violating helicity conservation , and another one which respects it and is logarithmically enhanced at high energy .	We analyze the quark-gluon induced process $ u g\to \tilde d\tchi_i^+ $ , including the one loop electroweak ( EW ) effects in the minimal supersymmetric model ( MSSM ) .	Combining this $ u g\to \tilde d\tchi_i^+ $ analysis with a corresponding one for $ u g \to d W^+ $ , we obtain simple approximate relations between the two processes , testing the MSSM structure at the amplitude and the cross section levels .	These relations become exact at asymptotic energies and , provided the SUSY scale is not too heavy , they may be approximately correct at LHC energies also .	In addition to these , we study the 1loop EW corrections to the inclusive $ \tilde d\tchi_i^+ $ production at LHC , presenting as examples , the $ p_T $ and angular distributions .
2	Moreover , we prove that the smearing can be realized by means of a strong Feller Markov kernel if and only if $ F $ is uniformly continuous .	A Positive Operator Valued Measure ( POVM ) is a map $ F : \mathcal { B } ( X ) \to\mathcal { L } _s^+ ( \mathcal { H } ) $ from the Borel $ \sigma $ -algebra of a topological space $ X $ to the space of positive self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space $ \mathcal { H } $ .	We assume $ X $ to be Hausdorff , locally compact and second countable and prove that a POVM $ F $ is commutative if and only if it is the smearing of a spectral measure $ E $ by means of a Feller Markov kernel .	Finally , we prove that a POVM which is absolutely continuous with respect to a finite measure $ \nu $ admits a strong Feller Markov kernel .	That provides a characterization of the smearing which connects a commutative POVM $ F $ to a spectral measure $ E $ and is relevant both from the mathematical and the physical viewpoint since smearings of spectral measures form a large and very relevant subclass of POVMs : they are paradigmatic for the modeling of certain standard forms of noise in quantum measurement ( Busch , Lahti , Werner ) , they provide optimal approximators as marginals in joint measurements of incompatible observables ( Busch , Lahti , Werner ) , they are important for a range of quantum information processing protocols , where classical post-processing plays a role ( Heinosaari , Ziman ) .
1	We provide bounds to the secrecy capacity for various possibilities on receiver feedback and show special cases where the bounds are tight .	We consider a block fading wiretap channel , where a transmitter attempts to send messages securely to a receiver in the presence of a hybrid half-duplex adversary , which arbitrarily decides to either jam or eavesdrop the transmitter-to- receiver channel .	We show that , without any feedback from the receiver , the secrecy capacity is zero if the transmitter-to-adversary channel stochastically dominates the effective transmitter-to-receiver channel .	However , the secrecy capacity is non-zero even when the receiver is allowed to feed back only one bit at the end of each block .	Our novel achievable strategy improves the rates proposed in the literature for the non-hybrid adversarial model .
4	No CP asymmetry is predicted for $ D^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0 $ or $ D^0 \to \ko \ok $ in this framework .	The LHCb Collaboration has recently reported evidence for a CP asymmetry approaching the percent level in the difference between $ D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- $ and $ D^0 \to K^+ K^- $ .	We analyze this effect as if it is due to a penguin amplitude with the weak phase of the standard model $ c \to b \to u $ loop diagram , but with a CP-conserving enhancement as if due to the strong interactions .	In such a case the magnitude and strong phase of this amplitude $ P_b $ are correlated in order to fit the observed CP asymmetry , and one may predict CP asymmetries for a number of other singly-Cabibbo-suppressed decays of charmed mesons to a pair of pseudoscalar mesons .	Non-zero CP asymmetries are expected for $ D^+ \to K^+ \ok $ ( the most promising channel for which a non-zero CP asymmetry has not yet been reported ) , as well as $ D^0 \to \pi^0 \pi^0 $ , $ D_s^+ \to \pi^+ \ko $ , and $ D_s \to \pi^0 K^+ $ .
2	In this work , we propose to assess classifiers in terms of normalized mutual information ( NI ) , which is novel and well defined in a compact range for classifier evaluation .	This correspondence studies the basic problem of classifications - how to evaluate different classifiers .	Although the conventional performance indexes , such as accuracy , are commonly used in classifier selection or evaluation , information-based criteria , such as mutual information , are becoming popular in feature/model selections .	We derive close-form relations of normalized mutual information with respect to accuracy , precision , and recall in binary classifications .	By exploring the relations among them , we reveal that NI is actually a set of nonlinear functions , with a concordant power-exponent form , to each performance index .
1	We performed large-eddy simulation with the sub-grid scale ( LES-SGS ) stretched-vortex model of momentum and scalar transport to study the gas-dynamics interactions of a helium inclined round jet into a supersonic ( $ M=3.6 $ ) turbulent ( \Reth $ =13\times10^3 $ ) air flow over a flat surface .	This short article describes flow parameters , numerical method , and animations of the fluid dynamics video `` LES of an Inclined Jet into a Supersonic Turbulent Crossflow '' ( http : //ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/14073/3/GFM-2009.mpg [ high-resolution ] and http : //ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/14073/2/GFM-2009-web.m1v [ low-resolution ] video ) .	The video shows the temporal development of Mach-number and magnitude of density-gradient in the mid-span plane , and isosurface of helium mass-fraction and $ \lam_2 $ ( vortical structures ) .	The identified vortical structures are sheets , tilted tubes , and discontinuous rings .	The vortical structures are shown to be well correlated in space and time with helium mass-fraction isosurface ( $ Y_ { \rm He } =0.25 $ ) .
2	We point out that the difference between the topological entropies of the attractor and the embedded repeller is for most choices of $ \alpha $ approximately equal to the Parry measure corresponding to $ \alpha $ , $ \mu_P ( \alpha ) $ .	We study the topological entropy of chaotic repellers formed by those points in a given chaotic attractor that never visit some small forbidden hole-region in the phase space .	The hole is a set of points in the phase space that have a sequence $ \alpha= ( \alpha_0\alpha_1 ... \alpha_ { l-1 } ) $ as the first $ l $ letters in their itineraries .	When the hole encompasses a point of a short periodic orbit , the entropy difference is significantly smaller than $ \mu_P ( \alpha ) $ .	This discrepancy is described by the formula which relates the length of the short periodic orbit , the Parry measure $ \mu_P ( \alpha ) $ , and the topological entropies of the two chaotic sets .
3	According to standard scaling , scalar curvature $ R $ behaves as $ |\beta-\beta_ { c } |^ { \alpha-2 } $ for $ \alpha & gt ; 0 $ where $ \beta $ is the inverse temperature and $ \alpha $ is the critical exponent of specific heat .	We derived the thermodynamic curvature of the Ising model on a kagome lattice under the presence of an external magnetic field .	The curvature was found to have a singularity at the critical point .	We focused on the zero field case to derive thermodynamic curvature and its components near the criticality .	In the model considered here in which $ \alpha $ is zero , we found that $ R $ behaves as $ |\beta-\beta_ { c } |^ { \alpha-1 } $ .
0	We present a large systematic study of hydrodynamic simulations of supersonic adiabatic jets in three dimensions to provide a definitive set of results on exploring jet density , Mach number and precession angle as variables .	We restrict the set-up to non-relativistic pressure-equilibrium flows into a homogeneous environment .	We first focus on the distribution and evolution of physical parameters associated with radio galaxies .	We find that the jet density has limited influence on the structure for a given jet Mach number .	The speed of advance varies by a small factor for jet densities between 0.1 and 0.0001 of the ambient density while the cocoon and cavity evolution change from narrow pressure balanced to wide over-pressure as the ratio falls .
3	The greedy approach is significantly informed by the use of novel distance heuristics that AltAltp derives from a graphplan-style planning graph for the problem .	Despite their near dominance , heuristic state search planners still lag behind disjunctive planners in the generation of parallel plans in classical planning .	The reason is that directly searching for parallel solutions in state space planners would require the planners to branch on all possible subsets of parallel actions , thus increasing the branching factor exponentially .	We present a variant of our heuristic state search planner AltAlt , called AltAltp which generates parallel plans by using greedy online parallelization of partial plans .	While this approach is not guaranteed to provide optimal parallel plans , empirical results show that AltAltp is capable of generating good quality parallel plans at a fraction of the cost incurred by the disjunctive planners .
3	Although powerful , it fails to extract substantial information from the data to guide the search efficiently , as this methodology is not based on any statistical modeling .	Identifying promising compounds from a vast collection of feasible compounds is an important and yet challenging problem in the pharmaceutical industry .	An efficient solution to this problem will help reduce the expenditure at the early stages of drug discovery .	In an attempt to solve this problem , Mandal , Wu and Johnson [ Technometrics 48 ( 2006 ) 273 -- 283 ] proposed the SELC algorithm .	The proposed approach uses Gaussian Process ( GP ) modeling to improve upon SELC , and hence named $ \mathcal { G } $ -SELC .
0	We present the first high-resolution spectra of the W UMa contact binary V524 Mon .	The spectra of the two components are very similar , resembling a G5 and a K0 .	We find the radial velocities and rotational velocities consistent with corotation .	We estimate the radii and the masses and derive a mass ratio M_2/M_1 = 2.1 .	We confirm that V524 Mon is a W-type contact system , likely enclosed in a common convective envelope , as found by Samec & amp ; Loflin ( 2003 ) .
1	We model the data with a self-consistent physical model ( GRASIL ) which includes a state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing .	We combine far-infrared photometry from Herschel ( PEP/HERMES ) with deep mid-infrared spectroscopy from Spitzer to investigate the nature and the mass assembly history of a sample of 31 Luminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies at z~1 and 2 selected in GOODS-S with 24 $ \mu $ m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mJy .	We find that all of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old ( & gt ; 1 Gyr ) stars and , at the same time , to host a moderate ongoing activity of SF ( SFR & lt ; 100 M $ _ { \odot } $ /yr ) .	The bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few Gyr before the observation in essentially all cases .	Only five galaxies of the sample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formation history ( SFH ) .
1	Finite time blow up of smooth initial data occurs for potential $ W $ having a Lipschitz singularity at the origin .	We focus in this work on the numerical discretization of the one dimensional aggregation equation $ \pa_t\rho + \pa_x ( v\rho ) =0 $ , $ v=a ( W'*\rho ) $ , in the attractive case .	A numerical discretization is proposed for which the convergence towards duality solutions of the aggregation equation is proved .	It relies on a careful choice of the discretized macroscopic velocity $ v $ in order to give a sense to the product $ v \rho $ .	Moreover , using the same idea , we propose an asymptotic preserving scheme for a kinetic system in hyperbolic scaling converging towards the aggregation equation in hydrodynamical limit .
2	With this procedure we are able to generate maps of proper motion velocities along and across the outflow axis , as well as ( angularly integrated ) proper motion velocity distributions .	We present an analysis of four epochs of H $ \alpha $ and [ S II ] $ \lambda\lambda $ 6716/6731 HST images of HH 1 .	For determining proper motions we explore a new method based on analysis of spatially degraded images obtained convolving the images with wavelet functions of chosen widths .	From the four available epochs , we find the time evolution of the velocities , intensities and spatial distribution of the line emission .	We find that over the last two decades HH 1 shows a clear acceleration .
1	Within a broad range of parameters , the motor-driven collapse of active elastic networks leads to a critical state .	We report analytical and numerical modelling of active elastic networks , motivated by experiments on crosslinked actin networks contracted by myosin motors .	We show that this state is qualitatively different from that of the random percolation model .	Intriguingly , it possesses both euclidean and scale-free structure with Fisher exponent smaller than $ 2 $ .	Remarkably , an indistinguishable Fisher exponent and the same euclidean structure is obtained at the critical point of the random percolation model after absorbing all enclaves into their surrounding clusters .
3	By enforcing a set of linear constraints on these matrices , we define a new class of codes that we term LP-decodable multipermutation codes .	In this paper , we introduce a new way of constructing and decoding multipermutation codes .	Multipermutations are permutations of a multiset that generally consist of duplicate entries .	We first introduce a class of binary matrices called multipermutation matrices , each of which corresponds to a unique and distinct multipermutation .	In order to decode these codes using a linear program ( LP ) , thereby enabling soft decoding , we characterize the convex hull of multipermutation matrices .
3	Such image data need to be stored for future reference of patients as well .	A new technique for embedding data into an image coupled with compression has been proposed in this paper .	A fast and efficient coding algorithms are needed for effective storage and transmission , due to the popularity of telemedicine and the use of digital medical images .	Medical images are produced and transferred between hospitals for review by physicians who are geographically apart .	This necessitates compact storage of medical images before being transmitted over Internet .
0	The univariate piecing-together approach ( PT ) fits a univariate generalized Pareto distribution ( GPD ) to the upper tail of a given distribution function in a continuous manner .	We propose a multivariate extension .	First it is shown that an arbitrary copula is in the domain of attraction of a multivariate extreme value distribution if and only if its upper tail can be approximated by the upper tail of a multivariate GPD with uniform margins .	The multivariate PT then consists of two steps : The upper tail of a given copula $ C $ is cut off and substituted by a multivariate GPD copula in a continuous manner .	The result is again a copula .
4	This order is intermediate between that of two Dirichlet spheres ( of order $ L^ { -3 } $ ) and two Neumann spheres ( of order $ L^ { -7 } $ ) .	We consider the Casimir interaction between two spheres corresponding to massless Dirac fields with MIT-bag boundary conditions .	Using operator approach , we derive the TGTG-formula for the Casimir interaction energy between the two spheres .	A byproduct is the explicit formula for the translation matrix that relates the fermionic spherical waves in different coordinate systems .	In the large separation limit , it is found that the order of the Casimir interaction energy is $ L^ { -5 } $ , where $ L $ is the separation between the centers of the spheres .
2	Its 250 mK focal plane detector array consists of 1,274 polarization-sensitive antenna-coupled bolometers , each with an associated lithographed band-defining filter .	The Polarbear Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) polarization experiment is currently observing from the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile .	It will characterize the expected B-mode polarization due to gravitational lensing of the CMB , and search for the possible B-mode signature of inflationary gravitational waves .	Each detector 's planar antenna structure is coupled to the telescope 's optical system through a contacting dielectric lenslet , an architecture unique in current CMB experiments .	We present the initial characterization of this focal plane .
2	We probe the redshift and luminosity evolution of intrinsic alignments in Horizon-AGN between $ z=0 $ and $ z=3 $ for galaxies with an $ r $ -band absolute magnitude of $ M_r\leq-20 $ .	Intrinsic galaxy shape and angular momentum alignments can arise in cosmological large-scale structure due to tidal interactions or galaxy formation processes .	Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have recently come of age as a tool to study these alignments and their contamination to weak gravitational lensing .	Alignments transition from being radial at low redshifts and high luminosities , dominated by the contribution of ellipticals , to being tangential at high redshift and low luminosities , where discs dominate the signal .	This can not be explained by the evolution of the fraction of ellipticals and discs alone : intrinsic evolution in the amplitude of alignments is necessary .
4	By means of star count techniques and field star decontaminated Color-Magnitude diagrams , the nature and size of these visual over-densities has been established ; and , when possible , new cluster fundamental parameters have been derived .	We present homogeneous $ V , I $ CCD photometry of nine stellar fields in the two inner quadrants of the Galactic plane .	The lines-of-view to most of these fields aim in the direction of the very inner Galaxy , where the Galactic field is very dense , and extinction is high and patchy .	Our nine fields are , according to several catalogs , centred on Galactic star clusters , namely Trumpler 13 , Trumpler 20 , Lynga 4 , Hogg 19 , Lynga 12 , Trumpler 25 , Trumpler 26 , Ruprecht 128 , and Trumpler 34 .	Apart from their coordinates , and in some cases additional basic data ( mainly from the 2MASS archive ) , their properties are poorly known .
4	This presents a new technique for magnetic field studies .	In a previous work Lazarian and Pogosyan suggested a technique to extract velocity and density statistics , of interstellar turbulence , by means of analysing statistics of spectral line data cubes .	In this paper we test that technique , by studying the effect of correlation between velocity and density fields , providing a systematic analysis of the uncertainties arising from the numerics , and exploring the effect of a linear shear .	We make use of both compressible MHD simulations and synthetic data to emulate spectroscopic observations and test the technique .	With the same synthetic spectroscopic data , we also studied anisotropies of the two point statistics and related those anisotropies with the magnetic field direction .
4	The second improvement is the usage of reduced forms ( a , b , c ) of discriminant D with a & gt ; 0 instead of reduced ideals of the same discriminant .	We propose new quantum algorithms to solve the regulator and the principal ideal problem in a real-quadratic number field .	We improve the algorithms proposed by Hallgren by using two different techniques .	The first improvement is the usage of a period function which is not one-to-one on its period .	We show that even in this case Shor 's algorithm computes the period with constant probability .
0	We present results obtained from a series of observations of the supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 by the Suzaku satellite .	The observations cover about two-thirds of the remnant surface .	We successfully detected hard X-rays up to ~ 40 keV from each pointing .	The hard X-ray spectra are described by power-law functions with photon indices of ~ 3.0 , which are larger than those in the energy region below 10 keV .	Connection of the spatially-integrated XIS and HXD spectra clearly reveals a spectral cutoff in the 0.4 -- 40 keV X-ray spectrum .
3	We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate , atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms , spikes appearing in the condensate wave function , and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse .	We explored the dynamics of how a Bose-Einstein condensate collapses and subsequently explodes when the balance of forces governing the size and shape of the condensate is suddenly altered .	A condensate 's equilibrium size and shape is strongly affected by the inter-atomic interactions .	Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally-applied magnetic field yields a wealth of detailed information on the violent collapse process .	These all have curious dependencies on time , the strength of the interaction , and the number of condensate atoms .
3	Just recently , however , it has been argued that the fundamental D=10 heterotic string does indeed display a near-horizon enhancement to OSp ( 8|2 ) as predicted by the brane-scan , provided alpha ' corrections are taken into account .	In 1987 two versions of the brane-scan of D-dimensional super p-branes were put forward .	The first pinpointed those ( p , D ) slots consistent with kappa-symmetric Green-Schwarz type actions ; the second generalized the `` membrane at the end of the universe '' idea to all those superconformal groups describing p-branes on the boundary of AdS_ { p+2 } x S^ { D-p-2 } .	Although the second version predicted D3 and M5 branes in addition to those of the first , it came unstuck because the 1/2 BPS solitonic branes failed to exhibit the required symmetry enhancement in the near-horizon limit , except in the non-dilatonic cases ( p=2 , D=11 ) , ( p=3 , D=10 ) and ( p=5 , D=11 ) .	If this logic could be extended to the other strings and branes , it would resolve this 21-year-old paradox and provide new AdS/CFT dualities , which we tabulate .
1	We discuss a modified recursive method , crucially based on the asymptotic expansion of the associated saddle-point integrals , which can be adopted for a large number of such structures ( e.g.partitions , permutations , lattice walks , trees , random graphs , all with a variety of prescribed statistics and/or constraints ) .	Various specifiable combinatorial structures , with d extensive parameters , can be exactly sampled both by the recursive method , with linear arithmetic complexity if a heavy preprocessing is performed , or by the Boltzmann method , with complexity Theta ( n^ { 1+d/2 } ) .	The new algorithm requires no preprocessing , still it has linear complexity on average .	In terms of bit complexity , instead of arithmetic , we only have extra logarithmic factors .	For many families of structures , this provides , at our knowledge , the only known quasi-linear generators .
4	The VHE gamma-ray results are discussed in the context of contemporaneous X-ray observations with Swift XRT .	HESS J0632+057 is an unidentified gamma-ray source located in the Monoceros region , probably associated with the massive Be star MWC 148.H.E.S.S .	and VERITAS observations in the very high energy ( VHE ) range combined with Swift X-ray data indicate that this object is a new member of the elusive gamma-ray binary class .	We present here results of VHE gamma-ray observations from VERITAS and HESS at energies above 100 GeV taken over more than six years .	The observations confirm HESS J0632+057 as a point-like VHE source with a significance of more than 12 standard deviations .
4	Due to strong hybridization the O 2p states are polarized , giving rise to extended localized magnetic moments centered at the high-spin sites .	We present electronic structure calculations for the one-dimensional magnetic chain compounds Ca_3CoRhO_6 and Ca_3FeRhO_6 .	The calculations are based on density functional theory and the local density approximation .	We use the augmented spherical wave ( ASW ) method .	The observed alternation of low- and high-spin states along the Co-Rh and Fe-Rh chains is related to differences in the oxygen coordination of the transition metal sites .
3	By comparing with regular ring lattices and random regular graphs , we show that random graphs are more robust than random regular graphs ; however , the relationship between random graphs and regular ring lattices depends on the average degree and graph size .	Recently , it has been proposed that the natural connectivity can be used to efficiently characterise the robustness of complex networks .	Natural connectivity quantifies the redundancy of alternative routes in a network by evaluating the weighted number of closed walks of all lengths and can be regarded as the average eigenvalue obtained from the graph spectrum .	In this article , we explore the natural connectivity of random graphs both analytically and numerically and show that it increases linearly with the average degree .	We derive the critical graph size as a function of the average degree , which can be predicted by our analytical results .
4	`` , termed wildcards or do n't cares , which can be mapped to an arbitrary substring of the text .	The generalized function matching ( GFM ) problem has been intensively studied starting with [ Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg , 1979 ] .	Given a pattern p and a text t , the goal is to find a mapping from the letters of p to non-empty substrings of t , such that applying the mapping to p results in t. Very recently , the problem has been investigated within the framework of parameterized complexity [ Fernau , Schmid , and Villanger , 2013 ] .	In this paper we study the parameterized complexity of the optimization variant of GFM ( called Max-GFM ) , which has been introduced in [ Amir and Nor , 2007 ] .	Here , one is allowed to replace some of the pattern letters with some special symbols `` ?
3	The experimental results are compared with predictions of tilted axis cranking calculations .	Magnetic dipole bands have been identified in 142,143,144Gd and 141Eu nuclei .	The observed bands are based on configurations with small oblate deformation involving high-Omega , h11/2 proton particles and low-Omega , h11/2 neutron holes .	Information about the strength of the effective interaction between the constituent nucleons has been deduced using a semiclassical scheme of the coupling of two angular momentum vectors .	The transition from irregular dipole band in 144Gd to more regular ones in lighter Gd nuclei is observed .
0	The transition temperature for a dilute , homogeneous , three-dimensional Bose gas has the expansion T_c = T_0 { 1 + c_1 a n^ ( 1/3 ) + [ c_2 ' ln ( a n^ ( 1/3 ) ) + c_2 '' ] a^2 n^ ( 2/3 ) + O ( a^3 n ) } , where a is the scattering length , n the number density , and T_0 the ideal gas result .	The first-order coefficient c_1 depends on non-perturbative physics .	In this paper , we show that the coefficient c_2 ' can be computed perturbatively .	We also show that the remaining second-order coefficient c_2 '' depends on non-perturbative physics but can be related , by a perturbative calculation , to quantities that have previously been measured using lattice simulations of three-dimensional O ( 2 ) scalar field theory .	Making use of those simulation results , we find T_c = T_0 { 1 + ( 1.32+-0.02 ) a n^ ( 1/3 ) + [ 19.7518 ln ( a n^ ( 1/3 ) ) + ( 75.7+-0.4 ) ] a^2 n^ ( 2/3 ) + O ( a^3 n ) } .
1	For a simple model of factor analysis type , it is proved that ordinary PCA can produce a consistent ( for n large ) estimate of the principal factor if and only if p ( n ) is asymptotically of smaller order than n. There may be a basis in which typical signals have sparse representations : most co-ordinates have small signal energies .	Principal components analysis ( PCA ) is a classical method for the reduction of dimensionality of data in the form of n observations ( or cases ) of a vector with p variables .	If such a basis ( e.g.wavelets ) is used to represent the signals , then the variation in many coordinates is likely to be small .	Consequently , we study a simple `` sparse PCA '' algorithm : select a subset of coordinates of largest variance , estimate eigenvectors from PCA on the selected subset , threshold and reexpress in the original basis .	We illustrate the algorithm on some exercise ECG data , and prove that in a single factor model , under an appropriate sparsity assumption , it yields consistent estimates of the principal factor .
3	Second , the isoenergetic curves in the space of momenta $ \vec \varkappa $ corresponding to these eigenfunctions have a form of slightly distorted circles with holes ( Cantor type structure ) .	We consider a Schr\ '' odinger operator $ H=-\Delta+V ( \vec x ) $ in dimension two with a quasi-periodic potential $ V ( \vec x ) $ .	We prove that the absolutely continuous spectrum of $ H $ contains a semiaxis and there is a family of generalized eigenfunctions at every point of this semiaxis with the following properties .	First , the eigenfunctions are close to plane waves $ e^ { i\langle \vec \varkappa , \vec x\rangle } $ at the high energy region .	A new method of multiscale analysis in the momentum space is developed to prove these results .
1	In this report the standard transport theories for superlattices , i.e.miniband conduction , Wannier-Stark-hopping , and sequential tunneling , are reviewed in detail .	Electric transport in semiconductor superlattices is dominated by pronounced negative differential conductivity .	Their relation to each other is clarified by a comparison with a quantum transport model based on nonequilibrium Green functions .	It is demonstrated how the occurrence of negative differential conductivity causes inhomogeneous electric field distributions , yielding either a characteristic sawtooth shape of the current-voltage characteristic or self-sustained current oscillations .	An additional ac-voltage in the THz range is included in the theory as well .
1	However , many devices of interest , such as optical couplers , have channels that can not be terminated without generating reflections .	Fast surface integral equation ( SIE ) solvers seem to be ideal approaches for simulating 3-D nanophotonic devices , as these devices generate fields both in an interior channel and in the infinite exterior domain .	Generating absorbers for these channels is a new problem for SIE methods , as the methods were initially developed for problems with finite surfaces .	In this paper we show that the obvious approach for eliminating reflections , making the channel mildly conductive outside the domain of interest , is inaccurate .	We describe a new method , in which the absorber has a gradually increasing surface conductivity ; such an absorber can be easily incorporated in fast integral equation solvers .
0	We discuss models in which the smallness of the effective vacuum energy density $ \rho_\L $ and the coincidence of the time of its dominance $ t_\L $ with the epoch of galaxy formation $ t_G $ are due to anthropic selection effects .	In such models , the probability distribution for $ \rho_\L $ is a product of an { \it a priori } distribution $ { \cal P } _* ( \rho_\L ) $ and of the number density of galaxies at a given $ \rho_\L $ ( which is proportional to the number of observers who will detect that value of $ \rho_\L $ ) .	To determine $ { \cal P } _* $ , we consider inflationary models in which the role of the vacuum energy is played by a slowly-varying potential of some scalar field .	We show that the resulting distribution depends on the shape of the potential and generally has a non-trivial dependence on $ \rho_\L $ , even in the narrow anthropically allowed range .	This is contrary to Weinberg 's earlier conjecture that the { \it a priori } distribution should be nearly flat in the range of interest .
3	In this article , we ? rst propose two nonparametric estimators for survival function of patients following a given treatment regime .	A treatment regime is a deterministic function that dictates personalized treatment based on patients ' individual prognostic information .	There is a fast-growing interest in ? nding optimal treatment regimes to maximize expected long-term clinical outcomes of patients for complex diseases , such as cancer and AIDS .	For many clinical studies with survival time as a primary endpoint , a main goal is to maximize patients ' survival probabilities given treatments .	Then , we derive the estimation of the optimal treatment regime based on a value-based searching algorithm within a set of treatment regimes indexed by parameters .
1	To this end , we assume a scalar confining and a one gluon exchange ( OGE ) potential .	We investigate the quark structure of D and B mesons in the framework of a constituent quark model .	The parameters of the model are adopted to reproduce the meson mass spectrum .	From a fit to ARGUS and CLEO data on B- & gt ; D*lv semileptonic decay we find for the Cabbibo Kobayashi Maskawa matrix element Vcb=0.036+-0.003 .	We compare our form factors to the pole dominance hypothesis and the heavy quark limit .
4	Closed-form optimal solutions are obtained in detailed situations .	This article is concerned with an optimal control problem derived by mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equation , where the drift coefficient of the observation equation is linear with respect to the state x and its expectation .	The control problem is different from the existing literature about optimal control for mean-field stochastic systems , and has more applications in mathematical finance , e.g. , asset-liability management problem , recursive utility optimality problem .	Using a backward separation method with a decomposition technique , two optimality conditions and two coupled forward-backward optimal filters are derived .	Several linear-quadratic optimal control problems for mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equations are studied .
4	Simulation results and theoretical analyses exhibit that the Petschek outflow channel becomes narrower when the reconnection inflow contains more magnetic energy , as previously claimed .	We investigate the large scale evolution of a relativistic magnetic reconnection in an electron-positron pair plasma by a relativistic two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD ) code .	We introduce an inter-species friction force as an effective resistivity to dissipate magnetic fields .	We demonstrate that magnetic reconnection successfully occurs in our two-fluid system , and that it involves Petschek-type bifurcated current layers in later stage .	We further observe a quasi-steady evolution thanks to an open boundary condition , and find that the Petschek-type structure is stable over the long time period .
3	We find that the kinematics in these outer regions are all different despite the fact that these four galaxies have similar photometric properties , and are uniformly classified as `` fast rotators '' from their stellar kinematics within $ 1R_e $ .	We present a kinematic analysis of the globular cluster systems and diffuse stellar light of four intermediate luminosity ( sub- $ L^ { \ast } $ ) early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster based on Gemini/GMOS data .	Our galaxy sample is fainter ( $ -23.8 & lt ; M_K & lt ; -22.7 $ ) than most previous studies , nearly doubling the number of galaxies in this magnitude range that now have GC kinematics .	The data for the diffuse light extends to $ 4R_e $ , and the data for the globular clusters reaches 8 -- $ 12R_e $ .	The globular cluster systems exhibit a wide range of kinematic morphology .
2	The central charge of this module is restricted by the requirement of the closure of the nonlinear realization of the Poincare algebra .	The free non-critical string quantum model is constructed directly in the light-cone variables in the range of dimensions $ 1 & lt ; D & lt ; 25 $ .	The longitudinal degrees of freedom are described by an abstract Verma module .	The spin content of the model is analysed .	In particular for D=4 the explicit formulae for the character generating functions of the open and closed massive strings are given and the spin spectrum of first 12 excited levels is calculated .
2	Despite recent interest in the area , the current state-of-the-art techniques lack in principled approaches for optimally combining different sources of evidence .	Expert finding is an information retrieval task that is concerned with the search for the most knowledgeable people with respect to a specific topic , and the search is based on documents that describe people 's activities .	The task involves taking a user query as input and returning a list of people who are sorted by their level of expertise with respect to the user query .	This article proposes two frameworks for combining multiple estimators of expertise .	These estimators are derived from textual contents , from graph-structure of the citation patterns for the community of experts , and from profile information about the experts .
3	Several examples of such evolution equations with functional carrying capacities are analyzed .	A class of models is introduced describing the evolution of population species whose carrying capacities are functionals of these populations .	The functional dependence of the carrying capacities reflects the fact that the correlations between populations can be realized not merely through direct interactions , as in the usual predator-prey Lotka-Volterra model , but also through the influence of species on the carrying capacities of each other .	This includes the self-influence of each kind of species on its own carrying capacity with delays .	The emphasis is given on the conditions under which the solutions to the equations display extreme events , such as finite-time death and finite-time singularity .
3	The identification process of NEP X-ray sources resulted in 144 X-ray sources having a normal stellar counterpart , with an excess of yellow stars with respect to model predictions .	X-ray surveys allow to identify young , main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood .	Young , stellar samples , selected according to their activity , can be used to determine the stellar birthrate in the last billion years .	The ROSAT North Ecliptic Pole survey ( NEP ) , with its moderately deep sensitivity ( fluxes ~10^ ( -14 ) erg cm^ ( -2 ) sec^ ( -1 ) ) , is the best survey , to date , able to sample the intermediate-age ( 10^8 - 10^9 years ) nearby population .	We want to determine if these X-ray active stars are young or intermediate-age stars , or active binaries .
0	The infrared is a key wavelength regime for probing the dusty , obscured nuclear regions of active galaxies .	We present results from an infrared study of 87 nearby Seyfert galaxies using the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes .	Combining detailed modelling of the 3 - 100 micron spectral energy distributions with mid-IR spectral diagnostics and near-infrared observations , we find broad support for the unified model of AGNs .	The IR emission of Seyfert 1s and 2s is consistent with their having the same type of central engine viewed at a different orientation .	The nature of the putative torus is becoming clearer ; in particular we present evidence that it is likely a clumpy medium .
0	We report the detection of short period variations in the stars HD69013 and HD96237 .	These stars possess large overabundances of rare earth elements and global magnetic fields , thus belong to the class of chemically peculiar Ap stars of the main sequence .	Pulsations were found from analysis of high time resolution spectra obtained with the ESO Very Large Telescope using a cross correlation method for wide spectral bands , from lines belonging to rare earth elements and from the H alpha core .	Pulsation amplitudes reach more than 200 m/s for some lines in HD69013 with a period of 11.4 min and about 100m/s in HD96237 with periods near 13.6 min .	The pulsations have also been detected in photometric observations obtained at the South African Astronomical Observatory .
3	For Sp ( 3 ) Yang-Mills theory the transition is first order both in 2+1 and in 3+1 dimensions .	Some time ago , Svetitsky and Yaffe have argued that -- if the deconfinement phase transition of a ( d+1 ) -dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group G is second order -- it should be in the universality class of a d-dimensional spin model symmetric under the center of G. For d=3 these arguments have been confirmed numerically only in the SU ( 2 ) case with center Z ( 2 ) , simply because all SU ( N ) Yang-Mills theories with N & gt ; =3 seem to have non-universal first order phase transitions .	The symplectic groups Sp ( N ) also have the center Z ( 2 ) and provide another extension of SU ( 2 ) = Sp ( 1 ) to general N. Using lattice simulations , we find that the deconfinement phase transition of Sp ( 2 ) Yang-Mills theory is first order in 3+1 dimensions , while in 2+1 dimensions stronger fluctuations induce a second order transition .	In agreement with the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture , for ( 2+1 ) -d Sp ( 2 ) Yang-Mills theory we find the universal critical behavior of the 2-d Ising model .	This suggests that the size of the gauge group -- and not the center symmetry -- determines the order of the deconfinement phase transition .
0	The Walsh transform $ \widehat { Q } $ of a quadratic function $ Q : F_ { p^n } \rightarrow F_p $ satisfies $ |\widehat { Q } ( b ) | \in \ { 0 , p^ { \frac { n+s } { 2 } } \ } $ for all $ b\in F_ { p^n } $ , where $ 0\le s\le n-1 $ is an integer depending on $ Q $ .	In this article , we study the following three classes of quadratic functions of wide interest .	The class $ \mathcal { C } _1 $ is defined for arbitrary $ n $ as $ \mathcal { C } _1 = \ { Q ( x ) = Tr ( \sum_ { i=1 } ^ { \lfloor ( n-1 ) /2\rfloor } a_ix^ { 2^i+1 } ) \ ; : \ ; a_i \in F_2\ } $ , and the larger class $ \mathcal { C } _2 $ is defined for even $ n $ as $ \mathcal { C } _2 = \ { Q ( x ) = Tr ( \sum_ { i=1 } ^ { ( n/2 ) -1 } a_ix^ { 2^i+1 } ) + { \rm Tr_ { n/2 } } ( a_ { n/2 } x^ { 2^ { n/2 } +1 } ) \ ; : \ ; a_i \in F_2\ } $ .	For an odd prime $ p $ , the subclass $ \mathcal { D } $ of all $ p $ -ary quadratic functions is defined as $ \mathcal { D } = \ { Q ( x ) = Tr ( \sum_ { i=0 } ^ { \lfloor n/2\rfloor } a_ix^ { p^i+1 } ) \ ; : \ ; a_i \in F_p\ } $ .	We determine the distribution of the parameter $ s $ for $ \mathcal { C } _1 , \mathcal { C } _2 $ and $ \mathcal { D } $ .
1	A vast majority of research in this area focus on design heuristic protocols , and analyze their performance by simulations on networks generated randomly or obtained in practical measurements of some ( usually small-size ) wireless networks. % some library .	Development of many futuristic technologies , such as MANET , VANET , iThings , nano-devices , depend on efficient distributed communication protocols in multi-hop ad hoc networks .	Moreover , they often assume access to truly random sources , which is often not reasonable in case of wireless devices .	In this work we use a formal framework to study the problem of broadcasting and its time complexity in any two dimensional Euclidean wireless network with uniform transmission powers .	For the analysis , we consider two popular models of ad hoc networks based on the Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio ( SINR ) : one with opportunistic links , and the other with randomly disturbed SINR .
1	The study is based on a large sample of ~22 000 well-defined star-forming galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) .	We present empirical relations between the global dust reddening and other physical galaxy properties including the Halpha luminosity , Halpha surface brightness , metallicity and axial ratio for star-forming disc galaxies .	The reddening parameterized by color excess E ( B-V ) is derived from the Balmer decrement .	Besides the dependency of reddening on Halpha luminosity / surface brightness and gas phase metallicity , it is also correlated with the galaxy inclination , in the sense that edge-on galaxies are more attenuated than face-on galaxies at a give intrinsic luminosity .	In light of these correlations , we present the empirical formulae of E ( B-V ) as a function of these galaxy properties , with a scatter of only 0.07 mag .
2	During the self-detuning cycle new and new narrow phonon modes are sequentially `` fired '' on one side of the spectrum and approximately the same number of modes are `` extinguished '' on the other side , up to a complete generation breakdown in a certain final portion of the frequency axis .	An unusual nonlinear resonance was experimentally observed in a ruby phonon laser ( phaser ) operating at 9 GHz with an electromagnetic pumping at 23 GHz .	The resonance is manifested by very slow cooperative self-detunings in the microwave spectra of stimulated phonon emission when pumping is modulated at a superlow frequency ( less than 10 Hz ) .	This is usually followed by a short-time refractority , after which the generation is fired again in the opposite ( starting ) portion of the frequency axis .	The entire process of such cooperative spectral motions is repeated with high degree of regularity .
0	I consider the Hubbard model of graphene in an external magnetic field and in the Hartree-Fock approximation .	In the continuum limit , the ground state energy at half filling becomes nearly symmetric under rotations of the three-component vector ( N1 , N2 , m ) , with the first two components representing the Neel order parameter orthogonal to and the third component the magnetization parallel with the external magnetic field .	When the symmetry breaking effects arising from the lattice , Zeeman coupling , and higher Landau levels are included the system develops a quantum critical point at which the antiferromagnetic order disappears and the magnetization has a kink .	The observed incompressible state at filling factor one is argued to arise due to a finite third component of the Neel order parameter at these electron densities .	Recent experiments appear consistent with vanishing N1 and N2 , and finite N3 , at the filling factors zero and one , respectively .
0	PSR 1259-63 is a radio pulsar orbiting a Be star in a highly eccentric orbit .	Soft and hard X-rays are observed from this binary system .	We apply the shock powered emission model to this system .	The collision of the pulsar and Be star winds forms a shock , which accelerates electrons and positrons to the relativistic energies .	We derive the energy distribution of relativistic electrons and positrons as a function of the distance from the shock in the pulsar nebula .
3	With this information , we are able to estimate the redshift evolution of the total ( FUV + FIR ) star formation rate density ( SFRD_TOT ) .	SPICA is one of the key projects for the future .	Not only its instrument suite will open up a discovery window but they will also allow to physically understand some of the phenomena that we still do not understand in the high-redshift universe .	Using new homogeneous luminosity functions ( LFs ) in the Far-Ultraviolet ( FUV ) from VVDS and in the Far-Infrared ( FIR ) from Herschel/PEP and Herschel/HerMES , we studied the evolution of the dust attenuation with redshift .	Our main conclusions are that : 1 ) the dust attenuation A_FUV is found to increase from z = 0 to $ z \sim 1.2 and then starts to decrease until our last data point at z = 3.6 ; 2 ) the estimated SFRD confirms published results to z \sim 2 .
0	We discuss efforts to determine the mass , radius , and surface composition of the nearby compact object RX J185635-3754 from its multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution .	We compute non-magnetized model atmospheres and emergent spectra for selected compositions and gravities , and discuss efforts to fit existing and new observational data from ROSAT , EUVE and the HST .	The spectral energy distribution matches that expected from a heavy-element dominated atmosphere , but not from a uniform temperature blackbody .	Non-magnetic light element atmospheres can not be simultaneously reconciled with the optical and X-ray data .	We extend previous studies , which were limited to one fixed neutron star mass and radius .
1	Each theory is incomplete and possesses problematic elements , but both have served as stepping stones to a more fundamental and inclusive geoscience theory that I call Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics ( WEDD ) .	Neither plate tectonics nor Earth expansion theory is sufficient to provide a basis for understanding geoscience .	WEDD begins with and is the consequence of our planet 's early formation as a Jupiter-like gas giant and permits deduction of : ( 1 ) Earth 's internal composition , structure , and highly-reduced oxidation state ; ( 2 ) Core formation without whole-planet melting ; ( 3 ) Powerful new internal energy sources - proto-planetary energy of compression and georeactor nuclear fission energy ; ( 4 ) Georeactor geomagnetic field generation ; ( 5 ) Mechanism for heat emplacement at the base of the crust resulting in the crustal geothermal gradient ; ( 6 ) Decompression driven geodynamics that accounts for the myriad of observations attributed to plate tectonics without requiring physically-impossible mantle convection , and ; ( 7 ) A mechanism for fold-mountain formation that does not necessarily require plate collision .	The latter obviates the necessity to assume supercontinent cycles .	Here , I review the principles of Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics and describe a new underlying basis for geoscience and geology .
4	We conclude by calculating the mod 2 spectrum homology of TC ( S^ { 2n+1 } ; 2 ) .	For any space X with the homotopy type of simply-connected , finite-type CW-complex , we construct an associative cochain algebra fls ( X ) whose cohomology algebra is isomorphic to that of LX , the free loop space on X .	For certain X , we define a cochain map from fls ( X ) to itself that is a good model of the pth-power operation on LX .	Under additional conditions on X , e.g. , when X is a wedge of spheres , we define a cochain complex hos ( X ) by twisting together fls ( X ) and H* ( BS^1 ) and prove that the cohomology of hos ( X ) is isomorphic to the Borel cohomology of LX .	Finally , we define tc ( X ) to be the mapping cone of the composite of the projection map from hos ( X ) to fls ( X ) with the model of the pth-power map ( for p=2 ) , so that the mod 2 spectrum cohomology of TC ( X ; 2 ) , the topological cyclic homology of X at 2 , is isomorphic to the mod 2 cohomology of tc ( X ) .
0	Galaxy formation models exhibit remarkable success in reproducing observed relations such as the relation between galaxies ' star formation rates ( SFRs ) and stellar masses and the stellar mass -- halo mass relation .	We demonstrate that comparisons of the short-timescale variability in galaxy SFRs with observational data provide an additional useful constraint on the physics of galaxy formation feedback .	We apply SFR indicators with different sensitivity timescales to galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments ( FIRE ) simulations .	We find that the SFR -- stellar mass relation has a significantly greater scatter when the Halpha-derived SFR is considered compared with when the far-ultraviolet ( FUV ) -based SFR is used .	This difference is a direct consequence of bursty star formation because the FIRE galaxies exhibit order-of-magnitude SFR variations over timescales of a few Myr .
4	The methodology is pure dual in the sense that it does n't require certain input approximations to the Snell envelope .	In this paper we introduce and study the concept of optimal and surely optimal dual martingales in the context of dual valuation of Bermudan options , and outline the development of new algorithms in this context .	We provide a characterization theorem , a theorem which gives conditions for a martingale to be surely optimal , and a stability theorem concerning martingales which are near to be surely optimal in a sense .	Guided by these results we develop a framework of backward algorithms for constructing such a martingale .	In turn this martingale may then be utilized for computing an upper bound of the Bermudan product .
1	It is not surprising that Cooper pairing occurs in dense matter since nucleon pairing is observed in nuclei as energy differences between even-even and odd-even nuclei .	Neutron stars provide a fertile environment for exploring superfluidity under extreme conditions .	Since superfluids and superconductors in neutron stars profoundly affect neutrino emissivities and specific heats , their presence can be observed in the thermal evolution of neutron stars .	An ever-growing number of cooling neutron stars , now amounting to 13 thermal sources , and several additional objects from which upper limits to temperatures can be ascertained , can now be used to discriminate among theoretical scenarios and even to dramatically restrict properties of nucleon pairing at high densities .	In addition , observations of pulsars , including their spin-downs and glitch histories , additionally support the conjecture that superfluidity and superconductivity are ubiquitous within , and important to our understanding of , neutron stars .
2	We utilize this particular form and propose a novel algorithm for thederivation of the equations of motion from the field equations .	The problem of derivation of the equations of motion from the field equations is considered .	Einstein 's field equations have a specific analytical form : They are linear in the second order derivatives and quadratic in the first order derivatives of the field variables .	It is based on the condition of the balance between the singular terms of the field equation .	We apply the algorithm to a nonlinear Lorentz invariant scalar field model .
2	We derive a new divergence family between multivariate spectral densities which takes root in the prediction theory .	In this technical note , we deal with a spectrum approximation problem arising in THREE-like multivariate spectral estimation approaches .	The solution to the problem minimizes a suitable divergence index with respect to an a priori spectral density .	Under mild assumptions on the a priori spectral density , the approximation problem , based on this new divergence family , admits a family of solutions .	Moreover , an upper bound on the complexity degree of these solutions is provided .
1	For any $ \sigma \in S_n $ , we let $ \mathrm { des } ( \sigma ) $ denote the number of descents of $ \sigma $ , $ \mathrm { inv } ( \sigma ) $ denote the number of inversions of $ \sigma $ , and $ \mathrm { LRmin } ( \sigma ) $ denote the number of left-to-right minima of $ \sigma $ .	Let $ S_n $ denote the symmetric group .	For any sequence of statistics $ \mathrm { stat } _1 , \ldots \mathrm { stat } _k $ on permutations , we say two permutations $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ in $ S_j $ are $ ( \mathrm { stat } _1 , \ldots \mathrm { stat } _k ) $ -c-Wilf equivalent if the generating function of $ \prod_ { i=1 } ^k x_i^ { \mathrm { stat } _i } $ over all permutations which have no consecutive occurrences of $ \alpha $ equals the generating function of $ \prod_ { i=1 } ^k x_i^ { \mathrm { stat } _i } $ over all permutations which have no consecutive occurrences of $ \beta $ .	We give many examples of pairs of permutations $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ in $ S_j $ which are $ \mathrm { des } $ -c-Wilf equivalent , $ ( \mathrm { des } , \mathrm { inv } ) $ -c-Wilf equivalent , and $ ( \mathrm { des } , \mathrm { inv } , \mathrm { LRmin } ) $ -c-Wilf equivalent .	For example , we will show that if $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are minimally overlapping permutations in $ S_j $ which start with 1 and end with the same element and $ \mathrm { des } ( \alpha ) = \mathrm { des } ( \beta ) $ and $ \mathrm { inv } ( \alpha ) = \mathrm { inv } ( \beta ) $ , then $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are $ ( \mathrm { des } , \mathrm { inv } ) $ -c-Wilf equivalent .
4	The second proposition is a pathwise replication result that generalizes the ones obtained in the classical framework of diffusion models .	This paper develops a mathematical framework for the analysis of continuous-time trading strategies which , in contrast to the classical setting of continuous-time mathematical finance , does not rely on stochastic integrals or other probabilistic notions .	Our purely analytic framework allows for the derivation of a pathwise self-financial condition for continuous-time trading strategies , which is consistent with the classical definition in case a probability model is introduced .	Our first proposition provides us with a pathwise definition of the gain process for a large class of continuous-time , path-dependent , self-finacing trading strategies , including the important class of 'delta-hedging ' strategies , and is based on the recently developed 'non-anticipative functional calculus ' .	Two versions of the statement involve respectively continuous and c\`adl\`ag price paths .
4	If p ( r ) denotes the probability of learning the result r `` for free '' in a protocol then one might hope to design a protocol which simultaneously has large p ( 0 ) and p ( 1 ) .	Suppose that we are given a quantum computer programmed ready to perform a computation if it is switched on .	Counterfactual computation is a process by which the result of the computation may be learnt without actually running the computer .	Such processes are possible within quantum physics and to achieve this effect , a computer embodying the possibility of running the computation must be available , even though the computation is , in fact , not run .	We study the possibilities and limitations of general protocols for the counterfactual computation of decision problems ( where the result r is either 0 or 1 ) .
0	We consider the following class of unitary representations $ \pi $ of some ( real ) Lie group $ G $ which has a matched pair of symmetries described as follows : ( i ) Suppose $ G $ has a period-2 automorphism $ \tau $ , and that the Hilbert space $ \mathbf { H } ( \pi ) $ carries a unitary operator $ J $ such that $ J\pi = ( \pi \circ \tau ) J $ ( i.e. , selfsimilarity ) .	( ii ) An added symmetry is implied if $ \mathbf { H } ( \pi ) $ further contains a closed subspace $ \mathbf { K } _0 $ having a certain order-covariance property , and satisfying the $ \mathbf { K } _0 $ -restricted positivity : $ & lt ; v \mid Jv & gt ; \ge 0 $ , $ \forall v\in \mathbf { K } _0 $ , where $ & lt ; \cdot \mid \cdot & gt ; $ is the inner product in $ \mathbf { H } ( \pi ) $ .	From ( i ) -- ( ii ) , we get an induced dual representation of an associated dual group $ G^c $ .	All three properties , selfsimilarity , order-covariance , and positivity , are satisfied in a natural context when $ G $ is semisimple and hermitean ; but when $ G $ is the $ ( ax+b ) $ -group , or the Heisenberg group , positivity is incompatible with the other two axioms for the infinite-dimensional irreducible representations .	We describe a class of $ G $ , containing the latter two , which admits a classification of the possible spaces $ \mathbf { K } _0 \subset \mathbf { H } ( \pi ) $ satisfying the axioms of selfsimilarity and order-covariance .
0	A simple interlayer pair tunneling is solved exactly .	We find that in the normal state spin-1/2 particle and hole excitations are gapped .	But the state is an unusual metal , characterized by novel fermionic spin zero and charge +2e and -2e excitations that exist about their own Fermi surfaces .	The model is consistent with a number of properties of the underdoped cuprates .	At finite temperature the Fermi surface appears partially gapped , and at high temperatures the spin gap disappears completely .
2	During the virialisation epoch , when the most massive structures form by gravitational collapse , it should be expected that comoving space evolves inhomogeneous curvature as structure grows .	For about a decade , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( BAO ) peak at about 105 Mpc/h has provided a standard ruler test of the LCDM cosmological model , a member of the Friedmann -- Lemaitre -- Robertson -- Walker ( FLRW ) family of cosmological models -- -according to which comoving space is rigid .	However , general relativity does not require comoving space to be rigid .	The BAO peak standard ruler should also follow this inhomogeneous evolution if the comoving rigidity assumption is false .	This `` standard '' ruler has now been detected to be flexible , as expected under general relativity .
1	As their name suggests , OR circuits have OR gates as their computation gates , as well as the usual input , output and constant ( 0/1 ) gates .	We investigate the complexity of uniform OR circuits and AND circuits of polynomial-size and depth .	As is the norm for Boolean circuits , our circuits have multiple sink gates , which implies that an OR circuit computes an OR function on some subset of its input variables .	Determining that subset amounts to solving a number of reachability questions on a polynomial-size directed graph ( which input gates are connected to the output gate ?	) , taken from a very sparse set of graphs .
0	We investigate three tree-dominated $ B \to a_0 a_0 $ decays for the first time in the perturbative QCD ( pQCD ) approach at leading order in the standard model , with $ a_0 $ standing for the light scalar $ a_0 ( 980 ) $ state , which is assumed as a meson based on the model of conventional two-quark $ ( q\bar q ) $ structure .	All the topologies of the Feynman diagrams such as the non-factorizable spectator ones and the annihilation ones are calculated in the pQCD approach .	It is of great interest to find that , contrary to the known $ B \to \pi \pi $ decays , the $ B \to a_0 a_0 $ decays are governed by the large non-factorizable contributions , which give rise to the large $ B \to a_0 a_0 $ decay rates in the order of $ 10^ { -6 } \sim 10^ { -5 } $ , although the $ a_0 $ meson has an extremely small vector decay constant $ f_ { a_0 } $ .	Also observed are large direct CP-violating asymmetries around $ 15\ % $ and $ 30\ % $ for the $ B^0 \to a_0^0 a_0^0 $ and $ a_0^+ a_0^- $ modes .	These sizable predictions could be easily examined at the running Large Hadron Collider and the near future Super-B/Belle-II experiments .
1	We account for the OVRO beamwidth and calibration uncertainties , as well as the uncertainty induced by the removal of non-CMB foreground contamination .	We use Owens Valley Radio Observatory ( OVRO ) cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) anisotropy data to constrain cosmological parameters .	We consider open and spatially-flat-Lambda cold dark matter cosmogonies , with nonrelativistic-mass density parameter Omega_0 in the range 0.1 -- 1 , baryonic-mass density parameter Omega_B in the range ( 0.005 -- 0.029 ) h^ { -2 } , and age of the universe t_0 in the range ( 10 -- 20 ) Gyr .	Marginalizing over all parameters but Omega_0 , the OVRO data favors an open ( spatially-flat-Lambda ) model with Omega_0 ~= 0.33 ( 0.1 ) .	At the 2 sigma confidence level model normalizations deduced from the OVRO data are mostly consistent with those deduced from the DMR , UCSB South Pole 1994 , Python I-III , ARGO , MAX 4 and 5 , White Dish , and SuZIE data sets .
4	We refer to this system M as minimal sequent calculus .	Gentzen 's classical sequent calculus LK has explicit structural rules for contraction and weakening .	They can be absorbed ( in a right-sided formulation ) by replacing the axiom P , ( not P ) by Gamma , P , ( not P ) for any context Gamma , and replacing the original disjunction rule with Gamma , A , B implies Gamma , ( A or B ) .	This paper presents a classical sequent calculus which is also free of contraction and weakening , but more symmetrically : both contraction and weakening are absorbed into conjunction , leaving the axiom rule intact .	It uses a blended conjunction rule , combining the standard context-sharing and context-splitting rules : Gamma , Delta , A and Gamma , Sigma , B implies Gamma , Delta , Sigma , ( A and B ) .
1	These eruptions are thought to represent key mass loss episodes in the lives of massive stars .	I review recent progress on understanding eruptions of unstable massive stars , with particular attention to the diversity of observed behavior in extragalatic optical transient sources that are generally associated with giant eruptions of luminous blue variables ( LBVs ) .	I discuss the possibility of dormant LBVs and implications for the duration of the greater LBV phase and its role in stellar evolution .	These eruptive variables show a wide range of peak luminosity , decay time , expansion speeds , and progenitor luminosity , and in some cases they have been observed to suffer multiple eruptions .	This broadens our view of massive star eruptions compared to prototypical sources like Eta Carinae , and provides important clues for the nature of the outbursts .
0	Coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) are the most spectacular eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere .	It is generally accepted that CMEs are results of eruptions of magnetic flux ropes ( MFRs ) .	However , a heated debate is on whether MFRs pre-exist before the eruptions or they are formed during the eruptions .	Several coronal signatures , \textit { e.g . } , filaments , coronal cavities , sigmoid structures and hot channels ( or hot blobs ) , are proposed as MFRs and observed before the eruption , which support the pre-existing MFR scenario .	There is almost no reported observation about MFR formation during the eruption .
3	Due to the lack of a common framework it often remains difficult to compare the various hybrid systems conceptually and to evaluate their performance comparatively .	The integration of different learning and adaptation techniques to overcome individual limitations and to achieve synergetic effects through the hybridization or fusion of these techniques has , in recent years , contributed to a large number of new intelligent system designs .	Computational intelligence is an innovative framework for constructing intelligent hybrid architectures involving Neural Networks ( NN ) , Fuzzy Inference Systems ( FIS ) , Probabilistic Reasoning ( PR ) and derivative free optimization techniques such as Evolutionary Computation ( EC ) .	Most of these hybridization approaches , however , follow an ad hoc design methodology , justified by success in certain application domains .	This chapter introduces the different generic architectures for integrating intelligent systems .
1	Previous work on this topic has focused on the integration of inertial and visual information .	Gaze stabilization is an important requisite for humanoid robots .	Little attention has been given to a third component , which is the knowledge that the robot has about its own movement .	In this work we propose a comprehensive framework for gaze stabilization in a humanoid robot .	We focus on the problem of compensating for disturbances induced in the cameras due to self-generated movements of the robot .
2	The continuous homotopy operator automates integration by parts on the jet space .	Using standard calculus , explicit formulas for the one-dimensional continuous and discrete homotopy operators are derived .	It is shown that these formulas are equivalent to those in terms of Euler operators obtained from the variational complex .	Its discrete analogue can be used in applications where summation by parts is essential .	Several examples illustrate the use of the homotopy operators .
4	The first construction , essentially combinatorial , defines a differential graded Lie algebra structure on the simplicial chain complex of the associahedra .	The aim of this work is to construct a cohomology theory controlling the deformations of a general Drinfel 'd algebra .	The task is accomplished in three steps .	The first step is the construction of a modified cobar complex adapted to a non-coassociative comultiplication .	The following two steps each involve a new , highly non-trivial , construction .
3	We show that $ F_L\gg F_R $ and , consequently , $ xF_3\approx F_T $ , where $ F_T $ is the transverse structure function .	We discuss heavy quark contributions to the neutrino-nucleon total cross section at very high energies , well above the real top production threshold .	The top-bottom weak current is found to generate strong left-right asymmetry of neutrino-nucleon interactions .	We separate contributions of different helicity states and make use of the $ \bkappa $ -factorization to derive simple and practically useful formulas for the left-handed ( $ F_L $ ) and right-handed ( $ F_R $ ) components of the conventional structure function $ 2xF_3=F_L-F_R $ in terms of the integrated gluon density .	The conventional structure function $ F_2=F_S+F_T $ at $ Q^2\ll m_t^2 $ appears to be dominated by its scalar ( also known as longitudinal ) component $ F_S $ and the hierarchy $ F_S\gg F_L\gg F_R $ arises naturally .
2	The curvature contribution to the Hessian is non-positive , suggesting a reduced probability of metastability compared to cases in which the derivatives of the K\ '' ahler potential are uncorrelated .	We study the statistics of the metric on K\ '' ahler moduli space in compactifications of string theory on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties .	We find striking hierarchies in the eigenvalues of the metric and of the Riemann curvature contribution to the Hessian matrix : both spectra display heavy tails .	To facilitate our analysis , we have developed a novel triangulation algorithm that allows efficient study of hypersurfaces with $ h^ { 1,1 } $ as large as 25 , which is difficult using algorithms internal to packages such as Sage .	Our results serve as input for statistical studies of the vacuum structure in flux compactifications , and of the distribution of axion decay constants in string theory .
0	First lasing of volume free electron laser ( VFEL ) is described .	The generating system consists of two metal diffraction grating with different spatial periods .	The first grating creates the conditions for Smith Purcell emission mechanism .	The second grating provides the distributed feedback for emitted wave .	The length of diffraction grating is 10 cm .
1	For index 1 saddles of potential energy surfaces ( the case of classical transition state theory ) , the existence of a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold ( NHIM ) of saddle stability type has been shown , where the NHIM serves as the `` anchor '' for the construction of dividing surfaces having the no-recrossing property and minimal flux .	We study the phase space geometry associated with index 2 saddles of a potential energy surface and its influence on reaction dynamics for $ n $ degree-of-freedom ( DoF ) Hamiltonian systems .	For the index 1 saddle case the stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM are co-dimension one in the energy surface , and act as conduits for reacting trajectories in phase space .	The situation for index 2 saddles is quite different .	We show that NHIMs with their stable and unstable manifolds still exist , but that these manifolds by themselves lack sufficient dimension to act as barriers in the energy surface .
0	We introduce a new family of superalgebras $ \overrightarrow { B } _ { r , s } $ for $ r , s \ge 0 $ such that $ r+s & gt ; 0 $ , which we call the walled Brauer superalgebras , and prove the mixed Scur-Weyl-Sergeev duality for queer Lie superalgebras .	More precisely , let $ \mathfrak { q } ( n ) $ be the queer Lie superalgebra , $ { \mathbf V } =\mathbb { C } ^ { n|n } $ the natural representation of $ \mathfrak { q } ( n ) $ and $ { \mathbf W } $ the dual of $ { \mathbf V } $ .	We prove that , if $ n \ge r+s $ , the superalgebra $ \overrightarrow { B } _ { r , s } $ is isomorphic to the supercentralizer algebra $ _ { \mathfrak { q } ( n ) } ( { \mathbf V } ^ { \otimes r } \otimes { \mathbf W } ^ { \otimes s } ) ^ { \op } $ of the $ \mathfrak { q } ( n ) $ -action on the mixed tensor space $ { \mathbf V } ^ { \otimes r } \otimes { \mathbf W } ^ { \otimes s } $ .	As an ingredient for the proof of our main result , we construct a new diagrammatic realization $ \overrightarrow { D } _ { k } $ of the Sergeev superalgebra $ Ser_ { k } $ .	Finally , we give a presentation of $ \overrightarrow { B } _ { r , s } $ in terms of generators and relations .
0	Experiments at electron-positron colliders can search for dark matter particle pair-production in association with a photon .	We estimate the sensitivity of this search at the proposed International Linear Collider ( ILC ) , under a variety of run scenarios .	We employ the effective operator formalism to provide a quasi-model-independent theoretical description of the signal , and present the reach of the ILC in terms of the scale \Lambda suppressing the dark matter-electron coupling operator .	We find that at the 250 GeV center-of-mass energy , the ILC can probe \Lambda up to 1-1.2 TeV , a factor of 2.5-3 above the best current bounds from LEP-2 .	With 1 TeV energy and polarized beams , the reach can be extended to 3-4 TeV .
2	The total flux density recovered from our VLBI image is 0.8 $ \pm $ 0.3 mJy ( one standard deviation ) .	We report on phase-referenced 23 GHz Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry ( VLBI ) observations of the type IIb supernova SN 2008ax , made with the Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) on 2 April 2008 ( 33 days after explosion ) .	These observations resulted in a marginal detection of the supernova .	As it appears , the structure may be interpreted as either a core-jet or a double source .	However , the supernova structure could be somewhat confused with a possible close by noise peak .
0	This paper introduces a family of transportation costs between non-negative measures .	This family is used to obtain parabolic and reaction-diffusion equations with drift , subject to Dirichlet boundary condition , as the gradient flow of the entropy functional $ \int_ { \Omega } \rho\log\rho+V\rho+1\hspace { 1mm } dx $ .	In 2010 , Alessio Figalli and Nicola Gigli introduced a transportation cost that can be used to obtain parabolic equations with drift subject to Dirichlet boundary condition .	However , the drift and the boundary condition are coupled in their work .	The costs in this paper allow the drift and the boundary condition to be detached .
1	This term was formally introduced to Mathematics in 1994 by Gelfand , Kapranov and Zelevinski .	The amoebas associated to algebraic varieties are certain concave regions in the Euclidean space whose shape reminds biological amoebas .	Some traces of amoebas were appearing from time to time , even before the formal introduction , as auxiliary tools in several problems .	After 1994 amoebas have been seen and studied in several areas of mathematics , from algebraic geometry and topology to complex analysis and combinatorics .	In particular , amoebas provided a very powerful tool for studying topology of algebraic varieties .
0	We perform molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the occurrence of inhomogeneous shear flows in soft jammed materials .	We use rough walls to impose a simple shear flow and study the athermal motion of jammed assemblies of soft particles , both for purely repulsive interactions and in the presence of an additional short-range attraction of varying strength .	In steady state , pronounced flow inhomogeneities emerge for all systems when the shear rate becomes small .	Deviations from linear flow are stronger in magnitude and become very long-lived when the strength of the attraction increases , but differ from permanent shear-bands .	Flow inhomogeneities occur in a stress window bounded by the dynamic and static yield stress values .
4	From the calculated results we find that on average the mass transfer rates are lower than traditional estimates by a factor of $ \sim 4 $ .	Thermal timescale mass transfer generally occurs in close binaries where the donor star is more massive than the accreting star .	The mass transfer rates are usually estimated in terms of the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale of the donor star .	But recent investigations indicate that this method may overestimate the real mass transfer rates in accreting white dwarf or neutron star binary systems .	We have systematically investigated the thermal-timescale mass transfer processes in intermediate-mass X-ray binaries , by calculating binary evolution sequences with various initial donor masses and orbital periods .
2	The procedure provides strong control of the family wise error rate and the false discovery rate asymptotically as both the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) and the search space get large , where the search space may grow exponentially as a function of SNR .	This paper considers the problem of detecting equal-shaped non-overlapping unimodal peaks in the presence of Gaussian ergodic stationary noise , where the number , location and heights of the peaks are unknown .	A multiple testing approach is proposed in which , after kernel smoothing , the presence of a peak is tested at each observed local maximum .	Simulations assuming a Gaussian peak shape and a Gaussian autocorrelation function show that desired error levels are achieved for relatively low SNR and are robust to partial peak overlap .	Simulations also show that detection power is maximized when the smoothing bandwidth is close to the bandwidth of the signal peaks , akin to the well-known matched filter theorem in signal processing .
2	Also the chiral nature of U ( 1 ) ' flavor symmetry calls for new U ( 1 ) '-charged Higgs doublets in order for the SM fermions to have realistic renormalizable Yukawa couplings .	We present U ( 1 ) flavor models for leptophobic Z ' with flavor dependent couplings to the right-handed up-type quarks in the Standard Model , which can accommodate the recent data on the top forward-backward ( FB ) asymmetry and the dijet resonance associated with a W boson reported by CDF Collaboration .	Such flavor-dependent leptophobic charge assignments generally require extra chiral fermions for anomaly cancellation .	The stringent constraints from the top FB asymmetry at the Tevatron and the same sign top pair production at the LHC can be evaded due to contributions of the extra Higgs doublets .	We also show that the extension could realize cold dark matter candidates .
4	The question addressed in this paper is regarding the modifications that can be made to the pendulum so that its time-period is independent of amplitude .	The classic simple pendulum is a device which works as a simple harmonic oscillator ( S.H.M . )	only approximately .	The time period remains fixed as long as the amplitude is kept sufficiently small .	This limitation makes it unsatisfactory choice for practical time keeping purposes .
4	The conditions for the giant-vortex formation as well as the internal structure of the vortex cores are discussed .	We predict the formation of giant vortices in quasi-two-dimensional quantum dots at high magnetic fields , i.e. , in rapidly rotating electron droplets .	Our numerical results of quantum dots confined by a flat , anharmonic potential show ground states where vortices are accumulated in the center of the dot , thereby leading to large cores in the electron and current densities .	The phenomenon is analogous to what was recently found in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates .	The giant-vortex states leave measurable signatures in the ground-state energetics .
4	The instability of a magnetic field driven by the electron neutrino asymmetry for the $ \nu $ -burst during the first second of a supernova explosion can amplify a seed magnetic field of a protostar , and , perhaps , can explain the generation of strongest magnetic fields in magnetars .	The magnetohydrodynamics ( MHD ) is modified to incorporate the parity violation in the Standard Model leading to a new instability of magnetic fields in the electroweak plasma in the presence of nonzero neutrino asymmetries .	The main ingredient for such a modified MHD is the antisymmetric part of the photon polarization tensor in plasma , where the parity violating neutrino interaction with charged leptons is present .	We calculate this contribution to the polarization tensor connected with the Chern-Simons term in effective Lagrangian of the electromagnetic field .	The general expression for such a contribution which depends on the temperature and the chemical potential of plasma as well as on the photon 's momentum is derived .
1	Nowadays , the computer games have become one of the most popular forms of entertainment due to their high-level of attraction and accessibility .	Before the computer age , games were played in the physical world where players would have to interact with real objects and each other , triggering a series of emotions .	However , the game industry is always trying to find new ways of making games more interactive and exciting in order to attract new players , and one of the recent trends on the area of human-computer interaction is Biofeedback .	The goal of this dissertation is to study different approaches on the use of indirect biofeedback within videogames , with the purpose of creating a better human-computer interaction , and provide a more appealing and immersive user experience .	For this , we focused on the development of a framework capable of testing different indirect biofeedback models within a specified game , in order to assess the effect of each of these variations on the user experience .
0	With the educated , interested non-specialist as the target audience , we overview what is known and not known about contemporary neutrino physics .	Theory tells us that neutrinos are the second-most common particle in the Universe , behind only the quanta of radiation called photons .	Almost a trillion neutrinos per second enter each human eyeball , and yet we do not see them ; these neutrinos , in roughly equal numbers , are emanations from our Sun and relics of the hot `` big bang '' era of the early Universe .	Much of what we know about neutrinos , and hope to learn in the future , is derived from a unique feature of neutrinos -- `` oscillation '' among neutrino `` flavor '' types .	An initial neutrino flavor will in general oscillate into another flavor as the neutrino propagates in space and time .
1	With the exception of gaps between detector elements , the entire galaxy is surveyed in r ' and i ' , while the J and Ks data extend out to 6 kpc ( 7 disk scale lengths ) .	The spatial distribution of stars in the nearby S0 galaxy NGC 5102 is investigated using images obtained with WIRCam and MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope .	A modest population of main sequence ( MS ) stars with M_V & lt ; -3.5 and ages 70 Myr are detected throughout the disk , with the majority located in the southern half of the galaxy .	The ratio of C stars to bright M giants is consistent with an overall increase in the star formation rate within the past 1 Gyr .	Star-forming activity during the interval 0.1 - 2 Gyr was more centrally concentrated than during the past 100 Myr .
0	The electromagnetic interaction between Ag nanoparticles on the top of the Si substrate and the incident light has been studied by numerical simulations .	It is found that the presence of a dielectric layer with different thickness leads to varied resonance wavelength and scattering cross section , and consequently shifted photocurrent response over all wavelengths .	These different behaviors are determined by whether the dielectric layer is beyond the domain where the near field of nanoparticles takes effect , and geometrical optics effects must be taken into account .	It is revealed that for particle of a certain size , an appropriate dielectric layer thickness is desirable to achieve the best absorption performance .	For a certain thickness of dielectric layer , an appropriate granular size is also desirable .
0	We prove exponential convergence to the invariant measure , in the total variation norm , for solutions of SDEs driven by $ \alpha $ -stable noises in finite and in infinite dimensions .	Two approaches are used .	The first one is based on Harris theorem , and the second on Doeblin 's coupling argument .	Irreducibility , Lyapunov function techniques , and uniform strong Feller property play an essential role in both approaches .	We concentrate on two classes of Markov processes : solutions of finite-dimensional equations , introduced in [ Priola 2010 ] , with H\ '' older continuous drift and a general , non-degenerate , symmetric $ \alpha $ -stable noise , and infinite-dimensional parabolic systems , introduced in [ Priola-Zabczyk 2009 ] , with Lipschitz drift and cylindrical $ \alpha $ -stable noise .
2	The high precision data was obtained for an anisotropic three-dimensional Anderson model with disorder given by a box distribution of width $ W/2 $ .	We compute the number level variance $ \Sigma_ { 2 } $ and the level compressibility $ \chi $ from high precision data for the Anderson model of localization and show that they can be used in order to estimate the critical properties at the metal-insulator transition by means of finite-size scaling .	With $ N $ , $ W $ , and $ L $ denoting , respectively , system size , disorder strength , and the average number of levels in units of the mean level spacing , we find that both $ \chi ( N , W ) $ and the integrated $ \Sigma_ { 2 } $ obey finite-size scaling .	We compute the critical exponent as $ \nu \approx 1.45 \pm 0.12 $ and the critical disorder as $ W_ { \rm c } \approx 8.59 \pm 0.05 $ in agreement with previous transfer-matrix studies in the anisotropic model .	Furthermore , we find $ \chi\approx 0.28 \pm 0.06 $ at the metal-insulator transition in very close agreement with previous results .
2	First , we measure Hanle signals 8 orders of magnitude larger than those predicted by standard theory .	We test the validity of Hanle measurements in three-terminal devices by using aluminum ( Al ) and gold ( Au ) .	The obtained Hanle and inverted Hanle-like curves show an anomalous behavior .	Second , the temperature and voltage dependences of the signal do not match with the tunneling spin polarization of the ferromagnetic contact .	Finally , the spin relaxation times obtained with this method are independent of the choice of the metallic channel .
4	It is found that the stationary heat flux $ J ( N ) \sim N^ { \alpha } $ , and $ \alpha $ depends on the strength of the external potential .	We study the transmission coefficient of a plane wave through a 1D finite quasi-periodic system -- the Frenkel-Kontorova ( FK ) model -- embedding in an infinite uniform harmonic chain .	By varying the mass of atoms in the infinite uniform chain , we obtain the transmission coefficients for { \it all } eigenfrequencies .	The phonon localization of the incommensurated FK chain is also studied in terms of the transmission coefficients and the Thouless exponents .	Moreover , the heat conduction of Rubin-Greer-like model for FK chain at low temperature is calculated .
3	These `` central images '' have long been sought as probes of galactic cores too distant to resolve with ordinary observations .	A galaxy can act as a gravitational lens , producing multiple images of a background object .	Theory predicts there should be an odd number of images but , paradoxically , almost all observed lenses have 2 or 4 images .	The missing image should be faint and appear near the galaxy 's center .	There are five candidates , but in one case the third image is not necessarily a central image , and in the others , the central component might be a foreground source rather than a lensed image .
2	When a specific genotype is only able to influence a few other genotypes , the ecology consists of separate non-interacting clusters in genotype space .	We study the evolution of the network properties of a populated network embedded in a genotype space characterised by either a low or a high number of potential links , with particular emphasis on the connectivity and clustering .	Evolution produces two distinct types of network .	When different types may influence a large number of other sites , the network becomes one large interconnected cluster .	The distribution of interaction strengths -- but not the number of connections -- changes significantly with time .
4	Exploitation of cross-correlation effects has recently led to the development of powerful methods in NMR spectroscopy to study very large biomolecules in solution .	Relaxation effects impose fundamental limitations on our ability to coherently control quantum mechanical phenomena .	In this letter , we establish physical limits on how closely can a quantum mechanical system be steered to a desired target state in the presence of relaxation .	In particular , we explicitly compute the maximum coherence or polarization that can be transferred between coupled nuclear spins in the presence of very general decoherence mechanisms that include cross-correlated relaxation .	We give analytical expressions for the control laws ( pulse sequences ) which achieve these physical limits and provide supporting experimental evidence .
1	The approach we use is based on the Galilei group , where the non-commutativity is seen as a central extension upon identification of the boost generators with the position operator .	We formulate non-relativistic classical and quantum mechanics in the non-commutative two dimensional plane .	We perform a systematic study of the free particle , defined by the symmetries of the space time , which include the no-commutativity .	The symmetries at the classical level are analyzed in terms of Noether 's theorem .	Canonical quantization is presented and the representation of the corresponding Heisenberg algebra is obtained .
3	We show that this quantity is $ \Theta ( \sqrt { n } ) $ , closing a line of incrementally larger lower bounds .	The $ \epsilon $ -approximate degree of a Boolean function $ f : \ { -1 , 1\ } ^n \to \ { -1 , 1\ } $ is the minimum degree of a real polynomial that approximates $ f $ to within $ \epsilon $ in the $ \ell_\infty $ norm .	We prove several lower bounds on this important complexity measure by explicitly constructing solutions to the dual of an appropriate linear program .	Our first result resolves the $ \epsilon $ -approximate degree of the two-level AND-OR tree for any constant $ \epsilon & gt ; 0 $ .	The same lower bound was recently obtained independently by Sherstov using related techniques .
2	We show some general topological properties that the desired max-min solutions shall satisfy .	In this work , our objective is to find out how topological and algebraic properties of unrooted Gaussian tree models determine their security robustness , which is measured by our proposed max-min information ( MaMI ) metric .	Such metric quantifies the amount of common randomness extractable through public discussion between two legitimate nodes under an eavesdropper attack .	Under such properties , we develop conditions under which comparable trees are put together to form partially ordered sets ( posets ) .	Each poset contains the most favorable structure as the poset leader , and the least favorable structure .
0	In this dissertation , we present LaSCO , the Language for Security Constraints on Objects , a new approach to expressing security policies using policy graphs and present a method for enforcing policies so expressed .	Other approaches for stating security policies fall short of what is desirable with respect to either policy clarity , executability , or the precision with which a policy may be expressed .	However , LaSCO is designed to have those three desirable properties of a security policy language as well as : relevance for many different systems , statement of policies at an appropriate level of detail , user friendliness for both casual and expert users , and amenability to formal reasoning .	In LaSCO , the constraints of a policy are stated as directed graphs annotated with expressions describing the situation under which the policy applies and what the requirement is .	LaSCO may be used for such diverse applications as executing programs , file systems , operating systems , distributed systems , and networks .
2	A formulation of the induction equation with a vector potential would solve the problem .	The development of smooth particle magnetohydrodynamic ( SPMHD ) has significantly improved the simulation of complex astrophysical processes .	However , the preservation the solenoidality of the magnetic field is still a severe problem for the MHD .	Unfortunately all previous attempts suffered from instabilities .	In the present work , we evolve the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge and smooth the derived magnetic field for usage in the momentum equation .
4	A phase space time and energy uncertainty relation is derived .	An operational time of arrival is introduced using a realistic position and momentum measurement scheme .	The phase space measurement involves the dynamics of a quantum particle probed by a measuring device .	For such a measurement an operational positive operator valued measure in phase space is introduced and investigated .	In such an operational formalism a quantum mechanical time operator is constructed and analyzed .
4	A possible remedy is CPT violation , which allows different mass spectra for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and hence can accommodate atmospheric , solar and LSND data without a sterile neutrino .	We point out that neutrino events observed at Kamiokande and IMB from SN1987A disfavor the neutrino oscillation parameters preferred by the LSND experiment .	For $ \Delta m^2 & gt ; 0 $ ( the light side ) , the electron neutrinos from the neutronization burst would be lost , while the first event at Kamiokande is quite likely to be due to an electron neutrino .	For $ \Delta m^2 & lt ; 0 $ ( the dark side ) , the average energy of the dominantly $ \bar { \nu } _e $ events is already lower than the theoretical expectations , which would get aggravated by a complete conversion from $ \bar { \nu } _\mu $ to $ \bar { \nu } _e $ .	If taken seriously , the LSND data are disfavored independent of the existence of a sterile neutrino .
0	We detect the second known lambda Bootis star ( HD 54272 ) which exhibits gamma Doradus-type pulsations .	The star was formerly misidentified as a RR Lyrae variable .	The lambda Bootis stars are a small group ( only 2 per cent ) of late B to early F-type , Population I stars which show moderate to extreme ( up to a factor 100 ) surface underabundances of most Fe-peak elements and solar abundances of lighter elements ( C , N , O , and S ) .	The photometric data from the Wide Angle Search for Planets ( WASP ) and All Sky Automated Survey ( ASAS ) projects were analysed .	They have an overlapping time base of 1566 d and 2545 d , respectively .
2	Here we report the first observation of this new valley Hall effect ( VHE ) .	Electrons in 2-dimensional crystals with a honeycomb lattice structure possess a new valley degree of freedom ( DOF ) in addition to charge and spin .	Each valley is predicted to exhibit a Hall effect in the absence of a magnetic field whose sign depends on the valley index , but to date this effect has not been observed .	Monolayer MoS2 transistors are illuminated by circularly polarized light which preferentially excites electrons into a specific valley , and a finite anomalous Hall voltage is observed whose sign is controlled by the helicity of the light .	Its magnitude is consistent with theoretical predictions of the VHE , and no anomalous Hall effect is observed in bilayer devices due to the restoration of crystal inversion symmetry .
1	However , such a success is essentially limited to qualitative data characterization , identification and analysis ( CIA ) .	Persistent homology provides a new approach for the topological simplification of big data via measuring the life time of intrinsic topological features in a filtration process and has found its success in scientific and engineering applications .	In this work , we outline a general protocol to construct objective-oriented persistent homology methods .	The minimization of the objective functional leads to a Laplace-Beltrami operator which generates a multiscale representation of the initial data and offers an objective oriented filtration process .	The resulting differential geometry based objective-oriented persistent homology is able to preserve desirable geometric features in the evolutionary filtration and enhances the corresponding topological persistence .
4	Due to integrability in the matrix model , it is possible to analytically compute ( fixed integer ) finite N results .	Due to instanton effects , gauge-theoretic large N expansions yield asymptotic series , in powers of 1/N^2 .	The present work shows how to generically make such expansions meaningful via their completion into resurgent transseries , encoding both perturbative and nonperturbative data .	Large N resurgent transseries compute gauge-theoretic finite N results nonperturbatively ( no matter how small N is ) .	Explicit calculations are carried out within the gauge theory prototypical example of the quartic matrix model .
4	State-resolved diffraction oscillations in the differential cross sections are measured with an angular resolution approaching 0.3 $ ^\circ $ .	We present ultrahigh-resolution measurements of state-to-state inelastic differential cross sections for NO-Ne and NO-Ar collisions , obtained by combining the Stark deceleration and velocity map imaging techniques .	We show that for counterpropagating crossed beam geometries , the effect of the velocity spreads of the reagent beams on the angular resolution of the images is minimized .	Futhermore , the counterpropagating geometry results in images that are symmetric with respect to the relative velocity vector .	This allows for the use of inverse Abel transformation methods that enhance the resolution further .
2	The scattering of rho meson due to this potential provides valuable informations about the $ \rho N $ resonance dynamics in a nucleus .	The strong coupling of rho meson to the nucleon produces $ s $ and $ p $ wave rho meson nucleon $ ( \rho N ) $ resonances .	In a nucleus , the $ \rho N $ resonance-hole polarization generates the optical potential or self-energy for the rho meson .	To investigate it , we use this potential to calculate the mass distribution spectrum for the $ \rho $ meson produced coherently in the proton nucleus reaction .	The cross sections arising due to $ s $ and $ p $ wave $ \rho N $ resonances have been presented .
0	The quasiparticle states found in the vortex core of a high-T $ _ { \rm { c } } $ cuprate superconductor may be probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy .	Results of such experiments have revealed typical spectra that are quite different from what is seen in conventional low-Tc superconductors .	In particular the Caroli-deGennes-Matricon state at $ E\sim 0 $ in the core center is not seen .	Instead , in a high-T $ _ { \rm { c } } $ vortex core , quasiparticle states are found at energies that are at a sizable fraction of the gap energy .	One explanation for this could be that a finite amplitude of a competing orderparameter stabilizes in the vortex-core center .
4	Finally , by means of the modified mapping we show that a large class of three-dimensional Ising models are precisely equivalent , in the time continuum limit , to particular quantum dimer models .	Motivated by recent interest in 2+1 dimensional quantum dimer models , we revisit Fisher 's mapping of two dimensional Ising models to hardcore dimer models .	First , we note that the symmetry breaking transition of the ferromagetic Ising model maps onto a non-symmetry breaking transition in dimer language -- instead it becomes a deconfinement transition for test monomers .	Next , we introduce a modification of Fisher 's mapping in which a second dimer model , also equivalent to the Ising model , is defined on a generically different lattice derived from the dual .	In contrast to Fisher 's original mapping , this enables us to reformulate frustrated Ising models as dimer models with positive weights and we illustrate this by providing a new solution of the fully frustrated Ising model on the square lattice .
4	Convergence properties of the sum rules are deduced from a general analysis of the form of the counterterms in the presence of electromagnetic spurions .	We pursue the analysis of a set of generalized DGMLY sum rules for the electromagnetic chiral parameters at order $ e^2p^2 $ and discuss implications for effective Lagrangians with resonances .	We exploit a formalism in which charge spurions are introduced and treated as sources .	We show that no inconsistency arises from anomalies up to quadratic order in the spurions .	We focus on the sum rules associated with QCD 4-point correlators which were not analyzed in detail before .
1	The observation probability of target state is not improved by designing unitary transform , but oracle function .	In order to research the security of the knapsack problem under quantum algorithm attack , we study the quantum algorithm for knapsack problem over Z_r based on the relation between the dimension of the knapsack vector and r. First , the oracle function is designed based on the knapsack vector B and S , and the quantum algorithm for the knapsack problem over Z_r is presented .	Its complexity is polynomial .	And its success probability depends on the relation between n and r. From the above discussion , we give the essential condition for the knapsack problem over Z_r against the existing quantum algorithm attacks , i.e.r & lt ; O ( 2^n ) .	Then we analyze the security of the Chor-Rivest public-key crypto .
1	This is inspired by the observation of the 1/2 vortex in high-temperature superconductors ( Kirtley , et al , Phys.Rev.Lett .	The spectrum of the fermion zero modes in the vicinity of the vortex with fractional winding number is discussed .	76 ( 1996 ) 1336 ) .	The fractional value of the winding number leads to the fractional value of the invariant , which describes the topology of the energy spectrum of fermions .	This results in the phenomenon of the `` half-crossing '' : the spectrum approaches zero but does not cross it , being captured at the zero energy level .
4	It is shown that the m/T-expansion converges quickly and provides an accurate description of the thermodynamic functions for large values of the coupling constant .	The thermodynamics of massless phi^4-theory is studied within screened perturbation theory ( SPT ) .	In this method the perturbative expansion is reorganized by adding and subtracting a mass term in the Lagrangian .	We analytically calculate the pressure and entropy to three-loop order and the screening mass to two-loop order , expanding in powers of m/T .	The truncated m/T-expansion results are compared with numerical SPT results for the pressure , entropy and screening mass which are accurate to all orders in m/T .
1	This improvement in resolution can potentially improve the photometry of faint stars in extremely crowded fields significantly by alleviating crowding .	The EMCCD is a type of CCD that delivers fast readout times and negligible readout noise , making it an ideal detector for high frame rate applications which improve resolution , like lucky imaging or shift-and-add .	Alleviating crowding is a prerequisite for observing gravitational microlensing in main sequence stars towards the galactic bulge .	However , the photometric stability of this device has not been assessed .	The EMCCD has sources of noise not found in conventional CCDs , and new methods for handling these must be developed .
3	First , we present an overview of the RF-EHNs including system architecture , RF energy harvesting techniques and existing applications .	Radio frequency ( RF ) energy transfer and harvesting techniques have recently become alternative methods to power the next generation wireless networks .	As this emerging technology enables proactive energy replenishment of wireless devices , it is advantageous in supporting applications with quality of service ( QoS ) requirement .	In this paper , we present an extensive literature review on the research progresses in wireless networks with RF energy harvesting capability , referred to as RF energy harvesting networks ( RF-EHNs ) .	Then , we present the background in circuit design as well as the state-of-the-art circuitry implementations , and review the communication protocols specially designed for RF-EHNs .
3	The weight distribution of the relevant cyclic code $ \mathcal { C } $ over $ \mathbb { F } _p $ with the length $ N $ and the dimension $ { \rm dim } _ { \mathbb { F } _p } \mathcal { C } =2n $ is also derived .	In this paper , for an odd prime $ p $ such that $ p\equiv 3\bmod 4 $ , odd $ n $ , and $ d= ( p^n+1 ) / ( p^k+1 ) + ( p^n-1 ) /2 $ with $ k|n $ , the value distribution of the exponential sum $ S ( a , b ) $ is calculated as $ a $ and $ b $ run through $ \mathbb { F } _ { p^n } $ .	The sequence family $ \mathcal { G } $ in which each sequence has the period of $ N=p^n-1 $ is also constructed .	The family size of $ \mathcal { G } $ is $ p^n $ and the correlation magnitude is roughly upper bounded by $ ( p^k+1 ) \sqrt { N } /2 $ .	Our result includes the case in \cite { Xia } as a special case .
3	The development of plateau , the solution of self-consistency condition , is seen in both ansatz .	The spontaneous breakdown of SO ( 10 ) symmetry of the IIB matrix model has been studied by using the improved mean field approximation ( IMFA ) .	In this report , the eighth-order contribution to the improved perturbative series is obtained , which involves evaluation of 20410 planar two-particle irreducible vacuum diagrams .	We consider SO ( d ) -preserving configurations as ansatz ( d=4,7 ) .	The large ratio of the space-time extent of d-dimensional part against the remaining ( 10-d ) -dimensional part is obtained for SO ( 4 ) ansatz evaluated at the representative points of the plateau .
4	In greater dimensions , we make the first steps towards such a classification by showing that M is a fibration ( with singularities ) by flat Riemannian manifolds ; up to a finite covering of M , we may assume that these manifolds are flat tori .	A similarity structure on a connected manifold M is a Riemannian metric on its universal cover such that the fundamental group of M acts by similarities .	If the manifold M is compact , we show that the universal cover admits a de Rham decomposition with at most two factors , one of which is Euclidean .	Very recently , after Belgun and Moroianu conjectured that the number of factors was at most one , Matveev and Nikolayevsky found an example with two factors .	When the non-flat factor has dimension 2 , we give a complete classification of the examples with two factors .
2	Assuming that the last ones can be expanded into series with respect to the inverse spectral parameter we calculate matrix elements of the local operators in the basis of the transfer matrix eigenstates .	We study integrable models solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and possessing the GL ( 3 ) -invariant R-matrix .	We consider a composite model where the total monodromy matrix of the model is presented as a product of two partial monodromy matrices .	We obtain determinant representations for these matrix elements .	Thus , we solve the inverse scattering problem in a weak sense .
1	This class of persistence modules frequently appears in topological data analysis , and the theory and algorithm proposed in this paper can be applied to these practical problems .	We study persistence modules defined on commutative ladders .	A new algebraic framework deals with persistence modules as representations on associative algebras and the Auslander-Reiten theory is applied to develop the theoretical and algorithmic foundations .	In particular , we prove that the commutative ladders of length less than 5 are representation-finite and explicitly show their Auslander-Reiten quivers .	Furthermore , a generalization of persistence diagrams is introduced by using Auslander-Reiten quivers .
4	The foreseen effects are used to establish upper bounds on the Lorentz-violating coefficients .	The influence of Lorentz- and CPT-violating terms of the extended Standard Model on a semi-classical two-level system is analyzed .	It is shown that the Lorentz-violating background ( when coupled with the fermion sector in a vector way ) is able to induce modifications on the Rabi oscillation pattern , promoting sensitive modulations on the usual oscillations .	As for the term involving the coefficient coupled in an axial vector way , it brings about oscillations both on energy states and on the spin states ( implied by the background ) .	It is also seen that such backgrounds are able to yield state oscillations even in the absence of the electromagnetic field .
2	We show that each migration mechanism is characterized by a specific law of orbital angular momentum exchange .	We investigate the secular dynamics of two-planet coplanar systems evolving under mutual gravitational interactions and dissipative forces .	We consider two mechanisms responsible for the planetary migration : star-planet ( or planet-satellite ) tidal interactions and interactions of a planet with a gaseous disc .	Calculating stationary solutions of the conservative secular problem and taking into account the orbital angular momentum leakage , we trace the evolutionary routes followed by the planet pairs during the migration process .	This procedure allows us to recover the dynamical history of two-planet systems and constrain parameters of the involved physical processes .
3	The spatial process is assumed to satisfy some very general mixing conditions , generalizing classical time-series strong mixing concepts .	A local linear kernel estimator of the regression function x\mapsto g ( x ) : =E [ Y_i|X_i=x ] , x\in R^d , of a stationary ( d+1 ) -dimensional spatial process { ( Y_i , X_i ) , i\in Z^N } observed over a rectangular domain of the form I_n : = { i= ( i_1 , ... , i_N ) \in Z^N| 1\leq i_k\leq n_k , k=1 , ... , N } , n= ( n_1 , ... , n_N ) \in Z^N , is proposed and investigated .	Under mild regularity assumptions , asymptotic normality of the estimators of g ( x ) and its derivatives is established .	Appropriate choices of the bandwidths are proposed .	The size of the rectangular domain I_n is allowed to tend to infinity at different rates depending on the direction in Z^N .
1	A new design of precoding and detection matrices for MIMO-NOMA is proposed and its performance is analyzed for the case with a fixed set of power allocation coefficients .	This paper considers the application of multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) techniques to non-orthogonal multiple access ( NOMA ) systems .	To further improve the performance gap between MIMO-NOMA and conventional orthogonal multiple access schemes , user pairing is applied to NOMA and its impact on the system performance is characterized .	More sophisticated choices of power allocation coefficients are also proposed to meet various quality of service requirements .	Finally computer simulation results are provided to facilitate the performance evaluation of MIMO-NOMA and also demonstrate the accuracy of the developed analytical results .
3	These helical conductors exhibit strong nonlocal transport signals and suppressed backscattering due to the opposite spin polarizations of the counterpropagating modes .	A quantum Hall edge state provides a rich foundation to study electrons in 1-dimension ( 1d ) but is limited to chiral propagation along a single direction .	Here , we demonstrate a versatile platform to realize new 1d systems made by combining quantum Hall edge states of opposite chiralities in a graphene electron-hole bilayer .	Using this approach , we engineer helical 1d edge conductors where the counterpropagating modes are localized in separate electron and hole layers by a tunable electric field .	Moreover , we investigate these electron-hole bilayers in the fractional quantum Hall regime , where we observe conduction through fractional and integer edge states of opposite chiralities , paving the way towards the realization of 1d helical systems with fractional quantum statistics .
1	These themes all tie together as a set of practical skills in scientific measurement , analysis , and experimentation .	In a recent report , the American Association of Physics Teachers has developed an updated set of recommendations for curriculum of undergraduate physics labs.1 This document focuses on six major themes : constructing knowledge , modeling , designing experiments , developing technical and practical laboratory skills , analyzing and visualizing data , and communicating physics .	In addition to teaching students how to use these skills , it is important for students to know when to use them so that they can use them autonomously .	This requires , especially in the case of analytical skills , high-levels of inquiry behaviours to reflect on data and iterate measurements , which students rarely do in lab experiments .	In this paper , we describe a simple framework for structuring the critical thinking and inquiry behaviours relevant to lab work , which focuses on iterative cycles of comparisons between data sets .
0	Fake online pharmacies have become increasingly pervasive , constituting over 90 % of online pharmacy websites .	There is a need for fake website detection techniques capable of identifying fake online pharmacy websites with a high degree of accuracy .	In this study , we compared several well-known link-based detection techniques on a large-scale test bed with the hyperlink graph encompassing over 80 million links between 15.5 million web pages , including 1.2 million known legitimate and fake pharmacy pages .	We found that the QoC and QoL class propagation algorithms achieved an accuracy of over 90 % on our dataset .	The results revealed that algorithms that incorporate dual class propagation as well as inlink and outlink information , on page-level or site-level graphs , are better suited for detecting fake pharmacy websites .
2	This is a serious concern for radio estimates of the local star formation rate density , as a substantial fraction of the ultraviolet luminosity density is generated by sub-L* galaxies at low redshifts .	( abridged ) We present multiwavelength observations for a large sample of microjansky radio sources detected in ultradeep 1.4GHz maps centered on the Hubble Deep Field-North ( HDF-N ) and the Hawaii Survey Fields SSA13 and SSA22 .	Our spectroscopic redshifts for 169 radio sources reveal a flat median redshift distribution , and these sources are hosted by similarly luminous optical L* galaxies , regardless of redshift .	From our submillimeter measurements for 278 radio sources , we find error-weighted mean 850micron fluxes of 1.72 $ \pm $ 0.09 mJy for the total sample , 2.37 $ \pm $ 0.13 mJy for the optically-faint ( I & gt ; 23.5 ) subsample , and 1.04 $ \pm $ 0.13 mJy for the optically-bright ( I & lt ; 23.5 ) subsample .	We significantly ( & gt ; 3\sigma ) detect in the submillimeter 50 of the radio sources , 38 with I & gt ; 23.5 .
1	The masses were obtained from a weak lensing analysis of deep F814W images obtained using the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) .	We present measurements of the masses of a sample of 25 moderate X-ray luminosity clusters of galaxies from the 160 square degree ROSAT survey .	We present an accurate empirical correction for the effect of charge transfer ( in ) efficiency on the shapes of faint galaxies .	A significant lensing signal is detected around most of the clusters .	The lensing mass correlates tightly with the cluster richness .
2	We construct an NXB database by collecting XIS events when the dark Earth covers the XIS FOV .	One of the advantages of the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer ( XIS ) system on board Suzaku is its low and stable non-X-ray background ( NXB ) .	In order to make the best use of this advantage , modeling the NXB spectra with high accuracy is important to subtract them from the spectra of on-source observations .	The total exposure time of the NXB data is about 785 ks for each XIS .	It is found that the count rate of the NXB anti-correlates with the cut-off-rigidity and correlates with the count rate of the PIN upper discriminator ( PIN-UD ) in Hard X-ray Detector on board Suzaku .
4	To answer these questions , we build up a framework for the L1-synthesis method .	An interesting topic in compressed sensing aims to recover signals with sparse representations in a dictionary .	Recently the performance of the L1-analysis method has been a focus , while some fundamental problems for the L1-synthesis method are still unsolved .	For example , what are the conditions for it to stably recover compressible signals under noise ?	Whether coherent dictionaries allow the existence of sensing matrices that guarantee good performances of the L1-synthesis method ?
0	We show how to use polar molecules in an optical lattice to engineer quantum spin models with arbitrary spin S & gt ; = 1/2 and with interactions featuring a direction-dependent spin anisotropy .	This is achieved by encoding the effective spin degrees of freedom in microwave-dressed rotational states of the molecules and by coupling the spins through dipolar interactions .	We demonstrate how one of the experimentally most accessible anisotropies stabilizes symmetry protected topological phases in spin ladders .	Using the numerically exact density matrix renormalization group method , we find that these interacting phases -- previously studied only in the nearest-neighbor case -- survive in the presence of long-range dipolar interactions .	We also show how to use our approach to realize the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 and the Kitaev honeycomb models .
0	Laser induced ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic metals was discovered almost 20 years ago , but currently there is still lack of consensus on the microscopic mechanism responsible for the corresponding transfer of angular momentum and energy between electron , lattice and spin subsystems .	A distinct , but intrinsically correlated phenomenon occurring on a longer timescale is the magnetization precession after the ultrafast demagnetization process , if a magnetic field is applied to tilt the magnetization vector away from its easy direction , which can be attributed to the change of anisotropy after laser heating .	In an in-plane magnetized Pt/Co/Pt thin film with perpendicular interface anisotropy , we found excellent agreement between theoretical prediction with plausible parameters and experimental data measured using time resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect .	This agreement confirms that the time evolution of the anisotropy field , which is driven by the interaction between electrons and phonons , determines the magnetization precession completely .	A detailed analysis shows that , even though the whole sample is magnetized in-plane , the dynamic interface anisotropy field dictates the initial phase of the magnetization precession , highlighting the significance of the interface anisotropy field in laser induced magnetization precession .
3	Our proof uses a multivariate extension of the techniques introduced by Dehling , Durieu and Voln\'y \cite { DehDurVol09 } in the univariate case .	We establish a multivariate empirical process central limit theorem for stationary $ \R^d $ -valued stochastic processes $ ( X_i ) _ { i\geq 1 } $ under very weak conditions concerning the dependence structure of the process .	As an application we can prove the empirical process CLT for ergodic torus automorphisms .	Our results also apply to Markov chains and dynamical systems having a spectral gap on some Banach space of functions .	As an important technical ingredient , we prove a $ ( 2p ) $ th moment bound for partial sums in multiple mixing systems .
2	We further construct analytic functions interpolating Heegner points in the anticyclotomic variables , and obtain a version of our formula for them .	We prove a general formula for the p-adic heights of Heegner points on modular abelian varieties with potentially ordinary ( good or semistable ) reduction at the primes above p. The formula is in terms of the cyclotomic derivative of a Rankin-Selberg p-adic L-function , which we construct .	It generalises previous work of Perrin-Riou , Howard , and the author , to the context of the work of Yuan-Zhang-Zhang on the archimedean Gross-Zagier formula and of Waldspurger on toric periods .	It is complemented , when the relevant root number is +1 rather than -1 , by an anticyclotomic version of the Waldspurger formula .	When combined with work of Fouquet , the anticyclotomic Gross-Zagier formula implies one divisibility in a p-adic Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture in anticyclotomic families .
1	The fluctuation exchange ( FLEX ) approximatoin is employed to calculate the spin fluctuations and the superconducting gap functions self-consistently in the optimal- and over-doped regions of hole concentration .	The superconducting state of a two-dimensional d-p model is studied from the spin fluctuation point of view by using a strong coupling theory .	The gap function has a symmetry of d_ { x^2 - y^2 } type and develops below the transition temperature T_c more rapidly than in the BCS model .	Its saturation value at the maximum is about 10 T_c .	When the spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity is well stabilized at low temperatures in the optimal regime , the imaginary part of the antiferromagnetic spin susceptibility shows a very sharp resonance peak reminiscent of the 41 meV peak observed in the neutron scattering experiment on YBCO .
3	A natural logical pursuit of this early work was to show that , in order to have a superconducting state evolved out of a pseudogap state , the diamagnetic bosonic pair fluctuations ( characterizing the pseudogap phase ) have to be propagating modes , which are phase correlated over finite distances above Tc .	In a recent preprint [ 0803.3052 ] A. Kanigel et al report evidence for Bogoliubov-type excitations in the pseudogap phase in the anti-nodal region , where a robust pseudogap remains well above Tc .	This important experimental result has been theoretically predicted by us almost 6 years ago on a basis of the phenomenological boson fermion model .	An earlier theoretical prediction on the basis of this model was that of a pseudogap in the electron DOS , setting in at some temperature T* and evolving into the superconducting gap upon approaching Tc .	If so , then the pseudogap feature has to be reflected in characteristic features of the single particle excitations , showing remnants of the Bogoliubov modes inherent in the superconducting phase .
3	When measured with particles of different pt , the magnitude of the factorization breakdown for the second Fourier harmonic reaches 20 % for very central PbPb collisions but decreases rapidly as the multiplicity decreases .	A systematic study of the factorization of long-range azimuthal two-particle correlations into a product of single-particle anisotropies is presented as a function of pt and eta of both particles , and as a function of the particle multiplicity in PbPb and pPb collisions .	The data were taken with the CMS detector for PbPb collisions at sqrt ( s [ NN ] ) = 2.76 TeV and pPb collisions at sqrt ( s [ NN ] ) = 5.02 TeV , covering a very wide range of multiplicity .	Factorization is observed to be broken as a function of both particle pt and eta .	The data are consistent with viscous hydrodynamic predictions , which suggest that the effect of factorization breaking is mainly sensitive to the initial-state conditions rather than to the transport properties ( e.g. , shear viscosity ) of the medium .
4	Consequently the inter-grain critical current density ( Jc ) , upturn curvature near the Tc in temperature dependence of upper critical field [ BC2 ( T ) ] , and BC2 are enhanced .	Here we present the magnetic properties and upper critical field ( BC2 ) of polycrystalline Y ( Ba1-xSrx ) 2Cu3O7- { \delta } superconductors , which are being determined through detailed ac/dc susceptibility and resistivity under magnetic field ( RTH ) study .	All the samples are synthesized through solid state reaction route .	Reduction in Meissner fraction ( the ratio of field cooled to zero field cooled magnetization ) is observed with increasing Sr content , suggesting occurrence of flux pining in the doped samples .	The ac susceptibility and resistivity measurements reveal improved grain couplings in Sr substituted samples .
1	The multigrid convergence behavior is known to strongly depend on whether the discretization grid is aligned or non-aligned with the anisotropic direction and analyses in the paper will be mainly focused on two-level algorithms .	This paper is devoted to the multigrid convergence analysis for the linear systems arising from the conforming linear finite element discretization of the second order elliptic equations with anisotropic diffusion .	For an aligned grid case , a lower bound is given for point-wise smoother which shows deterioration of convergence rate .	In both aligned and non-aligned cases we show that for a specially designed block smoother the convergence is uniform with respect to both anisotropy ratio and mesh size in the energy norm .	The analysis is complemented with numerical experiments which confirm the theoretical results
4	Our analysis reveals problem-dependent quantities that govern the speedups of our methods over BCFW .	We develop parallel and distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithms ; the former on shared memory machines with mini-batching , and the latter in a delayed update framework .	Whenever possible , we perform computations asynchronously , which helps attain speedups on multicore machines as well as in distributed environments .	Moreover , instead of worst-case bounded delays , our methods only depend ( mildly ) on \emph { expected } delays , allowing them to be robust to stragglers and faulty worker threads .	Our algorithms assume block-separable constraints , and subsume the recent Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe ( BCFW ) method~\citep { lacoste2013block } .
0	As is well known in electrolyte theory , electrostatic fields are attenuated by the presence of mobile charges in the solution .	This seems to limit the possibility of an electrostatic repulsion model of biological interactions such as cell division .	Here , a system of two charges in an ionic solution is considered .	It is found that in the context of the symmetries of the system , the electrostatic repulsion between the two is considerably increased as compared to the electrostatic repulsion between two bare charges in a dielectric .	This increase in repulsion , directly resulting from interactions between the symmetrical parts of the system , was found to be dependent on the magnitude of the charges and the separation between them .
2	In most cases the solution is explored via Monte Carlo sampling or variational methods .	Data clustering , including problems such as finding network communities , can be put into a systematic framework by means of a Bayesian approach .	The application of Bayesian approaches to real problems can be , however , quite challenging .	Here we work further on the application of variational methods to clustering problems .	We introduce generative models based on a hidden group structure and prior distributions .
3	This property results in great simplification of the governing partial differential equations .	The gravitational interaction is scale-free in both Newtonian gravity and general theory of relativity .	The concept of self-similarity arises from this nature .	Self-similar solutions reproduce themselves as the scale changes .	In addition , some self-similar solutions can describe the asymptotic behaviors of more general solutions .
4	In this paper , we describe a methodology for the computer simulation of site-disordered solids , based on the consideration of configurational ensembles and statistical mechanics , where the number of occupancy configurations is reduced by taking advantage of the crystal symmetry of the lattice .	Site-occupancy disorder , defined as the non-periodic occupation of lattice sites in a crystal structure , is a ubiquitous phenomenon in solid-state physics and chemistry .	Examples are mineral solid solutions , synthetic non-stoichiometric compounds and metal alloys .	The experimental investigation of these materials using diffraction techniques only provides averaged information of their structure .	However , many properties of interest in these solids are determined by the local geometry and degree of disorder , which escape an `` average crystal '' description , either from experiments or from theory .
3	In particular , we are now able to confirm that many , but not all , lines of sight with shallow far-UV extinction curves and large values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio , $ R_V $ = $ A_V $ / $ E ( B-V ) $ -- characteristic of larger than average dust grains -- are associated with particularly low hydrogen molecular fractions ( $ f_ { \rm H2 } $ ) .	We report total abundances and related parameters for the full sample of the FUSE survey of molecular hydrogen in 38 translucent lines of sight .	New results are presented for the `` second half '' of the survey involving 15 lines of sight to supplement data for the first 23 lines of sight already published .	We assess the correlations between molecular hydrogen and various extinction parameters in the full sample , which covers a broader range of conditions than the initial sample .	In the lines of sight with large $ R_V $ , there is in fact a wide range in molecular fractions , despite the expectation that the larger grains should lead to less H $ _2 $ formation .
3	We report on the development and on the preliminary tests of a new prototype detector based on Silicon Drift Detectors technology and the SIRIO ultra low noise front-end ASIC .	The XAFS beamline at Elettra Synchrotron in Trieste combines X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to provide chemically specific structural information of materials .	It operates in the energy range 2.4-27 keV by using a silicon double reflection Bragg monochromator .	The fluorescence measurement is performed in place of the absorption spectroscopy when the sample transparency is too low for transmission measurements or the element to study is too diluted in the sample .	The new system will be able to reduce drastically the time needed to perform fluorescence measurements , while keeping a short dead time and maintaining an adequate energy resolution to perform spectroscopy .
4	Owing to the formal similarity between the heat fluxes balance equations for a thermoelectric generator ( TEG ) and those for Feynman 's ratchet , we introduce a distribution parameter that quantifies the amount of heat that flows through the cold and hot sides of both heat engines .	We show how the formalism used for thermoelectric transport may be adapted to Smoluchowski 's seminal thought experiment also known as Feynman 's ratchet and pawl system .	Our analysis rests on the notion of useful flux , which for a thermoelectric system is the electrical current and for Feynman 's ratchet is the effective jump frequency .	Our approach yields original insight into the derivation and analysis of the system 's properties .	In particular we define an entropy per tooth in analogy with the entropy per carrier or Seebeck coefficient , and we derive the analogue to Kelvin 's second relation for Feynman 's ratchet .
2	The data are compared with QCD predictions for various sets of parton distribution functions .	The inclusive jet differential cross section has been measured for jet transverse energies , $ E_T $ , from 15 to 440 GeV , in the pseudorapidity region 0.1 $ \leq | \eta| \leq $ 0.7 .	The results are based on 19.5 pb $ ^ { -1 } $ of data collected by the CDF collaboration at the Fermilab Tevatron collider .	The cross section for jets with $ E_T & gt ; 200 $ GeV is significantly higher than current predictions based on O ( $ \alpha_s^3 $ ) perturbative QCD calculations .	Various possible explanations for the high- $ E_T $ excess are discussed .
4	And as in the ordinary case , the same-channel differential cross section diverges in the forward direction due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect , resulting in an infinite total cross section but finite transport and skew cross sections .	We consider an isolated vortex in the two-dimensional proximity-induced superconducting state formed at the interface of a three-dimensional strong topological insulator ( TI ) and an s-wave superconductor ( sSC ) .	Prior calculations of the bound states of this system famously revealed a zero-energy state that is its own conjugate , a Majorana fermion bound to the vortex core .	We calculate , not the bound states , but the scattering states of this system , and ask how the spin-momentum-locked massless Dirac form of the single-particle Hamiltonian , inherited from the TI surface , affects the cross section for scattering Bogoliubov quasiparticles from the vortex .	As in the case of an ordinary superconductor , this is a two-channel problem with the vortex mixing particle-like and hole-like excitations .
3	In theories with additional matter fields , R-parity can be broken collectively , such that R-parity is not broken by any single coupling , but only by an ensemble of couplings .	Supersymmetric theories with an R-parity generally yield a striking missing energy signature , with cascade decays concluding in a neutralino that escapes the detector .	In theories where R-parity is broken the missing energy is replaced with additional jets or leptons , often making traditional search strategies ineffective .	Such R-parity violation is very constrained , however , by resulting B and L violating signals , requiring couplings so small that LSPs will decay outside the detector in all but a few scenarios .	Cascade decays can proceed normally , with each step only sensitive to one or two couplings at a time , but B and L violation requires the full set , yielding a highly suppressed constraint .
2	The detection of hadronic ionization signatures in spatial coincidence with gamma ray signatures can help to unambiguously identify supernova remnants as sources of cosmic ray protons .	Context : Since a few years , signatures of supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds have been detected in gamma rays .	Whether these gamma rays are generated by cosmic ray electrons or by cosmic ray protons is usually not known .	Methods : In order to calculate hadronic signatures from cosmic ray-induced ionization for an examination of the origin of the observed gamma rays , the transport equation for cosmic ray protons propagating in a molecular cloud , including the relevant momentum loss processes , is solved analytically and the proton flux at any position in the cloud is determined .	Results : Since the solution of the transport equation is obtained for arbitrary source functions , it can be used for a variety of supernova remnants .
0	We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a superfluid Bose-Fermi mixture by introducing a set of coupled Galilei-invariant nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger equations valid from weak-coupling to unitarity .	The Bose dynamics is described by a Gross-Pitaevskii-type equation including beyond-mean-field corrections possessing the correct weak-coupling and unitarity limits .	The dynamics of the two-component Fermi superfluid is described by a density-functional equation including beyond-mean-field terms with correct weak-coupling and unitarity limits .	The present set of equations is equivalent to the equations of generalized superfluid hydrodynamics , which take into account also surface effects .	The equations describe the mixture properly as the Bose-Bose repulsive ( positive ) and Fermi-Fermi attractive ( negative ) scattering lengths are varied from zero to infinity in the presence of a Bose-Fermi interaction .
2	We calculate one-loop radiative corrections to the mass parameters which produce mass terms for the neutral leptons .	We analyse two cases of the minimal extension of the Standard Model when one or two right-handed fields are added to the three left-handed fields .	A second Higgs doublet ( two Higgs doublet model - 2HDM ) is included in our model .	In both cases we numerically analyse light neutrino masses as functions of the heavy neutrino masses .	Parameters of the model are varied to find light neutrino masses that are compatible with experimental data of solar and atmospheric neutrino mass differences for normal hierarchy .
0	We discuss the production of top -- anti-top quark pairs in association with a hard jet at the Tevatron and at the LHC and we report on the calculation of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to this process .	Numerical results for the top -- anti-top+jet cross section and the forward -- backward charge asymmetry are presented .	The corrections stabilize the leading-order prediction for the cross section .	In contrast , the charge asymmetry receives large corrections .	The dependence of the cross section as well as the asymmetry on the minimum transverse momenta used to define the additional jet is studied in detail for the Tevatron .
0	Based on observational constraints on large scale structure and halo structure , dark matter is generally taken to be cold and essentially collisionless .	On the other hand , given the large number of particles and forces in the visible world , a more complex dark sector could be a reasonable or even likely possibility .	This hypothesis leads to testable consequences , perhaps portending the discovery of a rich hidden world neighboring our own .	We consider a scenario that readily satisfies current bounds that we call Partially Interacting Dark Matter ( PIDM ) .	This scenario contains self-interacting dark matter , but it is not the dominant component .
4	The total reaction cross sections for Mg $ +^ { 12 } $ C , Si $ +^ { 12 } $ C and S $ +^ { 12 } $ C cases are predicted for future measurements .	A systematic analysis is made on the total reaction cross sections for Ne , Mg , Si , and S isotopes .	The high-energy nucleus-nucleus collision is described based on the Glauber model .	Using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method in the three-dimensional grid-space representation , we determine the nuclear density distribution for a wide range of nuclei self-consistently without assuming any spatial symmetry .	The calculated total reaction cross sections consistently agree with the recent cross section data on Ne $ +^ { 12 } $ C collision at 240 $ A $ \ , MeV , which makes it possible to discuss the radius and deformation of the isotopes .
1	Calculations are performed to one-loop-order , in Landau gauge , and at the lowest approximation level ( r=1 ) of interest for QCD .	In the framework of a generalized iterative scheme introduced previously to account for the non-analytic coupling dependence associated with the renormalization-group invariant mass scale Lambda , we establish the self-consistency equations of the extended Feynman rules ( Lambda-modified vertices of zeroth perturbative order ) for the three-gluon vertex , the two ghost vertices , and the two vertices of massless quarks .	We discuss the phenomenon of compensating poles inherent in these equations , by which the formalism automatically cancels unphysical poles on internal lines , and the role of composite-operator information in the form of equation-of-motion condensate conditions .	The observed near decoupling of the four-gluon conditions permits a solution to the 2-and-3-point conditions within an effective one-parameter freedom .	There exists a parameter range in which one solution has all vertex coefficients real , as required for a physical solution , and a narrower range in which the transverse-gluon and massless-quark propagators both exhibit complex-conjugate pole pairs .
2	At virtually all epochs , we detect at least one large spot group on the surface causing a 1-10 % flux modulation in the Kepler passband .	The Kepler target KIC 5110407 , a K-type star , shows strong quasi-periodic light curve fluctuations likely arising from the formation and decay of spots on the stellar surface rotating with a period of 3.4693 days .	Using an established light-curve inversion algorithm , we study the evolution of the surface features based on Kepler space telescope light curves over a period of two years ( with a gap of .25 years ) .	By identifying and tracking spot groups over a range of inferred latitudes , we measured the surface differential rotation to be much smaller than that found for the Sun .	We also searched for a correlation between the seventeen stellar flares that occurred during our observations and the orientation of the dominant surface spot at the time of each flare .
1	A 2D reconstruction of the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the coronal fluctuation power has been performed over the whole plane of the sky , from 1.4 to 4.0 solar radii .	This work focus on the first results on the identification and characterization of periodic plasma density fluctuations in the outer corona , observed in STEREO-A COR1 white-light image time series .	The adopted diagnostic tool is based on wavelet transforms .	This technique , with respect to the standard Fourier analysis , has the advantage of localizing non-persistent fluctuating features and exploring the variations of the relating wavelet power in both space and time .	The map of the variance of the coronal brightness clearly outlines intermittent , spatially coherent fluctuating features , localized along , or adjacent to , the strongest magnetic field lines .
0	The Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC ( NEXT ) is intended to investigate the neutrinoless double beta decay of 136Xe , which requires a severe suppression of potential backgrounds .	An extensive screening and material selection process is underway for NEXT since the control of the radiopurity levels of the materials to be used in the experimental set-up is a must for rare event searches .	First measurements based on Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry and gamma-ray spectroscopy using ultra-low background germanium detectors at the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc ( Spain ) are described here .	Activity results for natural radioactive chains and other common radionuclides are summarized , being the values obtained for some materials like copper and stainless steel very competitive .	The implications of these results for the NEXT experiment are also discussed .
1	Red supergiants ( RSGs ) are among the most luminous of all stars , easily detectable in external galaxies , and may ideally serve as kinematic tracers of Galactic structure .	Aims .	Some RSGs are surrounded by circumstellar envelopes detectable by their dust and molecular and , in particular , maser emission .	This study consists of a search for maser emission from silicon monoxide ( SiO ) toward a significant number of RSGs that are members of massive stellar clusters , many of which have only recently been discovered .	Further , we aim to relate the occurrence of maser action to properties of the host stars.Methods .
1	This region will be a site of vortex pinning and creep .	A region of toroidally oriented quantized flux lines must exist in the proton superconductor in the core of the neutron star .	Entrainment of the neutron superfluid with the crustal lattice leads to a requirement of superfluid moment of inertia associated with vortex creep in excess of the available crustal moment of inertia .	This will effect constraints on the equation of state .	The toroidal flux region provides the moment of inertia necessary to complement the crust superfluid with postglitch relaxation behavior fitting the observations .
1	We aim to establish the frequency and properties , unaffected by host galaxy dilution and obscuration , of AGNs in central and satellite galaxy members , also as a function of halo-centric distance .	We describe X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton of 18 galaxy groups ( M_group ~ 1-6x10^13 Msolar , z~0.05 ) from the Zurich Environmental Study ( ZENS ) .	X-ray point-source detections are reported for 22 of 177 observed galaxies , down to a limit of f_ ( 0.5-8 keV ) ~ 5x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 , corresponding to a limiting luminosity of L_ ( 0.5-8 keV ) ~3x10^40 erg s^-1 .	With the majority of the X-ray sources attributed to AGNs of low-to-moderate levels ( L/L_Edd & gt ; ~10^-4 ) , we discuss the detection rate in the context of the occupation of AGNs to halos of this mass scale and redshift , and compare the structural/morphological properties between AGN-active and non-active galaxies of different rank and location within the group halos .	We see a slight tendency for AGN hosts to have either relatively brighter/denser disks ( or relatively fainter/diffuse bulges ) than non-active galaxies of similar mass .
4	For an erasure coded system , a common practice to repair from a node failure is for a new node to download subsets of data stored at a number of surviving nodes , reconstruct a lost coded block using the downloaded data , and store it at the new node .	Distributed storage systems provide reliable access to data through redundancy spread over individually unreliable nodes .	Application scenarios include data centers , peer-to-peer storage systems , and storage in wireless networks .	Storing data using an erasure code , in fragments spread across nodes , requires less redundancy than simple replication for the same level of reliability .	However , since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes fail , a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way while transferring as little data as possible across the network .
4	Near the threshold to the first parametric instability , and in degenerate-mode amplification , the PA achieved very high gains in a very narrow bandwidth centered on its resonance frequency .	In this paper , we discuss the behavior of a linear classical parametric amplifier ( PA ) in the presence of white noise and give theoretical estimates of the noise spectral density based on approximate Green 's functions obtained by using averaging techniques .	Furthermore , we give analytical estimates for parametric amplification bandwidth of the amplifier and for the noisy precursors to instability .	To validate our theory we compare the analytical results with experimental data obtained in an analog circuit .	We describe the implementation details and the setup used in the experimental study of the amplifier .
0	We report energy levels , radiative rates ( A-values ) and lifetimes for the astrophysically-important Be-like ion C III .	For the calculations , 166 levels belonging to the $ n \le $ 5 configurations are considered and the { \sc grasp } ( General-purpose Relativistic Atomic Structure Package ) is adopted .	Einstein A-coefficients are provided for all E1 , E2 , M1 and M2 transitions , while lifetimes are compared with available measurements as well as theoretical results , and no large discrepancies noted .	Our energy levels are assessed to be accurate to better than 1\ % for a majority of levels , and A-values to better than 20\ % for most transitions .	Collision strengths are also calculated , for which the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Code ( { \sc darc } ) is used .
2	The notion of orientations with out-degrees prescribed by a function $ \aa : V\to \NN $ unifies many different combinatorial structures , including the afore mentioned .	We deal with the asymptotic enumeration of combinatorial structures on planar maps .	Prominent instances of such problems are the enumeration of spanning trees , bipartite perfect matchings , and ice models .	We call these orientations $ \aa $ -orientations .	The main focus of this paper are bounds for the maximum number of $ \aa $ -orientations that a planar map with $ n $ vertices can have , for different instances of $ \aa $ .
3	Poincar\'e only sketched the proof of the existence of second species solutions .	We consider the plane 3 body problem with 2 of the masses small .	Periodic solutions with near collisions of small bodies were named by Poincar\'e second species periodic solutions .	Such solutions shadow chains of collision orbits of 2 uncoupled Kepler problems .	Rigorous proofs appeared much later and only for the restricted 3 body problem .
0	Controlling electrons at the level of elementary charge $ e $ has been demonstrated experimentally already in the 1980 's .	Ever since , producing an electrical current $ ef $ , or its integer multiple , at a drive frequency $ f $ has been in a focus of research for metrological purposes .	In this review we first discuss the generic physical phenomena and technical constraints that influence charge transport .	We then present the broad variety of proposed realizations .	Some of them have already proven experimentally to nearly fulfill the demanding needs , in terms of transfer errors and transfer rate , of quantum metrology of electrical quantities , whereas some others are currently `` just '' wild ideas , still often potentially competitive if technical constraints can be lifted .
1	Eulerian and Lagrangian coherent structures are detected by computing the Q-criterion and the finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the velocity field , respectively .	We study coherent structures in solar photospheric flows in a plage in the vicinity of the active region AR 10930 using the horizontal velocity data derived from Hinode/SOT magnetograms .	Our analysis indicates that , on average , the deformation Eulerian coherent structures dominate over the vortical Eulerian coherent structures in the plage region .	We demonstrate the correspondence of the network of high magnetic flux concentration to the attracting Lagrangian coherent structures ( a-LCS ) in the photospheric velocity based on both observations and numerical simulations .	In addition , the computation of a-LCS provides a measure of the local rate of contraction/expansion of the flow .
4	This behaviour of the variations in the small groups is largely responsible for the anomalous behaviour of Rz in cycle pair ( 22 , 23 ) .	We have analysed the combined Greenwich and Solar Optical Observing Network ( SOON ) sunspot group data during the period of 1874-2011 and determined variations in the annual numbers ( counts ) of the small , large and big sunspot groups ( these classifications are made on the basis of the maximum areas of the sunspot groups ) .	We found that the amplitude of an even-numbered cycle of the number of large groups is smaller than that of its immediately following odd-numbered cycle .	This is consistent with the well known Gnevyshev and Ohl rule or G-O rule of solar cycles , generally described by using the Zurich sunspot number ( Rz ) .	During cycles 12-21 the G-O rule holds good for the variation in the number of small groups also , but it is violated by cycle pair ( 22 , 23 ) as in the case of Rz .
2	The chiral/continuum extrapolation is performed through a simultaneous fit in the three variables ( m_\pi , q^2 , a ) using HMChPT formulae with additional O ( a^2 ) terms that parametrically account for the lattice spacing dependence .	We present lattice results for the vector and scalar form factors of the semileptonic decays D - & gt ; \pi \ell \nu_ell and D - & gt ; K \ell \nu_\ell in the physical range of values of squared four momentum transfer q^2 , obtained with N_f=2 maximally twisted Wilson fermions simulated at three different lattice spacings ( a ~ 0.102 fm , 0.086 fm , 0.068 fm ) with pion masses as light as 270 MeV and m_\pi L \gtrsim 4 .	The form factors are extracted using a double ratios strategy , which allows a good statistical accuracy and is independent of the vector current renormalization constant .	Our results are in very good agreement with the experimental data in the full q^2 range for both D - & gt ; \pi \ell \nu_\ell and D - & gt ; K \ell \nu_\ell .	At zero momentum transfer we obtain f^ { D- & gt ; pi } ( 0 ) = 0.65 ( 6 ) _ { stat } ( 6 ) _ { syst } and f^ { D- & gt ; K } ( 0 ) = 0.76 ( 5 ) _ { stat } ( 5 ) _ { syst } , where the systematic error does not include the effects of quenching the strange and the charm quarks .
0	We investigate the ideal and incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD ) equations in three space dimensions for the development of potentially singular structures .	The methodology consists in implementing the four-fold symmetries of the Taylor-Green vortex generalized to MHD , leading to substantial computer time and memory savings at a given resolution ; we also use a re-gridding method that allows for lower-resolution runs at early times , with no loss of spectral accuracy .	One magnetic configuration is examined at an equivalent resolution of $ 6144^3 $ points , and three different configurations on grids of $ 4096^3 $ points .	At the highest resolution , two different current and vorticity sheet systems are found to collide , producing two successive accelerations in the development of small scales .	At the latest time , a convergence of magnetic field lines to the location of maximum current is probably leading locally to a strong bending and directional variability of such lines .
2	Four experimental groups have already tested their small-scale prototypes with up to four photons .	The boson sampler proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov is a non-universal quantum computer , which can serve as evidence against the extended Church-Turing thesis .	It samples the probability distribution at the output of linear unitary optical network , with indistinguishable single photons at the input .	The boson sampler with few dozens of single photons is believed to be hard to simulate on a classical computer .	For scalability of a realistic boson sampler with current technology it is necessary to know the effect of the photon mode mismatch on its operation .
1	We prove a finiteness result for these maps over generalized Kummer varieties ( moduli of torus bundles ) , leading us to conjecture that the maps are finite in general .	We construct natural maps ( the Klein and Wirtinger maps ) from moduli spaces of vector bundles on an algebraic curve $ X $ to affine spaces , as quotients of the nonabelian theta linear series .	The conjecture provides canonical explicit coordinates on the moduli space .	The finiteness results give low -- dimensional parametrizations of Jacobians ( in $ \Pp^ { 3g-3 } $ for generic curves ) , described by $ 2\Theta $ functions or second logarithmic derivatives of theta .	We interpret the Klein and Wirtinger maps in terms of opers on $ X $ .
0	We consider the transformation properties of integer sequences arising from the normal ordering of exponentiated boson ( [ a , a* ] =1 ) monomials of the form exp ( x ( a* ) ^r a ) , r=1,2 , ... , under the composition of their exponential generating functions ( egf ) .	They turn out to be of Sheffer-type .	We demonstrate that two key properties of these sequences remain preserved under substitutional composition : ( a ) the property of being the solution of the Stieltjes moment problem ; and ( b ) the representation of these sequences through infinite series ( Dobinski-type relations ) .	We present a number of examples of such composition satisfying properties ( a ) and ( b ) .	We obtain new Dobinski-type formulas and solve the associated moment problem for several hierarchically defined combinatorial families of sequences .
2	It is shown that the product of standard deviations of two position wavefunctions in the plane of a holographic light sheet is equal to the product of their normal separation and the Planck length .	An effective theory based on wave optics is used to describe indeterminacy of position in holographic spacetime with a UV cutoff at the Planck scale .	Wavefunctions describing spacetime positions are modeled as complex disturbances of quasi-monochromatic radiation .	For macroscopically separated positions the transverse uncertainty is much larger than the Planck length , and is predicted to be observable as a `` holographic noise '' in relative position with a distinctive shear spatial character , and an absolutely normalized frequency spectrum with no parameters once the fundamental wavelength is fixed from the theory of gravitational thermodynamics .	The spectrum of holographic noise is estimated for the GEO600 interferometric gravitational-wave detector , and is shown to approximately account for currently unexplained noise between about 300 and 1400Hz .
0	A composite quadric model ( CQM ) is an object modeled by piecewise linear or quadric patches .	We study the continuous detection problem of a special type of CQM objects which are commonly used in CAD/CAM , that is , the boundary surfaces of such a CQM intersect only in straight line segments or conic curve segments .	We present a framework for continuous collision detection ( CCD ) of this special type of CQM ( which we also call CQM for brevity ) in motion .	We derive algebraic formulations and compute numerically the first contact time instants and the contact points of two moving CQMs in $ \mathbb R^3 $ .	Since it is difficult to process CCD of two CQMs in a direct manner because they are composed of semi-algebraic varieties , we break down the problem into subproblems of solving CCD of pairs of boundary elements of the CQMs .
0	We present a beam splitter in a suspended , ballistic , multiterminal , bilayer graphene device .	By using local bottomgates , a p-n interface tilted with respect to the current direction can be formed .	We show that the p-n interface acts as a semi-transparent mirror in the bipolar regime and that the reflectance and transmittance of the p-n interface can be tuned by the gate voltages .	Moreover , by studying the conductance features appearing in magnetic field , we demonstrate that the position of the p-n interface can be moved by $ 1\ , \mu $ m .	The herein presented beamsplitter device can form the basis of electron-optic interferometers in graphene .
3	Finally , we use Multilayer Perceptron ( MLP ) to predict event spans .	We report an implementation of a clinical information extraction tool that leverages deep neural network to annotate event spans and their attributes from raw clinical notes and pathology reports .	Our approach uses context words and their part-of-speech tags and shape information as features .	Then we hire temporal ( 1D ) convolutional neural network to learn hidden feature representations .	The empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms baselines .
0	Using 535 x 10^6 B-meson pairs collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB e+ e- collider , we measure branching fractions of ( 7.16 +/- 0.10 ( stat ) +/- 0.60 ( syst ) ) x 10^-4 for B+ - & gt ; J/psi K+ pi+ pi- and ( 4.31 +/- 0.20 ( stat ) +/- 0.50 ( syst ) ) x 10^-4 for B+ - & gt ; psi-prime K+ pi+ pi- .	We perform amplitude analyses to determine the resonant structure of the K+ pi+ pi- final state in B+ - & gt ; J/psi K+ pi+ pi- and B+ - & gt ; psi-prime K+ pi+ pi- and find that the K_1 ( 1270 ) is a prominent component of both decay modes .	There is significant interference among the different intermediate states , which leads , in particular , to a striking distortion of the rho line shape due to the omega .	Based on the results of the fit to the B+ - & gt ; J/psi K+ pi+ pi- data , the relative decay fractions of the K_1 ( 1270 ) to K rho , K omega , and K^* ( 892 ) pi are consistent with previous measurements , but the decay fraction to K_0^* ( 1430 ) is significantly smaller .	Finally , by floating the mass and width of the K_1 ( 1270 ) in an additional fit of the B+ - & gt ; J/psi K+ pi+ pi- data , we measure a mass of ( 1248.1 +/- 3.3 ( stat ) +/- 1.4 ( syst ) ) MeV/c^2 and a width of ( 119.5 +/- 5.2 ( stat ) +/- 6.7 ( syst ) ) MeV/c^2 for the K_1 ( 1270 ) .
0	In this article , we improve the convergence order of some finite volume solutions approximating some second order elliptic problems .	We prove that finite volume approximations of order $ O ( h^ { k+1 } ) $ , with $ k $ integer , can be obtained after $ k $ corrections , starting with finite volume solution of order $ O ( h ) $ , by using the same matrix and changing only the second member of the original system .	This is done for general smooth second order elliptic problems in one dimension and for second order elliptic problems of the form $ -\Delta u+pu=f $ , with Dirichlet conditions .	Numerical tests justifying theoretical results and showing the efficiency of the method are presented .	The idea used behind these results is the one of Fox 's difference correction in the context of finite difference method .
3	The contact order controlls folding scenarios : the average times necessary to bring pairs of amino acids into their near native separations depend on the sequential distances within the pairs .	The effects of cooperativity are studied within Go-Lennard-Jones models of proteins by making the contact interactions dependent on the proximity to the native conformation .	The kinetic universality classes are found to remain the same as in the absence of cooperativity .	For a fixed native geometry , small changes in the effective contact map may affect the folding times in a chance way and to the extent that is comparable to the shift in the folding times due to cooperativity .	This dependence is largely monotonic , regardless of the cooperativity , and the dominant trend could be described by a single parameter like the average contact order .
3	The projected distribution and kinematics of the galaxies of other types are used to search for equilibrium solutions in the gravitational potential derived from the early-type galaxies , using the method described by Binney and Mamon as implemented by Solanes and Salvador-Sole ' .	We study the orbits of the various types of galaxies observed in the ESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey .	Galaxies within and outside substructures are considered separately .	We use the mass profile we determined from the distribution and kinematics of the early-type galaxies ( i.e.ellipticals , excluding the brightest ones , and S0s ) outside substructures ; the latter were assumed to be on isotropic orbits , which is supported by the shape of their velocity distribution .	For the brightest ellipticals we are not able to construct equilibrium solutions .
4	The proposed packetization policy provides an optimal packetization interval that minimizes the end-to-end delay for a given channel with certain bit error probability .	This article considers the problem of delay optimal bundling of the input symbols into transmit packets in the entry point of a wireless sensor network such that the link delay is minimized under an arbitrary arrival rate and a given channel error rate .	The proposed policy exploits the variable packet length feature of contemporary communications protocols in order to minimize the link delay via packet length regularization .	This is performed through concrete characterization of the end-to-end link delay for zero error tolerance system with First Come First Serve ( FCFS ) queuing discipline and Automatic Repeat Request ( ARQ ) retransmission mechanism .	The derivations are provided for an uncoded system as well as a coded system with a given bit error rate .
1	This might create the effect of extra-particle creation process at scales where the extra-degrees of freedom become relevant .	If we apply the path integral formulation in order to analyze the particle creation process of black-holes inside the non-linear formulation of massive gravity , it is possible to demonstrate that the effect of the extra-degrees of freedom is to deform the periodicity of the poles of the propagator in the complex $ t $ -plane .	For stationary solutions , depending on the values taken by the free parameters of the theory , the periodicity structure of the propagator reveal two effects .	The first one is a shift on the positions of the pole of the propagator with respect to the GR case , affecting then the instant at which the particles are detected .	The second one is the existence of branch points , affecting then the perception of particles .
3	To explore its properties further we examine its behaviour in time-dependent situations .	We study causal wedges associated with a given sub-region in the boundary of asymptotically AdS spacetimes .	Part of our motivation is to better understand the recently proposed holographic observable , causal holographic information ( CHI ) , which is given by the area of a bulk co-dimension two surface lying on the boundary of the causal wedge .	It has been suggested that CHI captures the basic amount of information contained in the reduced density matrix about the bulk geometry .	As a simple model we focus on null dust collapse in an asymptotically AdS spacetime , modeled by the Vaidya-AdS geometry .
0	We use multi-scale SPH simulations to follow the inflow of gas from galactic scales to & lt ; 0.1pc , where the gas begins to resemble a traditional Keplerian accretion disk .	The key ingredients are gas , stars , black holes ( BHs ) , self-gravity , star formation , and stellar feedback .	We use ~100 simulations to survey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the ISM physics .	We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic nuclei ( & lt ; ~300pc ) using galaxy scale simulations , including both major mergers and isolated bar- ( un ) stable disk galaxies .	For sufficiently gas-rich , disk-dominated systems , a series of gravitational instabilities generates large accretion rates of up to 1-10 M_sun/yr onto the BH ( at & lt ; & lt ; 0.1pc ) ; sufficient to fuel the most luminous quasars .
3	The main result in the first case is a partial classification in dimension $ n\geq 4 $ .	We investigate K\ '' ahler metrics conformal to gradient Ricci solitons , and base metrics of warped product gradient Ricci solitons .	The latter we name quasi-solitons .	A main assumption that is employed is functional dependence of the soliton potential , with the conformal factor in the first case , and with the warping function in the second .	In the second case , K\ '' ahler quasi-soliton metrics satisfying the above main assumption are shown to be , under an additional genericity hypothesis , necessarily Riemannian products .
1	We show that if the GRB outflow is proton loaded , spectral energy distribution of this emission is expected to sharply peak in 0.1-1~MeV energy band .	We argue that small pitch angle synchrotron emission provides an important dissipation mechanism which has to be taken into account in the models of formation of relativistic magnetized gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) outflows from the newborn black holes and/or magnetars .	If the small pitch angle synchrotron emission efficiently cools relativistic particles of the outflow , its spectrum below the peak energy is a powerlaw with spectral index alpha ~ -1 , close to the typical spectral index of the time-resolved GRB spectra .	Otherwise , the low energy spectral index can be as hard as alpha ~ 0 , as observed at the beginning of the GRB pulses .	We make a conjecture that small pitch angle synchrotron emission from proton-loaded magnetized GRB outflow could significantly contribute to the Band component of the prompt emission of GRBs while electromagnetic cascade initiated by the protons could be responsible for the GeV component .
0	We prove that the algebraic condition $ |p-2| | & lt ; { \mathscr Im } { \mathscr A } \xi , \xi & gt ; | \leq 2 \sqrt { p-1 } & lt ; { \mathscr Re } { \mathscr A } \xi , \xi & gt ; $ ( for any $ \xi\in\mathbb { R } ^ { n } $ ) is necessary and sufficient for the $ L^ { p } $ -dissipativity of the Dirichlet problem for the differential operator $ \nabla^ { t } ( { \mathscr A } \nabla ) $ , where $ { \mathscr A } $ is a matrix whose entries are complex measures and whose imaginary part is symmetric .	This result is new even for smooth coefficients , when it implies a criterion for the $ L^ { p } $ -contractivity of the corresponding semigroup .	We consider also the operator $ \nabla^ { t } ( { \mathscr A } \nabla ) + { \bf b } \nabla +a $ , where the coefficients are smooth and $ { \mathscr Im } { \mathscr A } $ may be not symmetric .	We show that the previous algebraic condition is necessary and sufficient for the $ L^ { p } $ -quasi-dissipativity of this operator .	The same condition is necessary and sufficient for the $ L^ { p } $ -quasi-contractivity of the corresponding semigroup .
0	We present new multi-band ( UBVI ) time-series data of helium burning variables in the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy .	The current sample includes 92 RR Lyrae-six of them are new identifications-and 20 Anomalous Cepheids , one of which is new identification .	The analysis of the Bailey diagram shows that the luminosity amplitude of the first overtone component in double-mode variables is located along the long-period tail of regular first overtone variables , while the fundamental component is located along the short-period tale of regular fundamental variables .	This evidence further supports the transitional nature of these objects .	Moreover , the distribution of Carina double-mode variables in the Petersen diagram ( P_1/P_0 vs P_0 ) is similar to metal-poor globulars ( M15 , M68 ) , to the dwarf spheroidal Draco and to the Galactic Halo .
3	The ensemble model fit can then be evaluated rigorously for and calibrated with individual light curves with no parameter fitting .	We present a novel method for the optimal selection of quasars using time-series observations in a single photometric bandpass .	Utilizing the damped random walk model of Kelly et al .	( 2009 ) , we parameterize the ensemble quasar structure function in Sloan Stripe 82 as a function of observed brightness .	This yields a classification in two statistics -- - one describing the fit confidence and one describing the probability of a false alarm -- - which can be tuned , a priori , to achieve high quasar detection fractions ( 99 % completeness with default cuts ) , given an acceptable rate of false alarms .
0	Spherical symmetry is ubiquitous in nature .	It 's therefore unfortunate that spherical system simulations are so hard , and require complete spheres with millions of interacting particles .	Here we introduce an approach to model spherical systems , using revised periodic boundary conditions adapted to spherical symmetry .	Method reduces computational costs by orders of magnitude , and is applicable for both solid and liquid membranes , provided the curvature is sufficiently small .	We demonstrate the method by calculating the bending and Gaussian curvature moduli of single- and multi-layer graphene .
4	This contribution provides an overview of the recently conducted analyses , including a search for neutrinos from the Fermi bubbles region , searches for optical counterparts with the TAToO program , and searches for neutrinos in correlation with gamma-ray bursts , blazars , and microquasars .	The ANTARES neutrino telescope is currently the largest operating water Cherenkov detector and the largest neutrino detector in the Northern Hemisphere .	Its main scientific target is the detection of high-energy ( TeV and beyond ) neutrinos from cosmic accelerators , as predicted by hadronic interaction models , and the measurement of the diffuse neutrino flux .	Its location allows for surveying a large part of the Galactic Plane , including the Galactic Centre .	In addition to the standalone searches for point-like and diffuse high-energy neutrino signals , ANTARES has developed a range of multi-messenger strategies to exploit the close connection between neutrinos and other cosmic messengers such as gamma-rays , charged cosmic rays and gravitational waves .
2	The partial cribbing scheme is especially motivated by the additive noise Gaussian MAC since perfect cribbing results in the degenerated case of full cooperation between the encoders and requires an infinite entropy link .	In this paper we consider a multiple access channel ( MAC ) with partial cribbing encoders .	This means that each of two encoders obtains a deterministic function of the other encoder output with or without delay .	We derive a single letter characterization of the capacity of the MAC with partial cribbing for the cases of causal and strictly causal partial cribbing .	Several numerical examples , such as quantized cribbing , are presented .
4	The model for T $ _ { C0 } $ is also found to be consistent with the absence of high-T $ _C $ characteristics for A $ _x $ MNX compounds in which a spatially separated intercalation layer is not formed .	Behavior consistent with Coulomb-mediated high-T $ _C $ superconductivity is shown to be present in the intercalated group-4-metal nitride halides A $ _x $ ( S ) $ _y $ MNX , where the MNX host ( M = Ti , Zr , Hf ; X = Cl , Br ) is partially intercalated with cations A $ _x $ and optionally molecular species ( S ) $ _y $ in the van der Waals gap between the halide X layers , expanding the basal-plane spacing d. The optimal transition temperature is modeled by T $ _ { C0 } $ $ { \propto } $ { \zeta } $ ^ { -1 } $ ( { \sigma } / $ A $ ) $ ^ { 1/2 } $ , where the participating fractional charge per area per formula unit { \sigma } / $ A $ and the distance { \zeta } , given by the transverse A $ _x $ -X separation ( { \zeta } & lt ; d ) , govern the interlayer Coulomb coupling .	From experiment results for { \beta } -form compounds based on Zr and Hf , in which concentrations x of A $ _x $ are varied , it is shown that { \sigma } = { \gamma } [ v ( x $ _ { opt } $ $ - $ x $ _0 $ ) ] , where x $ _ { opt } $ is the optimal doping , x $ _0 $ is the onset of superconducting behavior , v is the A $ _x $ charge state , and { \gamma } = 1/8 is a factor determined by the model .	Observations of T $ _C $ & lt ; T $ _ { C0 } $ in the comparatively more disordered { \alpha } -A $ _x $ ( S ) $ _y $ TiNX compounds are modeled as pair-breaking by remote Coulomb scattering from the A $ _x $ cations , which attenuates exponentially with increasing { \zeta } .	The T $ _ { C0 } $ values calculated for nine A $ _x $ ( S ) $ _y $ MNCl compounds , shown to be optimal , agree with the measured T $ _C $ to within experimental error .
1	The kinetics of filament growth is limited by the disassembly rate , at which inter-protein bonds break due to the thermal motion .	Protein molecules often self-assemble by means of non-covalent physical bonds to form extended filaments , such as amyloids , F-actin , intermediate filaments , and many others .	Existing models often assume that the thermal dissociation of subunits occurs uniformly along the filament , or even preferentially in the middle , while the well-known propensity of F-actin to depolymerize from one end is mediated by biochemical factors .	Here , we show for a very general ( and generic ) model , using Brownian dynamics simulations and theory , that the breakup location along the filament is strongly controlled by the asymmetry of the binding force about the minimum , as well as by the bending stiffness of the filament .	We provide the basic connection between the features of the interaction potential between subunits and the breakup topology .
2	An additional , trigonometric deformation of the measure arises in five-dimensional theories .	We relate Nekrasov partition functions , with arbitrary values of $ \epsilon_1 , \epsilon_2 $ parameters , to matrix models for $ \beta $ -ensembles .	We find matrix models encoding the instanton part of Nekrasov partition functions , whose measure , to the leading order in $ \epsilon_2 $ expansion , is given by the Vandermonde determinant to the power $ \beta=-\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2 $ .	Matrix model potentials , to the leading order in $ \epsilon_2 $ expansion , are the same as in the $ \beta=1 $ case considered in 0810.4944 [ hep-th ] .	We point out that potentials for massive hypermultiplets include multi-log , Penner-like terms .
0	We study black hole solutions in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with the dilaton and a negative `` cosmological constant '' .	We derive the field equations for the static spherically symmetric ( $ k=1 $ ) and hyperbolically symmetric ( $ k=-1 $ ) spacetime in general $ D $ dimensions .	The system has some scaling symmetries which are used in our analysis of the solutions .	We find exact solutions , i.e. , regular AdS solution for $ k=1 $ and a massless black hole solution for $ k=-1 $ .	Nontrivial asymptotically AdS solutions are obtained numerically in D=4 -- 6 and 10 dimensional spacetimes .
2	The variations in the intensity and the associated power density spectrum indicate that the HBO and NBO are strongly coupled , originating from the same location in the inner accretion disk .	The simultaneous and coupled evolution of horizontal branch oscillation ( HBO ) and normal branch oscillation ( NBO ) in Z-type sources suggests that the production of HBO is connected to NBO and is caused by changes in the physical/radiative properties of the inner accretion disk , although there is a lack of substantial spectral evidence to support this .	In this { \it Letter } , we present the results of an analysis of a RXTE observation of a Z source GX~5-1 , where the 6 Hz NBO is simultaneously detected along with a HBO at 51 Hz .	The absence of HBO and NBO in the lower energy bands , an increase in the rms amplitude with energy and a smooth transition among them suggest that they are produced in the hot inner regions of the accretion disk .	Based on a spectral analysis , we found a signature of changing or physically modified inner disk front during the coupled HBO and NBO evolution .
2	We find that for the light quark jet production the diffractive process is related to the differential off-diagonal gluon distribution function in the proton .	Massless quark and antiquark jet production at large transverse momentum in the coherent diffractive processes at hadron colliders is calculated in the two-gluon exchange parametrization of the Pomeron model .	We use the helicity amplitude method to calculate the cross section formula .	We estimate the production rate for this process at the Fermilab Tevatron by approximating the off-diagonal gluon distribution function by the usual diagonal gluon distribution in the proton .	And we find that the cross sections for the diffractive light quark jet production and the charm quark jet production are in the same order of magnitude .
2	The first errors are statistical , the second systematic .	In this paper we present a measurement of the natural widths of $ \Sigma_c^0 $ and $ \Sigma_c^ { ++ } $ .	Using data from the FOCUS experiment , we find $ \Gamma ( \Sigma_c^0 ) = 1.55 +0.41/-0.37 \pm 0.38 $ MeV/c^2 and $ \Gamma ( \Sigma_c^0 ) = 2.05 +0.41/-0.38 \pm 0.38 $ MeV/c^2 .	These results are obtained with a sample of 913 $ \Sigma_c^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \pi^- $ decays and 1110 $ \Sigma_c^++ \to \Lambda_c^+ \pi^+ $ decays .	These results are compared with recent theoretical predictions .
3	The global existence result also holds for linear and fast diffusion of the cell density in a certain parameter range in three dimensions .	A parabolic-parabolic ( Patlak- ) Keller-Segel model in up to three space dimensions with nonlinear cell diffusion and an additional nonlinear cross-diffusion term is analyzed .	The main feature of this model is that there exists a new entropy functional , yielding gradient estimates for the cell density and chemical concentration .	For arbitrarily small cross-diffusion coefficients and for suitable exponents of the nonlinear diffusion terms , the global-in-time existence of weak solutions is proved , thus preventing finite-time blow up of the cell density .	Furthermore , we show $ L^\infty $ bounds for the solutions to the parabolic-elliptic system .
0	We present a comparative study of several molecular lines and of the dust contiunuum at 1.2mm in a pre-stellar core that is embedded in the Galactic cirrus cloud MCLD123.5+24.9 .	Previous studies found that the core is gravitationally stable and shows signs of inward motion .	Using the Owens Valley ( OVRO ) and Plateau de Bure ( PdB ) interferometers we obtained high-angular resolution maps of the core in the carbon monosulfide CS 2-1 and the cyanoacetylene HC3N 10-9 transitions .	Together with CS 5-4 , C34S 3-2 , and bolometer data obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope , we analyse the excitation conditions and the structural properties of the cloud .	On the one hand , the new CS 2-1 observations reveal significant substructure on a scale of about 7 '' , i.e. , the beam size , corresponding to about 1050 AU at an adopted distance of 150pc .
3	Being also a candidate for gravitational lensing , this object is of high interest for the BL Lac research .	We present optical spectroscopy data that allowed a measurement of the redshift for the X-ray selected BL Lacertae object 1517+656 .	With a redshift of z = 0.702 this object has an absolute magnitude of B = -26.4 and is also an extremely powerful radio and X-ray source .	Although being a high frequency peaked BL Lac , this object is one of the most luminous BL Lac objects known so far .	Assuming several cosmological models and a realistic redshift for the lensed object , we find that 1517+656 has a mass & gt ; 2 * 10^12 solar masses and a high velocity dispersion & gt ; 350 km/sec .
4	The ratios of C IV to O VI to O VII to O VIII , intensities were compared with those predicted by theoretical models .	This paper examines the ultraviolet and X-ray photons generated by hot gas in the Galactic thick disk or halo in the Draco region of the northern hemisphere .	Our analysis uses the intensities from four ions , C IV , O VI , O VII , and O VIII , sampling temperatures of ~100,000 to ~3,000,000 K. We measured the O VI , O VII and O VIII intensities from FUSE and XMM-Newton data and subtracted off the local contributions in order to deduce the thick disk/halo contributions .	These were supplemented with published C IV intensity and O VI column density measurements .	Our estimate of the thermal pressure in the O VI-rich thick disk/halo gas , p_ { th } /k = 6500^ { +2500 } _ { -2600 } K cm^ { -3 } , suggests that the thick disk/halo is more highly pressurized than would be expected from theoretical analyses .
3	The main new idea is embedding Turing machines into integral group rings .	Main theorems of the article concern the problem of M. Atiyah on possible values of l^2-Betti numbers .	It is shown that all non-negative real numbers are l^2-Betti numbers , and that `` many '' ( for example all non-negative algebraic ) real numbers are l^2-Betti numbers of simply connected manifolds with respect to a free cocompact action .	Also an explicit example is constructed which leads to a simply connected manifold with a transcendental l^2-Betti number with respect to an action of the threefold direct product of the lamplighter group Z/2 wr Z .	The main tool developed generalizes known techniques of spectral computations for certain random walk operators to arbitrary operators in groupoid rings of discrete measured groupoids .
1	However , it is difficult to realize interactions between nitrogen-vacancy centers strong enough to form a macroscopically ordered phase under realistic temperatures .	Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond , being a promising candidate for quantum information processing , may also be an ideal platform for simulating many-body physics .	Here we propose a scheme to realize long-range ferromagnetic Ising interactions between distant nitrogen-vacancy centers by using a mechanical resonator as a medium .	Since the critical temperature in the long-range Ising model is proportional to the number of spins , a ferromagnetic order can be formed at a temperature of tens of millikelvin for a sample with $ \sim10^4 $ nitrogen-vacancy centers .	This method may provide a new platform for studying many-body physics using qubit systems .
3	Our analysis is based on a qualitative coding for approximately 3000 tweets in Arabic and English from the Syrian social bot that was active for 35 weeks on Twitter before it was shutdown .	Social botnets have become an important phenomenon on social media .	There are many ways in which social bots can disrupt or influence online discourse , such as , spam hashtags , scam twitter users , and astroturfing .	In this paper we considered one specific social botnet in Twitter to understand how it grows over time , how the content of tweets by the social botnet differ from regular users in the same dataset , and lastly , how the social botnet may have influenced the relevant discussions .	We find that the growth , behavior and content of this particular botnet did not specifically align with common conceptions of botnets .
2	In an appendix we indicate how one might extend this to qurves over non-algebraically closed fields .	In this paper we associate to a qurve A ( formerly known as a quasi-free or formally smooth algebra ) the one-quiver Q ( A ) and dimension vector a ( A ) .	This pair contains enough information to reconstruct for all natural numbers n the GL ( n ) -etale local structure of the representation scheme rep ( n , A ) .	Further , we classify all finitely generated groups G such that the group algebra lG is an l-qurve .	If char ( l ) =0 these are exactly the virtually free groups .
1	It also blows the superconductivity community by surprise because such a high Tc is unexpected in FeSe system with the bulk FeSe exhibiting a Tc at only 8 K at ambient pressure which can be enhanced to 38 K under high pressure .	The latest discovery of high temperature superconductivity signature in single-layer FeSe is significant because it is possible to break the superconducting critical temperature ceiling ( maximum Tc~55 K ) that has been stagnant since the discovery of Fe-based superconductivity in 2008 .	The Tc is still unusually high even considering the newly-discovered intercalated FeSe system A_xFe_ { 2-y } Se_2 ( A=K , Cs , Rb and Tl ) with a Tc at 32 K at ambient pressure and possible Tc near 48 K under high pressure .	Particularly interesting is that such a high temperature superconductivity occurs in a single-layer FeSe system that is considered as a key building block of the Fe-based superconductors .	Understanding the origin of high temperature superconductivity in such a strictly two-dimensional FeSe system is crucial to understanding the superconductivity mechanism in Fe-based superconductors in particular , and providing key insights on how to achieve high temperature superconductivity in general .
4	For observations made with a moderate beamsize ( ~18 '' ) , this technique identifies ~85 per cent of SMG counterparts .	We present a new submm/mm galaxy counterpart identification technique which builds on the use of Spitzer IRAC colors as discriminators between likely counterparts and the general IRAC galaxy population .	Using 102 radio- and SMA-confirmed counterparts to AzTEC sources across three fields ( GOODS-N , GOODS-S , and COSMOS ) , we develop a non-parametric IRAC color-color characteristic density distribution ( CDD ) , which , when combined with positional uncertainty information via likelihood ratios , allows us to rank all potential IRAC counterparts around SMGs and calculate the significance of each ranking via the reliability factor .	We report all robust and tentative radio counterparts to SMGs , the first such list available for AzTEC/COSMOS , as well as the highest ranked IRAC counterparts for all AzTEC SMGs in these fields as determined by our technique .	We demonstrate that the technique is free of radio bias and thus applicable regardless of radio detections .
0	In a recent paper , Hawkins ( 1997 ) argues on the basis of statistical studies of double-image gravitational lenses and lens candidates that a large population of dark lenses exists and that these outnumber galaxies with more normal mass-to-light ratios by a factor of 3:1 .	If correct , this is a very important result for many areas of astronomy including galaxy formation and cosmology .	In this paper we discuss our new radio-selected gravitational lens sample , JVAS/CLASS , in order to test and constrain this proposition .	We have obtained ground-based and HST images of all multiple-image lens systems in our sample and in 12 cases out of 12 we find the lensing galaxies in the optical and/or near infrared .	Our success in finding lensing galaxies creates problems for the dark lens hypothesis .
1	In large populations , defectors may escape punishment by roving from partner to partner , but defectors in smaller populations risk social isolation .	Partner selection is an important process in many social interactions , permitting individuals to decrease the risks associated with cooperation .	We investigate these possibilities for an evolutionary prisoner 's dilemma in which agents use expected payoffs to choose and refuse partners .	In comparison to random or round-robin partner matching , we find that the average payoffs attained with preferential partner selection tend to be more narrowly confined to a few isolated payoff regions .	Most ecologies evolve to essentially full cooperative behavior , but when agents are intolerant of defections , or when the costs of refusal and social isolation are small , we also see the emergence of wallflower ecologies in which all agents are socially isolated .
1	Consider the case when the derivatives of metric tensor over radial distance are sufficiently small ( in the scale of radius ) to justify studying a few first orders of quasiclassical ( WKB ) expansion over derivatives .	The renormalised vacuum expectation values of massless fermion ( conventionally call it neutrino ) stress-energy tensor are calculated in the static spherically-symmetrical wormhole topology .	Then we find that violation of the averaged weak energy condition takes place irrespectively of the detailed form of metric .	This is a necessary condition for the neutrino vacuum to be able to support the wormhole geometry .	In this respect , neutrino vacuum behaves like electromagnetic one and differs from the conformal scalar vacuum which does not seem to violate energy conditions for slowly varied metric automatically , but requires self-consistent wormhole solution for this .
1	In this work , we present a general analysis of the regions of existence and stability of cavity solitons and patterns in the Lugiato-Lefever equation , a mean-field model that finds applications in many different nonlinear optical cavities .	It has been recently uncovered that coherent structures in microresonators such as cavity solitons and patterns are intimately related to Kerr frequency combs .	We demonstrate that the rich dynamics and coexistence of multiple solutions in the Lugiato-Lefever equation are of key importance to understanding frequency comb generation .	A detailed map of how and where to target stable Kerr frequency combs in the parameter space defined by the frequency detuning and the pump power is provided .	Moreover , the work presented also includes the organization of various dynamical regimes in terms of bifurcation points of higher co-dimension in regions of parameter space that were previously unexplored in the Lugiato-Lefever equation .
3	This effect can be attributed to the fact that the fluctuation spectrum for closed geometries is gapped , inhibiting the thermal excitation of modes at low temperatures .	We present first worldline analytical and numerical results for the nontrivial interplay between geometry and temperature dependencies of the Casimir effect .	We show that the temperature dependence of the Casimir force can be significantly larger for open geometries ( e.g. , perpendicular plates ) than for closed geometries ( e.g. , parallel plates ) .	For surface separations in the experimentally relevant range , the thermal correction for the perpendicular-plates configuration exhibits a stronger parameter dependence and exceeds that for parallel plates by an order of magnitude at room temperature .	By contrast , open geometries support a thermal excitation of the low-lying modes in the gapless spectrum already at low temperatures .
2	This multi-patch representation corresponds to a decomposition of the computational domain into non-overlapping subdomains also called patches in the geometrical framework .	Isogeometric analysis ( IgA ) uses the same class of basis functions for both , representing the geometry of the computational domain and approximating the solution .	In practical applications , geometrical patches are used in order to get flexibility in the geometrical representation .	We will present discontinuous Galerkin ( dG ) methods that allow for discontinuities across the subdomain ( patch ) boundaries .	The required interface conditions are weakly imposed by the dG terms associated with the boundary of the sub-domains .
1	For any $ ( n , k , d ) $ such that $ d \geq 2k-2 $ and $ d \leq n-1 $ , we can directly construct an $ ( n , k , d ) $ MSR code without constructing a larger MSR code and shortening of the larger MSR code .	In this paper , we propose a generalized version of the Rashmi-Shah-Kumar Minimum-Storage-Regenerating ( RSK-MSR ) codes based on the product-matrix framework .	As a result , the size of a finite field over which the proposed code is defined is smaller than or equal to the size of a finite field over which the RSK-MSR code is defined .	In addition , the $ \ { \ell , \ell'\ } $ secure codes based on the generalized RSK-MSR codes can be obtained by applying the construction method of $ \ { \ell , \ell'\ } $ secure codes proposed by Shah , Rashmi and Kumar .	Furthermore , the message matrix of the $ ( n , k , d ) $ generalized RSK-MSR code is derived from that of the RSK-MSR code by using the construction method of the $ \ { \ell=k , \ell'=0\ } $ secure code .
0	We apply a von Zeipel gravity darkening model to corotating binaries to obtain a simple , analytical expression for the emergent radiative flux from a tidally distorted primary orbiting a point-mass secondary .	We adopt a simple Roche model to determine the envelope structure of the primary , assumed massive and centrally condensed , and use the results to calculate the flux .	As for single rotating stars , gravity darkening reduces the flux along the stellar equator of the primary , but , unlike for rotating stars , we find that gravity brightening enhances the flux in a region around the stellar poles .	We identify a critical limiting separation beyond which hydrostatic equilibrium no longer is possible , whereby the flux vanishes at the point on the stellar equator of the primary facing the companion .	For equal-mass binaries , the total luminosity is reduced by about 13 % when this limiting separation is reached .
1	In this paper , we present an analytical formulation for the treatment of finite-strain Bloch waves in one-dimensional phononic crystals .	The introduction of nonlinearity alters the dispersion of elastic waves in solid media .	Considering longitudinal waves , the exact dispersion relation in each homogeneous layer is first obtained and subsequently used within the transfer matrix method to derive an approximate dispersion relation for the overall periodic medium .	The result is an amplitude-dependent elastic band structure that may be used to elucidate the interplay between the waveform steepening and spreading effects that emerge due to the nonlinearity and periodicity , respectively .	For example , for a wave amplitude on the order of one eighth of the unit-cell size in a demonstrative structure , the two effects are practically in balance for wavelengths as small as roughly three times the unit-cell size .
4	Thanks to the long coherence time of hole spins and the efficient spin-photon interface provided by self-assembled quantum dots embedded in leaky microcavity structures , we generate 2300 entangled spin pairs per second , which represents an improvement approaching three orders of magnitude as compared to prior experiments .	Quantum entanglement emerges naturally in interacting quantum systems and plays a central role in quantum information processing .	Remarkably , it is possible to generate entanglement even in the absence of direct interactions : provided that which path information is erased , weak spin-state dependent light scattering can be used to project two distant spins onto a maximally entangled state upon detection of a single photon .	Even though this approach is necessarily probabilistic , successful generation of entanglement is heralded by the photon detection event .	Here , we demonstrate heralded quantum entanglement of two quantum dot heavy-hole spins separated by 5 meters using single-photon interference .
2	For sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios ( SNRs ) one of the proposed algorithm is SNR-invariant , i.e.the IS estimator does not depend on the cross-over probability of the channel .	In this paper the choice of the Bernoulli distribution as biased distribution for importance sampling ( IS ) Monte-Carlo ( MC ) simulation of linear block codes over binary symmetric channels ( BSCs ) is studied .	Based on the analytical derivation of the optimal IS Bernoulli distribution , with explicit calculation of the variance of the corresponding IS estimator , two novel algorithms for fast-simulation of linear block codes are proposed .	Also , the proposed algorithms are shown to be suitable for the estimation of the error-correcting capability of the code and the decoder .	Finally , the effectiveness of the algorithms is confirmed through simulation results in comparison to standard Monte Carlo method .
4	While the Standard Model rates are yet to be reached , current experimental limits are already putting constraints on New Physics models .	Indirect searches , and in particular rare decays , have proven to be a fruitful field to search for New Physics beyond the Standard Model .	While the down-quark sector ( B and K ) have been studied in detail , less attention was devoted to charm decays due to the smaller expected values and higher theoretical uncertainties of their observables .	Recently a renewed interest is growing in rare charm searches .	In this article we review the current experimental status of searches for rare decays in charmed hadrons .
4	We find a lattice version of chiral symmetry similar to the Ginsparg-Wilson approach .	We identify natural degrees of freedom of polycrystalline materials -- affine transformations of grains -- with those of a three-dimensional lattice theory for $ ( T\otimes\Omega ) ( \mathbb { R } ^3 ) $ .	We define a lattice Dirac operator on this space and identify its continuous limit with the free field limit of the whole fermionic sector of the standard model .	Fermion doubling is used here as a tool to obtain the necessary number of steps of freedom .	The correspondence extends to important structural properties ( families , colors , flavor pairs , electromagnetic charge ) .
2	The averages of distances are compared with two alternative expressions describing their dependence with the number of segments separating the units .	Numerical simulations are performed for isolated cyclic chains with excluded volume .	Data are reported for the form factor , S ( x ) , where x is the reduced scattering variable , and also for averages and distributions of the distance between intramolecular units .	The distribution function results are compared with the des Cloizeaux form .	Finally the S ( x ) data are compared with theoretical functions also derived from the des Cloizeaux expression for the distribution function .
4	For the Crab Pulsar SED we find a spectral slope of alpha_nu = 0.27+-0.03 in the optical/near-IR regime , when we exclude the contribution from the knot .	We study the spectral energy distribution ( SED ) of the Crab Pulsar and its nearby knot in the optical and in the infrared ( IR ) regime .	We present high-quality UBVRIz , as well as adaptive optics JHK_sL ' photometry , achieved under excellent conditions with the FORS1 and NAOS/CONICA instruments at the VLT .	We combine these data with re-analyzed archival Spitzer Space Telescope data to construct a SED for the pulsar , and quantify the contamination from the knot .	We have also gathered optical imaging data from 1988 to 2008 from several telescopes in order to examine the predicted secular decrease in luminosity .
0	The association of filaments with protostellar objects has made these structures a priority target in star formation studies .	The datasets of the Herschel Galactic Cold Cores Key Programme allow for a statistical study of filaments with a wide range of intrinsic and environmental characteristics .	Characterisation of this sample can be used to identify key physical parameters and quantify the role of environment in the formation of supercritical filaments .	Filaments were extracted from fields at D & lt ; 500pc with the getfilaments algorithm and characterised according to their column density profiles and intrinsic properties .	Each profile was fitted with a beam-convolved Plummer-like function and quantified based on the relative contributions from the filament 'core ' , represented by a Gaussian , and 'wing ' component , dominated by the power-law of the Plummer-like function .
3	Our algorithms have respective running times $ O ( n^2\log n ) $ when $ P $ is monotonic and $ O ( n^2\log^2 n ) $ when $ P $ is an arbitrary simple polyline .	In this paper we present a novel non-parametric method of simplifying piecewise linear curves and we apply this method as a statistical approximation of structure within sequential data in the plane .	We consider the problem of minimizing the average length of sequences of consecutive input points that lie on any one side of the simplified curve .	Specifically , given a sequence $ P $ of $ n $ points in the plane that determine a simple polygonal chain consisting of $ n-1 $ segments , we describe algorithms for selecting an ordered subset $ Q \subset P $ ( including the first and last points of $ P $ ) that determines a second polygonal chain to approximate $ P $ , such that the number of crossings between the two polygonal chains is maximized , and the cardinality of $ Q $ is minimized among all such maximizing subsets of $ P $ .	Finally , we examine the application of our algorithms iteratively in a bootstrapping technique to define a smooth robust non-parametric approximation of the original sequence .
0	Given graphs $ H_1 , H_2 , \dots , H_k $ , the Ramsey number $ R ( H_1 , \dots , H_k ) $ is the smallest integer $ n $ for which in any coloring of the edges of the complete graph $ K_n $ with colors $ 1,2 , \dots , k $ , there is some color $ i $ with a monochromatic copy of $ H_i $ .	We call a tuple $ ( H_1 , \dots , H_k ) $ good if for every $ k $ -coloring of the edges of an $ R ( H_1 , \dots , H_k ) $ -chromatic graph , there is some color $ i $ with a monochromatic copy of $ H_i $ .	We call a graph $ H $ $ k $ -good if the $ k $ -tuple $ ( H , H , \dots , H ) $ is good , and $ H $ is good if it is $ k $ -good for every $ k $ .	Bialostocki and Gy\'arf\'as proved that matchings are good and asked whether every acyclic $ H $ is good .	A natural strategy shows that $ P_4 $ is $ k $ -good for $ k \not = 3 $ and that $ ( P_4 , P_5 ) $ is good .
1	In the present paper , lattice ordered pseudo-effect algebras are considered as possible algebraic non-commutative analogs of non-commutative non-standard reasoning .	Pseudo-effect algebras are partial algebraic structures , that were introduced as a non-commutative generalization of effect algebras .	To this aim , the interplay among conjunction , implication and negation connectives is studied .	It turns out that in the non-commutative reasoning , all these connectives are doubled .	In particular , there are two negations and two pairs consisting of conjunction and implication , related by residuation laws .
2	This provides a complete solution to a question raised in a paper by Z. M. Balogh , R. Hoefer-Isenegger and J. T. Tyson .	We establish a `` low rank property '' for Sobolev mappings that pointwise solve a first order nonlinear system of PDEs , whose smooth solutions have the so-called `` contact property '' .	As a consequence , Sobolev mappings from an open set of the plane , taking values in the first Heisenberg group and that have almost everywhere maximal rank must have images with positive 3-dimensional Hausdorff measure with respect to the sub-Riemannian distance of the Heisenberg group .	Our approach differs from the previous ones .	Its technical aspect consists in performing an `` exterior differentiation by blow-up '' , where the standard distributional exterior differentiation is not possible .
1	To investigate this proposal , we compare the metallicity of the hosts of LGRBs , broad-lined Type Ic ( Ic-bl ) supernovae ( SNe ) , and Type II SNe to each other and to the metallicity distribution of star-forming galaxies using the SDSS to represent galaxies in the local universe and the TKRS for galaxies at intermediate redshifts .	Recently , it has been suggested that the metallicity aversion of long-duration gamma-ray bursts ( LGRBs ) is not intrinsic to their formation , but rather a consequence of the anti-correlation between star-formation and metallicity seen in the general galaxy population .	The differing metallicity distributions of the LGRB hosts and the star formation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicity preference of LGRBs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation between star-formation and metallicity , but rather must be overwhelmingly due to the astrophysics of the LGRBs themselves .	Three quarters of our LGRB sample are found at metallicities below 12+log ( O/H ) & lt ; 8.6 , while less than a tenth of local star-formation is at similarly low metallicities .	However , our SN samples are statistically consistent with the metallicity distribution of the general galaxy population .
3	Instead , Swift-BAT reveals strong intrinsic variability on time scales longer than one year .	We present a time , spectral and imaging analysis of the X-ray reflector in NGC 4945 , which reveals its geometrical and physical structure with unprecedented detail .	NGC 4945 hosts one of the brightest AGN in the sky above 10 keV , but it is only visible through its reflected/scattered emission below 10 keV , due to absorption by a column density of ~4\times10^24 cm-2 .	A new Suzaku campaign of 5 observations spanning ~6 months , together with past XMM-Newton and Chandra observations , show a remarkable constancy ( within & lt ; 10 % ) of the reflected component .	Modeling the circumnuclear gas as a thin cylinder with the axis on the plane of the sky , we show that the reflector is at a distance & gt ; 30-50 pc , well within the imaging capabilities of Chandra at the distance of NGC 4945 ( 1 '' ~18 pc ) .
3	The logarithmic terms in the four-point functions are connected to the anomalous dimensions of the exchanged fields .	We present a detailed analysis of a scalar conformal four-point function obtained from AdS/CFT correspondence .	We study the scalar exchange graphs in AdS and discuss their analytic properties .	Using methods of conformal partial wave analysis , we present a general procedure to study conformal four-point functions in terms of exchanges of scalar and tensor fields .	Comparison of the results from AdS graphs with the conformal partial wave analysis , suggests a possible general form for the operator product expansion of scalar fields in the boundary CFT .
4	Our empirical study verifies the efficiency of the proposed method for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously in machine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods .	We study the non-smooth optimization problems in machine learning , where both the loss function and the regularizer are non-smooth functions .	Previous studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss function or a strongly convex regularizer , making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization .	We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is bilinear in primal and dual variables .	We cast a non-smooth optimization problem into a minimax optimization problem , and develop a primal dual prox method that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of $ O ( 1/T ) $ { assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved } , significantly faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an $ O ( 1/\sqrt { T } ) $ convergence rate .
4	We demonstrate the origin of this boundary condition from different starting points , using ( i ) a simplified Chalker-Coddington network model , ( ii ) the standard diagrammatic perturbation expansion , and ( iii ) the nonlinear sigma-model with the topological term , thus establishing connections between the different approaches .	We consider the bilocal conductivity tensor , the two-probe conductance and its fluctuations for a disordered phase-coherent two-dimensional system of non-interacting electrons in the presence of a magnetic field , including correctly the edge effects .	Analytical results are obtained by perturbation theory in the limit $ \sigma_ { xx } \gg 1 $ .	For mesoscopic systems the conduction process is dominated by diffusion but we show that , due to the lack of time-reversal symmetry , the boundary condition for diffusion is altered at the reflecting edges .	Instead of the usual condition , that the derivative along the direction normal to the wall of the diffusing variable vanishes , the derivative at the Hall angle to the normal vanishes .
3	For the XXZ model we discuss in detail the relation between our results , the phenomenological theory of spin diffusion , and measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation rate in spin chain compounds .	In integrable one-dimensional quantum systems an infinite set of local conserved quantities exists which can prevent a current from decaying completely .	For cases like the spin current in the XXZ model at zero magnetic field or the charge current in the attractive Hubbard model at half filling , however , the current operator does not have overlap with any of the local conserved quantities .	We show that in these situations transport at finite temperatures is dominated by a diffusive contribution with the Drude weight being either small or even zero .	Furthermore , we study the Haldane-Shastry model where the current operator is also orthogonal to the set of conserved quantities associated with integrability but becomes itself conserved in the thermodynamic limit .
2	However , the incorporation of three dimensional fractional supersymmetry in this framework needs some care .	A generalization of super-Lie algebras is presented .	It is then shown that all known examples of fractional supersymmetry can be understood in this formulation .	The proposed solutions lead naturally to a formulation of a fractional supersymmetry starting from any representation D of any Lie algebra g. This involves taking the Fth-roots of D in an appropriate sense .	A fractional supersymmetry in any space-time dimension is then possible .
3	Our best estimate of the renormalization scale independent B-parameter is $ \hat { B } _ { B_d } = 1.03 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.18 $ .	We present a high statistics , quenched lattice calculation of the B-parameters $ B_ { B_d } $ and $ B_ { B_s } $ , computed at lowest order in the HQET .	The results were obtained using a sample of 600 quenched gauge field configurations , generated by Monte Carlo simulation at $ \beta=6.0 $ on a $ 24^ { 3 } \times 40 $ lattice .	For the light quarks the SW-Clover action was used ; the propagator of the lattice HQET was also tree-level improved .	$ \hat { B } _ { B_d } $ has been obtained by using `` boosted '' perturbation theory to calculate the renormalization constants which relate the matrix elements of the lattice operators to the corresponding amplitudes in the continuum .
3	Generalizing a construction of Looijenga and Lunts one obtains possibly infinite dimensional Lie algebras attached to K\ '' ahler-Riemann foliations .	We construct real polarizable Hodge structures on the reduced leafwise cohomology of K\ '' ahler-Riemann foliations by complex manifolds .	As in the classical case one obtains a hard Lefschetz theorem for this cohomology .	Serre 's K\ '' ahlerian analogue of the Weil conjectures carries over as well .	Finally using $ ( \mathfrak { g } , K ) $ -cohomology we discuss a class of examples obtained by dividing a product of symmetric spaces by a cocompact lattice and considering the foliations coming from the factors .
4	This calculation illuminates recent conjectures for these moments based on connections with random matrix theory .	We use a smoothed version of the explicit formula to find an approximation to the Riemann zeta function as a product over its nontrivial zeros multiplied by a product over the primes .	We model the first product by characteristic polynomials of random matrices .	This provides a statistical model of the zeta function that involves the primes in a natural way .	We then employ the model in a heuristic calculation of the moments of the modulus of the zeta function on the critical line .
2	We develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56Ni yield in SNe Ia and use it to test the theory with data from the Supernova Legacy Survey .	Timmes , Brown & amp ; Truran found that metallicity variations could theoretically account for a 25 % variation in the mass of 56Ni synthesized in Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) , and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter in observed SN Ia luminosities .	Higher-metallicity progenitors are more neutron-rich , producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive 56Ni .	We find that the average 56Ni yield does drop in SNe Ia from high metallicity environments , but the theory can only account for 7 % -- 10 % of the dispersion in SN Ia 56Ni mass , and thus luminosity .	This is because the effect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar , whereas we find that SN hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solar metallicities .
4	Effective transport coefficients are calculated for several plasma conditions and display a strong nonlinear dependence on the parameters and on the radial variable .	Numerical simulations of L-mode plasma turbulence in the Scrape Off Layer of MAST are presented .	Relevant features of the boundary plasma , such as the thickness of the density layer or the statistics of the fluctuations are related to the edge density and temperature , plasma current and parallel connection length .	It is found that the density profile is weakly affected by the edge density , it broadens when the current or the temperature are decreased while the connection length has the opposite effect .	The statistics of the turbulence is relatively insensitive to variations of all the edge parameters and show a certain degree of universality .
1	random variables .	Consider a first-order autoregressive process $ X_i=\beta X_ { i-1 } +\varepsilon_i , $ where $ \varepsilon_i=G ( \eta_i , \eta_ { i-1 } , \ldots ) $ and $ \eta_i , i\in\mathbb { Z } $ are i.i.d .	Motivated by two important issues for the inference of this model , namely , the quantile inference for $ H_0 : \beta=1 $ , and the goodness-of-fit for the unit root model , the notion of the marked empirical process $ \alpha_n ( x ) =\frac { 1 } { n } \sum_ { i=1 } ^ng ( X_i/a_n ) I ( \varepsilon_i\leq x ) , x\in\mathbb { R } $ is investigated in this paper .	Herein , $ g ( \cdot ) $ is a continuous function on $ \mathbb { R } $ and $ \ { a_n\ } $ is a sequence of self-normalizing constants .	As the innovation $ \ { \varepsilon_i\ } $ is usually not observable , the residual marked empirical process $ \hat { \alpha } _n ( x ) =\frac { 1 } { n } \sum_ { i=1 } ^ng ( X_i/a_n ) I ( \hat { \varepsilon } _i\l eq x ) , x\in\mathbb { R } , $ is considered instead , where $ \hat { \varepsilon } _i=X_i-\hat { \beta } X_ { i-1 } $ and $ \hat { \beta } $ is a consistent estimate of $ \beta. $ In particular , via the martingale decomposition of stationary process and the stochastic integral result of Jakubowski ( Ann.Probab .
1	We find that the Kibble-Zurek picture of defect formation can be applied to describe the density of defects produced during the quench .	We study numerically and analytically the dynamics of defect formation during a finite-time quench of the two dimensional Swift-Hohenberg ( SH ) model of Rayleigh-Benard convection .	Our study reveals the relevance of two factors : the effect of local variations of the striped patterns within defect-free domains and the presence of both point-like and extended defects .	Taking into account these two aspects we are able to identify the characteristic length scale selected during the quench and to relate it to the density of defects .	We discuss possible consequences of our study for the analysis of the coarsening process of the SH model .
3	Their cell structure is weaker , as it does not come with a multiplication , and they are far from being p-Fermat , even weakly .	It is well-known that the spacetime diagrams of some cellular automata have a fractal structure : for instance Pascal 's triangle modulo 2 generates a Sierpinski triangle .	Explaining the fractal structure of the spacetime diagrams of cellular automata is a much explored topic , but virtually all of the results revolve around a special class of automata , whose typical features include irreversibility , an alphabet with a ring structure , a global evolution that is a ring homomorphism , and a property known as ( weakly ) p-Fermat .	The class of automata that we study in this article has none of these properties .	However , they do produce fractal spacetime diagrams , and we explain why and how .
1	At low temperatures ( $ & lt ; 50 $ K ) and when the chemical potential lies inside the bulk gap , the crystal resistivity is strongly temperature dependent , reflecting inelastic scattering due to the thermal activation of optical phonons .	We report on electric-field and temperature dependent transport measurements in exfoliated thin crystals of Bi $ _ { 2 } $ Se $ _ { 3 } $ topological insulator .	A linear increase of the current with voltage is obtained up to a threshold value at which current saturation takes place .	We show that the activated behavior , the voltage threshold and the saturation current can all be quantitatively explained by considering a single optical phonon mode with energy $ \hbar \Omega \approx 8 $ meV .	This phonon mode strongly interacts with the surface states of the material and represents the dominant source of scattering at the surface at high electric fields .
3	A diff-Pad\'e analysis of 2000 terms series for $ \chi^ { ( 5 ) } $ and $ \chi^ { ( 6 ) } $ confirms to a very high degree of confidence previous conjectures about the location and strength of the singularities of the $ n $ -particle components of the susceptibility , up to a small set of `` additional '' singularities .	We calculate very long low- and high-temperature series for the susceptibility $ \chi $ of the square lattice Ising model as well as very long series for the five-particle contribution $ \chi^ { ( 5 ) } $ and six-particle contribution $ \chi^ { ( 6 ) } $ .	These calculations have been made possible by the use of highly optimized polynomial time modular algorithms and a total of more than 150000 CPU hours on computer clusters .	For $ \chi^ { ( 5 ) } $ 10000 terms of the series are calculated { \it modulo } a single prime , and have been used to find the linear ODE satisfied by $ \chi^ { ( 5 ) } $ { \it modulo } a prime .	We find the presence of singularities at $ w=1/2 $ for the linear ODE of $ \chi^ { ( 5 ) } $ , and $ w^2= 1/8 $ for the ODE of $ \chi^ { ( 6 ) } $ , which are { \it not } singularities of the `` physical '' $ \chi^ { ( 5 ) } $ and $ \chi^ { ( 6 ) } , $ that is to say the series-solutions of the ODE 's which are analytic at $ w =0 $ .
1	The mass of the scalar field decouples from the UV dimension of the dual scalar operator and can be chosen as negative as we want , without disturbing the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound .	We investigate holographic superconductors in asympototically geometries with hyperscaling violation .	We first numerically find that the scalar condenses below a critical temperature and a gap opens in the real part of the conductivity , indicating the onset of superconductivity .	We further analytically explore the effects of the hyperscaling violation on the superconducting transition temperature .	We find that the critical temperature increases with the increasing of hyperscaling violation .
3	However , there is a major risk that users employ too precise topics to specify their queries : they may be employing a topic that is only `` close-by '' but missing to match the right resource .	At the very center of digital mathematics libraries lie controlled vocabularies which qualify the { \it topic } of the documents .	These topics are used when submitting a document to a digital mathematics library and to perform searches in a library .	The latter are refined by the use of these topics as they allow a precise classification of the mathematics area this document addresses .	We call this the { \it topic trap } .
0	In this paper we present a hybrid scheme for topological quantum computation in a system of cold atoms trapped in an atomic lattice .	A topological qubit subspace is defined using Majorana fermions which emerge in a network of atomic Kitaev one-dimensional wires .	We show how braiding can be efficiently implemented in this setup and propose a direct way to demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of Majorana fermions via a single parity measurement .	We then introduce a proposal for the efficient , robust and reversible mapping of the topological qubits to a conventional qubit stored in a single atom .	There , well-controlled standard techniques can be used to implement the missing gates required for universal computation .
0	N-Reggeized gluon states in Quantum Chromodynamics are described by BKP equation .	In order to solve this equation for N & gt ; 3 particles the Q-Baxter operator method is used .	Spectrum of the integrals of motion of the system exhibits a complicated structure .	In this work we consider the case with N=4 Reggeons where complicated relations between q_3-spectrum and q_4-spectrum are analysed .	Moreover , corrections to WKB approximation for N=4 and q_3=0 are computed .
0	Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations predict that the average opacity of the Ly-alpha forest should increase in the neighborhood of galaxies because galaxies form in dense environments .	Recent observations ( Adelberger et al .	2002 ) confirm this expectation at large scales , but they show a decrease of absorption at comoving separations Delta_r & lt ; ~ 1 Mpc/h .	We show that this discrepancy is statistically significant , especially for the innermost data point at Delta_r & lt ; = 0.5 Mpc/h , even though this data point rests on three galaxy-quasar pairs .	Galaxy redshift errors of the expected magnitude are insufficient to resolve the conflict .
3	For a given sensor , the higher the portion of channels with unconditionally secure key exchange the higher the trust value .	As the utilization of sensor networks continue to increase , the importance of security becomes more profound .	Many industries depend on sensor networks for critical tasks , and a malicious entity can potentially cause catastrophic damage .	We propose a new key exchange trust evaluation for peer-to-peer sensor networks , where part of the network has unconditionally secure key exchange .	We give a brief introduction to unconditionally secured key exchange concepts and mention current trust measures in sensor networks .
3	From the partition function we first constructed one example of entropy current with non-negative divergence upto the required order .	In hydrodynamics the existence of an entropy current with non-negative divergence is related to the existence of a time-independent solution in a static background .	Recently there has been a proposal for how to construct an entropy current from the equilibrium partition function of the fluid system .	In this note , we have applied this algorithm for the charged fluid at second order in derivative expansion .	Finally we extended it to its most general form , consistent with the principle of local entropy production .
3	In the case of the simultaneous measurement of several parameters , we provide the full quantum Fisher information matrix .	We calculate the quantum Cram\'er -- Rao bound for the sensitivity with which one or several parameters , encoded in a general single-mode Gaussian state , can be estimated .	This includes in particular the interesting case of mixed Gaussian states .	We apply the formula to the problems of estimating phase , purity , loss , amplitude , and squeezing .	Our results unify previously known partial results , and constitute a complete solution to the problem of knowing the best possible sensitivity of measurements based on a single-mode Gaussian state .
4	We also include existence and relaxation results for variational problems in $ \BD ( \Omega ) $ , as well as a complete discussion of some differential inclusions for the symmetrized gradient in two dimensions .	We establish a general weak* lower semicontinuity result in the space $ \BD ( \Omega ) $ of functions of bounded deformation for functionals of the form $ $ \Fcal ( u ) : = \int_\Omega f \bigl ( x , \Ecal u \bigr ) \dd x + \int_\Omega f^\infty \Bigl ( x , \frac { \di E^s u } { \di \abs { E^s u } } \Bigr ) \dd \abs { E^s u } + \int_ { \partial \Omega } f^\infty \bigl ( x , u|_ { \partial \Omega } \odot n_\Omega \bigr ) \dd \Hcal^ { d-1 } $ $ , $ u \in \BD ( \Omega ) $ .	The main novelty is that we allow for non-vanishing Cantor-parts in the symmetrized derivative $ Eu $ .	The proof is accomplished via Jensen-type inequalities for generalized Young measures and a construction of good blow-ups , which is based on local rigidity arguments for some differential inclusions involving symmetrized gradients .	This strategy allows us to establish the lower semicontinuity result without an Alberti-type theorem in $ \BD ( \Omega ) $ , which is not available at present .
0	Let $ G $ be a complex reductive group and $ V $ a $ G $ -module .	Then the $ m $ th jet scheme $ G_m $ acts on the $ m $ th jet scheme $ V_m $ for all $ m\geq 0 $ .	We are interested in the invariant ring $ \mathcal { O } ( V_m ) ^ { G_m } $ and whether the map $ p_m^*\colon\mathcal { O } ( ( V//G ) _m ) \rightarrow \mathcal { O } ( V_m ) ^ { G_m } $ induced by the categorical quotient map $ p\colon V\rightarrow V//G $ is an isomorphism , surjective , or neither .	Using Luna 's slice theorem , we give criteria for $ p_m^* $ to be an isomorphism for all $ m $ , and we prove this when $ G=SL_n $ , $ GL_n $ , $ SO_n $ , or $ Sp_ { 2n } $ and $ V $ is a sum of copies of the standard representation and its dual , such that $ V//G $ is smooth or a complete intersection .	We classify all representations of $ \mathbb { C } ^* $ for which $ p^*_ { \infty } $ is surjective or an isomorphism .
2	We argue that the Kaplan-Yorke dimension must be discontinuous at the transition and compare it to the correlation dimension .	The attractor dimension at the transition to complete synchronization in a network of chaotic units with time-delayed couplings is investigated .	In particular , we determine the Kaplan-Yorke dimension from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents for iterated maps and for two coupled semiconductor lasers .	For a system of Bernoulli maps we indeed find a jump in the correlation dimension .	The magnitude of the discontinuity in the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is calculated for networks of Bernoulli units as a function of the network size .
1	However , with regard to this objective , conventional estimation methods for discrete-time dynamical models are frequently found to be wanting .	Using a time series model to mimic an observed time series has a long history .	In fact , they are characteristically misguided in at least two respects : ( i ) assuming that there is a true model ; ( ii ) evaluating the efficacy of the estimation as if the postulated model is true .	There are numerous examples of models , when fitted by conventional methods , that fail to capture some of the most basic global features of the data , such as cycles with good matching periods , singularities of spectral density functions ( especially at the origin ) and others .	We argue that the shortcomings need not always be due to the model formulation but the inadequacy of the conventional fitting methods .
3	We found slightly smaller asymmetry at $ \sqrt { S } =500 $ GeV for $ \pi^ { \pm,0 } $ and $ K^+ $ compared with those at the lower energies .	We study the single transverse-spin asymmetry for inclusive light-hadron productions in the proton-proton collision , $ \pphx $ ( $ h=\pi , K , \eta $ ) , for the RHIC kinematics based on the twist-3 mechanism in the collinear factorization .	The analysis includes all the contributions from the soft-gluon pole and the soft-fermion pole for the twist-3 quark-gluon correlation functions in the transversely polarized proton .	After discussing the flavor decomposition and the $ P_T $ -dependence of the asymmetry obtained in the previous analysis at the center-of-mass energy $ \sqrt { S } =62.4 $ and 200 GeV , we will give a prediction for the asymmetry at $ \sqrt { S } =500 $ GeV and also for the $ \eta $ -meson production .	The asymmetry for the $ \eta $ -meson turned out to be significantly larger than that for $ \pi^0 $ .
3	The influence of kinematic and dynamic relativistic effects on those observables is systematically studied .	Relativistic Faddeev equations for three-body scattering at arbitrary energies are formulated in momentum space and in first order in the two-body transition-operator directly solved in terms of momentum vectors without employing a partial wave decomposition .	Relativistic invariance is incorporated within the framework of Poincare invariant quantum mechanics , and presented in some detail .	Based on a Malfliet-Tjon type interaction , observables for elastic and break-up scattering are calculated up to projectile energies of 1 GeV .	Approximations to the two-body interaction embedded in the three-particle space are compared to the exact treatment .
4	Co-clusters extracted from such data , which shows similar pattern in both the dimension , can be used for a more accurate predictive model building .	In the past few years co-clustering has emerged as an important data mining tool for two way data analysis .	Co-clustering is more advantageous over traditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such as , ability to find highly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns .	However , one of the overlooked benefits of co-clustering is that , it can be used to extract meaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes .	For example , building predictive models with high dimensional data and heterogeneous population is a non-trivial task .
2	Starting from the expression of neutrino spin oscillation frequency we have shown that even in this general context , in high energy limit the spin oscillation frequency for neutrino moving along circular orbit vanishes .	Neutrino spin and flavour oscillation in curved spacetime have been studied for the most general static spherically symmetric configuration .	Using the symmetry properties we have derived spin oscillation frequency for neutrino moving along a geodesic or in a circular orbit .	This finally lends itself to non-zero probability of neutrino helicity flip .	While for neutrino flavour oscillation we have derived general results for oscillation phase , which subsequently have been applied to different gravity theories .
3	Furthermore , clear charge disproportionation is observed for the pseudo cubic and double-layer systems , while not in the single-layer system .	The orbital shapes and charge disproportionations at nominal Mn $ ^ { 3+ } $ and Mn $ ^ { 4+ } $ sites for the charge- and orbital-ordered phases have been studied on half-doped manganites Pr ( Sr $ _ { 0.1 } $ Ca $ _ { 0.9 } $ ) $ _2 $ Mn $ _2 $ O $ _7 $ and Eu $ _ { 0.5 } $ Ca $ _ { 1.5 } $ MnO $ _4 $ with double-layer and single-layer Mn-O networks , respectively , by means of x-ray structural analyses , in comparison with Pr $ _ { 0.5 } $ Ca $ _ { 0.5 } $ MnO $ _3 $ with the pseudo cubic network .	In a single-layer Eu $ _ { 0.5 } $ Ca $ _ { 1.5 } $ MnO $ _4 $ system , the ( $ y^2-z^2 $ ) / ( $ z^2-x^2 $ ) -type orbital shape is observed , while the ( $ 3y^2-r^2 $ ) / ( $ 3x^2-r^2 $ ) -type orbital shape in a pseudo cubic Pr $ _ { 0.5 } $ Ca $ _ { 0.5 } $ MnO $ _3 $ system .	In a double-layer Pr ( Sr $ _ { 0.1 } $ Ca $ _ { 0.9 } $ ) $ _2 $ Mn $ _2 $ O $ _7 $ system , the orbital shape is found to undergo a large change upon thermally induced rotation of orbital stripe .	These results indicate that the orbital shape and charge disproportionation are sensitive to the dimension of Mn-O network .
1	We confirm the existence of two inequivalent ladder structures in each vanadium layer .	We report results of a new analysis for the low-temperature structure of alpha'-NaV2O5 from synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments .	Based on our structural data we perform a bond-valence calculation for the vanadium sites in the low temperature state .	Due to an asymmetric charge ordering we obtain only two different vanadium valences despite the three inequivalent sites .	This explains the 51V-NMR observation of only two resonant peaks in the charge ordered phase .
3	We divided the sample in several mass-redshift bins to obtain stacked galaxy spectra with an improved S/N .	We investigate the link between AGN activity , star-formation and stellar mass of the host galaxy at 0 & lt ; z & lt ; 1 , looking for spectroscopic traces of AGN and aging of the host .	This work provides an extension of the existing studies at z & lt ; 0.1 and contributes to shed light on galaxy evolution at intermediate redshifts .	We used the zCOSMOS 20k data to create a sample of galaxies at z & lt ; 1 .	We exploited emission-line diagnostic diagrams to separate AGN from star-forming galaxies .
0	Within the coexistence region between liquid and vapor the equilibrium pressure of a simulated fluid exhibits characteristic jumps and plateaus when plotted as a function of density at constant temperature .	These features exclusively pertain to a finite-size sample in a periodic box , as they are washed out in the bulk limit .	Below the critical density , at each pressure jump the shape of the liquid drop undergoes a morphological transition , changing from spherical to cylindrical to slab-like as the density is increased .	We formulate a simple theory of these shape transitions , which is adapted from a calculation originally developed by Binder and coworkers [ { \em J . Chem.Phys . }	{ \bf 120 } , 5293 ( 2004 ) ] .
0	Cosmic microwave background studies of non-Gaussianity involving higher-order multispectra can distinguish between early universe theories that predict nearly identical power spectra .	However , the recovery of higher-order multispectra is difficult from realistic data due to their complex response to inhomogeneous noise and partial sky coverage , which are often difficult to model analytically .	A traditional alternative is to use one-point cumulants of various orders , which collapse the information present in a multispectrum to one number .	The disadvantage of such a radical compression of the data is a loss of information as to the source of the statistical behaviour .	A recent study by Munshi & amp ; Heavens ( 2009 ) has shown how to define the skew spectrum ( the power spectra of a certain cubic field , related to the bispectrum ) in an optimal way and how to estimate it from realistic data .
2	A well-known conjecture states that every such Boolean function can be computed by a shallow decision tree .	A natural measure of smoothness of a Boolean function is its sensitivity ( the largest number of Hamming neighbors of a point which differ from it in function value ) .	The structure of smooth or equivalently low-sensitivity functions is still a mystery .	While this conjecture implies that smooth functions are easy to compute in the simplest computational model , to date no non-trivial upper bounds were known for such functions in any computational model , including unrestricted Boolean circuits .	Even a bound on the description length of such functions better than the trivial $ 2^n $ does not seem to have been known .
4	This is more than the astrometric displacement typically caused by an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable zone , which is about 1-4 micro-AU for long-lived main-sequence stars .	We investigate the astrometric effects of stellar surface structures as a practical limitation to ultra-high-precision astrometry , e.g.in the context of exoplanet searches , and to quantify the expected effects in different regions of the HR-diagram .	Stellar surface structures are likely to produce fluctuations in the integrated flux and radial velocity of the star , as well as a variation of the observed photocentre , i.e.astrometric jitter , and closure phase .	We use theoretical considerations supported by Monte Carlo simulations to derive statistical relations between the corresponding astrometric , photometric , and radial-velocity effects .	For most stellar types the astrometric jitter due to stellar surface structures is expected to be of order 10 micro-AU or greater .
4	A mathematical model is developed for the maximal likelihood estimation of the network behind the social interactions and for the identification of the suspicious logs .	In this paper , I present a method to solve a node discovery problem in a networked organization .	Covert nodes refer to the nodes which are not observable directly .	They affect social interactions , but do not appear in the surveillance logs which record the participants of the social interactions .	Discovering the covert nodes is defined as identifying the suspicious logs where the covert nodes would appear if the covert nodes became overt .
1	Our presentation is pedagogical .	The goal of this article is to present an introduction to loop quantum gravity -a background independent , non-perturbative approach to the problem of unification of general relativity and quantum physics , based on a quantum theory of geometry .	Thus , in addition to providing a bird 's eye view of the present status of the subject , the article should also serve as a vehicle to enter the field and explore it in detail .	To aid non-experts , very little is assumed beyond elements of general relativity , gauge theories and quantum field theory .	While the article is essentially self-contained , the emphasis is on communicating the underlying ideas and the significance of results rather than on presenting systematic derivations and detailed proofs .
1	However , in the absence of a complete full setting of quantum gravity and detailed knowledge of specific properties of quantum states , it remained difficult to make testable predictions .	Quantum cosmology has traditionally been studied at the level of symmetry-reduced minisuperspace models , analyzing the behavior of wave functions .	For quantum cosmology to be part of empirical science , it must allow for a systematic framework in which corrections to well-tested classical equations can be derived , with any ambiguities and ignorance sufficiently parameterized .	As in particle and condensed-matter physics , a successful viewpoint is one of effective theories , adapted to specific issues one encounters in quantum cosmology .	This review presents such an effective framework of quantum cosmology , taking into account , among other things , space-time structures , covariance , the problem of time and the anomaly issue .
1	We discuss some basic problems of the quantum kicked rotator ( QKR ) and review some important results in the literature .	This is the first of a series of two papers .	We point out the flaws in the inverse Cayley transform method to prove dynamic localization .	When $ \tau/2\pi $ , where $ \tau $ is the kick period , is very close to a rational number , the localization length is larger than the typical localization length .	We analytically prove anomalous localization and confirm it by numerical calculations .
4	This variance is consistent with typical biased \lcdm models and puts very strong constraints on the quality of SDSS photometric calibration .	We test the homogeneity of the Universe at $ z\sim 0.3 $ with the Luminous Red Galaxy ( LRG ) spectroscopic sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .	First , the mean number $ N ( R ) $ of LRGs within completely surveyed LRG-centered spheres of comoving radius $ R $ is shown to be proportional to $ R^3 $ at radii greater than $ R\sim 70 h^ { -1 } \mathrm { Mpc } $ .	The test has the virtue that it does not rely on the assumption that the LRG sample has a finite mean density ; its results show , however , that there \emph { is } such a mean density .	Secondly , the survey sky area is divided into 10 disjoint solid angular regions and the fractional rms density variations of the LRG sample in the redshift range $ 0.2 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.35 $ among these ( $ \sim 2\times10^7 h^ { -3 } \mathrm { Mpc^3 } $ ) regions is found to be 7 percent of the mean density .
3	Furthermore , we have evaluated the correspondence between the actual velocities in the simulation with values determined from the Stokes-I ( Doppler shift of the centre of gravity ) and Stokes-V profiles ( zero-crossing shift ) .	We present results of synthetic spectro-polarimetric diagnostics of radiative MHD simulations of solar surface convection with magnetic fields .	Stokes profiles of Zeeman-sensitive lines of neutral iron in the visible and infrared spectral ranges emerging from the simulated atmosphere have been calculated in order to study their relation to the relevant physical quantities and compare with observational results .	We have analyzed the dependence of the Stokes-I line strength and width as well as of the Stokes-V signal and asymmetries on the magnetic field strength .	We confirm that the line weakening in strong magnetic fields results from a higher temperature ( at equal optical depth ) in the magnetic flux concentrations .
3	If young , then BP Psc would be one of the nearest and oldest known classical T Tauri stars .	We have carried out a multiwavelength observational campaign demonstrating some of the remarkable properties of the infrared-bright variable star BP Psc .	Surrounded by a compact dusty , gaseous disk , this little-studied late-G ( or early-K ) type star emits about 75 % of its detected energy flux at infrared wavelengths .	Evidence for accretion of gas in conjunction with narrow bi-polar jets and Herbig-Haro objects is apparently consistent with classification of BP Psc as a pre-main sequence star , as postulated in most previous studies .	However , such an evolutionary classification encounters various problems that are absent or much less severe if BP Psc is instead a luminosity class III post-main sequence star .
2	We then show that the concurrence monotones provide bounds on quantum information tasks .	We extend the definition of concurrence into a family of entanglement monotones , which we call concurrence monotones .	We discuss their properties and advantages as computational manageable measures of entanglement , and show that for pure bipartite states all measures of entanglement can be written as functions of the concurrence monotones .	As an example , we discuss their applications to remote entanglement distributions ( RED ) such as entanglement swapping and remote preparation of bipartite entangled states ( RPBES ) .	We prove a powerful theorem which states what kind of ( possibly mixed ) bipartite states or distributions of bipartite states can not be remotely prepared .
2	We examine the spatial variations of the MIR emission components in slices through two of the ultra compact-HII ( UC-HII ) regions .	The massive star forming region W49A represents one of the largest complexes of massive star formation present in the Milky Way and contains at least fifty young massive stars still enshrouded in their natal molecular cloud .	We employ Spitzer/IRS spectral mapping observations of the northern part of W49A to investigate the mid-infrared ( MIR ) spatial appearance of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) bands , PAH plateau features , atomic lines and continuum emission .	We find that the PAH bands reproduce known trends , with the caveat that the 6.2 $ \mu $ m PAH band seems to decouple from the other ionized PAH bands in some of the UC-HII regions -- an effect previously observed only in one other object : the giant star forming region N66 in the LMC .	Furthermore , we compare the nature of the emission surrounding W49A to that of `diffuse ' sightlines .
4	Insulating ferromagnets are controlled by pair breaking and the superconducting gap is smaller if the ferromagnetic electrodes have a parallel spin orientation .	We consider a microscopic theory of F/S/F trilayers with metallic or insulating ferromagnets .	The trilayer with metallic ferromagnets is controlled by the formation of non local pair correlations among the two ferromagnets which do not exist with insulating ferromagnets .	The difference between the insulating and ferromagnetic models can be understood from lowest order diagrams .	Metallic ferromagnets are controlled by non local pair correlations and the superconducting gap is larger if the ferromagnetic electrodes have a parallel spin orientation .
4	Furthermore , the techniques also can be used to establish linear convergence for related methods such as the iterative thresholding algorithm for joint sparsity and the accelerated gradient projection method .	In this article a unified approach to iterative soft-thresholding algorithms for the solution of linear operator equations in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces is presented .	We formulate the algorithm in the framework of generalized gradient methods and present a new convergence analysis .	As main result we show that the algorithm converges with linear rate as soon as the underlying operator satisfies the so-called finite basis injectivity property or the minimizer possesses a so-called strict sparsity pattern .	Moreover it is shown that the constants can be calculated explicitly in special cases ( i.e.for compact operators ) .
4	In this paper , we build a mathematical model for identifying the key parameters for the M2M transport protocol and also the relationships among these parameters .	Traditional end-to-end congestion control mechanisms assume data transferring happens between each pair user .	In contrast , in a P2P network , many peers may locally keep a copy of a specific data object .	If the path between a pair of peers is congested , the requesting peer who wants to download data will switch to another peer in its neighbor peer list to fetch the data instead of decreasing the download rate from the current peer .	Thus , it is critical to study the performance in multi-point-to-multi-point ( M2M ) transport protocol in a P2P network .
1	In particular , first , we analyze in detail the Peres-Terno argument regarding the inconsistency of hybrid quantizations of the Sudarshan type .	We reappraise some of the hybrid classical-quantum models proposed in the literature with the goal of retrieving some of their common characteristics .	We show that to accept such hybrid formalism entails the necessity of dealing with additional degrees of freedom beyond those in the straight complete quantization of the system .	Second , we recover a similar enlargement of degrees of freedom in the so-called statistical hybrid models .	Finally , we use Wigner 's quantization of a simple model to illustrate how in hybrid systems the subsystems are never purely classical or quantum .
1	We use the 3D photoionisation code Mocassin } to model the emission from the gas and dust .	We present a three-dimensional photoionisation and dust radiative transfer model of NGC 6302 , an extreme , high-excitation planetary nebula .	We have produced a good fit to the optical emission-line spectrum , from which we derived a density distribution for the nebula .	A fit to the infrared coronal lines places strong constraints on the properties of the unseen ionising source .	We find the best fit comes from using a 220,000 K hydrogen-deficient central star model atmosphere , indicating that the central star of this PN may have undergone a late thermal pulse .
2	The 4 simulated halos have masses ranging from a few times $ 10^ { 10 } $ to nearly $ 10^ { 12 } $ solar masses .	We examine the pressure of the star-forming interstellar medium ( ISM ) of Milky-Way sized disk galaxies using fully cosmological SPH+N-body , high resolution simulations .	These simulations include explicit treatment of metal-line cooling in addition to dust and self-shielding , $ \mathrm { H_ { 2 } } $ based star formation .	Using a kinematic decomposition of these galaxies into present-day bulge and disk components , we find that the typical pressure of the star-forming ISM in the present-day bulge is higher than that in the present-day disk by an order of magnitude .	We also find that pressure of the star-forming ISM at high redshift is on average , higher than ISM pressures at low redshift .
0	We describe a technique for generating pulses of light with controllable photon numbers , propagation direction , timing , and pulse shapes .	The technique is based on preparation of an atomic ensemble in a state with a desired number of atomic spin excitations , which is later converted into a photon pulse .	Spatio-temporal control over the pulses is obtained by exploiting long-lived coherent memory for photon states and electromagnetically induced transparency ( EIT ) in an optically dense atomic medium .	Using photon counting experiments we observe generation and shaping of few-photon sub-Poissonian light pulses .	We discuss prospects for controlled generation of high-purity n-photon Fock states using this technique .
2	We minimized the projection effects by making the measurements from a view that is roughly orthogonal to the direction of the ejection .	Employing coronagraphic and EUV observations close to the solar surface made by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ( STEREO ) mission , we determined the heliocentric distance of coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) at the starting time of associated metric type II bursts .	We used the wave diameter and leading edge methods and measured the CME heights for a set of 32 metric type II bursts from solar cycle 24 .	We also chose image frames close to the onset times of the type II bursts , so no extrapolation was necessary .	We found that the CMEs were located in the heliocentric distance range from 1.20 to 1.93 solar radii ( Rs ) , with mean and median values of 1.43 and 1.38 Rs , respectively .
2	We characterize Cohen-Macaulay , l-Cohen-Macaulay , Buchsbaum , and Gorenstein* complexes X , and also orientable manifolds in terms of the enriched modules .	For a simplicial complex X on { 1,2 , ... , n } we define enriched homology and cohomology modules .	They are graded modules over k [ x_1 , ... , x_n ] whose ranks are equal to the dimensions of the reduced homology and cohomology groups .	We introduce the notion of girth for simplicial complexes and make a conjecture relating the girth to invariants of the simplicial complex .	We also put strong vanishing conditions on the enriched homology modules and describe the simplicial complexes we then get .
2	Using the definition of GGM , the effects of the hidden sector are contained in a set of global symmetry current correlator functions and is mediated through the bulk .	We use the `` General Gauge Mediation '' formalism to describe a 5D setup with an $ S^ { 1 } /Z_ { 2 } $ orbifold .	We first consider a model independent SUSY breaking hidden sector on one boundary and generic chiral matter on another .	We find the gaugino , sfermion and hyperscalar mass formulas for minimal and generalised messengers in different regimes of a large , small and intermediate extra dimension .	Then we use the 5D GGM formalism to construct a model in which an SU ( 5 ) ISS model is located on the hidden boundary .
3	In the direction transverse to the applied field , the electric susceptibility is the same as in vacuum , while in the longitudinal direction it depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field .	We study the photon self-energy for the in-medium photon in a three-flavor color superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field .	At strong magnetic field , the quark dynamics becomes $ ( 1+1 ) $ -dimensional and the self-energy tensor only has longitudinal components .	In this approximation there is no Debye or Meissner screenings at zero temperature , but the electric susceptibility is nonzero and highly anisotropic .	Such a behavior is a realization in cold-dense QCD of the magnetoelectric effect , which was first discovered in condensed matter physics .
2	We consider a linearly constrained minimum variance ( LCMV ) optimization problem with the bounded constraint based on this strategy and propose a CG type algorithm for implementation .	In this work a constrained adaptive filtering strategy based on conjugate gradient ( CG ) and set-membership ( SM ) techniques is presented for adaptive beamforming .	A constraint on the magnitude of the array output is imposed to derive an adaptive algorithm that performs data-selective updates when calculating the beamformer 's parameters .	The proposed algorithm has data-selective updates , a variable forgetting factor and performs one iteration per update to reduce the computational complexity .	The updated parameters construct a space of feasible solutions that enforce the constraints .
2	The derived abundances of s-elements nicely agree with theoretical s-process nucleosynthesis predictions during the AGB phase .	A chemical study of normal Galactic C ( N ) carbon stars is presented .	Abundances of Li , CNO isotopes and s-elements are derived .	However , the figures obtained for Li and the 12C/13C ratios might imply the existence of a non-standard mixing process during the AGB phase operating preferentially in low mass stars .	The intrinsic or extrinsic nature of C ( N ) stars is also discussed .
1	Two aspects relevant to low-frequency studies are particularly emphasized .	This paper deals with the spectral element modeling of seismic wave propagation at the global scale .	First , the method is generalized beyond the Cowling approximation in order to fully account for the effects of self-gravitation .	In particular , the perturbation of the gravity field outside the Earth is handled by a projection of the spectral element solution onto the basis of spherical harmonics .	Second , we propose a new formulation inside the fluid which allows to account for an arbitrary density stratification .
1	In total , 26 ASCA sources have been detected down to a 2-10keV flux limit of S = 5e-14 erg/cm/s .	We present additional optical spectroscopic identifications of sources identified in three deep ASCA GIS fields which also form part of a deep ROSAT survey .	LDSS observations have increased the spectroscopic completeness of the survey to between 65 and 85 per cent , with identifications for up to 13 QSOs with broad emission lines and 6 objects with narrow emission lines .	Combining these objects with the AGN identified in the LMA/HEAO-1 sample by Grossan , we find evidence for significant cosmological evolution in the 2-10keV band ( & lt ; V_e/V_a & gt ; =0.63+/-0.03 ) , fit by a pure luminosity evolution model ; L \propto ( 1+z ) ^k , k=2.04^ { +0.16 } _ { -0.22 } $ .	The present-epoch 2-10keV AGN X-ray luminosity function , \Phi ( L_X ) , is best represented by a two power law function : \Phi ( L_X ) \propto L^ { -3.0 } , L* & gt ; 10^ { 44.1 } erg/s ; $ \Phi ( L_X ) \propto L^ { -1.9 } $ , L* & lt ; 10^ { 44.1 } erg/s .
4	This suggests a different origin for the gap to that proposed by current theories , which predict a $ \sqrt { B } $ dependence .	We have measured the tunneling between two two-dimensional electron gases at high magnetic fields $ B $ , when the carrier densities of the two electron layers are matched .	For filling factors $ \nu & lt ; 1 $ , there is a gap in the current-voltage characteristics centered about $ V=0 $ , followed by a tunneling peak at $ \sim 6 $ ~mV .	Both features have been observed before and have been attributed to electron-electron interactions within a layer .	We have measured high field tunneling peak positions and fitted gap parameters that are proportional to $ B $ , and independent of the carrier densities of the two layers .
0	The formalism developed in the first paper of the series [ arXiv:0901.1060 ] is applied to two thermodynamic systems : ( i ) of three global observables ( the energy , the total electron number and the spin number ) , ( ii ) of one global observable ( the internal electron energy ) and two local ( position-dependent ) observables ( the total electron density and the spin density ) .	The two-component potential of the many-electron system of interest is constructed of a scalar external potential and a collinear magnetic field ( coupled only with the spin operator ) .	Various equilibrium characteristics of two systems are defined and investigated .	Conditions for the equivalence between two systems ( the same equilibrium density matrix demanded ) are derived and thoroughly discussed .	The applicability of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is extended to the thermodynamic spin-density functional theory .
4	The results , combined with RM imaging of cluster-embedded sources and ROSAT X-ray profiles indicates that the hot intergalactic gas within these `` normal '' clusters is permeated with a high filling factor by magnetic fields at levels of & lt ; |B| & gt ; = 5-10 ( l/10 kpc ) ^ { -1/2 } microGauss , where l is the field correlation length .	Results are presented of a new VLA-ROSAT study that probes the magnetic field strength and distribution over a sample of 16 `` normal '' low redshift ( z & lt ; 0.1 ) galaxy clusters .	The clusters span two orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity , and were selected to be free of ( unusual ) strong radio cluster halos , and widespread cooling flows .	Consistent with these criteria , most clusters show a relaxed X-ray morphology and little or no evidence for recent merger activity .	Analysis of the rotation measure ( RM ) data shows cluster-generated Faraday RM excess out to ~0.5 Mpc from cluster centers .
3	It will be shown that perturbative treatments must be discarded , and replaced by a more sophisticated formalism where the dynamics of the nanomagnet and the nuclei that couple to it are treated together from the beginning .	This mini-review presents a simple and accessible summary on the fascinating physics of quantum nanomagnets coupled to a nuclear spin bath .	These chemically synthesized systems are an ideal test ground for the theories of decoherence in mesoscopic quantum degrees of freedom , when the coupling to the environment is local and not small .	We shall focus here on the most striking quantum phenomenon that occurs in such nanomagnets , namely the tunneling of their giant spin through a high anisotropy barrier .	After a critical review of the theoretical predictions and their experimental verification , we continue with a set of experimental results that challenge our present understanding , and outline the importance of filling also this last gap in the theory .
4	We interpret our results in terms of a stochastic model and identify two mechanisms of clustering .	We investigate clustering of malignant glioma cells .	\emph { In vitro } experiments in collagen gels identified a cell line that formed clusters in a region of low cell density , whereas a very similar cell line ( which lacks an important mutation ) did not cluster significantly .	We hypothesize that the mutation affects the strength of cell-cell adhesion .	We investigate this effect in a new experiment , which follows the clustering dynamics of glioma cells on a surface .
2	Our model is essentially that of Araki and Tremaine ( 1986 ) , which we show can be both simplified and generalised .	This paper examines the onset of the viscous overstability in dense particulate rings .	First , we formulate a dense gas kinetic theory that is applicable to the Saturnian system .	Second , we put this model to work computing the equilibrium properties of dense planetary rings , which we subsequently compare with the results of N-body simulations , namely those of Salo ( 1991 ) .	Finally , we present the linear stability analyses of these equilibrium states , and derive criteria for the onset of viscous overstability in the self-gravitating and non-self-gravitating cases .
4	This method enables also to study second order properties of the so-called expected Euler Characteristic approximation using only elementary arguments and to extend these kind of results to some interesting classes of Gaussian fields .	We study the probability distribution $ F ( u ) $ of the maximum of smooth Gaussian fields defined on compact subsets of $ \R^d $ having some geometric regularity .	Our main result is a general formula for the density of $ F $ .	Even though this is an implicit formula , one can deduce from it explicit bounds for the density , hence for the distribution , as well as improved expansions for $ 1-F ( u ) $ for large values of $ u $ .	The main tool is the Rice formula for the moments of the number of roots of a random system of equation over the reals , of which we give a new simplified proof .
0	Transparent media exhibiting anomalous dispersion have been of considerable interest since Wang , Kuzmich , and Dogariu [ Nature { \bf 406 } , 277 ( 2000 ) ] first observed light propagate with superluminal and negative group velocities without absorption .	Here , we propose an atomic model exhibiting these properties , based on a generalization of amplification without inversion in a five-level DIGS system .	The system consists of a $ \Lambda $ atom prepared as in standard electromagnetically induced transparency ( EIT ) , with two additional metastable ground states coupled to the $ \Lambda $ atom ground states by two RF/microwave fields .	We consider two configurations by which population is incoherently pumped into the ground states of the atom .	Under appropriate circumstances , we predict a pair of new gain lines with tunable width , separation , and height .
4	This star would require a very low inclination angle ( i & lt ; 9deg ) to satisfy the mass function constraints ; however it can not be excluded as the counterpart without follow-up spectroscopy to detect emission signatures of accretion .	Using VLT/ISAAC , we detected 2 candidate counterparts to the bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28 , one bright and one faint , within the X-ray error circles of XMM-Newton and Chandra .	In determining the spectral types of the counterparts we applied 3 different extinction corrections ; one for an all-sky value , one for a Galactic Bulge value and one for a local value .	We find the local value , with an extinction law of alpha = 3.23 +- 0.01 is the only correction that results in colours and magnitudes for both bright and faint counterparts consistent with a small range of spectral types , and for the bright counterpart , consistent with the spectroscopic identification .	Photometry of the faint candidate indicates it is a K7/M0 V star at a distance of 3.75 +- 1 kpc .
4	The Born series of the harmonic forced oscillation case are derived by directly applying the approximation to the LTI system or by transforming the LTI system to Helmholtz equation prior to doing the approximation .	Linear-time invariant ( LTI ) oscillation systems such as forced mechanical vibration , series RLC and parallel RLC circuits can be solved by using simplest initial conditions or employing of Green 's function of which knowledge of initial condition of the force term is needed .	Here we show a mathematical connection of the LTI system and the Helmholtz equation form of the time-independent Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation in quantum mechanical scattering problem .	We apply Born approximation in quantum mechanics to obtain LTI general solution in form of infinite Born series which can be expressed as a series of one-dimensional Feynman graphs .	Conditions corresponding to the approximation are given for the case of harmonic driving force .
3	This allows to perform numerical simulations in which the trajectories and the density of the particles affect each other .	In this paper a new multiscale modeling technique is proposed .	It relies on a recently introduced measure-theoretic approach , which allows to manage the microscopic and the macroscopic scale under a unique framework .	In the resulting coupled model the two scales coexist and share information .	Crowd dynamics is the motivating application throughout the paper .
3	The Sr II spectrum is very strong , and the resonance lines show similar core-nib structure to the stronger Ca K line .	The magnetic , chemically peculiar A-star HR 710 ( HD 15144 , ADS 1849A , AB Cet ) has a close companion in a nearly circular orbit .	Its 3-day period is unusually short for such stars .	The system emits moderately hard x-rays , which likely come from a white dwarf secondary ( ADS 1849Ab ) .	We place only loose constraints on a model .
3	We also observe that from our pregeometric perspective it is rather natural to contemplate a spacetime whose pregeometric picture is based on the phase-space coordinates ( fields ) of a string .	Motivation for the study of spacetime noncommutativity comes primarily from its possible use in investigations of ( Planck-scale ) spacetime fuzziness , but most work focuses on S-matrix/field-theory observables and still very little has been established for geometric observables .	We argue that it might be useful to exploit the `` pregeometric '' formulation of spacetime noncommutativity , which in particular describes the coordinates of the Moyal plane in terms of the phase-space coordinates of a point particle `` living '' in a auxiliary/fictitious spacetime ( $ \ { x_1 , x_2\ } _ { Moyal } \equiv \ { q , p\ } _ { particle } $ ) .	This leads us straightforwardly to a distance operator for the Moyal plane , and allows us to expose some limitations of a previous attempt to describe the `` area of a disc '' in the Moyal plane .	The fact that such `` stringspaces '' essentially provide spacetime points with extendedness is relevant for the fuzziness of geometric spacetime observables in ways that we preliminarily characterize through an analysis of the distance observable on a two-dimensional stringspace and through the observation that by implementing the Amati-Ciafaloni-Veneziano/Gross-Mende uncertainty relation in the phase space of the pregeometric string one could have stringspaces with a novel type of fuzzy coordinates .
4	Methods : We compared linear polarization maps from dust continuum , obtained with PolKa at APEX , and $ ^ { 12 } $ CO ( $ J=2\rightarrow1 $ ) and ( $ J=1\rightarrow0 $ ) from the IRAM 30-m telescope and found no consistency between the two sets of polarization maps .	Context : We investigate non-Zeeman circular polarization and linear polarization levels of up to 1 % of $ ^ { 12 } $ CO spectral line emission detected in a shocked molecular clump around the supernova remnant ( SNR ) IC 443 , with the goal of understanding the magnetic field structure in this source .	Aims : We examine our polarization results to confirm that the circular polarization signal in CO lines is caused by a conversion of linear to circular polarization , consistent with anisotropic resonant scattering .	In this process background linearly polarized CO emission interacts with similar foreground molecules aligned with the ambient magnetic field and scatters at a transition frequency .	The difference in phase shift between the orthogonally polarized components of this scattered emission can cause a transformation of linear to circular polarization .
3	The 545 and 857 \GHz\ data are calibrated using Uranus and Neptune flux density measurements , compared with models of their atmospheric emissions to calibrate the data .	This paper describes the processing applied to the HFI cleaned time-ordered data to produce photometrically calibrated maps .	HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies , from 100 to 857 GHz .	To get the best accuracy on the calibration on such a large range , two different photometric calibration schemes have to be used .	The lower frequencies ( below 353 GHz ) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.One of the components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of the satellite in the Solar System , and is therefore time-variable .
1	The model is two-dimensional and has two different `` amino acids '' .	We study the thermodynamic behavior of a simple off-lattice model for protein folding .	Using numerical simulations of all chains containing eight or ten monomers , we examine the sequence dependence at a fixed temperature .	It is shown that only a few of the chains exist in unique folded state at this temperature , and the energy level spectra of chains with different types of behavior are compared .	Furthermore , we use this model as a testbed for two improved Monte Carlo algorithms .
2	The calculated bulk modulus value is found to be 23.23 GPa which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 20.5 GPa .	The structural , electronic , optical and vibrational properties of LiN $ _3 $ under high pressure have been studied using plane wave pseudopotentials within the generalized gradient approximation for the exchange and correlation functional .	The calculated lattice parameters agree quite well with experiments .	Our calculations reproduce well the trends in high pressure behavior of the structural parameters .	The present results show that the compressibility of LiN $ _3 $ crystal is anisotropic and the crystallographic b-axis is more compressible when compared to a- and c-axis which is also consistent with the experiment .
1	Using standard asymptotic analysis we prove that , on bounded domains , auxin peaks are not formed via a Turing instability in the active transport parameter , but via simple corrections to the homogeneous steady state .	We study the formation of auxin peaks in a generic class of concentration-based auxin transport models , posed on static plant tissues .	When the active transport is small , the geometry of the tissue encodes the peaks ' amplitude and location : peaks arise where cells have fewer neighbours , that is , at the boundary of the domain .	We test our theory and perform numerical bifurcation analysis on two models which are known to generate auxin patterns for biologically plausible parameter values .	In the same parameter regimes , we find that realistic tissues are capable of generating a multitude of stationary patterns , with a variable number of auxin peaks , that can be selected by different initial conditions or by quasi-static changes in the active transport parameter .
1	The model has a realistic set of predator-prey equations that describe the population dynamics of the species for any structure of the food web .	Simulations of the coevolution of many interacting species are performed using the Webworld model .	The equations account for competition between species for the same resources , and for the diet choice of predators between alternative prey according to an evolutionarily stable strategy .	The set of species present undergoes long-term evolution due to speciation and extinction events .	We summarize results obtained on the macro-evolutionary dynamics of speciations and extinctions , and on the statistical properties of the food webs that are generated by the model .
2	Deuterium chemistry and spin states of H $ _2 $ and H $ _3^+ $ isotopologues are included in this primarily gas-phase chemical model .	The deuterium fraction [ N $ _2 $ D $ ^+ $ ] / [ N $ _2 $ H $ ^+ $ ] , may provide information about the ages of dense , cold gas structures , important to compare with dynamical models of cloud core formation and evolution .	Here we introduce a complete chemical network with species containing up to three atoms , with the exception of the Oxygen chemistry , where reactions involving H $ _3 $ O $ ^+ $ and its deuterated forms have been added , significantly improving the consistency with comprehensive chemical networks .	We investigate dependence of deuterium chemistry on model parameters : density ( $ n_ { \rm H } $ ) , temperature , cosmic ray ionization rate , and gas-phase depletion factor of heavy elements ( $ f_ { \rm D } $ ) .	We also explore the effects of time-dependent freeze-out of gas-phase species and dynamical evolution of density at various rates relative to free-fall collapse .
0	We consider the linearized nonsymmetric theory of gravitation ( NGT ) within the background of an expanding universe and near a Schwarzschild mass .	We show that the theory always develops instabilities unless the linearized nonsymmetric lagrangian reduces to a particular simple form .	This form contains a gauge invariant kinetic term , a mass term for the antisymmetric metric-field and a coupling with the Ricci curvature scalar .	This form can not be obtained within NGT .	Based on the linearized lagrangian we know to be stable , we consider the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations of the antisymmetric gravitational field ( B-field ) from inflation up to the present day .
2	It possesses an $ N=2 $ symmetry since it can be obtained from a manifest $ N=2 $ coset algebra construction .	A manifestly $ N=2 $ supersymmetric coset formalism is introduced to describe integrable hierarchies .	It is applied to analyze the super-NLS equation .	A remarkable result is here discussed : the existence of a B\ '' { a } cklund transformation which connects the super-NLS equation to the equations belonging to the integrable hierarchy of one particular ( the $ a=4 $ ) $ N=2 $ super-KdV equation .	$ N=2 $ scalar Lax pair operators are introduced for both super-KdV and super-NLS .
1	This graph functional originated from the problem of source coding in information theory and was introduced by J. K\ '' { o } rner in 1973 .	The entropy of a graph is a functional depending both on the graph itself and on a probability distribution on its vertex set .	Although the notion of graph entropy has its roots in information theory , it was proved to be closely related to some classical and frequently studied graph theoretic concepts .	For example , it provides an equivalent definition for a graph to be perfect and it can also be applied to obtain lower bounds in graph covering problems .	In this thesis , we review and investigate three equivalent definitions of graph entropy and its basic properties .
0	We have obtained 21cm images of 19 spiral galaxies in the Coma cluster , using the VLA in its C and D configurations .	The sample selection was based on morphology , brightness , and optical diameters of galaxies within one Abell radius ( 1.2 degrees ) .	The HI detected , yet deficient galaxies show a strong correlation in their HI properties with projected distance from the cluster center .	The most strongly HI deficient ( HI Def & gt ; 0.4 ) galaxies are located inside a radius of 30 arcmin ( aprox 0.6 Mpc ) from the center of Coma , roughly the extent of the central X-ray emission .	These central galaxies show clear asymmetries in their HI distribution and/or shifts between the optical and 21cm positions .
4	The { \it signal-to-noise ratio } analysis shows that gravitational waves emitted from the $ r $ -mode instability from neutron stars with magnetic fields upto the order of $ 10^ { 14 } $ gauss may be detectable by the Advanced LIGO at 20 Mpc .	Studies have shown that emission of gravitational wave drives an instability in the $ r $ -modes of young rapidly rotating neutron stars carrying away most of the angular momentum through gravitational wave emission in the first year or so after their formation .	Magnetic field plays a crucial role in the evolution of these $ r $ -modes and hence the evolution of the neutron star itself .	An attempt is made here to investigate the role of magnetic field in the evolution of $ r $ -mode instability and detectibility of gravitational waves emitted by a newly born , hot and rapidly and differentially rotating neutron star .	It is found that magnetic field tend to suppress the $ r $ -mode amplitude .
0	We present observational data for two main components ( S255IR and S255N ) of the S255 high mass star forming region in continuum and molecular lines obtained at 1.3 mm and 1.1 mm with the SMA , at 1.3 cm with the VLA and at 23 and 50 cm with the GMRT .	The angular resolution was from ~ 2 '' to ~ 5 '' for all instruments .	With the SMA we detected a total of about 50 spectral lines of 20 different molecules ( including isotopologues ) .	About half of the lines and half of the species ( in particular N2H+ , SiO , C34S , DCN , DNC , DCO+ , HC3N , H2CO , H2CS , SO2 ) have not been previously reported in S255IR and partly in S255N at high angular resolution .	Our data reveal several new clumps in the S255IR and S255N areas by their millimeter wave continuum emission .
2	It appears that SFE is well-defined for arbitrary electromagnetic fields .	Strong-Field Electrodynamics ( SFE ) is Maxwell theory with a certain Lorentz-covariant Ohm 's law which uses only the electromagnetic degrees of freedom .	We show that SFE is { \it semi-dissipative } : while the dissipation rate of the electromagnetic energy is non-negative , it can be exactly zero for non-trivial electromagnetic fields .	It should be possible to calculate the dissipative pulsar magnetosphere and resolve the magnetic separatrix using SFE .	We show that SFE reduces to Force-Free Electrodynamics ( FFE ) in the large conductivity limit .
3	The finite size behaviour of the loop in the curve describing the inverse temperature versus energy density is discussed , emphasizing that the extrema do not have the meaning of van der Waals-like `` spinodal points '' separating metastable from unstable states , but rather describe the onset of heterophase states : droplet/bubble evaporation/condensation transitions .	The investigation of phase coexistence in systems with multi-component order parameters in finite systems is discussed , and as a generic example , Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional q-state Potts model ( q=30 ) on LxL square lattices ( 40 & lt ; =L & lt ; =100 ) are presented .	It is shown that the microcanonical ensemble is well-suited both to find the precise location of the first order phase transition and to obtain an accurate estimate for the interfacial free energy between coexisting ordered and disordered phases .	For this purpose , a microcanonical version of the heatbath algorithm is implemented .	Thus all parts of these loops , including the parts that correspond to a negative specific heat , describe phase coexistence in full thermal equilibrium .
3	It can be used not only for the study of tunneling between condensates of atomic gases , but for solid state Josephson junctions and coupled Cooper pair boxes .	In this review we demonstrate how the algebraic Bethe ansatz is used for the calculation of the energy spectra and form factors ( operator matrix elements in the basis of Hamiltonian eigenstates ) in exactly solvable quantum systems .	As examples we apply the theory to several models of current interest in the study of Bose-Einstein condensates , which have been successfully created using ultracold dilute atomic gases .	The first model we introduce describes Josephson tunneling between two coupled Bose-Einstein condensates .	The theory is also applicable to models of atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensates , with two examples given and analysed .
2	We relate uniformly rigid spaces to their associated classical rigid spaces , and we transfer various constructions and results from rigid geometry to the uniformly rigid setting .	We define a new category of non-archimedean analytic spaces over a complete discretely valued field , which we call uniformly rigid .	It extends the category of rigid spaces , and it can be described in terms of bounded functions on products of open and closed polydiscs .	In particular , we prove an analog of Kiehl 's patching theorem for coherent ideals , and we define the uniformly rigid generic fiber of a formal scheme of formally finite type .	This uniformly rigid generic fiber is more intimately linked to its model than the classical rigid generic fiber obtained via Berthelot 's construction .
0	Together with a characteristic function , idempotent permutations uniquely determine idempotent maps , as well as their linearly ordered arrangement simultaneously .	Furthermore , in-place linear time transformations are possible between them .	Hence , they may be important for succinct data structures , information storing , sorting and searching .	In this study , their combinatorial interpretation is given and their application on sorting is examined .	Given an array of n integer keys each in [ 1 , n ] , if it is allowed to modify the keys in the range [ -n , n ] , idempotent permutations make it possible to obtain linearly ordered arrangement of the keys in O ( n ) time using only 4log ( n ) bits , setting the theoretical lower bound of time and space complexity of sorting .
2	Meanwhile , the `` analytized '' perturbation expansion for an observable $ F $ , in contrast with the usual case , may contain specific functions $ { \cal A } _n ( x ) = [ a^n ( x ) ] _ { \rm an } $ , the `` n-th power of $ a ( x ) $ analytized as a whole '' , instead of $ ( { \cal A } ( x ) ) ^n $ .	The structure of the QFT expansion is studied in the framework of a new `` Invariant analytic '' version of the perturbative QCD .	Here , an invariant ( running ) coupling $ a ( Q^2/\Lambda^2 ) =\beta_1\alpha_s ( Q^2 ) /4\pi $ is transformed into a `` $ Q^2 $ -- analytized '' invariant coupling $ a_ { \rm an } ( Q^2/\Lambda^2 ) \equiv { \cal A } ( x ) $ which , by constuction , is free of ghost singularities due to incorporating some nonperturbative structures .	In other words , the pertubation series for $ F ( x ) $ , due to analyticity imperative , may change its form turning into an { \it asymptotic expansion \`a la Erd\'elyi over a nonpower set } $ \ { { \cal A } _n ( x ) \ } $ .	We analyse sets of functions $ \ { { \cal A } _n ( x ) \ } $ and discuss properties of non-power expansion arising with their relations to feeble loop and scheme dependence of observables .
2	This avoids the problem of DC offsets which plagues conventional AC calorimeters .	We developed a new type of AC microcalorimeter based on a modulated-bath technique for measuring the specific heat of small microgram samples in the temperature range from 30-300 K , and tested it in magnetic fields up to 14 T. The device is built from a modified commercial Peltier element .	The temperature of its top plate can be modulated periodically by Peltier effect , so that the oscillation is symmetrical about the temperature of the main bath .	The sample is attached to a thin thermocouple cross , acting as a weak thermal link to a platform .	The absence of a heater reduces the background heat capacity ( 'addenda ' ) to a minimum .
4	Then , based on the theory of random geometric graph , we show that the minimum training length scales in the order of $ \ln K $ , where $ K $ is the number of users covered by a CRAN .	We consider training-based channel estimation for a cloud radio access network ( CRAN ) , in which a large amount of remote radio heads ( RRHs ) and users are randomly scattered over the service area .	In this model , assigning orthogonal training sequences to all users will incur a substantial overhead to the overall network , and is even impossible when the number of users is large .	Therefore , in this paper , we introduce the notion of local orthogonality , under which the training sequence of a user is orthogonal to those of the other users in its neighborhood .	We model the design of locally orthogonal training sequences as a graph coloring problem .
4	We now know from Super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory data that neutrinos have mass , and that the total neutrino contribution to the cosmological density must be at least as large as $ \Omega_\nu \sim 0.001 $ , a little less than that of the visible stars in the universe .	This article summarizes the possible roles of neutrinos in cosmology , from the first three minutes onward .	The fact that primordial neutrinos are about as numerous as the photons of the cosmological background radiation means that neutrino ( or `` hot '' ) dark matter can have a significant impact upon how matter is distributed in the universe .	Over the past two decades , the liklihood of this has risen and fallen as more and more data has become available from laboratory experiments and the latest telescopes .	Hot dark matter models were studied in the late 1970s and early 1980s , and there was considerable interest in cold plus hot dark matter models for a few years in the mid-1990s .
2	This holds both for the `` classical '' renormalization related to defect coupling with average local electron density and for the `` mesoscopic '' renormalization caused by the mesoscopic fluctuations of electronic density the dynamical defects are coupled with .	We study effect of the adiabatic electron renormalization on the parameters of the dynamical defects in the ballistic metallic point contact .	The upper energy states of the `` dressed '' defect are shown to give a smaller contribution to a resistance of the contact than the lower energy ones .	In the case of mesoscopic renormalization one may treat the dynamical defect as coupled with Friedel oscillations originated by the other defects , both static and mobile .	Such coupling lifts the energy degeneracy of the states of the dynamical defects giving different mesoscopic contribution to resistance , and provides a new model for the fluctuator as for the object originated by the electronic mesoscopic disorder rather than by the structural one .
2	Because the pulsar exhibits strong diffractive scintillation , these statistics convey information about the spatial extent of the radio emission region .	Using a novel technique , we achieve ~100 picoarcsecond resolution and set an upper bound of less than 4 km for the characteristic size of the Vela pulsar 's emission region .	Specifically , we analyze flux-density statistics of the Vela pulsar at 760 MHz .	We measure both a characteristic size of the emission region and the emission sizes for individual pulses .	Our results imply that the radio emission altitude for the Vela pulsar at this frequency is less than 340 km .
4	A larger fraction of the super-DLAs lie close to or above the line [ X/H ] =20.59-log N ( HI ) in the metallicity vs. N ( HI ) plot , compared to the less gas-rich DLAs , suggesting that super-DLAs are more likely to be rich in molecules .	We report Keck/ESI and VLT/UVES observations of three super-damped Lyman-alpha quasar absorbers with H I column densities log N ( HI ) & gt ; = 21.7 at redshifts z=2-2.5 .	All three absorbers show similar metallicities ( -1.3 to -1.5 dex ) , and dust depletion of Fe , Ni , and Mn .	Two of the absorbers show supersolar [ S/Zn ] and [ Si/Zn ] .	We combine our results with those for other DLAs to examine trends between N ( HI ) , metallicity , dust depletion .
2	BRLOs have both broad radio recombination lines ( $ \Delta $ V $ & gt ; $ 60 \kms ) and rising spectra ( S $ _ { \nu } \sim\nu^ { \alpha } $ ) , with $ \alpha $ values greater than 0.4 .	High resolution 7 mm observations of the W49N massive star forming region have detected recombination line emission from the individual ultracompact ( UC ) HII regions on 50 milliarcsecond ( 600 AU ) scales .	These line observations , combined with multifrequency , high-resolution continuum imaging of the region at 7 mm ( VLA ) and at 3 mm and 1 mm ( BIMA ) , indicate that five to seven of the eighteen ultracompact sources in W49N are broad recombination line objects ( BRLOs ) as described by Jaffe & amp ; Martin-Pintado ( 1999 ) .	The broad line widths of the H52 $ \alpha $ line are probably related to motions in the ionized gas rather than pressure broadening .	A number of models have been proposed to explain the long lifetime of UC HII regions , including the photoevaporated disk model proposed by Hollenbach et al . ( 1994 ) .
0	The Uhrig dynamical decoupling sequence achieves high-order decoupling of a single system qubit from its dephasing bath through the use of bang-bang Pauli pulses at appropriately timed intervals .	High-order decoupling of single and multiple qubit systems from baths causing both dephasing and relaxation can also be achieved through the nested application of Uhrig sequences , again using single-qubit Pauli pulses .	For the 3-qubit decoherence free subsystem ( DFS ) and related subsystem encodings , Pauli pulses are not naturally available operations ; instead , exchange interactions provide all required encoded operations .	Here we demonstrate that exchange interactions alone can achieve high-order decoupling against general noise in the 3-qubit DFS .	We present decoupling sequences for a 3-qubit DFS coupled to classical and quantum baths and evaluate the performance of the sequences through numerical simulations .
2	The elastic edge-edge interactions force ultra-narrow ribbons to be flat , which then bifurcate to twisted and bent shapes at critical widths that vary inversely with edge stress .	Efforts to modulate the electronic properties of atomically thin crystalline nanoribbons requires precise control over their morphology .	Here , we perform atomistic simulations on freestanding graphene nanoribbons ( GNRs ) to first identify the minimal shapes , and then employ a core-edge framework based on classical plate theory to quantify the width dependence in more general systems .	Compressive edge stresses results in twisted and saddle shapes that are energetically indistinguishable in the vicinity of the bifurcation .	Increasing widths favor the saddle shapes with ( longitudinal ) ribbon curvatures that vary non-linearly with width and edge stress .
2	However , the probability of detectable pulsations is higher in transient systems where the mass accretion is sporadic and the neutron star is likely to have a low mass .	We investigate the dependence of pulse amplitudes of accreting millisecond pulsars on the masses of the neutron stars .	Because the pulsation amplitudes are suppressed as the neutron stars become more massive , the probability of detection of pulsations decreases in systems that have been accreting for a long time .	We propose this mechanism as the explanation of the small number of millisecond X-ray pulsars found to date , as well as their emergence as fast pulsars mostly in transient , low-Mdot systems .	This mechanism can also quantitatively explain the lack of pulsars in the majority of LMXBs .
3	In addition , we find that another ferromagnetic phase without orbital order realizes in a wide filling region for large Hund 's rule coupling .	To understand effects of orbital degeneracy on magnetism , in particular effects of Hund 's rule coupling , we study the two-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice by a variational Monte Carlo method .	As a variational wave function , we consider a Gutzwiller projected wave function for a staggered spin and/or orbital ordered state .	We find a ferromagnetic phase with staggered orbital order around quarter-filling , i.e. , electron number n=1 per site , and an antiferromagnetic phase without orbital order around half-filling n=2 .	These two ferromagnetic states are metallic except for quarter filling .
3	The compact zero-metal stars also experienced more fallback than their solar metallicity counterparts .	Two-dimensional simulations of mixing and fall back in non-rotating massive stars have been carried out using realistic initial models for the presupernova star and assuming standard spherically symmetric explosions of 1.2*10^51ergs .	Stars of 15 and 25 solar masses with both primordial and solar composition were modeled .	The zero metallicity supernova progenitors were compact blue stars and the amount of Rayleigh-Taylor induced mixing in them was greatly reduced compared with what was seen in the red supergiants with solar metallicity .	As a result , the ejected nucleosynthesis from the two populations was very different .
1	The differential cross section with radiative corrections due to emission of virtual and soft real photons calculated to a power accuracy is presented .	The process of large-angle high energy electron-positron scattering with emission of one hard photon almost collinear to one of the charged particles momenta is considered .	Emission of two hard photons and total expressions for radiative correction are given in leading logarithmical approximation .	The latter are illustrated by numeric estimates .	A relation of the results with structure function formalism is discussed .
1	The oxygen partial pressure , PO2 , during the growth was systematically varied .	Anatase Ti0.96Co0.04O2 films were grown epitaxially on SrTiO3 ( 001 ) substrates by using plused laser deposition with in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction .	As PO2 decreased , the growth behavior was changed from a 2-dimensional layer-by-layer-like growth to a 3-dimensional island-like one , which resulted in an increase in the saturation magnetization .	These structural and magnetic changes were explained in terms of the formation of cobalt clusters whose existence was proved by transmission-electron-microscopie studies .	Our work clearly indicates that the cobalt clustering will cause room-temperature ferromagnetism in the Co-doped TiO2 films .
2	We present measurements of 19 DIBs ' properties in 50 sightlines towards hot stars , distributed at a variety of galactic coordinates and interstellar reddening .	Diffuse interstellar bands ( DIBs ) can trace different conditions of the ISM along the sightline toward the observed stars .	A small survey was made in optical wavelengths , producing high resolution and high signal to noise spectra .	Equivalent widths were obtained by fitting asymmetric Gaussian and variable continuum to DIBs .	Conditions of the ISM were calculated from 8 atomic and molecular interstellar lines .
3	It is modest for B - & gt ; DK but can be O ( 1 ) for B - & gt ; D\pi .	We investigate the implications of direct CP violation ( CPV ) on the determination of the unitarity triangle angle \gamma\ from B - & gt ; DK decays .	We show that \gamma\ can still be extracted even with the inclusion of direct CPV in charm if ( i ) at least one of the D decays has negligible CP violation ; and ( ii ) data from charm factory at threshold are used .	If approximate expressions without including direct CP violation in charm are used , this can result in a shift in \gamma\ that is O ( r_D/r_B ) .	We illustrate the size of the shift on an example of Gronau-London-Wyler method .
3	The course is supported by a rich and complex tutor organization .	Project management education programmes are often proposed in higher education to give students competences in project planning ( Gantt 's chart ) , project organizing , human and technical resource management , quality control and also social competences ( collaboration , communication ) , emotional ones ( empathy , consideration of the other , humour , ethics ) , and organizational ones ( leadership , political vision , and so on ) .	This training is often given according a training-by-project type of learning with case studies .	This article presents one course characterized by a pedagogical organization based upon Knowledge Management ( KM ) concepts : knowledge transfer and construction throughout a learning circle and social interactions .	We have observed this course by using another KM method inspired from KADS with various return of experience formalized into cards and charts .
0	In the 19th century , several astronomers made observations of sunspots , recording their positions and sometimes their areas .	These observations were published in the form of extensive tables , but have been unhelpful until now .	Three of these observers were Richard C. Carrington , Christian H. F. Peters , and Warren de la Rue ( and their respective collaborators ) .	They published , in various articles the data corresponding to 26 641 sunspot positions ( Carrington , Peters , and de la Rue registered 4 900 , 14 040 , and 7 701 sunspot positions , respectively ) .	In this paper we present a translation of more than 400 pages of their printed numerical tables into a machine readable format , including an initial analysis targeted at detecting possible mistakes in the reading or in the original transcription .
2	A stochastic source method is used to reduce inversions in calculating propagators .	We present our preliminary results on the lowest moment & lt ; x & gt ; of quark distribution functions of the pion using two flavor dynamical simulations with Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist .	The calculation is done in a range of pion masses from 300 to 500 MeV .	Finite volume effects at the lowest quark mass are examined by using two different lattice volumes .	Our results show that we achieve statistical errors of only a few percent .
4	Generation of the transverse current in the scattering-free ballistic transport regime provides unambiguous evidence for the intrinsic inverse spin Hall effect .	We report observation of intrinsic inverse spin Hall effect in un-doped GaAs multiple quantum wells with a sample temperature of 10 K. A transient ballistic pure spin current is injected by a pair of laser pulses through quantum interference .	By time-resolving the dynamics of the pure spin current , the momentum relaxation time is deduced , which sets the lower limit of the scattering time between electrons and holes .	The transverse charge current generated by the pure spin current via the inverse spin Hall effect is simultaneously resolved .	We find that the charge current is generated well before the first electron-hole scattering event .
1	The stages account for the different times taken by helium to occupy the octahedral and tetrahedral interstices in the C60 lattice .	The kinetics of helium gas sorption by a C60 powder and subsequent desorption of the 4He impurity from the saturated powder has been investigated in the temperature interval T = 2-292 K. Evidence is obtained that supports the existence of two stages in the temperature dependences of sorption and desorption .	The characteristic times of sorption and desorption coincide .	It is found that the temperature dependences of the characteristic times of occupying the octahedral and tetrahedral interstices are nonmonotonic .	As the temperature is lowered from 292 K to 79.3 K , the characteristic times increase , which indicates a predominance of thermally activated diffusion of helium in C60 .
4	The total energy calculations indicate that the lowest energy structures of AcN , ThN , and PaN are degenerate at the NM+SOC , FM+SOC , and AFM+SOC levels of theory with vanishing total magnetic moments in the FM+SOC and AFM+SOC cases , making the ground states essentially non-magnetic with spin-orbit interaction .	The full potential all electron linearized augmented plane wave plus local orbitals ( FP-LAPW + lo ) method , as implemented in the suite of software WIEN2K , has been used to systematically investigate the structural , electronic , and magnetic properties of the actinide compounds AnN ( An = Ac , Th , Pa , U , Np , Pu , Am ) .	The theoretical formalism used is the generalized gradient approximation to density functional theory ( GGA-DFT ) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof ( PBE ) exchange-correlation functional .	Each compound has been studied at six levels of theory : non-magnetic ( NM ) , non-magnetic with spin-orbit coupling ( NM+SOC ) , ferromagnetic ( FM ) , ferromagnetic with spin-orbit coupling ( FM+SOC ) , anti-ferromagnetic ( AFM ) , and anti-ferromagnetic with spin-orbit coupling ( AFM+SOC ) .	The structural parameters , bulk moduli , densities of states , and charge distributions have been computed and compared to available experimental data and other theoretical calculations published in the literature .
3	As a by-product of this investigation , we study the causal structure of the string dual to the nucleated pair as seen by different static observers and we show that it can be interpreted as a dynamical creation of a `gluonic ' wormhole .	Using the AdS/CFT correspondence , we construct the holographic dual of a tunneling instanton describing Schwinger pair creation in de Sitter space .	Our approach allows us to extract the critical value of the electric field for which the potential barrier disappears , rendering the vacuum unstable .	In addition , we compute the large- $ \lambda $ , large- $ N_c $ corrections to the nucleation rate and we find that it agrees with previous expectations based on perturbative computations .	We explain how this result provides further evidence for the ER=EPR conjecture as an equivalence between two descriptions of the same physical phenomenon .
0	We consider generalizations of Szpiro 's classical discriminant conjecture to hyperelliptic curves over a number field $ K $ , and to smooth , projective and geometrically connected curves $ X $ over $ K $ of genus at least one .	The main results give effective exponential versions of the generalized conjectures for some curves , including all curves $ X $ of genus one or two .	We obtain in particular exponential versions of Szpiro 's classical discriminant conjecture for elliptic curves over $ K $ .	In course of our proofs we establish explicit results for certain Arakelov invariants of hyperelliptic curves ( e.g.Faltings ' delta invariant ) which are of independent interest .	The proofs use the theory of logarithmic forms and Arakelov theory for arithmetic surfaces .
3	We find that the coupling together of a large number of low-lying excitations leads to strong many-body corrections , which could be observed in inelastic light scattering or optical absorption .	We consider graphene in a strong perpendicular magnetic field at zero temperature with an integral number of filled Landau levels and study the dispersion of single particle-hole excitations .	We first analyze the two-body problem of a single Dirac electron and hole in a magnetic field interacting via Coulomb forces .	We then turn to the many-body problem , where particle-hole symmetry and the existence of two valleys lead to a number of effects peculiar to graphene .	We also discuss in detail how the appearance of different branches in the exciton dispersion is sensitive to the number of filled spin and valley sublevels .
0	Share prices of financial companies from the S & amp ; P 500 list have been modeled by a linear function of consumer price indices in the USA .	The Johansen and Engle-Granger tests for cointegration both demonstrated the presence of an equilibrium long-term relation between observed and predicted time series .	Econometrically , the pricing concept is valid .	For several companies , share prices are defined only by CPI readings in the past .	Therefore , our empirical pricing model is a deterministic one .
0	We present a heuristic search algorithm for solving first-order MDPs ( FOMDPs ) .	Our approach combines first-order state abstraction that avoids evaluating states individually , and heuristic search that avoids evaluating all states .	Firstly , we apply state abstraction directly on the FOMDP avoiding propositionalization .	Such kind of abstraction is referred to as firstorder state abstraction .	Secondly , guided by an admissible heuristic , the search is restricted only to those states that are reachable from the initial state .
1	We investigate in detail the influence of external nonclassical light fields on current-voltage step structures of the MJJ .	In this paper , we study the supercurrent in a mesoscopic Josephson junction ( MJJ ) and its quantum statistical properties in the presence of nonclassical light fields .	We also study in detail quantum statistical properties of the supercurrent when the external quantum electromagnetic fields are even and odd coherent-state light fields .	It is shown that the supercurrent in the MJJ exhibits both squeezing effect and quantum coherences .	It is demonstrated that the MJJ can feel the difference not only between classical light fields and nonclassical light fields but also between different nonclassical light fields .
2	We show also that the conformal invariance of the spin 0 sector can be naturally achieved by introducing a compensating term in the lagrangian .	We investigate the conformal invariance of massless Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory coupled to riemannian space-times .	We show that , as usual , in the minimal coupling procedure only the spin 1 sector of the theory -which corresponds to the electromagnetic field- is conformally invariant .	Such a procedure -besides not modifying the spin 1 sector- leads to the well-known conformal coupling between the scalar curvature and the massless Klein-Gordon-Fock field .	Going beyond the riemannian spacetimes , we briefly discuss the effects of a nonvanishing torsion in the scalar case .
2	A number of authors have sought to address this issue by incorporating regularized approaches , such as the lasso , that impose sparse or low-rank structures on the estimated coefficient parameters of the VAR .	Vector autoregression ( VAR ) is a fundamental tool for modeling the joint dynamics of multivariate time series .	However , as the number of component series is increased , the VAR model quickly becomes overparameterized , making reliable estimation difficult and impeding its adoption as a forecasting tool in high dimensional settings .	More traditional approaches attempt to address overparameterization by selecting a low lag order , based on the assumption that dynamic dependence among components is short-range .	However , these methods typically assume a single , universal lag order that applies across all components , unnecessarily constraining the dynamic relationship between the components and impeding forecast performance .
3	The particle and thermal photon spectra are seen to differ only marginally , for the two equations of state .	We find that an equation of state for hot hadronic matter consisting of all baryons having $ M & lt ; 2 $ GeV and all mesons having $ M & lt ; 1.5 $ GeV , along with Hagedorn resonances in thermal and chemical equilibrium , matches rather smoothly with lattice equation of state ( p4 action , $ { N_\tau } =8 $ ) for T up to $ \approx 200 $ MeV , when corrected for the finite volume of hadrons .	Next we construct two equations of state for strongly interacting matter ; one , HHL , in which the above is matched to the lattice equation of state at $ T=165 $ MeV and the other , HHB , where we match it to a bag model equation of state with critical temperature $ T_c=165 $ MeV .	We compare particle spectra , thermal photon spectra and histories of evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced in the central collision of gold ( lead ) nuclei at RHIC ( LHC ) energies , considering ideal hydrodynamical expansion of the system .	The history of evolution shows differences in the evolution of temperature and radial velocity , as one might expect .
3	In order to search for condensation on either side of the resonance we introduce a technique that pairwise projects fermionic atoms onto molecules ; this enables us to measure the momentum distribution of fermionic atom pairs .	We have observed condensation of fermionic atom pairs in the BCS-BEC crossover regime .	A trapped gas of fermionic 40K atoms is evaporatively cooled to quantum degeneracy and then a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance is used to control the atom-atom interactions .	The location of this resonance is precisely determined from low-density measurements of molecule dissociation .	The transition to condensation of fermionic atom pairs is mapped out as a function of the initial atom gas temperature T compared to the Fermi temperature TF for magnetic-field detunings on both the BCS and BEC sides of the resonance .
3	We propose that these defects form as a result of the separation of the silicide film from the substrate and its buckling in order to relieve the compressive , biaxial epitaxial stresses .	A new pyramidal structural defect , 5 to 8 micron wide , has been discovered in thin films of epitaxial erbium disilicide formed by annealing thin Er films on Si ( 001 ) substrates at temperatures of 500 to 800C .	Since these defects form even upon annealing in vacuum of TiN-capped films their formation is not due to oxidation .	The pyramidal defects are absent when the erbium disilicide forms on amorphous substrates , which suggests that epitaxial strains play an important role in their formation .	Silicon can then diffuse through the silicide or along the interface to fully or partially fill the void between the buckled erbium disilicide film and the substrate .
0	We have carried out dc magnetization ( M ) , heat-capacity ( C ) and dielectric studies down to 2K for the compound GdCrTiO5 , crystallizing in orthorhombic Pbam structure , in which well-known multiferroics RMn2O5 ( R= Rare-earths ) form .	The points of emphasis are : ( i ) The magnetic ordering temperature of Cr appears to be suppressed compared to that in isostructural Nd counterpart , NdCrTiO5 , for which the Neel temperature is about 21 K. This finding on the Gd compound suggests that Nd 4f orbital plays a role on the magnetism of Cr in contrast to a proposal long ago .	( ii ) Dielectric constant does not exhibit any notable feature below about 30 K in the absence of external magnetic field , but a peak appears and gets stronger with the application of external magnetic fields , supporting the existence of magnetodielectric coupling .	( iii ) The dielectric anomalies appear even near 100 K , which can be attributed to short-range magnetic-order .	We also observe a gain in spectral weight below about 150 K in Raman spectra in the frequency range 150 to 400 cm-1 , which could be magnetic in origin supporting short-range magnetic order .
2	These low-density meta-stable phases show large negative pressure transitions compared to diamond which represent a serious obstacle for their synthesis .	We present a theoretical study on the behavior under pressure of the two hypothetical C $ _ { 46 } $ and Li $ _8 $ C $ _ { 46 } $ type-I carbon clathrates in order to bring new informations concerning their synthesis .	Using \textit { ab initio } calculations , we have explored the energetic and structural properties under pressure of these two carbon based cage-like materials .	However , we evidence that a minimum energy barrier can be reached close to 40 GPa , suggesting that the synthesis of the Li-clathrate under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature may be possible .	Electronic band structure with related density of states behavior under pressure as well as the dependence of the active Raman modes with pressure are also examined .
3	A previous CMSSM global fit is then re-weighted by our likelihood map .	Recent CMS data significantly extend the direct search exclusion for supersymmetry .	We examine the impact of such data on global fits of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( CMSSM ) to indirect and cosmological data .	By simulating supersymmetric signal events at the LHC , we construct a likelihood map for the recent CMS data , validating it against the exclusion region calculated by the experiment itself .	The CMS results nibble away at the high fit probability density region , transforming probability distributions for the scalar and gluino masses .
2	The frequency , damping and stability of the optical spring resonance can be tuned by adjusting the power and detuning of the two optical fields , allowing for a precise measurement of the absorption-induced photo-thermal feedback .	We report on the observation of photo-thermal feed-back in a stable dual-carrier optical spring .	The optical spring is realized in a 7 cm Fabry-Perot cavity comprised of a suspended 0.4 g small end mirror and a heavy input coupler , illuminated by two optical fields .	The magnitude and frequency dependence of the observed photo-thermal effect are consistent with predicted corrections due to transverse thermal diffusion and coating structure .	While the observed photo-thermal feed-back tends to destabilize the optical spring , we also propose a small coating modification that would change the sign of the effect , making a single-carrier stable optical spring possible .
0	We consider the problem of finding $ \lambda\in \mathbb { R } $ and a function $ u : \mathbb { R } ^n\rightarrow\mathbb { R } $ that satisfy the PDE $ $ \max\left\ { \lambda + F ( D^2u ) -f ( x ) , H ( Du ) \right\ } =0 , \quad x\in \mathbb { R } ^n .	$ $ Here $ F $ is elliptic , positively homogeneous and superadditive , $ f $ is convex and superlinear , and $ H $ is typically assumed to be convex .	Examples of this type of PDE arise in the theory of singular ergodic control .	We show that there is a unique $ \lambda^* $ for which the above equation has a solution $ u $ with appropriate growth as $ |x|\rightarrow \infty $ .	Moreover , associated to $ \lambda^* $ is a convex solution $ u^* $ that has bounded second derivatives , provided $ F $ is uniformly elliptic and $ H $ is uniformly convex .
1	Through this paradigm , the customers gain access to shared computing resources located in remote data centers that are hosted by cloud providers ( CP ) .	Cloud computing is being viewed as the technology of today and the future .	This technology allows for provisioning of various resources such as virtual machines ( VM ) , physical machines , processors , memory , network , storage and software as per the needs of customers .	Application providers ( AP ) , who are customers of the CP , deploy applications on the cloud infrastructure and then these applications are used by the end-users .	To meet the fluctuating application workload demands , dynamic provisioning is essential and this article provides a detailed literature survey of dynamic provisioning within cloud systems with focus on application performance .
1	TeV scale heavy neutrinos can also be accommodated to have a sizable mixing with the Standard Model light neutrinos , through which they can be produced and detected at the high energy colliders .	Majorana and pseudo-Dirac heavy neutrinos are introduced into the type-I and inverse seesaw models , respectively , in explaining the naturally small neutrino mass .	In this paper we consider the Next-to-Leading Order QCD corrections to the heavy neutrino production , and study the scale variation in cross-sections as well as the kinematic distributions with different final states at $ 14 $ TeV LHC and also in the context of $ 100 $ TeV hadron collider .	The repertoire of the Majorana neutrino is realized through the characteristic signature of the same-sign dilepton pair , whereas , due to a small lepton number violation , the pseudo-Dirac heavy neutrino can manifest the trileptons associated with missing energy in the final state .	Using the $ \sqrt { s } =8 $ TeV , $ 20.3 $ fb $ ^ { -1 } $ and $ 19.7 $ fb $ ^ { -1 } $ data at the ATLAS and CMS respectively , we obtain prospective scale dependent upper bounds of the light-heavy neutrino mixing angles for the Majorana heavy neutrinos at the $ 14 $ TeV LHC and $ 100 $ TeV collider .
0	Self-potential ( SP ) data are of interest to vadose zone hydrology because of their direct sensitivity to water flow and ionic transport .	There is unfortunately little consensus in the literature about how to best model SP data under partially saturated conditions and different approaches ( often supported by one laboratory data set alone ) have been proposed .	We argue herein that this lack of agreement can largely be traced to electrode effects that have not been properly taken into account .	A series of drainage and imbibition experiments are considered , in which we find that previously proposed approaches to remove electrode effects are unlikely to provide adequate corrections .	Instead , we explicitly model the electrode effects together with classical SP contributions using a flow and transport model .
2	These results are derived in Newtonian gauge , at first and second order in the small momentum q of the long mode and they are valid non-perturbatively in the short-scale \delta .	We derive consistency relations for the late universe ( CDM and \Lambda CDM ) : relations between an n-point function of the density contrast \delta and an ( n+1 ) -point function in the limit in which one of the ( n+1 ) momenta becomes much smaller than the others .	These are based on the observation that a long mode , in single-field models of inflation , reduces to a diffeomorphism since its freezing during inflation all the way until the late universe , even when the long mode is inside the horizon ( but out of the sound horizon ) .	In the non-relativistic limit our results match with ( Kehagias and Riotto '13 ) and ( Peloso and Pietroni '13 ) .	These relations are a consequence of diffeomorphism invariance ; they are not satisfied in the presence of extra degrees of freedom during inflation or violation of the Equivalence Principle ( extra forces ) in the late universe .
3	In this work , we suggest a novel scheduling approach in which each base station , besides allocating the time and frequency according to given constraints , also manages its uplink power budget such that the aggregate interference , `` Noise Rise '' , caused by its subscribers at the neighboring cells is bounded .	Consider the problem of joint uplink scheduling and power allocation .	Being inherent to almost any wireless system , this resource allocation problem has received extensive attention .	Yet , most common techniques either adopt classical power control , in which mobile stations are received with the same Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio , or use centralized schemes , in which base stations coordinate their allocations .	Our suggested scheme is distributed , requiring neither coordination nor message exchange .
0	We develop a framework for a systematic resummation of the transverse momentum distribution of top-quark pairs produced at hadron colliders based on effective field theory .	Compared to Drell-Yan and Higgs production , a novel soft function matrix is required to account for the soft gluon emissions from the final states .	We calculate this soft function at the next-to-leading order , and perform the resummation at the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy .	We compare our results with parton shower programs and with the experimental data at the Tevatron and the LHC .	We also discuss the implications for the top quark charge asymmetry .
4	A common feature of all these pure and mixed entangled states is found , i.e. , they have $ d^2 $ common commuting stabilizers .	Remote information concentration ( RIC ) in $ d $ -level systems ( qudits ) is studied .	It is shown that the quantum information initially distributed in three spatially separated qudits can be remotely and deterministically concentrated to a single qudit via an entangled channel without performing any global operations .	The entangled channel can be different types of genuine multipartite pure entangled states which are inequivalent under local operations and classical communication .	The entangled channel can also be a mixed entangled state , even a bound entangled state which has a similar form to the Smolin state , but has different features from the Smolin state .
3	The estimated total mass of G19.30+0.07 is ~1130 Msun .	We present Very Large Array observations of ammonia ( NH3 ) ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and CCS ( 2_1-1_0 ) emission toward the Infrared Dark Cloud ( IRDC ) G19.30+0.07 at ~22GHz .	The NH3 emission closely follows the 8 micron extinction .	The NH3 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines provide diagnostics of the temperature and density structure within the IRDC , with typical rotation temperatures of ~10 to 20K and NH3 column densities of ~10^15 cm^-2 .	The cloud comprises four compact NH3 clumps of mass ~30 to 160 Msun .
0	The predictions of the inflationary LCDM paradigm match today 's high-precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy extremely well .	The same data put tight limits on other sources of anisotropy .	Cosmic strings are a particularly interesting alternate source to constrain .	Strings are topological defects , remnants of inflationary-era physics that persist after the big bang .	They are formed in a variety of models of inflation , including string theory models such as brane inflation .
2	An application of this formalism to the Rindler metric recovers the well-known Unruh effect .	A canonical particle definition via the diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian for a quantum field theory in specific curved space-times is presented .	Within the provided approach radial ingoing or outgoing Minkowski particles do not exist .	For the situation of a black hole the Hamiltonian splits up into two independent parts accounting for the interior and the exterior domain , respectively .	It turns out that a reasonable particle definition may be accomplished for the outside region only .
0	This paper describes an agent-based model of interacting firms , in which interacting firm agents rationally invest capital and labor in order to maximize payoff .	Both transactions and production are taken into account in this model .	First , the performance of individual firms on a real transaction network was simulated .	The simulation quantitatively reproduced the cumulative probability distribution of revenue , material cost , capital , and labor .	Then , the response of the firms to a given exogenous shock , defined as a sudden change of gross domestic product , is discussed .
2	In the second part of the paper we develop some notions of quantum statistical mechanics in positive characteristic and we show that , in the case of Drinfeld modules of rank one , there is a natural time evolution on the associated noncommutative space , which is closely related to the positive characteristic L-functions introduced by Goss .	In this paper we construct a noncommutative space of `` pointed Drinfeld modules '' that generalizes to the case of function fields the noncommutative spaces of commensurability classes of Q-lattices .	It extends the usual moduli spaces of Drinfeld modules to possibly degenerate level structures .	The points of the usual moduli space of Drinfeld modules define KMS functionals for this time evolution .	We also show that the scaling action on the dual system is induced by a Frobenius action , up to a Wick rotation to imaginary time .
2	Its measured fluence in the 0.2-10 keV band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2 , which corresponds to 1-15 % of the prompt fluence .	We present observations of XRF 050406 , the first burst detected by Swift showing a flare in its X-ray light curve .	During this flare , which peaks at t_peak ~210s after the BAT trigger , a flux variation of ( delta F ) /F~6 in a very short time ( delta t ) /t_peak & lt ; & lt ; 1 was observed .	We present indications of spectral variations during the flare .	We argue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks , which implies that the central engine is still active at 210s , though with a reduced power with respect to the prompt emission .
2	More specifically , we define a qubit encoding scheme that allows the formal protocol to produce more than one entangled qubit pair per coherent state , or equivalently for the realistic protocol , more than one secret key bit .	We study the equivalence between a realistic quantum key distribution protocol using coherent states and homodyne detection and a formal entanglement purification protocol .	Maximally-entangled qubit pairs that one can extract in the formal protocol correspond to secret key bits in the realistic protocol .	The entanglement parameters are estimated using quantum tomography .	We analyze the properties of the encoding scheme and investigate its application to the important case of the attenuation channel .
2	The full equation additionally includes terms generated by a deviation from the paraxial approximation and by a longitudinal electric-field component in the beam .	We consider ( 2+1 ) -dimensional beams , whose transverse size may be comparable to or smaller than the carrier wavelength , on the basis of an extended version of the nonlinear Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation derived from the Maxwell`s equations .	As this equation is very cumbersome , we also study , in parallel to it , its simplified version which keeps the most essential term : the term which accounts for the { \it nonlinear diffraction } .	Solitary-wave stationary solutions to both the full and simplified equations are found , treating the terms which modify the nonlinear Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation as perturbations .	Within the framework of the perturbative approach , a conserved power of the beam is obtained in an explicit form .
4	By contrast , we show that $ \mathrm { Fix } ^T_R ( H ) $ need not be quasiconvex with an explicit family of examples .	Let $ S $ be an oriented surface of finite type , $ \mathcal { MCG } ( S ) $ its mapping class group , and $ \mathcal { T } ( S ) $ its Teichm\ '' uller space with the Teichm\ '' uller metric .	Let $ H \leq \mathcal { MCG } ( S ) $ be a finite subgroup and consider the subset of $ \mathcal { T } ( S ) $ fixed by $ H $ , $ \mathrm { Fix } ( H ) \subset \mathcal { T } ( S ) $ .	For any $ R & gt ; 0 $ , we prove that the set of points whose $ H $ -orbits have diameter bounded by $ R $ , $ \mathrm { Fix } _R^T ( H ) $ , lives in a bounded neighborhood of $ \mathrm { Fix } ( H ) $ .	As an application , we show that the orbit of any point $ X \in \mathcal { T } ( S ) $ under the action of a finite order mapping class has a fixed coarse barycenter .
0	Supersymmetry breaking in string perturbation theory predicts the existence of a new dimension at the TeV scale .	The simplest realization of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model in the context of this mechanism has two important consequences : ( i ) A natural solution to the $ \mu $ -problem ; ( ii ) The absence of quadratic divergences in the cosmological constant , which leads to a dynamical determination of the supersymmetry breaking and electroweak scale .	We present an explicit example in which the whole particle spectrum is given as a function of the top quark mass .	A generic prediction of this mechanism is the existence of Kaluza-Klein excitations for gauge bosons and higgses .	In particular the first excitation of the photon could be accessible to future accelerators and give a clear signal of the proposed mechanism .
4	While one is a intrinsic property of individual atoms , the other takes into account the local electrical surroundings .	We have recently developed the QTPIE ( charge transfer with polarization current equilibration ) fluctuating-charge model , a new model with correct dissociation behavior for nonequilibrium geometries .	The correct asymptotics originally came at the price of representing the solution in terms of charge-transfer variables instead of atomic charges .	However , we have found an exact reformulation of fluctuating-charge models in terms of atomic charges again , which is made possible by the symmetries of classical electrostatics .	We show how this leads to the distinguishing between two types of atomic electronegativities in our model .
4	As a test , we reproduce the exact post-quench steady state of the Neel quench problem obtained previously by means of the Quench Action method .	In integrable many-particle systems , it is widely believed that the stationary state reached at late times after a quantum quench can be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble ( GGE ) constructed from their extensive number of conserved charges .	A crucial issue is then to identify a complete set of these charges , enabling the GGE to provide exact steady state predictions .	Here we solve this long-standing problem for the case of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain by explicitly constructing a GGE which uniquely fixes the macrostate describing the stationary behaviour after a general quantum quench .	A crucial ingredient in our method , which readily generalizes to other integrable models , are recently discovered quasi-local charges .
2	We present , in a self-contained paper , a new way to find this solutions using the physical imposition operator .	When an informationally incomplete set of observables is considered there are several solutions to the quantum state reconstruction problem using von Neumann measurements .	The set of solutions are known as Pauli partners , which are not easy to find even numerically .	We show that every Pauli partner is an attractive fixed point of this operator , which means that we can find complete sets of Pauli partners very efficiently .	As a particular case , we found numerically 24 mutually unbiased bases in dimension N=23 in less than 30 seconds in a standard PC .
0	Two extensions of generalized linear models are considered .	In the first one , response variables depend on multiple linear combinations of covariates .	In the second one , only response variables are observed while the linear covariates are missing .	We derive stochastic Lipschitz continuity results for the loss functions involved in the regression problems and apply them to get bounds on estimation error for Lasso .	Multivariate comparison results on Rademacher complexity are obtained as tools to establish the stochastic Lipschitz continuity results .
4	The latter are very naturally expressed in terms of the $ L $ -matrices appearing in the Lax pair for the Toeplitz lattice equations .	The Toeplitz determinants ( of increasing size ) associated with the symbols $ exp { t ( z+z^ { -1 } ) } $ or $ ( 1- { \xi } { z } ) ^ { \alpha } ( 1- { \xi } { z^ { -1 } } ) ^ { \beta } $ satisfy recursion relations , thus expressing all the Toeplitz determinants as a rational function of the first few determinants .	A. Borodin found these relations using Riemann-Hilbert methods .	The nature of Borodin 's relations pointed towards the Toeplitz lattice and its Virasoro algebra , as developed by the authors .	In this paper , we take the Toeplitz and Virasoro approach for a fairly large class of symbols , leading to a systematic and simple way of generating such recursion relations .
4	We have characterized the evolution of luminous X-ray AGN as the fraction of galaxies with M_R & lt ; M_R^* ( z ) +1 that host AGN with rest-frame , hard X-ray [ 2 -- 10 keV ] luminosities L_X , H & gt ; = 10^43 \ergs .	We have measured the luminous AGN population in a large sample of clusters of galaxies and find evidence for a substantial increase in the cluster AGN population from z~0.05 to z~1.3 .	The present sample now includes 32 clusters of galaxies , including 15 clusters above z=0.4 , which corresponds to a three-fold increase compared to our previous work at high redshift .	At z & lt ; 0.4 we have obtained new observations of AGN candidates in six additional clusters and found no new luminous AGN in cluster members .	Our total sample of 17 low-redshift clusters contains only two luminous AGN , while at high redshifts there are 18 such AGN , or an average of more than one per cluster .
0	The last decades brought an impressive progress in synthesizing and studying properties of nuclides located very far from the beta stability line .	Among the most fundamental properties of such exotic nuclides , usually established first , is the half-life , possible radioactive decay modes , and their relative probabilities .	When approaching limits of nuclear stability , new decay modes set in .	First , beta decays become accompanied by emission of nucleons from highly excited states of daughter nuclei .	Second , when the nucleon separation energy becomes negative , nucleons start to be emitted from the ground state .
0	We introduce combinatorial multivector fields , associate with them multivalued dynamics and study their topological features .	Our combinatorial multivector fields generalize combinatorial vector fields of Forman .	We define isolated invariant sets , Conley index , attractors , repellers and Morse decompositions .	We provide a topological characterization of attractors and repellers and prove Morse inequalities .	The generalization aims at algorithmic analysis of dynamical systems through combinatorialization of flows given by differential equations and through sampling dynamics in physical and numerical experiments .
0	We examine the effective theory of single-field inflation in the limit where the scalar perturbations propagate with a small speed of sound .	In this case the non-linearly realized time-translation symmetry of the Lagrangian implies large interactions , giving rise to primordial non-Gaussianities .	When the non-Gaussianities are measurable , these interactions will become strongly coupled unless new physics appears close to the Hubble scale .	Due to its proximity to the Hubble scale , the new physics is not necessarily decoupled from inflationary observables and can potentially affect the predictions of the model .	To understand the types of corrections that may arise , we construct weakly-coupled completions of the theory and study their observational signatures .
2	It then declined with an e-folding time of ~5.6E4 sec to the pre-flare level in the third observation .	Hard X-ray emissions from a Herbig Be star MWC297 were discovered in three separate observations spanning 5 days in April 1994 with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics ( ASCA ) .	An X-ray flare was found at the beginning of the second observation with a maximum luminosity of 4.9E32 ergs/s , which is five times larger than that of the quiescent phase ( the first observation ) .	The X-ray spectra are explained by absorbed thin-thermal plasma models .	The temperature in the quiescent phase of about 2.7 keV is significantly higher than that of main-sequence OB stars and similar to low mass young stellar objects ( YSOs ) and other Herbig Ae/Be stars observed with ASCA .
0	We show that if one can solve 3SUM on a set of size n in time n^ { 1+\e } then one can list t triangles in a graph with m edges in time O ( m^ { 1+\e } t^ { 1/3-\e/3 } ) .	This is a reversal of Patrascu 's reduction from 3SUM to listing triangles ( STOC '10 ) .	Our result builds on and extends works by the Paghs ( PODS '06 ) and by Vassilevska and Williams ( FOCS '10 ) .	We make our reductions deterministic using tools from pseudorandomness .	We then re-execute both Patrascu 's reduction and our reversal for the variant 3XOR of 3SUM where integer summation is replaced by bit-wise xor .
4	We also get good agreement with data from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments .	We consider hot carrier inelastic scattering due to electron -- electron interactions in graphene , as functions of carrier energy and density .	We calculate the imaginary part of the zero-temperature quasiparticle self-energy for doped graphene , utlizing the $ G_0W $ and random phases approximations .	Using the full dynamically screened Coulomb interaction , we obtain the inelastic quasiparticle lifetimes and associated mean free paths .	The linear dispersion of graphene gives lifetime energy dependences that are qualitatively different from those of parabolic-band semiconductors .
3	Simulations are performed using a hybrid dynamical Monte Carlo protocol that allows self-assembling clusters to rearrange internally while still providing Stokes-Einstein-like diffusion of aggregates of different sizes .	Both biological and artificial self-assembly processes can take place by a range of different schemes , from the successive addition of identical building blocks , to hierarchical sequences of intermediates , all the way to the fully addressable limit in which each component is unique .	In this paper we introduce an idealized model of cubic particles with patterned faces that allows self-assembly strategies to be compared and tested .	We consider a simple octameric target , starting with the minimal requirements for successful self-assembly and comparing the benefits and limitations of more sophisticated hierarchical and addressable schemes .	Our simulations explicitly capture the thermodynamic , dynamic and steric challenges typically faced by self-assembly processes , including competition between multiple partially-completed structures .
4	Let three positive operators be given , does the fact that the third Reidemeister movement between them is possible implie that they commute pairwise ?	In quantum information theory , for $ a , b $ two positive operators living in $ B ( \mathcal { H } ) $ , where $ \mathcal { H } $ is a separable Hilbert space , the quantum fidelity is denoted by $ a*b = ( b^ { 1/2 } ab^ { 1/2 } ) ^ { 1/2 } $ .	One of the aim of this let ter is to interpret the quantum fidelity as an algebraic law .	We remark that if $ a , b , c $ are three positive operators whi ch commute pairwise , the law * becomes self-distributive , i.e.the third Reidemeister movement in knot theory is verif ied .	We study the converse .
0	Modeling dynamical systems , both for control purposes and to make predictions about their behavior , is ubiquitous in science and engineering .	Predictive state representations ( PSRs ) are a recently introduced class of models for discrete-time dynamical systems .	The key idea behind PSRs and the closely related OOMs ( Jaeger 's observable operator models ) is to represent the state of the system as a set of predictions of observable outcomes of experiments one can do in the system .	This makes PSRs rather different from history-based models such as nth-order Markov models and hidden-state-based models such as HMMs and POMDPs .	We introduce an interesting construct , the systemdynamics matrix , and show how PSRs can be derived simply from it .
0	The formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parental clouds .	We here focus on the high-density parts of W43 , a molecular cloud undergoing an efficient event of formation .	The cloud structure is studied with a column density image derived from Herschel continuum maps obtained at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500 micron .	We identify two high-column density filamentary clouds , quoted as the W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges , which both account for 1.5x10^4 Msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2 , respectively .	We used the N_2H^+ 1 -- 0 line to confirm that the W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound , despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths .
0	Competitive limits on the weakly interacting massive particle ( WIMP ) spin-independent scattering cross section are currently being produced by 76Ge detectors originally designed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay , such as the Heidelberg-Moscow and IGEX experiments .	In the absence of background subtraction , limits on the WIMP interaction cross section are set by calculating the upper confidence limit on the theoretical event rate , given the observed event rate .	The standard analysis technique involves calculating the 90 % upper confidence limit on the number of events in each bin , and excluding any set of parameters ( WIMP mass and cross-section ) which produces a theoretical event rate for any bin which exceeds the 90 % upper confidence limit on the event rate for that bin .	We show that , if there is more than one energy bin , this produces exclusion limits that are actually at a lower degree of confidence than 90 % , and are hence erroneously tight .	We formulate criteria which produce true 90 % confidence exclusion limits in these circumstances , including calculating the individual bin confidence limit for which the overall probability that no bins exceeds this confidence limit is 90 % and calculating the 90 % minimum confidence limit on the number of bins which exceed their individual bin 90 % confidence limits .
3	This , added to a relatively young age of $ \sim700 $ Myr measured from the absorption lines , provides the first direct evidence for a distant galaxy being caught in the act of rapidly shutting down its star formation .	We present Keck-I MOSFIRE spectroscopy in the Y and H bands of GDN-8231 , a massive , compact , star-forming galaxy ( SFG ) at a redshift $ z\sim1.7 $ .	Its spectrum reveals both H $ _ { \alpha } $ and [ NII ] emission lines and strong Balmer absorption lines .	The H $ _ { \alpha } $ and Spitzer MIPS 24 $ \mu $ m fluxes are both weak , thus indicating a low star formation rate of SFR $ \lesssim5-10 $ M $ _ { \odot } $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ .	Such quenching allows GDN-8231 to become a compact , quiescent galaxy , similar to 3 other galaxies in our sample , by $ z\sim1.5 $ .
0	One of the fundamental characteristics of a nonlinear system is how it transfers correlations in its inputs to correlations in its outputs .	This is particularly important in the nervous system , where correlations between spiking neurons are prominent .	Using linear response and asymptotic methods for pairs of unconnected integrate-and-fire ( IF ) neurons receiving white noise inputs , we show that this correlation transfer depends on the output spike firing rate in a strong , stereotyped manner , and is , surprisingly , almost independent of the interspike variance .	For cells receiving heterogeneous inputs , we further show that correlation increases with the geometric mean spiking rate in the same stereotyped manner , greatly extending the generality of this relationship .	We present an immediate consequence of this relationship for population coding via tuning curves .
4	Moreover , we emphasize throughout the paper the major difficulties and differences due to the 2BSDE framework .	In a recent paper , Soner , Touzi and Zhang [ 20 ] have introduced a notion of second order backward stochastic differential equations ( 2BSDEs for short ) , which are naturally linked to a class of fully non-linear PDEs .	They proved existence and uniqueness for a generator which is uniformly Lipschitz in the variables $ y $ and $ z $ .	The aim of this paper is to extend these results to the case of a generator satisfying a monotonicity condition in $ y $ .	More precisely , we prove existence and uniqueness for 2BSDEs with a generator which is Lipschitz in $ z $ and uniformly continuous with linear growth in $ y $ .
0	We investigate the dynamics and evolution of coalescing neutron stars .	The three-dimensional Newtonian equations of hydrodynamics are integrated by the `Piecewise Parabolic Method ' However , we do include the effects of the emission of gravitational waves on the hydrodynamics .	The properties of neutron star matter are described by the equation of state of Lattimer & amp ; Swesty .	In addition to the fundamental hydrodynamic quantities , density , momentum , and energy , we follow the time evolution of the electron density in the stellar gas .	Energy losses and changes of the electron abundance due to the emission of neutrinos are taken into account by an elaborate `` neutrino leakage scheme '' , which employs a careful calculation of the lepton number and energy source terms of all neutrino types .
1	The search is performed by looking for an excess of high energy muon neutrinos from WIMP annihilations in the Sun , the core of the Earth , and the Galactic Center , as compared to the number expected from the atmospheric neutrino background .	We present the results of indirect searches for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ( WIMPs ) with 1679.6 live days of data from the Super-Kamiokande detector using neutrino-induced upward through-going muons .	No statistically significant excess was seen .	We calculate flux limits in various angular cones around each of the above celestial objects .	We obtain conservative model-independent upper limits on WIMP-nucleon cross-section as a function of WIMP mass and compare these results with the corresponding results from direct dark matter detection experiments .
0	We study the existence of automatic presentations for various algebraic structures .	An automatic presentation of a structure is a description of the universe of the structure by a regular set of words , and the interpretation of the relations by synchronised automata .	Our first topic concerns characterising classes of automatic structures .	We supply a characterisation of the automatic Boolean algebras , and it is proven that the free Abelian group of infinite rank , as well as certain Fraisse limits , do not have automatic presentations .	In particular , the countably infinite random graph and the random partial order do not have automatic presentations .
2	The formation mechanism of the cavities is still unclear .	( Abridged ) Planet formation is closely related to the structure and dispersal of protoplanetary disks .	A certain class of disks , called transition disks , exhibit cavities in dust images at scales of up to a few 10s of AU .	The gas content of such cavities can be spatially resolved for the first time using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) .	We have developed a new series of models to simulate the physical conditions and chemical abundances of the gas in cavities to address the question whether the gas is primarily atomic or molecular inside the dust free cavities exposed to intense UV radiation .
4	The enhanced $ \alpha- $ element abundances are also consistent with rapid chemical enrichment , most likely by type II SNe .	Using the NIRSPEC spectrograph at Keck II , we have obtained infrared echelle spectra covering the range $ 1.5-1.8 \mu \rm m $ for the highly reddened bulge globular clusters Terzan 4 and Terzan 5 .	The clusters are of interest because a blue horizontal branch in Terzan 4 is consistent with very low metallicity , while Terzan 5 has been proposed as possibly the most metal rich known Galactic globular cluster .	We report the first detailed abundance analysis for stars in these clusters , and we find [ Fe/H ] = -- 1.60 and -- 0.21 dex for Terzan 4 and Terzan 5 , respectively , confirming the presence of a large metallicity spread in the bulge as well as in the halo of the Galaxy .	We find $ \rm [ \alpha/Fe ] \approx+0.5 $ dex in Terzan 4 and $ \rm [ \alpha/Fe ] \approx +0.3 $ dex in Terzan 5 , consistent with what has been found for field stars in the bulge .
2	The fourth stream is much broader , roughly 45 kpc distant , at least 53 degrees in length , and is most likely the tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy .	We report on the detection of four new stellar debris streams and a new dwarf galaxy candidate in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .	Three of the streams , ranging between 3 and 15 kpc in distance and spanning between 37 and 84 degrees on the sky , are very narrow and are most probably tidal streams originating in extant or disrupted globular clusters .	As the streams each span multiple constellations , we extend tradition and designate them the Acheron , Cocytos , Lethe , and Styx streams .	At the same distance and apparently embedded in the Styx stream is a ~1 kpc-wide concentration of stars with a similar color-magnitude distribution which we designate Bootes III .
1	The experiments cover the field range $ 8 \alt h \equiv H/ H_ { F } \alt 80 $ ( $ H_F = $ is the Fr\'eedericksz field ) .	We report experimental results for convection near onset in a thin layer of a homeotropically aligned nematic liquid crystal heated from below as a function of the temperature difference $ \Delta T $ and the applied vertical magnetic field $ H $ and compare them with theoretical calculations .	For $ h $ less than a codimension-two field $ h_ { ct } \simeq 46 $ the bifurcation is subcritical and oscillatory , with travelling- and standing-wave transients .	Beyond $ h_ { ct } $ the bifurcation is stationary and subcritical until a tricritical field $ h_t= 57.2 $ is reached , beyond which it is supercritical .	The bifurcation sequence as a function of $ h $ found in the experiment confirms the qualitative aspects of the theoretical predictions .
4	As theorists we use and play with this free choice of factorization , which is naturally fixed for an experimentalist .	We discuss the concept of how entanglement changes with respect to different factorizations of the total algebra which describes the quantum states .	Depending on the considered factorization a quantum state appears either entangled or separable .	For pure states we always can switch unitarily between separability and entanglement , however , for mixed states a minimal amount of mixedness is needed .	We discuss our general statements in detail for the familiar case of qubits , the GHZ states , Werner states and Gisin states , emphasizing their geometric features .
4	This work was initiated in the context of the ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2010 , a competition organized jointly by the French Operational Research and Decision Support Society , the European Operational Research Society , and the European utility company Electricite de France .	This paper introduces a three-phase heuristic approach for a large-scale energy management and maintenance scheduling problem .	The problem is concerned with scheduling maintenance and refueling for nuclear power plants up to five years into the future , while handling a number of scenarios for future demand and prices .	The goal is to minimize the expected total production costs .	The first phase of the heuristic solves a simplified constraint programming model of the problem , the second performs a local search , and the third handles overproduction in a greedy fashion .
1	Specifically , the inducibility of a graph H is its extremal density , as an induced subgraph of G , where |G| - & gt ; infinity .	There is much recent interest in understanding the density at which constant size graphs can appear in a very large graph .	Already for 4-vertex graphs many questions are still open .	Thus , the inducibility of the 4-path was addressed in a construction of Exoo ( 1986 ) , but remains unknown .	Refuting a conjecture of Erdos , Thomason ( 1997 ) constructed graphs with a small density of both 4-cliques and 4-anticliques .
0	Once the energy spectrum of the secondary component is well understood , measurements of the antiproton cosmic-ray flux at the Earth will be a powerful way to indirectly probe for the existence of supersymmetric relics in the galactic halo .	Unfortunately , it is still spoilt by considerable theoretical uncertainties .	As shown in this work , searches for low-energy antideuterons appear in the mean time as a plausible alternative , worth being explored .	Above a few GeV/n , a dozen spallation antideuterons should be collected by the future AMS experiment on board ISSA .	For energies less than about 3 GeV/n , the antideuteron spallation component becomes negligible and may be supplanted by a potential supersymmetric signal .
4	Our result is consistent with a recent dynamical mean field calculation based on the $ d $ -- $ p $ model and in contrast to the result from a $ d $ -band only model .	Using quasiparticle self-consistent $ GW $ calculations we examined the electronic structure of LaNiO $ _3 $ and the LaNiO $ _3 $ /LaAlO $ _3 $ superlattice .	The effects of electron correlation in Ni- $ d $ bands were reasonably well described without any { \it ad hoc } parameter and without the ambiguity related to the double-counting and downfolding issues .	The effective mass is about $ 30\ % $ enhanced compared to the GGA result .	One band feature , which is believed to be essential for the cuprate-like superconductivity , is not realized and the central Fermi surface pocket does not disappear .
2	Our errors on system parameters like a/R_ { * } and \rho_ { * } have improved by ~40 % compared to previous best ground-based measurements .	The Apache Point Survey of Transit Lightcurves of Exoplanets ( APOSTLE ) observed 10 transits of XO-2b over a period of three years .	We present measurements which confirm previous estimates of system parameters like the normalized semi-major axis ( a/R_ { * } ) , stellar density ( \rho_ { * } ) , impact parameter ( b ) and orbital inclination ( i_ { orb } ) .	Our study of the transit times show no evidence for transit timing variations and we are able to rule out co-planar companions with masses \ge 0.20 \mearth\ in low order mean motion resonance with XO-2b .	We also explored the stability of the XO-2 system given various orbital configurations of a hypothetical planet near the 2:1 mean motion resonance .
4	Using the existing experimental data on the interplanetary positron flux , a new constraint on the axion-electron coupling constant for axions with masses in the $ ( 1.2-5.4 ) $ MeV range was obtained : $ g_ { Ae } \leq ( 1-5 ) \times 10^ { -17 } $ .	A search for the axioelectric absorption of 5.5-MeV solar axions produced in the $ p+d\rightarrow \rm { ^3He } +\gamma ( 5.5 \rm { MeV } ) $ reaction was performed with two BGO detectors placed inside a low-background setup .	A model independent limit on axion-photon and axion-nucleon couplings was obtained : $ |g_ { Ae } \times g_ { AN } | \leq 3.2\times 10^ { -9 } ( m_A=0 ) $ .	Constraints on the axion-electron coupling constant were obtained for axions with masses in the $ ( 0.1-1.0 ) $ MeV range : $ g_ { Ae } \leq ( 1.8-9.0 ) \times 10^ { -7 } $ .	The solar positron flux from $ A\rightarrow e^-+e^+ $ decay was determined for axions with masses $ m_A & gt ; 2m_e $ .
2	The $ K $ -exchange potential is also considered in the $ \Lambda^ { \ast } $ and $ N $ interaction .	The $ \Lambda^ { \ast } $ -hypernuclei , which are bound states of $ \Lambda ( 1405 ) $ and nuclei , are discussed as a possible interpretation of the $ \bar { K } $ -nuclei .	The Bonn and Nijmegen potentials are extended and used as a phenomenological potential between $ \Lambda^ { \ast } $ and $ N $ .	The two-body ( $ \Lambda^ { \ast } N $ ) and three-body ( $ \Lambda^ { \ast } NN $ ) systems are solved by a variational method .	It is shown that the spin and isospin of the ground states are assigned as $ \Lambda^ { \ast } N ( S=1 , I=1/2 ) $ and $ \Lambda^ { \ast } NN ( S=3/2 , I=0 ) $ , respectively .
0	Bibliometric analysis has firmly conquered its place as an instrument for evaluation and international comparison of performance levels .	Consequently , differences in coverage by standard bibliometric databases installed a dichotomy between on the one hand the well covered 'exact ' sciences , and on the other hand most of the social sciences and humanities with a more limited coverage ( Nederhof , 2006 ) .	Also the latter domains need to be able to soundly demonstrate their level of performance and claim or legitimate funding accordingly .	An important part of the output volume in social sciences appears as books , book chapters and national literature ( Hicks , 2004 ) .	To proceed from publication data to performance measurement , quantitative publication counts need to be combined with qualitative information , for example from peer assessment or validation ( European Expert Group on Assessment of University-Based Research , 2010 ) , to identify those categories that represent research quality as perceived by peers .
0	We continue the study of mild transient reductions in the speed of sound of the adiabatic mode during inflation , of their effect on the primordial power spectrum and bispectrum , and of their detectability in the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) .	We focus on the regime of \emph { moderately sharp } mild reductions in the speed of sound during uninterrupted slow-roll inflation , a theoretically well motivated and self-consistent regime that admits an effective single-field description .	The signatures on the power spectrum and bispectrum were previously computed using a slow-roll Fourier transform ( SRFT ) approximation , and here we compare it with generalized slow-roll ( GSR ) and in-in methods , for which we derive new formulas that account for moderately sharp features .	The agreement between them is excellent , and also with the power spectrum obtained from the numerical solution to the equation of motion .	We show that , in this regime , the SRFT approximation correctly captures with simplicity the effect of higher derivatives of the speed of sound in the mode equation , and makes manifest the correlations between power spectrum and bispectrum features .
0	We consider the advection-diffusion equation \ [ \phi_t + Au \cdot \nabla \phi = \Delta \phi , \qquad \phi ( 0 , x ) =\phi_0 ( x ) \ ] on $ \bbR^2 $ , with $ u $ a periodic incompressible flow and $ A\gg 1 $ its amplitude .	We provide a sharp characterization of all $ u $ that optimally enhance dissipation in the sense that for any initial datum $ \phi_0\in L^p ( \bbR^2 ) $ , $ p & lt ; \infty $ , and any $ \tau & gt ; 0 $ , \ [ \|\phi ( \cdot , \tau ) \|_ { L^\infty ( \bbR^2 ) } \to 0 \qquad \text { as $ A\to\infty $ . }	\ ] Our characterization is expressed in terms of simple geometric and spectral conditions on the flow .	Moreover , if the above convergence holds , it is uniform for $ \phi_0 $ in the unit ball of $ L^p ( \mathbb { R } ^2 ) $ , $ p & lt ; \infty $ , and $ \|\cdot\|_\infty $ can be replaced by any $ \|\cdot\|_q $ , $ q & gt ; p $ .	Extensions to higher dimensions and applications to reaction-advection-diffusion equations are also considered .
0	Accretion models predict that fluorescence lines broadened by relativistic effects should arise from reflection of X-ray emission onto the inner region of the accretion disc surrounding the central black hole of active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) .	The theory behind the origin of relativistic lines is well established , and observational evidence from a moderate number of sources seems to support the existence of these lines .	The aim of this work is to establish the fraction of AGN with relativistic Fe Kalpha lines , and study possible correlations with source physical properties .	An XMM-Newton collection of 149 radio-quiet Type 1 AGN has been systematically and uniformly analyzed in order to search for significant evidence of a relativistically broadened Fe Kalpha line .	To enable statistical studies , an almost complete , flux-limited subsample of 31 sources has been defined .
2	The Cabibbo-suppressed decay B0 - & gt ; D*- K+ pi- pi+ is observed for the first time and the measured ratio of branching fractions is B ( B0 - & gt ; D*- K+ pi- pi+ ) / B ( B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ pi- pi+ ) = ( 6.47 \pm 0.37 ( stat . )	Using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at sqrt ( s ) = 7 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb^ { -1 } , the ratio of branching fractions of the B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ pi- pi+ decay relative to the B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ decay is measured to be B ( B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ pi- pi+ ) / B ( B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ ) = 2.64 \pm 0.04 ( stat . )	\pm 0.13 ( syst . ) .	\pm 0.35 ( syst . ) ) x 10^ { -2 } .	A search for orbital excitations of charm mesons contributing to the B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ pi- pi+ final state is also performed , and the first observation of the B0 - & gt ; Dbar_ { 1 } ( 2420 ) ^0 pi+ pi- decay is reported with the ratio of branching fractions B ( B0 - & gt ; ( Dbar_ { 1 } ( 2420 ) ^0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ ) pi- pi+ ) / B ( B0 - & gt ; D*- pi+ pi- pi+ ) = ( 2.04 \pm 0.42 ( stat . )
0	Differential rotation can be detected in single line profiles of stars rotating more rapidly than about $ v \sin { i } = 10 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ with the Fourier transform technique .	This allows to search for differential rotation in large samples to look for correlations between differential rotation and other stellar parameters .	I analyze the fraction of differentially rotating stars as a function of color , rotation , and activity in a large sample of F-type stars .	Color and rotation exhibit a correlation with differential rotation in the sense that more stars are rotating differentially in the cooler , less rapidly rotating stars .	Effects of rotation and color , however , can not be disentangled in the underlying sample .
3	We find that the denser cloud , with the lower mean thermal Jeans mass , produces a higher proportion of brown dwarfs and has a lower characteristic ( median ) mass of the stars and brown dwarfs .	We investigate the dependence of stellar properties on the mean thermal Jeans mass in molecular clouds .	We compare the results from the two largest hydrodynamical simulations of star formation to resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit , the first of which was reported by Bate , Bonnell & amp ; Bromm .	The initial conditions of the two calculations are identical except for the radii of the clouds , which are chosen so that the mean densities and mean thermal Jeans masses of the clouds differ by factors of nine and three , respectively .	This dependence of the initial mass function ( IMF ) on the density of the cloud may explain the observation that the Taurus star-forming region appears to be deficient in brown dwarfs when compared with the Orion Trapezium cluster .
3	Lamoreaux , Phys.Rev.Lett .	We show that the claims expressed in the Comment arXiv:0810.3244v1 by R.S .	Decca et al against our paper , D.A.R .	Dalvit and S.K .	{ \bf 101 } , 163203 ( 2008 ) , are wrong and manifestly inconsistent with basic principles of statistical physics .
4	We show that fluctuation-dissipation relations exist for such effectively open systems , and use them to show that such a stochastic term , which explicitly introduces quantum fluctuations on the lower order correlation functions , necessarily accompanies the dissipative term , thus leading to a Boltzmann-Langevin equation which depicts both the dissipative and stochastic dynamics of correlation functions in quantum field theory .	The aim of this paper is two-fold : in probing the statistical mechanical properties of interacting quantum fields , and in providing a field theoretical justification for a stochastic source term in the Boltzmann equation .	We start with the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of the Schwinger - Dyson equations for the correlation functions , which we describe by a closed-time-path master ( $ n = \infty PI $ ) effective action .	When the hierarchy is truncated , one obtains the ordinary closed-system of correlation functions up to a certain order , and from the nPI effective action , a set of time-reversal invariant equations of motion .	But when the effect of the higher order correlation functions is included ( through e.g. , causal factorization -- molecular chaos -- conditions , which we call 'slaving ' ) , in the form of a correlation noise , the dynamics of the lower order correlations shows dissipative features , as familiar in the field-theory version of Boltzmann equation .
3	The algorithmimprovesthe estimation of centroids of the generative distribution during the process of clustering and outlier discovery .	The outlier detection problem in some cases is similar to the classification problem .	For example , the main concern of clustering-based outlier detection algorithms is to find clusters and outliers , which are often regarded as noise that should be removed in order to make more reliable clustering .	In this article , we present an algorithm that provides outlier detection and data clustering simultaneously .	The proposed algorithm consists of two stages .
1	Middlebox functionalities are usually deployed on expensive and proprietary hardware that require trained personnel for deployment and maintenance .	Middleboxes or network appliances like firewalls , proxies and WAN optimizers have become an integral part of today 's ISP and enterprise networks .	Middleboxes contribute significantly to a network 's capital and operational costs .	In addition , organizations often require their traffic to pass through a specific sequence of middleboxes for compliance with security and performance policies .	This makes the middlebox deployment and maintenance tasks even more complicated .
1	These energies are obtained by decoupling the exponents in the numerator and denominator of the integrand in the original definition of the tangent-point energies .	In this article we introduce and investigate a new two-parameter family of knot energies $ TP^ { ( p , q ) } $ that contains the tangent-point energies .	We will first characterize the curves of finite energy in the sub-critical range $ p\in ( q+2,2q+1 ) $ and see that those are all injective and regular curves in the Sobolev-Slobodecki\u { i } space $ W^ { ( p-1 ) /q , q } $ .	We derive a formula for the first variation that turns out to be a non-degenerate elliptic operator for the special case $ q=2 $ -- - a fact that seems not to be the case for the original tangent-point energies .	This observation allows us to prove that stationary points of $ TP^ { ( p,2 ) } $ + \lambda length , $ p\in ( 4,5 ) $ , \lambda & gt ; 0 , are smooth -- - so especially all local minimizers are smooth .
3	Thus energy can transported from the naked singularity to either a local or a distant observer .	A distinguishable and observable physical property of Naked Singular Regions of the spacetime formed during a gravitational collapse has important implications for both experimental and theoretical relativity .	We examine here whether energy can escape physically from naked singular regions to reach either a local or a distant observer within the framework of general relativity .	We find that in case of imploding null dust collapse scenarios field outgoing singular null geodesics including the cauchy horizon can be immersed between two Vaidya spacetimes as null boundary layers with non vanishing positive energy density .	And example illustrating that similar considerations can be applied to dust models is given .
4	Furthermore , of these techniques , only EBSD and off-axis Raman spectroscopy allow measurement of all six components of the stress tensor , but neither is able to provide full 3D maps .	Stress and strain are important factors in determining the mechanical , electronic , and optical properties of materials , relating to each other by the material 's elasticity or stiffness .	Both are represented by second rank field tensors with , in general , six independent components .	Measurements of these quantities are usually achieved by measuring a property that depends on the translational symmetry and periodicity of the crystal lattice , such as optical phonon energies using Raman spectroscopy , the electronic band gap using cathodoluminescence , photoelasticity via the optical birefringence , or Electron Back Scattering Diffraction ( EBSD ) .	A reciprocal relationship therefore exists between the maximum sensitivity of the measurements and the spatial resolution .
1	However some models are opaque to probabilistic interpretation , and MF-based methods , typically solved using Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) , may incur loss of corpus information .	Most existing word embedding methods can be categorized into Neural Embedding Models and Matrix Factorization ( MF ) -based methods .	In addition , it is desirable to incorporate global latent factors , such as topics , sentiments or writing styles , into the word embedding model .	Since generative models provide a principled way to incorporate latent factors , we propose a generative word embedding model , which is easy to interpret , and can serve as a basis of more sophisticated latent factor models .	The model inference reduces to a low rank weighted positive semidefinite approximation problem .
1	In general , proving termination needs acyclicity , unless program-specific or non-automated reasoning is performed .	In heap-based languages , knowing that a variable x points to an acyclic data structure is useful for analyzing termination : this information guarantees that the depth of the data structure to which x points is greater than the depth of the structure pointed to by x.fld , and allows bounding the number of iterations of a loop which traverses the data structure on fld .	However , recent work could prove that certain loops terminate even without inferring acyclicity , because they traverse data structures `` acyclically '' .	Consider a double-linked list : if it is possible to demonstrate that every cycle involves both the `` next '' and the `` prev '' field , then a traversal on `` next '' terminates since no cycle will be traversed completely .	This paper develops a static analysis inferring field-sensitive reachability and cyclicity information , which is more general than existing approaches .
4	Inspired by these abstract mathematic researches , the Hamilton dynamic system is studied by geometrical field theory of deformation .	When a set of particles are moving in a potential field , two aspects are concerned : 1 ) the relative motion of particle in spatial domain ; 2 ) the particle velocity variations in time domain .	The difficulty on treating the systems is originated from the fact that the motion in time domain and the motion in spatial domain are coupled together completely .	Generally , for a Hamilton dynamic system established by a set of general velocity functions , several abstract theories have been well established , such as Lie algebra , Symplectic manifold , Poisson brackets , and others .	However , mathematically , to find out a general Hamilton function is very difficult even for very simple problems .
2	In this paper we present a more empirical approach to this issue .	In systems undergoing starbursts the evolution of the young stellar population is expected to drive changes in the emission line properties .	This evolution is usually studied theoretically , with a combination of evolutionary synthesis models for the spectral energy distribution of starbursts and photoionization calculations .	We apply empirical population synthesis techniques to samples of Starburst and HII galaxies in order to measure their evolutionary state and correlate the results with their emission line properties .	A couple of useful tools are introduced which greatly facilitate the interpretation of the synthesis : ( 1 ) an evolutionary diagram , whose axis are the strengths of the young , intermediate age and old components of the stellar population mix , and ( 2 ) the mean age of stars associated with the starburst , $ \ov { t } _ { SB } $ .
0	The recently developed evolutionary algorithm USPEX proved to be a tool that enables accurate and reliable prediction of structures for a given chemical composition .	Here we extend this method to predict the crystal structure of polymers by performing constrained evolutionary search , where each monomeric unit is treated as one or several building blocks with fixed connectivity .	This greatly reduces the search space and allows the initial structure generation with different sequences and packings using these blocks .	The new constrained evolutionary algorithm is successfully tested and validated on a diverse range of experimentally known polymers , namely polyethylene ( PE ) , polyacetylene ( PA ) , poly ( glycolic acid ) ( PGA ) , poly ( vinyl chloride ) ( PVC ) , poly ( oxymethylene ) ( POM ) , poly ( phenylene oxide ) ( PPO ) , and poly ( p-phenylene sulfide ) ( PPS ) .	By fixing the orientation of polymeric chains , this method can be further extended to predict all polymorphs of poly ( vinylidene fluoride ) ( PVDF ) , and the complex linear polymer crystals , such as nylon-6 and cellulose .
4	First , the regularized one-loop quantum master equation is used to compute the complete one-loop anomaly .	The nonlocal regularization method , recently proposed in ref.\ , \ct { emkw91 , kw92 , kw93 } , is extended to general gauge theories by reformulating it along the ideas of the antibracket-antifield formalism .	From the interplay of both frameworks a fully regularized version of the field-antifield ( FA ) formalism arises , being able to deal with higher order loop corrections and to describe higher order loop contributions to the BRST anomaly .	The quantum master equation , considered in the FA framework as the quantity parametrizing BRST anomalies , is argued to be incomplete at two and higher order loops and conjectured to reproduce only the one-loop corrections to the $ \hbar^p $ anomaly generated by the addition of $ O ( \hbar^ { k } ) $ , $ k & lt ; p $ , counterterms .	Chiral $ W_3 $ gravity is used to exemplify the nonlocally regularized FA formalism .
1	Since the dielectric anisotropy of a nematic is small , it takes relatively large fields to elicit a significant liquid crystal response .	Molecules of a nematic liquid crystal respond to an applied magnetic field by reorienting themselves in the direction of the field .	The interaction may be enhanced in colloidal suspensions of ferromagnetic particles in a liquid crystalline matrix -- -ferronematics -- - as proposed by Brochard and de Gennes in 1970 .	The ability of these particles to align with the field and , simultaneously , cause reorientation of the nematic molecules , greatly increases the magnetic response of the mixture .	Essentially the particles provide an easy axis of magnetization that interacts with the liquid crystal via surface anchoring .
1	It is known that this problem can be formulated as an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold .	Joint approximate diagonalization of non-commuting symmetric matrices is an important process in independent component analysis .	Riemannian optimization techniques can be used to solve this optimization problem .	Among the available techniques , this article provides Riemannian Newton 's method for the joint diagonalization problem , which has the quadratic convergence property .	In particular , it is shown that the resultant Newton 's equation can be effectively solved by means of the Kronecker product and vec operator , which reduces the dimension of the equation .
3	It is shown to parametrize all tropical linear spaces .	In tropical algebraic geometry , the solution sets of polynomial equations are piecewise-linear .	We introduce the tropical variety of a polynomial ideal , and we identify it with a polyhedral subcomplex of the Grobner fan .	The tropical Grassmannian arises in this manner from the ideal of quadratic Plucker relations .	Lines in tropical projective space are trees , and their tropical Grassmannian G_ { 2 , n } equals the space of phylogenetic trees studied by Billera , Holmes and Vogtmann .
4	We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of the transmitted image .	When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is rotated .	Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the transmitted image ( Padgett et al.2006 ) .	We examine these two phenomena by extending an analysis of Player ( 1976 ) to general electromagnetic fields .	We find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular momentum of the light .
1	This set of data with 45 '' resolution comprises the highest spatial dynamic range image of an individual molecular cloud constructed to date , and provides valuable insights to the molecular gas distribution , kinematics , and the star formation process .	The FCRAO Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud observed the 12CO and 13CO J=1-0 emission from 98 square degrees of this important , nearby star forming region .	In this contribution , we describe the observations , calibration , data processing , and characteristics of the noise and line emission of the survey .	The angular distribution of 12CO and 13CO emission over 1 km/s velocity intervals and the full velocity extent of the cloud are presented .	These reveal a complex , dynamic medium of cold , molecular gas .
2	A generic deformation can be obtained by making the Calabi-Yau non-commutative .	Placing a set of branes at a Calabi-Yau singularity leads to an N=1 quiver gauge theory .	We analyze F-term deformations of such gauge theories .	We discuss non-commutative generalisations of well-known singularities such as the Del Pezzo singularities and the conifold .	We also introduce new techniques for deriving superpotentials , based on quivers with ghosts and a notion of generalised Seiberg duality .
3	Meanwhile , the priority of resources allocation is given to the real-time applications .	In this paper , we conduct a study to optimize resource allocation for adaptive real-time and delay-tolerant applications in cellular systems .	To represent the user applications via several devices and equipment , sigmoidal-like and logarithm utility functions are used .	A fairness proportional utility functions policy approach is used to allocate the resources among the user equipment ( UE ) s in a utility percentage form and to ensure a minimum level of customer satisfaction for all the subscribers .	We measure the effect of the stochastic variations of the adaptive real-time applications on the optimal rate allocation process and compare the results of deterministic and stochastic systems .
4	It is therefore interesting to explore whether both metal-rich and metal-poor clusters could form by a common mechanism and still be consistent with the bimodal distribution .	Observed metallicities of globular clusters reflect physical conditions in the interstellar medium of their high-redshift host galaxies .	Globular cluster systems in most large galaxies display bimodal color and metallicity distributions , which are often interpreted as indicating two distinct modes of cluster formation .	The metal-rich and metal-poor clusters have systematically different locations and kinematics in their host galaxies .	However , the red and blue clusters have similar internal properties , such as the masses , sizes , and ages .
4	The main problem I want to discuss in this `` short course '' is how to actually do this explicitly , with some emphasis on obtaining representations of the elements of the Selmer group as explicit covering spaces of E. These explicit representations are useful in two respects - they allow a search for rational points ( if successful , this proves that the element is in the image of the left hand map above ) , and they provide the starting point for performing `` higher '' descents ( e.g. , extending a p-descent computation to a p^2-descent computation ) .	Let E be an elliptic curve over Q ( or , more generally , a number field ) .	Then on the one hand , we have the finitely generated abelian group E ( Q ) , on the other hand , there is the Shafarevich-Tate group Sha ( Q , E ) .	Descent is a general method of getting information on both of these objects - ideally complete information on the Mordell-Weil group E ( Q ) , and usually partial information on Sha ( Q , E ) .	What descent does is to compute ( for a given n & gt ; 1 ) the n-Selmer group Sel^ ( n ) ( Q , E ) ; it sits in an exact sequence 0 -- & gt ; E ( Q ) /nE ( Q ) -- & gt ; Sel^ ( n ) ( Q , E ) -- & gt ; Sha ( Q , E ) [ n ] -- & gt ; 0 and thus contains combined information on E ( Q ) and Sha ( Q , E ) .
1	In particular , it is well known that image textures constitute power visual cues for feature extraction and classification .	In many image processing applications , such as segmentation and classification , the selection of robust features descriptors is crucial to improve the discrimination capabilities in real world scenarios .	In the past few years the local binary pattern ( LBP ) approach , a texture descriptor method proposed by Ojala et al. , has gained increased acceptance due to its computational simplicity and more importantly for encoding a powerful signature for describing textures .	However , the original algorithm presents some limitations such as noise sensitivity and its lack of rotational invariance which have led to many proposals or extensions in order to overcome such limitations .	In this paper we performed a quantitative study of the Ojala 's original LBP proposal together with other recently proposed LBP extensions in the presence of rotational , illumination and noisy changes .
3	Considered alone , one of the instabilities would originate a linearly polarized hexagonal pattern whereas the other instability is of pure vectorial origin and would give rise to an elliptically polarized stripe pattern .	We study pattern formation associated with the polarization degree of freedom of the electric field amplitude in a mean field model describing a nonlinear Kerr medium close to a two-photon resonance , placed inside a ring cavity with flat mirrors and driven by a coherent $ \hat x $ -polarized plane-wave field .	In the self-focusing case , for negative detunings the pattern arises naturally from a codimension two bifurcation .	For a critical value of the field intensity there are two wave numbers that become unstable simultaneously , corresponding to two Turing-like instabilities .	We show that the competition between the two wavenumbers can originate different structures , being the detuning a natural selection parameter .
0	Studies of massive black holes ( BHs ) in nearby galactic centers have revealed a tight correlation between BH mass and galactic velocity dispersion .	In this paper we investigate how the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation and the nuclear luminosity versus velocity dispersion relation in QSOs/active galactic nuclei ( AGNs ) are connected with the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation in local galaxies , through the nuclear luminosity evolution of individual QSOs/AGNs and the mass growth of individual BHs .	In the study we ignore the effects of BH mergers and assume that the velocity dispersion does not change significantly during and after the nuclear activity phase .	Using the observed correlation in local galaxies and an assumed form of the QSO/AGN luminosity evolution and BH growth , we obtain the simulated observational appearance of the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation in QSOs/AGNs .	The simulation results illustrate how the BH accretion history ( e.g. , the lifetime of nuclear activity and the possibility that QSOs/AGNs accrete at a super-Eddington accretion rate at the early evolutionary stage ) can be inferred from the difference between the relation in QSOs/AGNs and that in local galaxies .
4	The dynamical instability of homogeneous sphere as well as relativistic polytropes with different values of charge in Newtonian and post-Newtonian regimes is explored .	In this paper , we study the dynamical instability of gaseous sphere under radial oscillations approaching the Reissner-Nordstr\ '' om limit .	For this purpose , we derive linearized perturbed equation of motion following the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches .	We formulate perturbed pressure in terms of adiabatic index by employing the conservation of baryon numbers .	A variational principle is established to evaluate characteristic frequencies of oscillations which lead to the criteria for dynamical stability .
4	After mixing , all signals are digitized and processed by digital receivers before the data are transmitted to the correlator .	The 10-antenna prototype of the multifrequency Siberian radioheliograph is described .	The prototype consists of four parts : antennas with broadband front-ends , analog back-ends , digital receivers and a correlator .	The prototype antennas are mounted on the outermost stations of the Siberian Solar Radio Telescope ( SSRT ) array .	A signal from each antenna is transmitted to a workroom by an analog fiber optical link , laid in an underground tunnel .
4	Let \mu_j^n denote the restriction of \mu to the sigma-algebra generated by the variables \sigma ( x ) , where x is at distance exactly n from \rho .	Consider a Markov chain on an infinite tree T= ( V , E ) rooted at \rho .	In such a chain , once the initial root state \sigma ( \rho ) is chosen , each vertex iteratively chooses its state from the one of its parent by an application of a Markov transition rule ( and all such applications are independent ) .	Let \mu_j denote the resulting measure for \sigma ( \rho ) =j .	The resulting measure \mu_j is defined on configurations \sigma= ( \sigma ( x ) ) _ { x\in V } \in A^V , where A is some finite set .
0	At large N_c the nucleon can be viewed as a soliton of the effective chiral lagrangian .	This picture of nucleons allows a consistent nonperturbative calculation of the leading-twist parton distributions at a low normalization point .	We derive general formulae for the polarized and unpolarized distributions ( singlet and non-singlet ) in the chiral quark-soliton model .	The consistency of our approach is demonstrated by checking the baryon number , isospin and total momentum sum rules , as well as the Bjorken sum rule .	We present numerical estimates of the quark and antiquark distributions and find reasonable agreement with parametrizations of the data at a low normalization point .
2	The phenomenon of stochastic tunneling , where an intermediate mutant in a sequence does not reach fixation in a population before generating a double mutant , has been studied using a variety of computational and mathematical methods .	Tumors initiate when a population of proliferating cells accumulates a certain number and type of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations .	The population dynamics of such sequential acquisition of ( epi ) genetic alterations has been the topic of much investigation .	However , the field still lacks a comprehensive analytical description since theoretical predictions of fixation times are only available for cases in which the second mutant is advantageous .	Here , we study stochastic tunneling in a Moran model .
2	They minimize a special uncertainty relation .	We present a construction of semi-classical states for P\ '' oschl-Teller potentials based on a supersymmetric quantum mechanics approach .	The parameters of these `` coherent '' states are points in the classical phase space of these systems .	Like standard coherent states they resolve the identity with a uniform measure .	They permit to establish the correspondence ( quantization ) between classical and quantum quantities .
1	In $ \textrm { CaFe } _2\textrm { As } _2 $ we identify the optical spin-density -- wave gap $ 2\Delta_ { \mathrm { SDW } } \approx1250\ \textrm { cm } ^ { -1 } $ .	We report the complex dielectric function of high-quality $ A\textrm { Fe } _2\textrm { As } _2 $ , ( $ A $ =Ca , Sr , Ba ) single crystals with $ T_ { \mathrm { N } } \approx150\ \textrm { K } $ , $ 200\ \textrm { K } $ , and $ 138\ \textrm { K } $ , respectively , determined by broadband spectroscopic ellipsometry at temperatures $ 10\leq T\leq300\ \textrm { K } $ and wavenumbers from $ 100\ \textrm { cm } ^ { -1 } $ to $ 52000\ \textrm { cm } ^ { -1 } $ .	The $ 2\Delta_ { \mathrm { SDW } } / ( k_ { \mathrm { B } } T_ { \mathrm { N } } ) $ ratio , characterizing the strength of the electron-electron coupling in the spin-density -- wave state , amounts to $ \approx12 $ in $ \textrm { CaFe } _2\textrm { As } _2 $ , significantly larger than the corresponding values for the $ \textrm { SrFe } _2\textrm { As } _2 $ and $ \textrm { BaFe } _2\textrm { As } _2 $ compounds : 8.7 and 5.3 , respectively .	We further show that , similarly to the Ba-based compound , two characteristic SDW energy gaps can be identified in the infrared-conductivity spectra of both $ \textrm { SrFe } _2\textrm { As } _2 $ and $ \textrm { CaFe } _2\textrm { As } _2 $ and investigate their detailed temperature dependence in all three materials .	This analysis reveals the existence of an anomaly in $ \textrm { CaFe } _2\textrm { As } _2 $ at a temperature $ T^*\approx80\ \textrm { K } $ , well below the N\'eel temperature of this compound , which implies weak coupling between the two SDW subsystems .
0	Variability , both in X-ray and optical/UV , affects the well-known anti-correlation between the $ \alpha_ { ox } $ spectral index and the UV luminosity of active galactic nuclei , contributing part of the dispersion around the average correlation ( `` intra-source dispersion '' ) , in addition to the differences among the time-average $ \alpha_ { ox } $ values from source to source ( `` inter-source dispersion '' ) .	We want to evaluate the intrinsic $ \alpha_ { ox } $ variations in individual objects , and their effect on the dispersion of the $ \alpha_ { ox } -L_ { UV } $ anti-correlation .	We use simultaneous UV/X-ray data from Swift observations of a low-redshift sample , to derive the epoch-dependent $ \alpha_ { ox } ( t ) $ indices .	We correct for the host galaxy contribution by a spectral fit of the optical/UV data .	We compute ensemble structure functions to analyse variability of multi-epoch data .
0	We discuss the possibility of an autonomous navigation system for spacecraft that is based on pulsar timing data .	Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that are observable as variable celestial sources of electromagnetic radiation .	Their periodic signals have timing stabilities comparable to atomic clocks and provide characteristic temporal signatures that can be used as natural navigation beacons , quite similar to the use of GPS satellites for navigation on Earth .	By comparing pulse arrival times measured on-board the spacecraft with predicted pulse arrivals at some reference location , the spacecraft position can be determined autonomously with accuracies on the order of 5 kilometres .	For a spacecraft at a distance of 10 astronomical units from Earth ( e.g. , Earth-Saturn ) , this means an improvement by a factor of 8 compared to conventional methods .
2	Here I discuss the strong binary lens events OGLE # 7 and DUO # 2 .	For observed galactic microlensing events only one fit is usually presented , though , especially for a binary lens , several fits may be possible .	This has been shown for the MACHO LMC # 1 event ( Dominik & amp ; Hirshfeld 1996 ) .	It is shown that several models with a large variety of parameters are in accordance with the photometric data .	For most of the fits , 1-sigma-bounds on the fit parameters are given .
2	In this paper , we discuss new successful simulations of supernova explosions that shed light on the relative importance of these two instabilities .	The neutrino-driven explosion mechanism for core-collapse supernovae in its modern flavor relies on the additional support of hydrodynamical instabilities in achieving shock revival .	Two possible candidates , convection and the so-called standing accretion shock instability ( SASI ) , have been proposed for this role .	While convection has so far been observed to grow first in self-consistent hydrodynamical models with multi-group neutrino transport , we here present the first such simulation in which the SASI grows faster while the development of convection is initially inhibited .	We illustrate the features of this SASI-dominated regime using an explosion model of a 27 solar mass progenitor , which is contrasted with a convectively-dominated model of an 8.1 solar mass progenitor with subsolar metallicity , whose early post-bounce behavior is more in line with previous 11.2 and 15 solar mass explosion models .
0	The existing linear frequency modulated ( LFM ) ( or step frequency ) and random noise synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) systems may correspond to the frequency hopping ( FH ) and direct sequence ( DS ) spread spectrum systems in the past second and third generation wireless communications .	Similar to the current and future wireless communications generations , in this paper , we propose OFDM SAR imaging , where a sufficient cyclic prefix ( CP ) is added to each OFDM pulse .	The sufficient CP insertion converts an inter-symbol interference ( ISI ) channel from multipaths into multiple ISI-free subchannels as the key in a wireless communications system , and analogously , it provides an inter-range-cell interference ( IRCI ) free ( high range resolution ) SAR image in a SAR system .	The sufficient CP insertion along with our newly proposed SAR imaging algorithm particularly for the OFDM signals also differentiates this paper from all the existing studies in the literature on OFDM radar signal processing .	Simulation results are presented to illustrate the high range resolution performance of our proposed CP based OFDM SAR imaging algorithm .
2	We show that these partition functions are equal to the generating functions of some peculiar classes of partitions which we introduce under the name 'orbifold partitions ' .	We consider N=4 theories on ALE spaces of $ A_ { k-1 } $ type .	As is well known , their partition functions coincide with $ A_ { k-1 } $ affine characters .	These orbifold partitions turn out to be related to the generalized Frobenius partitions introduced by G. E. Andrews some years ago .	We relate the orbifold partitions to the blended partitions and interpret explicitly in terms of a free fermion system .
1	We show that for all states generated by Clifford operation there always exist such an encoding , this includes all stabilizer states such as cluster states and all graph states .	In this article we investigate the possibility of encoding classical information onto multipartite quantum states in the distant laboratory framework .	We also show encoding for classes of symmetric states ( which can not be generated by Clifford operations ) .	We generalise our approach using group theoretic methods introducing the unifying notion of Pseudo Clifford operations .	All states generated by Pseudo Clifford operations are locally encodable ( unifying all our examples ) , and we give a general method for generating sets of many such locally encodable states .
0	The Infrared Camera ( IRC ) is one of two focal-plane instruments on the AKARI satellite .	It is designed for wide-field deep imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy in the near- to mid-infrared ( 1.8 -- 26.5um ) in the pointed observation mode of AKARI .	IRC is also operated in the survey mode to make an all-sky survey at 9 and 18um .	It comprises three channels .	The NIR channel ( 1.8 -- 5.5um ) employs a 512 x 412 InSb array , whereas both the MIR-S ( 4.6 -- 13.4um ) and MIR-L ( 12.6 -- 26.5um ) channels use 256 x 256 Si : As impurity band conduction arrays .
1	Immersed surfaces with prescribed motions are generated using the interpolation and regularization operators obtained from the discrete delta function approach of the original ( Peskin 's ) immersed boundary method .	A new parallel , computationally efficient immersed boundary method for solving three-dimensional , viscous , incompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented .	Unlike Peskin 's method , boundary forces are regarded as Lagrange multipliers that are used to satisfy the no-slip condition .	The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid and are solved in a finite number of operations using lattice Green 's function techniques .	These techniques are used to automatically enforce the natural free-space boundary conditions and to implement a novel block-wise adaptive grid that significantly reduces the run-time cost of solutions by limiting operations to grid cells in the immediate vicinity and near-wake region of the immersed surface .
2	We have developed a prototype of this LST light concentrator with an injection-molded plastic cone and a specular multilayer film .	Reflective light concentrators with hexagonal entrance and exit apertures are frequently used at the focal plane of gamma-ray telescopes in order to reduce the size of the dead area caused by the geometries of the photodetectors , as well as to reduce the amount of stray light entering at large field angles .	The focal plane of the large-sized telescopes ( LSTs ) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array ( CTA ) will also be covered by hexagonal light concentrators with an entrance diameter of 50 mm ( side to side ) to maximize the active area and the photon collection efficiency , enabling realization of a very low energy threshold of 20 GeV .	The shape of the plastic cone has been optimized with a cubic B\ ' { e } zier curve and a ray-tracing simulation .	We have also developed a multilayer film with very high reflectance ( $ \gtrsim95 $ \ % ) along wide wavelength and angle coverage .
4	The first possibility corresponds to a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the system and the second one implies that the heat bath could not totally erase the initial information in certain cases .	The phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking is investigated in the dynamic thermalization of a degenerate quantum system .	A three-level system interacting with a heat bath is carefully studied to this end .	It is shown that the three-level system with degenerate ground states might have different behaviors depending on the details of the interaction with the heat bath when the temperature approaches zero .	If we introduce an external field to break the degeneracy of the ground states and let it approach zero after letting the temperature approach zero , then two possibilities will arise : the steady state is a definite one of the degenerate states independent of the initial state , or the steady state is dependent on the initial state in a complicated way .
2	This quantity arises naturally in the study of Schramm-Loewner Evolutions ( SLE ) .	Let A be a bounded , relatively closed subset of the upper half plane H whose complement C is simply connected .	If B_t is a standard complex Brownian motion starting at iy and t_A = inf { t & gt ; 0 : B_t not in C } , the half-plane capacity of A , hcap ( A ) is defined to be the limit as y goes to infinity of y E [ Im ( B_ { t_A } ] .	In this note , we show that hcap ( A ) is comparable to a more geometric quantity hsiz ( A ) that we define to be the 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the union of all balls tangent to R whose centers belong to A .	Our main result is that hsiz ( A ) /66 & lt ; hcap ( A ) leq 7 hsiz ( A ) / ( 2 pi ) .
2	We develop a theory to describe the transient optomechanical behavior underlying the Ramsey fringes .	We adopt the Ramsey 's method of separated oscillatory fields to study coherences of the mechanical system in an optomechanical resonator .	The high resolution Ramsey fringes are observed in the emission optical field , when two pulses separated in time are applied .	We also perform the experimental demonstration using a silica microresonator .	The method is versatile and can be adopted to different types of mechanical resonators , electromechanical resonators .
2	It is demonstrated that out-of plane motion does not affect the properties of the adsorbed films as long as the total density is not close to the monolayer completion .	Using Monte Carlo simulation methods in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles , we discuss the melting and the formation of ordered structures of mixed Ar-Xe submonolayer films on graphite .	The calculations have been performed using two- as well as three-dimensional models of the systems studied .	On the other hand , close to the monolayer completion , the promotion of particles to the second layer considerably affects the properties of mixed films .	It has been shown that the mixture exhibits complete mixing in the liquid phase and freezes into solid phases of the structure depending upon the film composition .
0	The observed high covering fractions of neutral hydrogen ( HI ) with column densities above $ \sim 10^ { 17 } \rm { cm } ^ { -2 } $ around Lyman-Break Galaxies ( LBGs ) and bright quasars at redshifts z ~ 2-3 has been identified as a challenge for simulations of galaxy formation .	We use the EAGLE cosmological , hydrodynamical simulation , which has been shown to reproduce a wide range of galaxy properties and for which the subgrid feedback was calibrated without considering gas properties , to study the distribution of HI around high-redshift galaxies .	We predict the covering fractions of strong HI absorbers ( $ N_ { \rm { HI } } \gtrsim 10^ { 17 } \rm { cm } ^ { -2 } $ ) inside haloes to increase rapidly with redshift but to depend only weakly on halo mass .	For massive ( $ M_ { 200 } \gtrsim 10^ { 12 } { \rm M_ { \odot } } $ ) halos the covering fraction profiles are nearly scale-invariant and we provide fitting functions that reproduce the simulation results .	While efficient feedback is required to increase the HI covering fractions to the high observed values , the distribution of strong absorbers in and around halos of a fixed mass is insensitive to factor of two variations in the strength of the stellar feedback .
3	An additional contribution to the soft X-ray flux results from mutual interactions of clumps within the ejecta .	The luminous unstable star ( star system ) eta Carinae is surrounded by an optically bright bipolar nebula , the Homunculus and a fainter but much larger nebula , the so-called outer ejecta .	As images from the EINSTEIN and ROSAT satellites have shown , the outer ejecta is also visible in soft X-rays , while the central source is present in the harder X-ray bands .	With our CHANDRA observations we show that the morphology and properties of the X-ray nebula are the result of shocks from fast clumps in the outer ejecta moving into a pre-existing denser circumstellar medium .	Spectra extracted from the CHANDRA data yield gas temperatures kT of 0.6-0.76 keV .
0	Although it is commonly agreed that the presence of a close stellar companion is likely to affect planet formation and evolution , the precise effects and their actual impact on planet occurrence and properties are still debated .	In particular , observational constraints are sparse , a consequence of the discrimination against close binaries in Doppler planet searches .	To bring observational constraints on the occurrence and properties of planets in binaries and multiple stars , we have been conducting two dedicated observing programs using both adaptive optics imaging and radial-velocity monitoring .	In this chapter we explain our approach and present preliminary results from these two programs .	A simplified statistical analysis of the data from our VLT/NACO imaging survey brings the first observational evidence that the occurrence of planets is reduced in binaries closer than ~120 AU .
2	A necessary and sufficient condition for all the eigenvalue functions to be continuous and several properties of the eigenvalue functions in a set of the space of the problems are given .	This paper is concerned with continuous dependence of the n-th eigenvalue on self-adjoint discrete Sturm-Liouville problems .	The n-th eigenvalue is considered as a function in the space of the problems .	They play an important role in the study of continuous dependence of the n-th eigenvalue function on the problems .	Continuous dependence of the n-th eigenvalue function on the equations and on the boundary conditions is studied separately .
0	For the purpose of understanding second-order scalar PDEs and their hydrodynamic integrability , we introduce G-structures that are induced on hypersurfaces of the space of symmetric matrices ( interpreted as the fiber of second-order jet space ) and are defined by non-degenerate scalar second-order-only ( Hessian ) PDEs in any number of variables .	The fiber group is a conformal orthogonal group that acts on the space of independent variables , and it is a subgroup of the conformal orthogonal group for a semi-Riemannian metric that exists on the PDE .	These G-structures are automatically compatible with the definition of hydrodynamic integrability , so they allow contact-invariant analysis of integrability via moving frames and the Cartan -- Kaehler theorem .	They directly generalize the GL ( 2 ) -structures that arise in the case of Hessian hyperbolic equations in three variables as well as several related geometries that appear in the literature on hydrodynamic integrability .	Part I primarily discusses the motivation , the definition , and the solution to the equivalence problem , and Part II will discuss integrability in detail .
2	The developed formalism can describe edge excitations localized both at the physical edges of the array and at the internal `` domain walls '' separating array regions existing in different static magnetization states .	A general theory of edge spin wave excitations in semi-infinite and finite periodic arrays of magnetic nanodots existing in a spatially uniform magnetization ground state is developed .	The theory is formulated using a formalism of multi-vectors of magnetization dynamics , which allows one to study edge excitations in arrays having arbitrary complex primitive cells and lattice geometry .	Using a perturbation theory in the framework of the developed formalism it is possible to calculate damping of edge modes and their excitation by external variable magnetic fields .	The theory is illustrated on the following practically important examples : ( i ) calculation of the FMR absorption in a finite nanodot array having the shape of a right triangle , ( ii ) calculation of nonreciprocal spin wave spectra of edge modes , including modes at the physical edges of an array and modes at the domain walls inside an array , ( iii ) study of the influence of the domain wall modes on the FMR spectrum of an array existing in a non-ideal chessboard antiferromagnetic ground state .
0	Five well-known LBV stars in M33 were observed with the Multi-Pupil Fiber Spectrograph ( MPFS ) on the 6-m Russian telescope .	We observed LBVs varA , varB , varC , var2 and var83 .	In three of them , var2 , var83 , varB , large-scale nebulae were found with sizes from 15 pc and larger .	The nebula shapes are complex , like one-side tails or conical nebulae .	They all are related to their LBV stars .
4	To quartic terms in the field strength , a parity-violating term appears besides the two ordinary terms .	The recent PVLAS experiment observed the rotation of polarization and the ellipticity when a linearly polarized laser beam passes through a transverse magnetic field .	The phenomenon can not be explained in the conventional QED .	We attempt to accommodate the result by employing an effective theory for the electromagnetic field alone .	No new particles with a mass of order the laser frequency or below are assumed .
0	We study the spectrum of scalar mesons in the holographic dual of walking technicolor , obtained by embedding D7 - anti-D7 probe branes in a certain type IIB background .	The scalar mesons arise from fluctuations of the probe techniflavour branes and complement the ( axial- ) vector meson spectra that we investigated in earlier work .	By explicitly finding the spectrum of scalar masses , we show that the nonsupersymmetric D7 - anti-D7 embedding is stable with respect to such fluctuations .	Interestingly , it turns out that the mass splitting between the scalar and vector meson spectra is of subleading order in a small parameter expansion .	It is noteworthy that this near-degeneracy may not be entirely due to a small amount of supersymmetry breaking and thus could indicate the presence of some other ( approximate ) symmetry in the problem .
2	We present counterexamples to some natural conjectures .	We investigate algebraic and topological transitivity and , more generally , k-transitivity for linear spaces of operators .	In finite dimensions , we determine minimal dimensions of k-transitive spaces for every k , and find relations between the degree of transitivity of a product or tensor product on the one hand and those of the factors on the other .	Some infinite dimensional analogues are discussed .	A simple proof is given of Arveson 's result on the weak-operator density of transitive spaces that are masa bimodules .
2	The essential point behind the deleter is that the environment , by means of a dissipative interaction , furnishes a contractive map towards a pure state .	Environment-induced decoherence presents a great challenge to realizing a quantum computer .	We point out the somewhat surprising fact that decoherence can be useful , indeed necessary , for practical quantum computation , in particular , for the effective erasure of quantum memory in order to initialize the state of the quantum computer .	We present a specific example of an amplitude damping channel provided by a two-level system 's interaction with its environment in the weak Born-Markov approximation .	This is contrasted with a purely dephasing , non-dissipative channel provided by a two-level system 's interaction with its environment by means of a quantum nondemolition interaction .
3	A key finding of this paper is that appropriate network extensions of widely-studied single agent learning policies do not perform well in terms of regret .	We consider a collaborative online learning paradigm , wherein a group of agents connected through a social network are engaged in learning a Multi-Armed Bandit problem .	Each time an agent takes an action , the corresponding reward is instantaneously observed by the agent , as well as its neighbours in the social network .	We perform a regret analysis of various policies in this collaborative learning setting .	In particular , we identify a class of non-altruistic and individually consistent policies , which could suffer a large regret .
2	The results clearly reveal the presence of the continuous phase transition at a finite energy density and are consistent both qualitatively and quantitatively with the predictions of equilibrium statistical mechanics .	The Hamiltonian dynamics of the classical $ \phi^4 $ model on a two-dimensional square lattice is investigated by means of numerical simulations .	The macroscopic observables are computed as time averages .	The Hamiltonian microscopic dynamics also exhibits critical slowing down close to the transition .	Moreover , the relationship between chaos and the phase transition is considered , and interpreted in the light of a geometrization of dynamics .
1	Simulations in \cite { J } and \cite { B } suggest that this limit distribution is uniform on $ ( f,1 ) $ , for some $ f\sim2/3 $ .	One of the key problems related to the Bak-Sneppen evolution model on the circle is to compute the limit distribution of the fitness at a fixed observation vertex in the stationary regime , as the size of the system tends to infinity .	In this paper we prove that the mean of the fitness in the stationary regime is bounded away from 1 , uniformly in the size of the system , thereby establishing the non-triviality of the limit behaviour .	The Bak-Sneppen dynamics can easily be defined on any finite connected graph .	We also present a generalisation of the phase-transition result in the context of an increasing sequence of such graphs .
4	Finally , we apply the proposed weighted decoupling algorithm in the domain of system identification , and observe smaller model errors .	Multivariate polynomials arise in many different disciplines .	Representing such a polynomial as a vector of univariate polynomials can offer useful insight , as well as more intuitive understanding .	For this , techniques based on tensor methods are known , but these have only been studied in the exact case .	In this paper , we generalize an existing method to the noisy case , by introducing a weight factor in the tensor decomposition .
4	It was nevertheless recently demonstrated that dc-second-order nonlinear currents as well as ultrafast ac-currents can be generated in graphene under optical excitation .	Nonlinear couplings between photons and electrons in new materials give rise to a wealth of interesting nonlinear phenomena .	This includes frequency mixing , optical rectification or nonlinear current generation , which are of particular interest for generating radiation in spectral regions that are difficult to access , such as the terahertz gap .	Owing to its specific linear dispersion and high electron mobility at room temperature , graphene is particularly attractive for realizing strong nonlinear effects .	However , since graphene is a centrosymmetric material , second-order nonlinearities a priori cancel , which imposes to rely on less attractive third-order nonlinearities .
4	We analyse the characteristic physical scales relevant for the description of these radiative corrections .	We re-analyse the perturbative radiative corrections to the Higgs mass within the Standard Model in the light of the Taylor-Lagrange renormalization scheme .	This scheme naturally leads to completely finite corrections , depending on an arbitrary dimensionless scale .	This formulation avoids very large individual corrections to the Higgs mass .	In other words , it is a confirmation that the so-called fine-tuning problem in the Standard Model is just an artefact of the regularization scheme and should not lead to any physical interpretation in terms of the energy scale at which new physics should show up , nor to the appearance of a new symmetry .
2	We present detailed predictions for various observables that can be measured at LHC in ongoing experiments like ATLAS or CMS at sqrt { s } =7 TeV : the cross-section , the azimuthal correlations and the angular distribution of these jets .	More than 25 years ago , Mueller Navelet jets were proposed as a decisive test of BFKL dynamics at hadron colliders .	We here study this process at NLL BFKL accuracy , taking into account NLL corrections to the Green 's function and to the jet vertices .	For this purpose , we apply realistic kinematical cuts and binning , and study the dependence of our results with respect to several parameters .	We then compare our results with those that can be obtained in a fixed order NLO treatment , and propose specific observables which could actually be used as a probe of BFKL dynamics .
4	A detailed analysis of the advantages and limitations to this densitometry technique is also presented .	We present Green Bank Telescope ( GBT ) observations of the 3 ( 12 ) -3 ( 13 ) ( 29 GHz ) and 4 ( 13 ) -4 ( 14 ) ( 48 GHz ) transitions of the H2CO molecule toward a sample of 23 well-studied star-forming regions .	Analysis of the relative intensities of these transitions can be used to reliably measure the densities of molecular cores .	Adopting kinetic temperatures from the literature , we have employed a Large Velocity Gradient ( LVG ) model to derive the average hydrogen number density [ n ( H2 ) ] within a 16 arcsecond beam toward each source .	Densities in the range of 10^ { 5.5 } -- 10^ { 6.5 } cm^ { -3 } and ortho-formaldehyde column densities per unit line width between 10^ { 13.5 } and 10^ { 14.5 } cm^ { -2 } ( km s^ { -1 } ) ^ { -1 } are found for most objects , in general agreement with existing measurements .
1	The measurements were made for the paramagnetic metal ( PM ) , paramagnetic insulator ( PI ) , and antiferromagnetic insulator ( AFI ) phases of ( V $ _ { 1-x } $ M $ _x $ ) $ _2 $ O $ _3 $ with the samples of $ x $ = 0 , 0.012 , and 0.028 for Cr-doping and $ x $ = 0.01 for Ti-doping .	We present high-resolution bulk-sensitive photoemission spectra of ( V $ _ { 1-x } $ M $ _x $ ) $ _2 $ O $ _3 $ ( M=Cr , Ti ) .	In the PM phase , we observe a prominent quasiparticle peak in general agreement with theory , which combines dynamical mean-field theory with the local density approximation ( LDA+DMFT ) .	The quasiparticle peak shows a significantly larger peak width and weight than in the theory .	For both the PI and AFI phases , the vanadium 3d parts of the valence spectra are not simple one peak structures .
2	This compound undergoes a superconducting transition at $ T_ { c } $ = 3.75 K at $ H $ = 0 .	The magnetic properties of a quasi two-dimensional superconductor , Sn-metal graphite ( MG ) , are studied using DC and AC magnetic susceptibility .	Sn-MG has a unique layered structure where Sn metal layer is sandwiched between adjacent graphene sheets .	The $ H $ - $ T $ diagram of Sn-MG is similar to that of a quasi two-dimensional superconductors .	The phase boundaries of vortex liquid , vortex glass , and vortex lattice phase merge into a multicritical point located at $ T^ { * } $ = 3.4 K and $ H^ { * } $ = 40 Oe .
4	Furthermore , the Ha emission is more extended than the stellar continuum emission , consistent with inside-out assembly of galactic disks .	We present Ha maps at 1kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies at z~1 , made possible by the WFC3 grism on HST .	Employing this capability over all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies .	By creating deep stacked Halpha ( Ha ) images , we reach surface brightness limits of 1x10^-18\erg\s\cm^2\arcsec^2 , allowing us to map the distribution of ionized gas out to & gt ; 10kpc for typical L* galaxies at this epoch .	We find that the spatial extent of the Ha distribution increases with stellar mass as r ( Ha ) [ kpc ] =1.5 ( Mstars/10^10Msun ) ^0.23 .
2	One of our interesting outcomes from the effective Hubble equation for the domain wall dynamics is that it contains an additional component of `` dark matter '' which is induced from the charge of the bulk Born-Infeld gauge field .	In this paper we constructed a semi-realistic cosmological model in a dynamic domain wall framework .	Our universe is considered to be a ( 3+1 ) dimensional dynamic domain wall in a higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Born-Infeld background .	In this background spacetime we have studied the cosmological dynamics of the domain wall .	In addition to the Born-Infield gauge field if we consider additional pure gauge field , a non-singular bounce happens at the early stage with a smooth transition between contracting and expanding phase .
2	E } { \bf 56 } , 4179 ( 1997 ) ] .	It is possible in principle to probe the many -- atom potential surface using density functional theory ( DFT ) .	This will allow us to apply DFT to the Hamiltonian formulation of atomic motion in monatomic liquids [ \textit { Phys.Rev .	For a monatomic system , analysis of the potential surface is facilitated by the random and symmetric classification of potential energy valleys .	Since the random valleys are numerically dominant and uniform in their macroscopic potential properties , only a few quenches are necessary to establish these properties .
3	Via To\ '' en 's derived Morita theory , we identify Hochschild cohomology with derived endomorphisms of the diagonal curved module ; we compute the latter and get the expected result .	We study matrix factorization and curved module categories for Landau-Ginzburg models ( X , W ) with X a smooth variety , extending parts of the work of Dyckerhoff .	Following Positselski , we equip these categories with model category structures .	Using results of Rouquier and Orlov , we identify compact generators .	Finally , we show that our categories are smooth , proper when the singular locus of W is proper , and Calabi-Yau when the total space X is Calabi-Yau .
2	Results show that for $ ^ { 48 } $ Ca projectiles the quasi-fission is substantially reduced in comparison to the $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca case .	Quasi-fission is the primary reaction mechanism that prevents the formation of superheavy elements in heavy-ion fusion experiments .	Employing the time-dependent density functional theory approach we study quasi-fission in the systems $ ^ { 40,48 } $ Ca+ $ ^ { 238 } $ U .	This partly explains the success of superheavy element formation with $ ^ { 48 } $ Ca beams .	For the first time , we also calculate the repartition of excitation energies of the two fragments in a dynamic microscopic theory .
0	It is widely believed that existing electroweak data requires a Standard Model Higgs to be light while electroweak and flavour physics constraints require other scalars charged under the Standard Model gauge couplings to be heavy .	We analyze the robustness of these beliefs within a general scalar sector and find both to be incorrect , provided that the scalar sector approximately preserves custodial symmetry and minimal flavour violation ( MFV ) .	We demonstrate this by considering the phenomenology of the Standard Model supplemented by a scalar having SU ( 3 ) _c x SU ( 2 ) _L x U ( 1 ) _Y quantum numbers ( 8,2 ) _ ( 1/2 ) which has been argued to be the only kind of exotic flavour singlet scalar allowed by MFV that couples to quarks .	We examine constraints coming from electroweak precision data , direct production from LEPII and the Tevatron , and from flavour physics , and find that the observations allow both the Standard Model Higgs and the new scalars to be simultaneously light , with masses ~ 100 GeV , and in some cases lighter .	The discovery of such light coloured scalars could be a compelling possibility for early LHC runs , due to their large production cross section , ~100 pb .
1	We find a low amplitude RM effect for WASP-16 ( Teff = 5700 \pm 150K ) , suggesting that the star is a slow rotator and thus of an advanced age , and obtain a projected alignment angle of lambda = -4.2 degrees +11.0 -13.9 .	We present new measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin ( RM ) effect for three WASP planetary systems , WASP-16 , WASP-25 and WASP-31 , from a combined analysis of their complete sets of photometric and spectroscopic data .	For WASP-25 ( Teff = 5750\pm100K ) we detect a projected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 14.6 degrees \pm6.7 .	WASP-31 ( Teff = 6300\pm100K ) is found to be well-aligned , with a projected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 2.8degrees \pm3.1 .	A circular orbit is consistent with the data for all three systems , in agreement with their respective discovery papers .
1	In several ways it is a spin-orbit-induced analogue in time-reversal-invariant systems of the integer quantum Hall effect ( IQHE ) .	The topological insulator is an electronic phase stabilized by spin-orbit coupling that supports propagating edge states and is not adiabatically connected to the ordinary insulator .	This paper studies the topological insulator phase in disordered two-dimensional systems , using a model graphene Hamiltonian introduced by Kane and Mele as an example .	The nonperturbative definition of a topological insulator given here is distinct from previous efforts in that it involves boundary phase twists that couple only to charge , does not refer to edge states , and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge .	In this definition , the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states is determined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the IQHE case .
2	These kinds of vibrations belong to a different universality class than bonded electrons .	We discuss vibrational localization problems in glasses and disordered media in this paper .	It is claimed that the essence of the localization problem is already observed in disordered lattice models .	Specifically , The eigenvectors are extended even in two dimensions .	Moreover , the correlation exponent does not diverge in the transition from localized to delocalized states .
0	In this work , we show a methodology aimed to improve the quality of the assessment process for subjects related to basic programming .	The method takes into account the relevance of the items and the students answers to follow different paths to improve the accuracy of the assessment process .	We have developed numerical simulations and experiments with real students that demonstrate the advantages of this model when compared with traditional evaluation tools .	This method improves the objectiveness and takes into account the relevance of the subject contents .	We also demonstrate that the architecture of the algorithm is fully compatible with traditional multiple choice test formalisms .
3	We also reviewed some data from the GBI monitoring program at two frequencies and hard X-ray BATSE ( 20-100 keV ) and soft X-ray RTXE ( 2-12 keV ) ASM data .	Variable non-thermal radio emission from Galactic X-ray binaries is a trace of relativistic jets , created near accretion disks .	The spectral characteristics of a lot of radio flares in the X-ray binaries with jets ( RJXB ) is discussed in this report .	We carried out several long daily monitoring programs with the RATAN-600 radio telescope of the sources : SS433 , Cyg X-3 , LSI+61o303 , GRS 1915+10 and some others .	We confirmed that flaring radio emission of Cyg X-3 correlated with hard and anti-correlated with soft X-ray emission during the strong flare ( & gt ; $ Jy ) in May 1997 .
4	? to create the necessary indicators to evaluate these rules depending on designers choices .	This article aims at presenting our objective that is to use DfD rules earlier during the design process .	Indeed , during the conceptual design phase , designers do n't have simple qualitative tools or methods to evaluate their products .	There are guidelines that are very useful in a first approach to give some objectives , but there is no quantitative indicators associated to these rules to consider the disassembly aspects when the first choices are realised for the product .	So we will present that to use DfD rules during the conceptual design phase , we first have : ? to identify which kind of rules can be applied when designers only have a functional representation of their product .
2	As the corresponding Standard Model predictions have been refined , the experimental and theoretical values have persistently differed by about 3 standard deviations .	A new experiment at Fermilab will measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with a precision of 140 parts per billion ( ppb ) .	This measurement is motivated by the results of the Brookhaven E821 experiment that were first released more than a decade ago , which reached a precision of 540 ppb .	If the Brookhaven result is confirmed at Fermilab with this improved precision , it will constitute definitive evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model .	The experiment observes the muon spin precession frequency in flight in a well-calibrated magnetic field ; the improvement in precision will require both 20 times as many recorded muon decay events as in E821 and a reduction by a factor of 3 in the systematic uncertainties .
2	We suggest that this is partly because collisionless dynamics is also important and contribute to shaping the cluster properties .	Since globular clusters ( GCs ) are old , low-N systems their dynamics is widely believed to be fully dominated by collisional two-body processes , and their surface brightness profiles are fit by King models .	However , for many GCs , especially those with HST-resolved central regions , and `extra-tidal ' features , King models provide poor fits .	We show using time-scale and length-scale arguments that except for the very centers of clusters , collisionless dynamics should be more important than collisional .	We then fit 38 GCs analyzed by Noyola and Gebhardt ( 2006 ) with ( collisional ) King and ( collisionless ) DARKexp models over the full available radial range , and find that the latter provide a better fit to 29 GCs ; for six of these the fit is at least ~5x better in term of rms .
3	Keplerian conic sections are obtained for special choices for p and p ' and the systems are shown to be equivalent to nonrelativistic systems .	We study several different kinds of bound states built from D-branes and orientifolds .	These states are to atoms what branonium - the bound state of a brane and its anti-brane - is to positronium , inasmuch as they typically involve a light brane bound to a much heavier object with conserved charges which forbid the system 's decay .	We find the fully relativistic motion of a probe Dp'-brane in the presence of source Dp-branes is integrable by quadratures .	Their quantum behaviour is also equivalent to the corresponding non-relativistic limit .
1	In this article I continue to investigate a particular type of K\ '' ahler manifolds with positive first Chern class which generalize Calabi -- Yau manifolds in a natural way and which provide a framework for mirrors of rigid string vacua .	Because of the existence of rigid Calabi -- Yau manifolds , mirror symmetry can not be understood as an operation on the space of manifolds with vanishing first Chern class .	This class is comprised of a special type of Fano manifolds which encode crucial information about ground states of the superstring .	It is shown in particular that the massless spectra of $ ( 2,2 ) $ -- supersymmetric vacua of central charge $ \hat { c } =D_ { crit } $ can be derived from special Fano varieties of complex dimension $ ( D_ { crit } +2 ( Q-1 ) ) $ , $ Q & gt ; 1 $ , and that in certain circumstances it is even possible to embed Calabi -- Yau manifolds into such higher dimensional spaces .	The constructions described here lead to new insight into the relation between exactly solvable models and their mean field theories on the one hand and their corresponding Calabi -- Yau manifolds on the other .
1	Recent advances in the synthesis of sheets with controlled heterogeneities have enabled their actuation into non-trivial shapes with unprecedented energy density .	Nematic elastomers and glasses are solids that display spontaneous distortion under external stimuli .	Thus , these have emerged as powerful candidates for soft actuators .	To further this potential , we introduce the key metric constraint which governs shape changing actuation in these sheets .	We then highlight the richness of shapes amenable to this constraint through two broad classes of examples which we term nonisometric origami and lifted surfaces .
0	According to the E.L. Feinberg viewpoint on the possibility of a semi-bare electron state we may expect a state of electron with non-equilibrium Coulomb field during the time range of { \gamma^2 \lambda/c } , where { \gamma } is the Lorents-factor of electron , c is light velocity and { \lambda } is the wavelength corresponding to a frequency in Fourier expansion of the Coulomb field of relativistic electron .	If this non-equilibrium Coulomb field has a spatial asymmetry , a relativistic electron may be deflected by its own Coulomb field .	For the { \gamma^2 \lambda/c=1m } we may observe this effect in macroscopic mode when the electrons are grouped in bunches with the population Ne=10^8 .	We present in this paper the experimental observation of the deflection of an electron beam by an asymmetrical non-equilibrium Coulomb field of electron bunch .	The experiment was performed on the relativistic electron beam of the microtron of Tomsk Polytechnic University .
2	In this work we report on a detailed fully atomistic molecular dynamics study of this phenomenon .	Violet Lander ( VL ) ( C108H104 ) is a large organic molecule that when deposited on Cu ( 110 ) exhibited lock-and-key like behavior ( Otero et al. , Nature Mater .	3 , 779 ( 2004 ) ) .	Our results show that it has its physical basis in the interplay of the molecular hydrogens and the Cu ( 110 ) atomic spacing , which is a direct consequence of an accidental commensurability between molecule and surface dimensions .	This knowledge could be used to engineer new molecules capable of displaying lock-and-key behavior with new potential applications in nanotechology .
0	Let $ M $ be a $ II_1 $ -factor with trace $ \tau $ , the linear subspaces of $ L^2 ( M , \tau ) $ are not just common Hilbert spaces , but they have additional structure .	We introduce the notion of a cyclic linear space by taking those properties as axioms .	In Sec.2 we formulate the following problem : `` does every cyclic Hilbert space embed into $ L^2 ( M , \tau ) $ , for some $ M $ ? `` .	An affirmative answer would imply the existence of an algorithm to check Connes ' embedding Conjecture .	In Sec.3 we make a first step towards the answer of the previous question .
4	The masses in the strong sector generically violate custodial symmetry , and a good precision electroweak fit requires tuning of order $ \sim 10 % $ .	We propose a framework for natural breaking of electroweak symmetry in supersymmetric models , where elementary Higgs fields are semi-perturbatively coupled to a strong superconformal sector .	The Higgs VEVs break conformal symmetry in the strong sector at the TeV scale , and the strong sector in turn gives important contributions to the Higgs potential , giving rise to a kind of Higgs bootstrap .	A Higgs with mass $ 125\GeV $ can be accommodated without any fine tuning .	A Higgsino mass of order the Higgs mass is also dynamically generated in these models .
4	An analytic evaluation of the power spectrum yields the relationship between the average time profile of nanoflares ( or microflares ) , assumed to be self-similar in energy , and the power spectrum .	The energy input into the lower solar corona by flare evaporation events has been modeled according to the available observations for quiet regions .	The question is addressed whether such heating events can provide the observed average level of the coronal emission measure and thus of the observed flux of extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) and X-ray emission without contradicting the observed average power spectrum of the emission measure , the typical emission measure variations observed for individual pixels and the observed flare energy distribution .	As the assumed flare height influences the derived flare energy , the mathematical foundations of nanoflare distributions and their conversion to different height assumptions are studied first .	This also allows a comparison with various published energy distributions differing in height assumptions and to relate the observations to the input parameters of the heating model .
0	We present a mathematical analysis of the statistical parallax method .	The method yields physical insight into the maximum-likelihood determinations of the luminosity and velocity distribution and enables us to conduct a vigorous Monte Carlo investigation into various systematic effects .	We apply our analytic formalism to the RR Lyrae sample of Layden et al .	The velocity distribution of RR Lyrae stars is highly non-Gaussian , with kurtoses K_\pi = 2.04 , K_\theta = 3.22 and K_z = 4.28 in the three principal directions , but this has almost no effect on either the best fit or the uncertainty of the luminosity determination .	Indeed , our principal result is that the statistical parallax method is extremely robust in the face of all systematic effects that we considered .
3	We also generated synthetic quasar spectra in the range 1.0 & lt ; z & lt ; 5.5 and computed expected quasar colors .	We focus on the search for unresolved faint quasars and AGN in the crude combine images using a multicolor imaging analysis that has proven very successful in recent years .	Quasar selection was carried out both in multicolor space and in `` profile space , '' defined as the multi-parameter space formed by the radial profiles of the objects in the different images .	By combining the dither frames available for each filter , we were able to obtain well-sampled radial profiles of the objects and measure their deviation from that of a stellar source .	We determined that the data are 90 % complete for point sources at 26.2 , 28.0 , 27.8 , 26.8 in the F300W , F450W , F606W and F814W filters , respectively .
3	In lattice regulations , it reflects on the appearance of power-like divergences in the inverse of the lattice spacing for a series of quantities ( $ \bar \Lambda $ , gluelump masses , the singlet and hybrid potentials , ... ) making that the continuum limit can not be reached for them .	Perturbative expansions of QCD observables in powers of $ \alpha_s $ are believed to be asymptotic and non-Borel summable due to the existence of singularities in the Borel plane ( renormalons ) .	This fact is connected with the factorization of scales ( which is inherent to QCD and asymptotic freedom ) and jeopardizes the convergence of the perturbative expansion and the accurate determination of power-suppressed corrections .	This problem is more acute for physical systems composed by one or more heavy quarks .	Nevertheless , all these problems are solved within the framework of effective field theories with renormalon substraction .
1	The HDF-S data we discuss were taken in a number of different filters extending from the near -- UV ( F300W ) to the infrared ( F222M ) in two different fields .	We present the results of colour selection of candidate high redshift galaxies in Hubble Deep Field South ( HDF-S ) using the Lyman dropout scheme .	This allows us to select candidates with redshifts from z~3 to z~12 .	We find 15 candidate z~3 objects ( F300W dropouts ) , 1 candidate z~4 object ( F450W dropout ) and 16 candidate z $ \sim $ 5 objects ( F606W dropouts ) in the ~ 4.7 arcmin^2 WFPC-2 field , 4 candidate z~6 ( optical dropouts ) and 1 candidate z~8 ( F110W dropout ) in the 0.84 arcmin^2 NICMOS-3 field .	No F160W dropouts are found ( z~12 ) .
3	In this paper , we are emphasizing on English-Hindi language pair , so in order to preserve the correct MT output we present a ranking system , which employs some machine learning techniques and morphological features .	Machine Translation is the challenging problem for Indian languages .	Every day we can see some machine translators being developed , but getting a high quality automatic translation is still a very distant dream .	The correct translated sentence for Hindi language is rarely found .	In ranking no human intervention is required .
4	At each extremum labelled by $ k = 0 , \ldots , [ \frac { N-1 } 2 ] $ , the $ \mathfrak { u } ( N ) $ color gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to $ \mathfrak { u } ( N-k ) \oplus \mathfrak { u } ( k ) $ and provides different ( A ) dS backgrounds with the cosmological constants $ \big ( \frac { N } { N-2k } \big ) ^ { 2 } \ , \L $ \ , .	We propose a theory of three-dimensional ( anti ) de Sitter gravity carrying Chan-Paton color charges .	We define the theory by Chern-Simons formulation with the gauge algebra $ ( \mathfrak { gl } _ { 2 } \oplus \mathfrak { gl } _ { 2 } ) \otimes \mathfrak { u } ( N ) $ , obtaining a color-decorated version of interacting spin-one and spin-two fields .	We also describe the theory in metric formulation and show that , among $ N^ { 2 } $ massless spin-two fields , only the singlet one plays the role of metric graviton whereas the rest behave as \emph { colored spinning matter } that strongly interacts at large $ N $ .	Remarkably , these \emph { colored spinning matter } acts as Higgs field and generates a non-trivial potential of staircase shape .
1	We predicted the most probable sites occupied by Eu3+ and Li+ ions and the related charge-compensation mechanisms involved into these substitutions .	We investigated the Li+ ion incorporation in Ba2GdNbO6 : Eu3+ perovskite by atomistic simulations based on energy minimization .	The results show that the Eu3+ and Li+ ions are incorporated mainly at the Gd3+ site .	In the Li+ ion case , there is a charge compensation by Nb_Gd antisite .	The Crystal ? eld parameters and the transition levels for the Eu3+ ion in the BGN : Eu3+ were calculated with basis on the simulated local symmetry of the Eu3+ site .
1	Naively any would-be vacuum state has many nearby decay paths , and all possible decays must be suppressed .	The possibility of a landscape of metastable vacua raises the question of what fraction of vacua are truly long lived .	An interesting model of this phenomena consists of $ N $ scalars with a random potential of fourth order .	Here we show that the scaling of the typical minimal bounce action with $ N $ is readily understood , and differs from statements in the literature .	We discuss the extension to more realistic landscape models .
2	The direction of propagation can be either parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field lines .	Electron magnetohydrodynamics ( EMHD ) provides a fluid-like description of small-scale magnetized plasmas .	An EMHD wave ( also known as whistler wave ) propagates along magnetic field lines .	We numerically study propagation of 3-dimensional ( 3D ) EMHD wave packets moving in one direction .	We obtain two major results : 1 .
2	The Cahn-Hilliard approach is used to model the behaviour of evolving and diffusing interfaces .	We study the interactions between the thermodynamic transition and hydrodynamic flows which would characterise a thermo- and hydro-dynamic evolution of a binary mixture in a dissolution/nucleation process .	The primary attention is given to the slow dissolution dynamics .	An important peculiarity of the full Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations is the use of the full continuity equation required even for a binary mixture of incompressible liquids , firstly , due to dependence of mixture density on concentration and , secondly , due to strong concentration gradients at liquids ' interfaces .	Using the multiple-scale method we separate the physical processes occurring on different time scales and , ultimately , provide a strict derivation of the Boussinesq approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations .
1	We study the resulting FSI effects in the tensor analyzing power in detail and find substantial FSI effects starting at still low missing momentum $ p_m \gsim 0.9 fm^ { -1 } $ .	The strength of final state interaction ( FSI ) between struck proton and spectator neutron in $ ^2\vec { H } ( e , e'p ) $ scattering depends on the alignment of the deuteron .	At larger $ p_m \gsim 1.5 fm^ { -1 } $ , FSI completely dominates both missing momentum distribution and tensor analyzing power .	We find that to a large extent FSI masks the sensitivity of the tensor analyzing power to models of the deuteron wave function .	For the transversely polarized deuterons the FSI induced forward-backward asymmetry of the missing momentum distribution is shown to have a node at precisely the same value of $ p_m $ as the PWIA missing momentum distribution .
1	This problem , known as domain shift , occurs when training classifiers from object-centric internet image databases and trying to apply them directly to scene understanding tasks .	Images seen during test time are often not from the same distribution as images used for learning .	The consequence is often severe performance degradation and is one of the major barriers for the application of classifiers in real-world systems .	In this paper , we show how to learn transform-based domain adaptation classifiers in a scalable manner .	The key idea is to exploit an implicit rank constraint , originated from a max-margin domain adaptation formulation , to make optimization tractable .
1	The density parameters of both components are then constant , as they expand as a^ { -4 } .	A dual component made of non-relativistic particles and a scalar field , exchanging energy , naturally falls onto an attractor solution , making them a ( sub ) dominant part of the cosmic energy during the radiation dominated era , provided that the constant \beta , measuring the coupling , is strong enough .	If the field energy is then prevalently kinetic , as is expected , its energy is exactly half of the pressureless component ; the dual component as a whole , then , has a density parameter \Omega_ { cd } = 3/4\beta^2 ( e.g. , for \beta~2.5 , \Omega_ { cd } ~0.1 , in accordance with Dark Radiation expectations ) .	The stationary evolution can only be broken by the rising of other component ( s ) , expanding as a^ { -3 } .	In a realistic scenario , this happens when z~3-5x10^3 .
2	A mixed-ADC architecture , where most of the antennas are equipped with low-precision ADCs while a few antennas have full-precision ADCs , can solve these issues and actualize the potential of the pure low-resolution ADC architecture .	Using a very low-resolution analog-to-digital convertor ( ADC ) unit at each antenna can remarkably reduce the hardware cost and power consumption of a massive multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) system .	However , such a pure low-resolution ADC architecture also complicates parameter estimation problems such as time/frequency synchronization and channel estimation .	In this paper , we present a unified framework to develop a family of detectors over the massive MIMO uplink system with the mixed-ADC receiver architecture by exploiting probabilistic Bayesian inference .	As a basic setup , an optimal detector is developed to provide a minimum mean-squared-error ( MMSE ) estimate on data symbols .
1	It is based on an existing phase-field formulation of the bulk free energy and incorporates two crucial effects : ( i ) anisotropic ionic mobility in the crystal and ( ii ) surface reactions governing the flux of ions across the electrode/electrolyte interface , depending on the local free energy difference .	A general continuum theory is developed for ion intercalation dynamics in a single crystal of a rechargeable battery cathode .	Although the phase boundary can form a classical diffusive `` shrinking core '' when the dynamics is bulk-transport-limited , the theory also predicts a new regime of surface-reaction-limited ( SRL ) dynamics , where the phase boundary extends from surface to surface along planes of fast ionic diffusion , consistent with recent experiments on LiFePO4 .	In the SRL regime , the theory produces a fundamentally new equation for phase transformation dynamics , which admits traveling-wave solutions .	Rather than forming a shrinking core of untransformed material , the phase boundary advances by filling ( or emptying ) successive channels of fast diffusion in the crystal .
1	Using a continuum , membrane-like model we study the height-height correlation functions and the destabilization modes corresponding to two different boundaries conditions : ribbons which are fixed or free on the edges .	We analyze the thermal fluctuations of a narrow graphene nanoribbon .	For the first situation , the thermal spectrum has a gap and the correlations along the ribbon decay exponentially .	Thermal fluctuations produce only local perturbations of the flat situation .	However , the long range crystalline order is not distorted .
0	Most software verification tools can be classified into one of a number of established families , each of which has their own focus and strengths .	For example , concrete counterexample generation in model checking , invariant inference in abstract interpretation and completeness via annotation for deductive verification .	This creates a significant and fundamental usability problem as users may have to learn and use one technique to find potential problems but then need an entirely different one to show that they have been fixed .	This paper presents a single , unified algorithm kIkI , which strictly generalises abstract interpretation , bounded model checking and k-induction .	This not only combines the strengths of these techniques but allows them to interact and reinforce each other , giving a `single-tool ' approach to verification .
0	We use first principles calculations to study structural , vibrational and superconducting properties of H $ _2 $ S at pressures $ P\ge 200 $ GPa .	The inclusion of zero point energy leads to two different possible dissociations of H $ _2 $ S , namely 3H $ _2 $ S $ \to $ 2H $ _3 $ S + S and 5H $ _2 $ S $ \to $ 3H $ _3 $ S + HS $ _2 $ , where both H $ _3 $ S and HS $ _2 $ are metallic .	For H $ _3 $ S , we perform non-perturbative calculations of anharmonic effects within the self-consistent harmonic approximation and show that the harmonic approximation strongly overestimates the electron-phonon interaction ( $ \lambda\approx 2.64 $ at 200 GPa ) and T $ _c $ .	Anharmonicity hardens HS bond-stretching modes and softens H -- S bond-bending modes .	As a result , the electron-phonon coupling is suppressed by $ 30\ % $ ( $ \lambda\approx 1.84 $ at 200 GPa ) .
2	The crucial role is played in this by the Bohr 's insistence on the wavefunction providing the most complete description possible for an even individual system .	A brief account of the world view of classical physics is given first .	We then recapitulate as to why the Copenhagen interpretation of the quantum mechanics had to renounce most of the attractive features of the clasical world view such as a causal description , locality , scientific realism and introduce a fundamental distinction between system and apparatus .	The alternative of introducing extra dynamical variables , called hidden variables , in addition to the wavefunction of the system so as to be able to retain at least some of the desirable features of classical physics , is then explored .	The first such successful attempt was that of Bohm in 1952 who showed that a realistic interpretation of the quantum mechanics can be given which maintains a causal description as well as does not treat systems and measuring appeartus differently .
4	Although groups of the form G^n have a simple product structure , they share important representation-theoretic properties with the symmetric groups S_n , where a solution to the HSP would yield a quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism .	Daniel Simon 's 1994 discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for solving the hidden subgroup problem ( HSP ) over Z_2^n provided one of the first algebraic problems for which quantum computers are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts .	In this paper , we study the generalization of Simon 's problem to arbitrary groups .	Fixing a finite group G , this is the problem of recovering an involution m = ( m_1 , ... , m_n ) in G^n from an oracle f with the property that f ( x ) = f ( xy ) iff y equals m or the identity .	In the current parlance , this is the hidden subgroup problem ( HSP ) over groups of the form G^n , where G is a nonabelian group of constant size , and where the hidden subgroup is either trivial or has order two .
1	This explanation is in contradiction with the thermodynamics second law .	The present earth warming up is often explained by the atmosphere gas greenhouse effect .	The warming up by greenhouse effect is quite improbable .	It is cloud reflection that gives to the earth s ground its 15 degres C mean temperature .	Since the reflection of the radiation by gases is negligible , the role of the atmosphere greenhouse gases in the earth warming up by earth radiation reflection loses its importance .
4	Far above the threshold , ion Landau damping is recovered .	The motion of ions in the fields B = B_0 zhat and E = E_0 yhat cos ( k_perp y - omega t ) is considered .	When omega & gt ; & gt ; Omega_i and v_perp & gt ; omega/k_perp , the equations of motion may be reduced to a set of difference equations .	These equations exhibit stochastic behavior when E_0 exceeds a threshold .	The diffusion coefficient above the threshold is determined .
2	However , it is also known that this transition can be observed for sub-critical Reynolds numbers .	The transitional boundary layer flow over a flat plate is investigated .	The boundary layer flow is known to develop unstable Tollmien-Schlichting waves above a critical value of the Reynolds number .	In that case , the basin of attraction of the laminar state coexists with the sustained turbulence .	In this article , the trajectory on the separatrix between these two states is simulated .
2	For ttbar events under typical 2011 pileup conditions , the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of pt & gt ; 0.9 GeV is 94 % for pseudorapidities of abs ( eta ) & lt ; 0.9 and 85 % for 0.9 & lt ; abs ( eta ) & lt ; 2.5 .	A description is provided of the software algorithms developed for the CMS tracker both for reconstructing charged-particle trajectories in proton-proton interactions and for using the resulting tracks to estimate the positions of the LHC luminous region and individual primary-interaction vertices .	Despite the very hostile environment at the LHC , the performance obtained with these algorithms is found to be excellent .	The inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material .	For isolated muons , the corresponding efficiencies are essentially 100 % .
1	We consider two high-energy limits , corresponding to two different kinematic regions : a ) the Higgs boson is centrally located in rapidity between the two jets , and very far from either jet ; b ) the Higgs boson is close to one jet in rapidity , and both of these are very far from the other jet .	In this paper , we analyze the high-energy limits for Higgs boson plus two jet production .	In both cases the amplitudes factorize into impact factors or coefficient functions connected by gluons exchanged in the t channel .	Accordingly , we compute the coefficient function for the production of a Higgs boson from two off-shell gluons , and the impact factors for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a gluon or a quark jet .	We include the full top quark mass dependence and compare this with the result obtained in the large top-mass limit .
1	We will require that our correlator follows the power behaviour prescribed by the operator product expansion at high euclidian momentum .	We study the octet SS-PP correlator within resonance chiral theory up to the one-loop level , i.e. , up to next-to-leading order in the 1/Nc expansion .	Nevertheless , we will not make use of short-distance constraints from other observables .	Likewise , the high-energy behaviour will be demanded for the whole correlator , not for individual absorptive channels .	The amplitude is progressively improved by considering more and more complicated operators in the hadronic lagrangian .
0	We study the phase behavior of a symmetric binary polymer blend which is confined into a thin film .	The film surfaces interact with the monomers via short range potentials .	We calculate the phase behavior within the self-consistent field theory of Gaussian chains .	Over a wide range of parameters we find strong first order wetting transitions for the semi-infinite system , and the interplay between the wetting/prewetting behavior and the phase diagram in confined geometry is investigated .	Antisymmetric boundaries , where one surface attracts the A component with the same strength than the opposite surface attracts the B component , are applied .
1	At a fixed temperature and interaction strength , we study the interplay between the maximum degree ( $ \Delta $ ) of the underlying graph and the number of colours or spins ( $ q $ ) in determining whether the dynamics mixes rapidly or not .	We present several results on the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics for sampling from the Gibbs distribution in the ferromagnetic Potts model .	We find a lower bound $ L $ on the number of colours such that Glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing if at least $ L $ colours are used .	We give a closely-matching upper bound $ U $ on the number of colours such that with probability that tends to 1 , the Glauber dynamics mixes slowly on random $ \Delta $ -regular graphs when at most $ U $ colours are used .	We show that our bounds can be improved if we restrict attention to certain types of graphs of maximum degree $ \Delta $ , e.g.toroidal grids for $ \Delta = 4 $ .
2	Starting from the ( 3+1 ) -dimensional Yang-Mills action , we implement the high energy limit $ s\ ! & gt ; \ ! & gt ; \ !	Previous studies of high-energy scattering in QCD have shown a remarkable correspondence with two-dimensional field theory .	In this paper we formulate a simple effective model in which this two-dimensional nature of the interactions is manifest .	t $ via a scaling argument and we derive from this a simplified effective theory .	This effective theory is still ( 3+1 ) -dimensional , but we show that its interactions can to leading order be summarized in terms of a two-dimensional sigma-model defined on the transverse plane .
2	These two phases can coexist over a narrow range of pressures , P_min & lt ; P & lt ; P_max .	Much of the interstellar medium in disk galaxies is in the form of neutral atomic hydrogen , H I .	This gas can be in thermal equilibrium at relatively low temperatures , T & lt ; 300 K ( the cold neutral medium , or CNM ) or at temperatures somewhat less than 10^4 K ( the warm neutral medium , or WNM ) .	We determine P_min and P_max in the plane of the Galaxy as a function of Galactocentric radius R using recent determinations of the gas heating rate and the gas phase abundances of interstellar gas .	We provide an analytic approximation for P_min as a function of metallicity , far-ultraviolet radiation field , and the ionization rate of atomic hydrogen .
3	Our procedure unifies in a single structure the quantum plane coordinates and the q-group matrix elements T^a_b , and allows to deduce without effort the differential calculus on the q-plane IGL_qr ( N ) / GL_qr ( N ) .	A review of the multiparametric linear quantum group GL_qr ( N ) , its real forms , its dual algebra U ( gl_qr ( N ) ) and its bicovariant differential calculus is given in the first part of the paper .	We then construct the ( multiparametric ) linear inhomogeneous quantum group IGL_qr ( N ) as a projection from GL_qr ( N+1 ) , or equivalently , as a quotient of GL_qr ( N+1 ) with respect to a suitable Hopf algebra ideal .	A bicovariant differential calculus on IGL_qr ( N ) is explicitly obtained as a projection from the one on GL_qr ( N+1 ) .	The general theory is illustrated on the example of IGL_qr ( 2 ) .
4	We also analyse the effect of the disc 's thermodynamic properties on the orbital evolution of embedded planets in detail .	While planets in the solar system only have a low inclination with respect to the ecliptic there is mounting evidence that in extrasolar systems the inclination can be very high , at least for close-in planets .	One process to alter the inclination of a planet is through planet-disc interactions .	Recent simulations considering radiative transport have shown that the evolution of migration and eccentricity can strongly depend on the thermodynamic state of the disc .	We extend previous studies to investigate the planet-disc interactions of fixed and moving planets on inclined and eccentric orbits .
4	We find all primitive weird numbers of the form $ 2^kpq $ ( $ p & lt ; q $ being odd primes ) for $ 1\le k\le14 $ .	We say a natural number~ $ n $ is abundant if $ \sigma ( n ) & gt ; 2n $ , where $ \sigma ( n ) $ denotes the sum of the divisors of~ $ n $ .	The aliquot parts of~ $ n $ are those divisors less than~ $ n $ , and we say that an abundant number~ $ n $ is pseudoperfect if there is some subset of the aliquot parts of~ $ n $ which sum to~ $ n $ .	We say~ $ n $ is weird if~ $ n $ is abundant but not pseudoperfect .	We call a weird number~ $ n $ primitive if none of its aliquot parts are weird .
4	Finally , quantitative photometric redshifts and SED fits are presented for one `` J-band dropout '' galaxy with J-K & gt ; 2.5 which is confirmed to be very dusty ( E ( B-V ) ~=0.5 ) and background to the quasar at & gt ; 99.9 % confidence .	We present new data on several z=1.54 radio-loud quasar fields from a sample of 31 at z=1-2 in which we have previously identified an excess population of predominantly red galaxies .	Narrow-band H-alpha observations detect five candidate galaxies at the quasar redshifts in three fields totaling 10.156 arcmin^2 , a surface density 30 times higher than in previous surveys , even targeted ones .	SCUBA observations of three fields detect at least one candidate quasar-associated galaxy .	Many galaxies with SEDs indicating considerable dust are not detected , but the limits are only sufficient to rule out hyperluminous infrared galaxies .
4	We should emphasize that $ F $ -Theory is yet just a very provisional attempt , lacking clear dynamical principles .	After a brief review of string and $ M $ -Theory we point out some deficiencies .	Partly to cure them , we present several arguments for `` $ F $ -Theory '' , enlarging spacetime to $ ( 2 , 10 ) $ signature , following the original suggestion of C. Vafa .	We introduce a suggestive Supersymmetric 27-plet of particles , associated to the exceptional symmetric hermitian space $ E_ { 6 } /Spin^ { c } ( 10 ) $ .	Several possible future directions , including using projective rather than metric geometry , are mentioned .
4	Comparison between the respective Navier-Stokes transport coefficients shows that the EHS model reproduces almost perfectly the self-diffusion coefficient and reasonably well the two transport coefficients defining the heat flux , the shear viscosity being reproduced within a deviation less than 14 % ( for $ \alpha\geq 0.5 $ ) .	The prototype model of a fluidized granular system is a gas of inelastic hard spheres ( IHS ) with a constant coefficient of normal restitution $ \alpha $ .	Using a kinetic theory description we investigate the two basic ingredients that a model of elastic hard spheres ( EHS ) must have in order to mimic the most relevant transport properties of the underlying IHS gas .	First , the EHS gas is assumed to be subject to the action of an effective drag force with a friction constant equal to half the cooling rate of the IHS gas , the latter being evaluated in the local equilibrium approximation for simplicity .	Second , the collision rate of the EHS gas is reduced by a factor $ ( 1+\alpha ) /2 $ , relative to that of the IHS gas .
2	This sample contains a substantial portion of the WAT clusters in the VLA 20 cm survey of Abell clusters , including 75 % of WAT clusters in the complete survey ( z & lt ; =0.09 ) , and 20 % of WAT clusters with z & gt ; 0.09 .	We present new redshifts and positions for 635 galaxies in nine rich clusters containing Wide-Angle Tailed ( WAT ) radio galaxies .	Combined with existing data , we now have a sample of 18 WAT-containing clusters with more than 10 redshifts .	It is a representative sample which should not contain biases other than selection by radio morphology .	We graphically present the new data using histograms and sky maps .
2	Specificity stems here from the interplay between binding affinity and cellular abundancy of transcription factor proteins and the binding of such proteins to DNA is thus controlled by their chemical potential .	Transcription regulation is largely governed by the profile and the dynamics of transcription factors ' binding to DNA .	Stochastic effects are intrinsic to this dynamics and the binding to functional sites must be controled with a certain specificity for living organisms to be able to elicit specific cellular responses .	We combine large-scale protein abundance data in the budding yeast with binding affinities for all transcription factors with known DNA binding site sequences to assess the behavior of their chemical potentials .	A sizable fraction of transcription factors is apparently bound non-specifically to DNA and the observed abundances are marginally sufficient to ensure high occupations of the functional sites .
1	A long-standing puzzle is the low carrier mobility ( { \mu } ) in them as compared with corresponding bulk structures , which constitutes the main hurdle for realizing high-performance devices .	Two-dimensional semiconductors are structurally ideal channel materials for the ultimate atomic electronics after silicon era .	To address this issue , we perform combined experimental and theoretical study on atomically thin MoS2 field effect transistors with varying the number of MoS2 layers ( NLs ) .	Experimentally , an intimate relation is observed with a 10-fold degradation in { \mu } for extremely thinned monolayer channels .	To accurately describe the carrier scattering process and shed light on the origin of the thinning-induced mobility degradation , a generalized Coulomb scattering model is developed with strictly considering device configurative conditions , i.e. , asymmetric dielectric environments and lopsided carrier distribution .
1	The data set covers 42 contiguous cycles of the system orbital motion .	We report on the full analysis of a Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) Proportional Counter Array ( PCA ) monitoring of the { \gamma } -ray binary system LS I +61 303 .	Analyzing this X-ray monitoring dataset , the largest to date for this source , we report on the variability of the orbital profile and the spectral distribution , and provide strong evidence for an anti-correlation between flux and spectral index ( the higher the flux , the harder the spectral index ) .	Furthermore , we present the analysis of two newly discovered ks-timescale flares , which present significant variability also on shorter timescales , and tend to occur at orbital phases between 0.6-0.9 .	However , a detailed timing analysis of the flares does not show any coherent or quasi-coherent ( QPO ) structure in their power spectra .
2	There are two type of EDs : fan-shaped and halo-shaped .	With the observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard the \emph { Solar Dynamics Observatory } , we statistically investigate the emerging dimmings ( EDs ) of 24 isolated active regions ( IARs ) from June 2010 to May 2011 .	All the IARs present EDs in lower temperature lines ( e.g. , 171 { \AA } ) at their early emerging stages , meanwhile in higher temperature lines ( e.g. , 211 { \AA } ) , the ED regions brighten continuously .	There are 19 fan-shaped EDs and 5 halo-shaped ones .	The EDs appear several to more than ten hours delay to the first emergence of the IARs .
0	Given two irreducible curves of the plane which have isomorphic complements , it is natural to ask whether there exists an automorphism of the plane that sends one curve on the other .	This question has a positive answer for a large family of curves and H.Yoshihara conjectured that it is true in general .	We exhibit counterexamples to this conjecture , over any ground field .	In some of the cases , the curves are isomorphic and in others not ; this provides counterexamples of two different kinds .	Finally , we use our construction to find the existence of surprising non-linear automorphisms of affine surfaces .
1	It is then important to ask what such singular peaks imply , with or without the effects of other biological factors .	Under the effect of strong genetic drift , it is highly probable to observe gene fixation or gene loss in a population , shown by infinite peaks on a coherently constructed potential energy landscape .	We studied the stochastic escape time from the infinite potential peaks in the Wright-Fisher model , where the typical two-scale diffusion dynamics was observed via computer simulations .	We numerically found the average escape time for all the bi-stable cases and analytically approximated the results under weak mutations and selections by calculating the mean first passage time ( MFPT ) in singular potential peak .	Our results showed that Kramers ' classical escape formula can be extended to the models with non-Gaussian probability distributions , overcoming constraints in previous methods .
3	However , the GUT relation of the gaugino masses is broken unlike the case of minimal gauge mediation , and an NLSP other than the Bino ( especially the gluino NLSP ) becomes possible , relaxing the cosmological constraints .	A large class of non-minimal gauge mediation models , such as ( semi- ) direct gauge mediation , predict a hierarchy between the masses of the supersymmetric standard model gauginos and those of scalar particles .	We perform a comprehensive study of these non-minimal gauge mediation models , including mass calculations in semi-direct gauge mediation , to illustrate these features , and discuss the phenomenology of the models .	We point out that the cosmological gravitino problem places stringent constraints on mass splittings , when the Bino is the NLSP .	We also discuss the collider signals of the models .
4	We also discuss the extensions of this class of solutions to superstring theory and their relations to higher spin algebras in higher space-time dimensions .	We find a class of analytic solutions in open bosonic string field theory , parametrized by the chiral copy of higher spin algebra in $ AdS_3 $ .	The solutions are expressed in terms of the generating function for the products of Bell polynomials in derivatives of bosonic space-time coordinates $ X^m ( z ) $ of the open string , which form is determined in this work .	The products of these polynomials form a natural operator algebra realizations of $ W_\infty $ ( area-preserving diffeomorphisms ) , enveloping algebra of SU ( 2 ) and higher spin algebra in $ AdS_3 $ .	The class of SFT solutions found can , in turn , be interpreted as the `` enveloping of enveloping '' , or the enveloping of $ AdS_3 $ higher spin algebra .
1	These classes generalize all the known families of two- or three-parametric models solvable in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions to more general four-parametric classes involving three-parametric detuning modulation functions .	We derive five classes of quantum time-dependent two-state models solvable in terms of the double confluent Heun functions , five other classes solvable in terms of the biconfluent Heun functions , and a class solvable in terms of the triconfluent Heun functions .	The particular models derived describe different non-linear ( parabolic , cubic , sinh , cosh , etc . )	level-sweeping or level-glancing processes , double- or triple-level-crossing processes , as well as periodically repeated resonance-glancing or resonance-crossing processes .	We show that more classes can be derived using the equations obeyed by certain functions involving the derivatives of the confluent Heun functions .
2	Assuming that the channel is known to the receivers only , we show that BIA can achieve $ \frac { 2K } { K+2 } $ DoF , which surpasses the sum DoF achieved by previously known interference alignment schemes with delayed channel state information at transmitters ( CSIT ) .	In this letter , we present the first characterization for the achievable Degrees-of-Freedom ( DoF ) by Blind Interference Alignment ( BIA ) using staggered antenna switching in the $ K $ -user Gaussian Interference Channel .	In such scheme , each transmitter is equipped with one conventional antenna and each receiver is equipped with one reconfigurable ( multi-mode ) antenna .	This result implies that the sum DoF is upper bounded by 2 , which means that the best we can do with BIA is to double the DoF achieved by orthogonal multiple access schemes .	Moreover , we propose an algorithm to generate the transmit beamforming vectors and the reconfigurable antenna switching patterns , and apply this algorithm to the 4-user SISO Interference Channel , showing that $ \frac { 4 } { 3 } $ sum DoF is achievable .
4	It has been shown that the modified expression for the energy levels of hydrogenic atoms within such a pure bound field theory ( PBFT ) provides the same gross and fine structure of energy levels , like in the standard theory .	This paper continues the analysis of bound quantum systems started in ( T. Yarman , A.L .	Kholmetskii and O.V.Missevitch .	Going from classical to quantum description of bound charged particles .	Part 1 : basic concepts and assertions ) , based on a novel approach , involving the requirement of energy-momentum conservation for the bound electromagnetic ( EM ) field , when the EM radiation is forbidden .
1	The characteristics of PCR executed on a gel-based oligonucleotide microarray with immobilized forward primers and a single common reverse primer in solution were investigated for several DNA targets .	An approach for multiplex qualitative and quantitative microarray-based PCR analysis has been proposed .	One-stage multiplex on-chip PCR was studied for simultaneous amplification of herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 , cytomegalovirus DNA , and bacteriophage lambda DNA as an internal control .	Additionally the joint analysis of increased number of targets ( with addition of Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma hominis , and Ureaplasma urealyticum DNA ) was done in two-stage version of assay : first stage was in-tube PCR with target-specific primers , while the reverse ones contained 5'-adapter region ; the second stage was on-chip amplification with immobilized target-specific forward primers and adapter as common reverse primer in solution .	The possible application of one-stage reaction for human cDNA analysis was additionally demonstrated with utilization of a common poly-T-containing primer in solution .
1	Here we present a complete computation of these quantities within the Standard Model .	With initial and final particles on-shell , the anomalous weak-magnetic dipole moments of b and c quarks are electroweak gauge invariant quantities of the effective couplings Zb\bar { b } and Zc\bar { c } , respectively , and good candidates to test the Standard Model and/or new physics .	We show that decoupling properties with respect to heavy particles do take place in the weak magnetic moment .	The obtained values , a_b ( M_Z^2 ) = ( 2.98-1.56i ) x10^ ( -4 ) and a_c ( M_Z^2 ) = ( -2.80+1.09i ) x10^ ( -5 ) are dominated by one-gluon exchange diagrams .	The electroweak corrections are less than 1 % of the total magnitude .
4	Though most of the conclusions reached in Hawley 's earlier work on Schwarzschild black holes carry over to Kerr spacetime , the presence of frame dragging in the Kerr geometry adds an element of complexity to the simulations ; we have seen especially clear examples of this phenomenon in the accretion flows that arise from retrograde tori .	This paper presents results of three-dimensional simulations of global hydrodynamic instabilities in black hole tori , extending earlier work by Hawley to Kerr spacetimes .	This study probes a three-dimensional parameter space of torus angular momentum , torus size , and black hole angular momentum .	We have observed the growth of the Papaloizou-Pringle instability for a range of torus configurations and the resultant formation of m=1 planets .	We have also observed the quenching of this instability in the presence of early accretion flows ; however , in one simulation both early accretion and planet formation occurred .
2	The solutions of these equations using the method based on the extraction leading singularities of the amplitudes are obtained .	The relativistic five-quark equations are found in the framework of the dispersion relation technique .	The behavior of the low-energy five-particle amplitude is determined by its leading singularities in the pair invariant masses .	The mass spectra of nucleon and delta-isobar hybrid baryons are calculated .	The calculations of hybrid baryon amplitudes estimate the contributions of four subamplitudes .
3	We obtain the phase diagram in a magnetic field .	We investigate the magnetization process for a quasi-one-dimensional S=1 antiferromagnet with bond alternation .	By combining the density matrix renormalization group method with the interchain mean-field theory , we discuss how the interchain coupling affects the magnetization curve .	It is found that the width of the magnetization plateau is considerably reduced upon introducing the interchain coupling .	The effect of single-ion anisotropy is also addressed .
3	Mesoscopic quantum electrodynamics is therefore subject to `` doing quantum electrodynamics while thinking classically , '' allowing one to substitute essentally classical considerations for quantum ones without any loss in generality .	Quantum electrodynamics under conditions of distinguishability of interacting matter entities , and of controlled actions and back-actions between them , is considered .	Such `` mesoscopic quantum electrodynamics '' is shown to share its dynamical structure with the classical stochastic electrodynamics .	In formal terms , we demonstrate that all general relations of the mesoscopic quantum electrodynamics may be recast in a form lacking Planck 's constant .	Implications of these results for the quantum measurement theory are discussed .
0	A vast amount of textual web streams is influenced by events or phenomena emerging in the real world .	The social web forms an excellent modern paradigm , where unstructured user generated content is published on a regular basis and in most occasions is freely distributed .	The present Ph.D. Thesis deals with the problem of inferring information - or patterns in general - about events emerging in real life based on the contents of this textual stream .	We show that it is possible to extract valuable information about social phenomena , such as an epidemic or even rainfall rates , by automatic analysis of the content published in Social Media , and in particular Twitter , using Statistical Machine Learning methods .	An important intermediate task regards the formation and identification of features which characterise a target event ; we select and use those textual features in several linear , non-linear and hybrid inference approaches achieving a significantly good performance in terms of the applied loss function .
4	We then give the novel definition of radio cover time , namely , the expected time of a random walk to be heard ( as opposed to visit ) by all nodes .	In recent years , protocols that are based on the properties of random walks on graphs have found many applications in communication and information networks , such as wireless networks , peer-to-peer networks and the Web .	For wireless networks ( and other networks ) , graphs are actually not the correct model of the communication ; instead hyper-graphs better capture the communication over a wireless shared channel .	Motivated by this example , we study in this paper random walks on hyper-graphs .	First , we formalize the random walk process on hyper-graphs and generalize key notions from random walks on graphs .
2	These values are independent of the thickness of the channel and of the applied gate voltage .	We present the first thermoelectric measurements on pentacene field effect transistors .	We report high values of the Seebeck coefficient at room temperature between 240 and 500 micro V/K depending on the dielectric surface treatment .	Two contributions to the Seebeck coefficient are clearly identified : the expected contribution that is dependent on the position of the transport level and reflects the activated character of carrier generation , and an unexpected intrinsic contribution of 265 plus minus 40 micro V/K that is independent of the temperature and the treatment of the oxide surface .	This value corresponds to an unusually large lattice vibrational entropy of 3 kB per carrier .
1	This approach may be useful in several contexts including sensor networks .	We consider the problem of distributed dictionary learning , where a set of nodes is required to collectively learn a common dictionary from noisy measurements .	Diffusion cooperation schemes have been proposed to solve the distributed linear regression problem .	In this work we focus on a diffusion-based adaptive dictionary learning strategy : each node records observations and cooperates with its neighbors by sharing its local dictionary .	The resulting algorithm corresponds to a distributed block coordinate descent ( alternate optimization ) .
1	The backgrounds examined here include the cases of the M-wave and the M-Kaluza-Klein monopole .	We derive superalgebras in many types of supersymmetric M-brane backgrounds .	On the basis of the obtained algebras , we deduce all the supersymmetric non-orthogonal intersections of the M-Kaluza-Klein monopole and the M-5-brane at angles .	In addition , we present a 1/4 supersymmetric worldvolume 3-brane soliton on the M-5-brane in the M-5-brane background as an extended solution of the 3-brane solitons of the M-5-brane by Howe , Lambert and West .	This soliton can be interpreted as a certain intersection of three M-5-branes .
0	It is argued that irradiation in low-mass X-ray binaries ( LMXBs ) caused by accretion-generated X-rays can not only change the optical appearance of LMXBs but also their outburst properties and possibly also their long-term evolution .	Irradiation during an outburst of the outer parts of the accretion disc in a transient LMXB leads to drastic changes in the outburst properties .	As far as the secular evolution of such systems is concerned , these changes can result in enhanced loss of mass and angular momentum from the system and , most important , in neutron star LMXBs in a much less efficient use of the transferred matter to spin up the neutron star to a ms-pulsar .	Irradiation of the donor star can destabilize mass transfer and lead to irradiation-driven mass transfer cycles , i.e.to a secular evolution which differs drastically from an evolution in which irradiation is ignored .	It is argued that irradiation-driven mass transfer cycles can not occur in systems which are transient because of disc instabilities , i.e.in particular in long-period LMXBs with a giant donor .
3	For larger strangeness fractions , the calculated binding energy increases substantially beyond any previous calculation due to a phase transition into Sigma and Xi dominated matter .	The hyperon-hyperon potentials due to a recent SU ( 3 ) Nijmegen soft-core potential model are incorporated within a relativistic mean field calculation of strange hadronic matter .	We find considerably higher binding energy in bulk matter compared to several recent calculations which constrain the composition of matter .	For small strangeness fractions , matter is dominated by a composition of nucleons , Lambdas , and Xis , and the calculated binding energy closely follows that calculated by using the hyperon potentials of our previous calculations .	We also compare bulk matter calculations with finite system calculations , again highlighting the consequences of reducing the Coulomb destabilizing effects in finite strange systems .
2	Apart from the SRC , that are implemented through a Jastrow ansatz with a realistic correlation function , we incorporate the contribution from pion exchange and intermediate $ \Delta _ { 33 } $ currents .	The influence of short-range correlations ( SRC ) on the triple-coincidence ( e , e $ ' $ pp ) reactions is studied .	The non-relativistic model uses a mean-field potential to account for the distortions that the escaping particles undergo .	The ( e , e $ ' $ pp ) cross sections are predicted to exhibit a sizeable sensitivity to the SRC .	The contribution from the two-nucleon breakup channel to the semi-exclusive $ ^ { 12 } $ C ( e , e $ ' $ p ) cross section is calculated in the kinematics of a recent NIKHEF-K experiment .
3	At zero temperature , a high frequency peak in the dynamical conductivity appears above a `` Higgs mass '' gap , and corresponds to order parameter magnitude fluctuations .	Two dimensional hard core bosons suffer strong scattering in the high temperature resistive state at half filling .	The dynamical conductivity is calculated using non perturbative tools such as continued fractions , series expansions and exact diagonalization .	We find a large temperature range with linearly increasing resistivity and broad dynamical conductivity , signaling a breakdown of Boltzmann-Drude quasiparticle transport theory .	We discuss the apparent similarity between conductivity of hard core bosons and phenomenological characteristics of cuprates , including the universal scaling of Homes et.al .
1	This problem can be described with hundreds or even thousands of descriptors relevant to various molecular properties , most of them redundant and not relevant for the retention constant prediction .	In the current study we examine an application of the machine learning methods to model the retention constants in the thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) .	Hence we employed feature selection to significantly reduce the number of attributes .	Additionally we have tested application of the bagging procedure to the feature selection .	The random forest regression models were built using selected variables .
2	The associated clustering problem is as follows : Given n points in Re^d , find k points that minimize their average pairwise L1 distance .	This paper gives processor-allocation algorithms for minimizing the average number of communication hops between the assigned processors for grid architectures , in the presence of occupied cells .	The simpler problem of assigning processors on a free grid has been studied by Karp , McKellar , and Wong who show that the solutions have nontrivial structure ; they left open the complexity of the problem .	We present a natural approximation algorithm and show that it is a 7/4-approximation for 2D grids .	For d-dimensional space , the approximation guarantee is 2- ( 1/2d ) , which is tight .
0	We explore the use of the bispectrum for understanding quasiperiodic oscillations .	The bispectrum is a statistic which probes the relations between the relative phases of the Fourier spectrum at different frequencies .	The use of the bispectrum allows us to break the degeneracies between different models for time series which produce identical power spectra .	We look at data from several observations of GRS 1915+105 when the source shows strong quasi-periodic oscillations and strong broadband noise components in its power spectrum .	We show that , despite strong similarities in the power spectrum , the bispectra can differ strongly .
0	The \eta-meson collision with light nuclei , ^2H , ^3H , ^3He , and ^4He , is considered on the basis of a microscopic approach which utilises Faddeev type and Lippmann-Schwinger equations .	The nuclear hamiltonian is approximated by the finite rank approximation which amounts to the coherent approximation .	The \eta-nucleus scattering length and the resonance and bound -- state poles of the amplitude describing elastic scattering of \eta-meson by these nuclei are obtained .	For each of the nuclei considered , the minimal factor enhancing the \eta N -- attraction that moves the poles to the quasi -- bound state area of the complex k -- plane , is determined .	It is shown that within the existing uncertainties in the elementary \eta N iteraction all these nuclei can support a quasi -- bound state which can result in a formation of an eta-mesic nucleus .
2	Diffuse nucleosynthesis is studied through 26Al , 60Fe , and positron annihilation gamma-ray measurements .	Gamma-ray spectrometers with high spectral resolution have been operated in space since 2002 .	Major efforts to understand instrumental response and backgrounds are a requird before detailed science interpretations can be derived ; by now , high-resolution line-shape studies have resulted in significant astrophysical constraints , not only through studies of solar-flare details , but also for nuclear processes in the Galaxy : 44Ti from the Cas A supernova could only be detected in the low-energy lines at 68 and 78 keV , the 1157 keV line from the same decay is not seen ; this constrains 44Ti ejection in core collapse supernovae .	The gamma-ray line from decay of radioactive 26Al could be measured at unpredecented spectroscopic precision .	The new determination of the total mass of 26Al produced by stellar sources throughout the Galaxy yields 2.8 +/-0.9 M_solar , and the interstellar medium around 26Al sources appears characterized by velocities in the ~100 km s-1 region .
3	An example application , known as a Side Blind Zone Alert ( SBZA ) system , which monitors the blind zone of the vehicle and alerts the driver in a timely manner to prevent collisions , is discussed in this paper .	Due to the increasing number of sensors deployed in modern vehicles , Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks ( IVWSNs ) have recently received a lot of attention in the automotive industry as they can reduce the amount of wiring harness inside a vehicle .	By removing the wires , car manufacturers can reduce the weight of a vehicle and improve engine performance , fuel economy , and reliability .	In addition to these direct benefits , an IVWSN is a versatile platform that can support other vehicular applications as well .	The performance of the IVWSN-based SBZA system is evaluated via real experiments conducted on two test vehicles .
2	The optical polar vibrational modes of the nanocrystallites ( vibrons ) and their interaction with the electronic system are analized with the help of a continuum model satisfying both the mechanical and electrostatic matching conditions at the interface .	A theoretical model of resonant hyper-Raman scattering by an ensemble of spherical semiconductor quantum dots has been developed .	The electronic intermediate states are described as Wannier-Mott excitons in the framework of the envelope function approximation .	An explicit expression for the hyper-Raman scattering efficiency is derived , which is valid for incident two-photon energy close to the exciton resonances .	The dipole selection rules for optical transitions and Fr\ '' ohlich-like exciton-lattice interaction are derived : It is shown that only exciton states with total angular momentum $ L=0,1 $ and vibrational modes with angular momentum $ l_p=1 $ contribute to the hyper-Raman scattering process .
0	There has been substantial progress in recent years in the quantitative understanding of the nonequilibrium time evolution of quantum fields .	Important topical applications , in particular in high energy particle physics and cosmology , involve dynamics of quantum fields far away from the ground state or thermal equilibrium .	In these cases , standard approaches based on small deviations from equilibrium , or on a sufficient homogeneity in time underlying kinetic descriptions , are not applicable .	A particular challenge is to connect the far-from-equilibrium dynamics at early times with the approach to thermal equilibrium at late times .	Understanding the `` link '' between the early- and the late-time behavior of quantum fields is crucial for a wide range of phenomena .
3	For paths , we determine an optimal shortcut in linear time .	We seek to augment a geometric network in the Euclidean plane with shortcuts to minimize its continuous diameter , i.e. , the largest network distance between any two points on the augmented network .	Unlike in the discrete setting where a shortcut connects two vertices and the diameter is measured between vertices , we take all points along the edges of the network into account when placing a shortcut and when measuring distances in the augmented network .	We study this network augmentation problem for paths and cycles .	For cycles , we show that a single shortcut never decreases the continuous diameter and that two shortcuts always suffice to reduce the continuous diameter .
3	The meaning of these quantities is in general different from the commonly reported , but statistically meaningless expressions , `` lower limit '' , `` nominal value '' and `` upper limit '' of the total reaction rate .	Numerical values of charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for nuclei in the A=14 to 40 region are tabulated .	The results are obtained using a method , based on Monte Carlo techniques , that has been described in the preceding paper of this series ( Paper I ) .	We present a low rate , median rate and high rate which correspond to the 0.16 , 0.50 and 0.84 quantiles , respectively , of the cumulative reaction rate distribution .	In addition , we approximate the Monte Carlo probability density function of the total reaction rate by a lognormal distribution and tabulate the lognormal parameters { \mu } and { \sigma } at each temperature .
4	This paper proposes a hybrid text recognizer using a deep recurrent neural network with multiple layers of abstraction and long range context along with a language model to verify the performance of the deep neural network .	Deep LSTM is an ideal candidate for text recognition .	However text recognition involves some initial image processing steps like segmentation of lines and words which can induce error to the recognition system .	Without segmentation , learning very long range context is difficult and becomes computationally intractable .	Therefore , alternative soft decisions are needed at the pre-processing level .
4	Also , we show that if $ \varphi : \Mn\rightarrow \Mn $ is an additive map satisfying $ \varphi ( \A \B+\B \A ) =\A\varphi ( \B ) +\varphi ( \B ) \A \quad ( \A , \B \in \Mn ) $ , then $ \varphi ( \A ) =\A\varphi ( \textbf { 1 } ) $ for all $ \A\in \Mn $ , where $ \varphi ( \textbf { 1 } ) $ lies in the centre of $ \Mn $ .	Let $ \Mn $ be the ring of all $ n \times n $ matrices over a unital ring $ \mathcal { R } $ , let $ \mathcal { M } $ be a 2-torsion free unital $ \Mn $ -bimodule and let $ D : \Mn\rightarrow \mathcal { M } $ be an additive map .	We prove that if $ D ( \A ) \B+ \A D ( \B ) +D ( \B ) \A+ \B D ( \A ) =0 $ whenever $ \A , \B\in \Mn $ are such that $ \A\B=\B\A=0 $ , then $ D ( \A ) =\delta ( \A ) +\A D ( \textbf { 1 } ) $ , where $ \delta : \Mn\rightarrow \mathcal { M } $ is a derivation and $ D ( \textbf { 1 } ) $ lies in the centre of $ \mathcal { M } $ .	It is also shown that $ D $ is a generalized derivation if and only if $ D ( \A ) \B+ \A D ( \B ) +D ( \B ) \A+ \B D ( \A ) -\A D ( \textbf { 1 } ) \B-\B D ( \textbf { 1 } ) \A=0 $ whenever $ \A\B=\B\A=0 $ .	We apply this results to provide that any ( generalized ) Jordan derivation from $ \Mn $ into a 2-torsion free $ \Mn $ -bimodule ( not necessarily unital ) is a ( generalized ) derivation .
4	The differences in ignition delay times between the dedicated hydrogen mechanisms ( O'Conaire , Li and Konnov ) range from approximately a maximum factor of 2 for the H2-air cases , to more than a factor 5 for the H2/O2/AR cases .	This paper provides detailed comparisons of chemical reaction mechanisms of H2 applicable at high preheat temperatures and pressures relevant to gas turbine and particularly Alstom 's reheat gas turbine conditions .	It is shown that the available reaction mechanisms exhibit large differences in several important elementary reaction coefficients .	The reaction mechanisms are assessed by comparing ignition delay and laminar flame speed results obtained from CHEMKIN with available data , however , the amount of data at these conditions is scarce and a recommended candidate among the mechanisms can presently not be selected .	Generally , the results with the GRI-Mech and Leeds mechanisms deviate from the Davis , Li , O'Conaire , Konnov and San Diego mechanisms , but there are also significant deviations between the latter five mechanisms that altogether are better adapted to hydrogen .
3	The abundance analysis presented here is based on the direct calculation of the electron temperature Te and yields an oxygen abundance of 12+log ( O/H ) = 8.28+/-0.02 .	We present results of NTT spectroscopy of the one known planetary nebula ( PN ) in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Fornax , a gas-deficient Local Group galaxy that stopped its star formation activity a few hundred million years ago .	We detected the [ OIII ] 4363 line with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~22 .	For the first time we detected the weak [ SII ] 6717,6731 lines ( I ( 6717+6731 ) ~0.01 I ( Hbeta ) ) , determined the electron number density ( Ne ( SII ) = 750 cm^-3 ) , and calculated O , N , Ne , Ar , S , Cl , Fe , He and C abundances .	The analysis of the O , Ne , Ar and S abundances shows that the original ISM oxygen abundance was 0.27+/-0.10 dex lower and that third-dredge-up self-pollution in oxygen took place .
0	A common approach for introducing security at the physical layer is to rely on the channel variations of the wireless environment .	This type of approach is not always suitable for wireless networks where the channel remains static for most of the network lifetime .	For these scenarios , a channel independent physical layer security measure is more appropriate which will rely on a secret known to the sender and the receiver but not to the eavesdropper .	In this paper , we propose CD-PHY , a physical layer security technique that exploits the constellation diversity of wireless networks which is independent of the channel variations .	The sender and the receiver use a custom bit sequence to constellation symbol mapping to secure the physical layer communication which is not known a priori to the eavesdropper .
1	Convection is computed using large eddy simulations .	We have developed a multidimensional radiation hydrodynamics code to simulate the interaction of radial stellar pulsation and convection for full amplitude pulsating models .	Here we perform three-dimensional simulations of RR Lyrae stars for comparison with previously reported two-dimensional simulations .	We find that the time dependent behavior of the peak convective flux on pulsation phase is very similar in both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional calculations .	The growth rates of the pulsation in the two-dimensional calculations are about $ 0.1\ % $ higher than in the three-dimensional calculations.The amplitude of the light curve for a 6500 K RR Lyrae model is essentially the same for our 2D and 3D calculations , as is the rising light curve .
4	Indium atomic wire , however , displays only marginal preference towards the formation of symmetric dimers staying close to the metallic limit .	Electronic structure calculations for atomic wire of metals like Al , Ga and In are performed for a patterned dihydrogeneted Si ( 001 ) :1 $ \times $ 1 in search of structures with metallic behavior .	The dihydrogeneted Si ( 001 ) is patterned by depassivating hygrozen atoms only from one row of Si atoms along the [ 1 $ \bar { 1 } $ 0 ] direction .	Various structures of adsorbed metals and their electronic properties are examined .	It is found that Al and Ga atomic wire structures with metallic property are strongly unstable towards the formation of buckled metal dimers leading to semiconducting behavior .
1	The field reaches the following limiting AB magnitudes : B~25.3 , V~24.8 and R~25.1 and contains about 50000 extended sources in the AB magnitude range 18 & lt ; R & lt ; 25 .	We present the Capodimonte Deep Field ( OACDF ) , a deep field covering an area of 0.5 square degrees in the B , V , R optical bands plus six medium-band filters in the wavelength range 773 -- 913 nm .	Hence , it is intermediate between deep pencil beam surveys and very wide but shallow surveys .	The main scientific goal of the OACDF is the identification and characterization of early-type field galaxies at different look-back times in order to study different scenarios of galaxy formation .	Parallel goals include the search for groups and clusters of galaxies and the search for rare and peculiar objects ( gravitational lenses , QSOs , halo White Dwarfs ) .
4	We study the dependence of the optimal solution on the choice of the risk aversion criterion .	We solve a version of the optimal trade execution problem when the mid asset price follows a displaced diffusion .	Optimal strategies in the adapted class under various risk criteria , namely value-at-risk , expected shortfall and a new criterion called `` squared asset expectation '' ( SAE ) , related to a version of the cost variance measure , are derived and compared .	It is well known that displaced diffusions ( DD ) exhibit dynamics which are in-between arithmetic Brownian motions ( ABM ) and geometric Brownian motions ( GBM ) depending of the choice of the shift parameter .	Furthermore , DD allows for changes in the support of the mid asset price distribution , allowing one to include a minimum permitted value for the mid price , either positive or negative .
0	We study the stability of circular orbits of the electromagnetic two-body problem in an electromagnetic setting that includes retarded and advanced interactions .	We give a method to derive the equations of tangent dynamics about circular orbits up to nonlinear terms and we derive the linearized equations explicitly .	In particular we study the normal modes of the linearized dynamics that have an arbitrarily large imaginary eigenvalue .	These large imaginary eigenvalues define fast frequencies that introduce a fast ( stiff ) timescale into the dynamics .	As an application of Dirac 's electrodynamics of point charges with retarded-only interactions , we study the conditions for the two charges to perform a fast gyrating motion of small radius about a circular orbit .
4	This is illustrated by a special case of a two-scale Cantor dust .	A simple multifractal coarsening model is suggested that can explain the observed dynamical behavior of the fractal dimension in a wide range of coarsening fractal systems .	It is assumed that the minority phase ( an ensemble of droplets ) at $ t=0 $ represents a non-uniform recursive fractal set , and that this set is a geometrical multifractal characterized by a $ f ( \alpha ) $ -curve .	It is assumed that the droplets shrink according to their size and preserving their ordering .	It is shown that at early times the Hausdorff dimension does not change with time , whereas at late times its dynamics follow the $ f ( \alpha ) $ curve .
2	We show that the progenitor halo masses of UFDs can be as low as Mvir = 10^7 Msun .	New observations indicate that ultrafaint dwarf galaxies ( UFD ) -- the least luminous systems bound by dark matter halos ( & lt ; 10^5 Lsun ) -- may have formed before reionization .	The extrapolated virial masses today are uncertain with estimates ranging from 10^8 Msun to 10^9 Msun .	Under the right conditions , such a halo can survive the energy input of a supernova and its radiative progenitor .	A clumpy medium is much less susceptible to both internal and external injections of energy .
0	The last two years have seen an impressive improvement in the determination of $ |V_ { ub } | $ , especially from inclusive decays .	The error on $ |V_ { ub } | $ measured with inclusive decays was reduced from 18 % ( PDG 2004 ) to 8 % ( PDG 2006 ) .	This progress is a result of combined experimental and theoretical efforts .	In this talk , the theoretical framework ( BLNP ) that enabled such progress is reviewed , as well as other approaches to an inclusive determination of $ |V_ { ub } | $ ( DGE , $ M_X-q^2 $ etc . ) .	The prospects of improving $ |V_ { ub } | $ are discussed , addressing issues of weak annihilation , implications of leptonic B decays , and determination of $ |V_ { ub } | $ with exclusive decays .
3	Our aim is to realize the operator algebra of quasibosons composed of two fermions or two q-fermions ( q-deformed fermions ) by the respective operators of deformed oscillators , the widely studied objects .	Composite bosons , here called { \it quasibosons } ( e.g.mesons , excitons , etc .	) , occur in various physical situations .	Quasibosons differ from bosons or fermions as their creation and annihilation operators obey non-standard commutation relations , even for the `` fermion+fermion '' composites .	For this , the restrictions on quasiboson creation/annihilation operators and on the deformed oscillator ( deformed boson ) algebra are obtained .
4	Assuming a fragmentation-limited background dust population , we developed a Monte Carlo approach that follows single monomers as they move through a vertical column of gas and become incorporated in different aggregates as they undergo sticking and fragmenting collisions .	In protoplanetary disks , the distribution and abundance of small ( sub ) micron grains are important for a range of physical and chemical processes .	For example , they dominate the optical depth at short wavelengths and their surfaces are the sites of many important chemical reactions such as the formation of water .	Based on their aerodynamical properties ( i.e. , their strong dynamical coupling with the surrounding gas ) it is often assumed that these small grains are well-mixed with the gas .	Our goal is to study the vertical ( re ) distribution of grains taking into account settling , turbulent diffusion , as well as collisions with other dust grains .
2	Most planetary events yield a measurement of the angular Einstein radius \theta_e .	I show that for a substantial fraction of planets detected in a space-based survey , it would be possible to measure the planet and host masses and distances , if the survey satellite were placed in geosynchronous orbit .	Such an orbit would enable measurement of the microlens parallax , \pi_e , for events with moderately low impact parameters , \beta & lt ; ~ 0.05 , which encompass a disproportionate share of planetary detections .	Since the host mass is given by M=\theta_e/\kappa\pi_e where \kappa\ is a constant , parallax measurements are the crucial missing link .	I present simple analytic formulae that enable quick error estimates for observatories in circular orbits of arbitrary period and semi-major axis , and arbitrary orientation relative to the line of sight .
4	We also discuss a possibility to get a complete set of gauge invariants which allow an actual dependence on the string zero modes .	An open bosonic string is considered with the aim to construct a general gauge invariant , being a polynomial of Fubini-Veneziano ( FV ) fields .	The FV fields are transformed as 1-forms on $ S^1 $ , that allows to formulate the problem in geometric terms .	We introduce a most general anzats for these invariants and explicitly resolve the invariance conditions in the framework of the anzats .	The invariants are interpreted as integrals of n-form over a gauge invariant domains in an n-dimensional torus , where the invariance of these domains is considered with respect to the action of the diagonal of the group $ \times ( Diff~S^1 ) ^n $ .
2	In the soft handoff scenario studied here , both macrocell and microcell base stations serve each system user and the two received copies of a desired user 's signal are summed using maximal ratio combining .	This paper examines the effect of soft handoff on the uplink user capacity of a CDMA system consisting of a single macrocell in which a single hotspot microcell is embedded .	The users of these two base stations operate over the same frequency band .	Exact and approximate analytical methods are developed to compute uplink user capacity .	Simulation results demonstrate a 20 % increase in user capacity compared to hard handoff .
4	However , the maxima in the amplitudes are not related to the underlying flux in the burst .	We present a comprehensive observational and theoretical analysis of the amplitudes and profiles of oscillations that occur during thermonuclear X-ray bursts from weakly-magnetized neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries .	Our sample contains 59 oscillations from six sources observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer .	The oscillations that we examined occurred primarily during the decaying portions of bursts , and lasted for several seconds each .	We find that the oscillations are as large as 15 % during the declines of the bursts , and they appear and disappear due to intrinsic variations in their fractional amplitudes .
4	Pinning of orbits allows for their controlled positioning -- they can be transported by the motion of the vortex lines .	Electromagnetic waves with phase defects in the form of vortex lines combined with a constant magnetic field are shown to pin down cyclotron orbits ( Landau orbits in the quantum mechanical setting ) of charged particles at the location of the vortex .	This effect manifests itself in classical theory as a trapping of trajectories and in quantum theory as a Gaussian shape of the localized wave functions .	Analytic solutions of the Lorentz equation in the classical case and of the Schr\ '' odinger or Dirac equations in the quantum case are exhibited that give precise criteria for the localization of the orbits .	There is a range of parameters where the localization is destroyed by the parametric resonance .
2	energies of 500 GeV and 1 TeV .	We perform a detailed study of the process $ e^+e^-\to\gamma\nu_l\bar\nu_l $ and its sensitivity to anomalous gauge boson couplings of the $ \gamma WW $ vertex .	We concentrate on LEP II energies , $ \sqrt { s } =200 $ GeV , and energies appropria- te to the proposed Next Linear Collider ( NLC ) high energy $ e^+e^- $ collider with c.m .	At 200 GeV , the process offers , at best , a consistency check of other processes being considered at LEP-200 .	At 500 GeV , the parameters $ \kappa_\gamma $ and $ \lambda_\gamma $ can be measured to about $ \pm 0.05 $ and $ \pm 0.1 $ respectively at 95\ % C.L .
2	Our goal is to model the relationship between the energy intake derived from Food Frequency Questionnaires ( FFQs ) and the energy expenditure estimated from the doubly labeled water method .	Previous likelihood-based linear modeling of nutritional data has been limited by the availability of software that allows flexible error structures in the data .	We demonstrate the use of a Bayesian modeling approach to the analysis of such data .	We consider models with different distributions for the FFQ energy intake .	The models include previously identified covariates describing social desirability , education and their possible interaction that are felt to impact the reported FFQ .
4	In addition , I also study the radial geodesics and obtain the solutions of some particular cases .	When dealing with a spacetime , one usually searches for singularities , black holes , white holes and wormholes due to their importance to the motion of particles .	There is a family of solution of the Brans-Dicke vacuum equations that has not been fully studied from this perspective .	In this paper , I study some properties of this family and find the complete set of solutions that avoids singularity at the point where the metric diverges or degenerates .	The possible changes in the metric signature when passing through this point is analyzed .
3	This paper focuses on the distributed reconstruction of a time-varying bandlimited graph signal based on observations sampled at a subset of selected nodes .	The rapid development of signal processing on graphs provides a new perspective for processing large-scale data associated with irregular domains .	In many practical applications , it is necessary to handle massive data sets through complex networks , in which most nodes have limited computing power .	Designing efficient distributed algorithms is critical for this task .	A distributed least square reconstruction ( DLSR ) algorithm is proposed to recover the unknown signal iteratively , by allowing neighboring nodes to communicate with one another and make fast updates .
3	We find that the network robustness is only improved above a critical cooperation range .	A robust worldwide air-transportation network ( WAN ) is one that minimizes the number of stranded passengers under a sequence of airport closures .	Building on top of this realistic example , here we address how spatial network robustness can profit from cooperation between local actors .	We swap a series of links within a certain distance , a cooperation range , while following typical constraints of spatially embedded networks .	Such improvement can be described in the framework of a continuum transition , where the critical exponents depend on the spatial correlation of connected nodes .
4	The values of the critical exponents ( { \nu } , { \alpha } , { \beta } and { \gamma } ) are estimated within the framework of the finite-size scaling theory and power law relations for selected D/J values ( -2 , 0 , 1 , 2 and 4 ) .	The mixed spin 3- spin 3/2 Ising model has been simulated using cooling algorithm on cellular automaton ( CA ) .	The simulations have been made in the interval -6 & lt ; =D & lt ; =6 for J=1 for the square lattices with periodic boundary conditions .	The ground state phase diagram of the model has different type ferrimagnetic orderings .	Through D/J=2 line , compensation points occurs at kT/J=0 .
0	We use the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to study the nonlinear evolutions of inhomogeneous spacetimes during inflation in generalized gravity .	We find the exact solutions to the lowest order Hamilton-Jacobi equation for special scalar potentials and introduce an approximation method for general potentials .	The conserved quantity invariant under a change of timelike hypersurfaces proves useful in dealing with gravitational perturbations .	In the long-wavelength approximation , we find a conserved quantity related to the new canonical variable that makes the Hamiltonian density vanish , and calculate the non-Gaussianity in generalized gravity .	The slow-roll inflation models with a single scalar field in generalized gravity predict too small non-Gaussianity to be detected by future CMB experiments .
0	In `` A new proof of the completeness of the Lukasiewicz axioms '' } ( Transactions of the American Mathematical Society , 88 ) C.C .	Chang proved that any totally ordered $ MV $ -algebra $ A $ was isomorphic to the segment $ A \cong \Gamma ( A^* , u ) $ of a totally ordered $ l $ -group with strong unit $ A^* $ .	This was done by the simple intuitive idea of putting denumerable copies of $ A $ on top of each other ( indexed by the integers ) .	Moreover , he also show that any such group $ G $ can be recovered from its segment since $ G \cong \Gamma ( G , u ) ^* $ , establishing an equivalence of categories .	In `` Interpretation of AF $ C^* $ -algebras in Lukasiewicz sentential calculus '' ( J. Funct.Anal.Vol .
2	We show that the Kleisli categories of many common monads are categories of this kind .	We introduce a general categorical framework for the definition of weak behavioural equivalences , building on and extending recent results in the field .	This framework is based on parametrized saturation categories , i.e.categories whose hom-sets are endowed with complete orders and a suitable iteration operators ; this structure allows us to provide the abstract definitions of various ( weak ) behavioural equivalence .	This allows us to readily instantiate the abstract definitions to a wide range of existing systems ( weighted LTS , Segala systems , calculi with names , etc .	) , recovering the corresponding notions of weak behavioural equivalences .
4	Detectors with high sensitivity at frequencies greater than ~4-5 kHz would be well suited for this kind of sources .	We consider the emission of gravitational waves in the two proposed models for the collapse of a massive star to a black hole : the prompt collapse , in which nearly all the star collapses to a black hole in a dynamical time scale , and the delayed collapse , in which a light black hole , or a neutron star , which subsequently accretes matter , forms due to the fall-back achieving , in the neutron star case , the critical mass for black hole formation .	Recent simulations strongly support this last scenario .	We show that , due to the slowness of fall-back , in the delayed collapse the main burst of gravitational radiation is emitted depending on the parameters , mass and angular momentum , of the initial , light , black hole .	We estimate , under different assumptions , the detectability of the emitted gravitational waves showing that such kind of collapse is not particularly suited for detection by forthcoming interferometric detectors .
4	The intracluster medium has already reached the metallicity of present-day clusters .	Combined HST , X-ray , and ground-based optical studies show that clusters of galaxies are largely `` in place '' by $ z \sim 1 $ , an epoch when the Universe was less than half its present age .	High resolution images show that elliptical , S0 , and spiral galaxies are present in clusters at redshifts up to $ z \sim 1.3 $ .	Analysis of the CMDs suggest that the cluster ellipticals formed their stars several Gyr earlier , near redshift 3 .	The morphology -- density relation is well established at $ z\sim1 $ , with star-forming spirals and irregulars residing mostly in the outer parts of the clusters and E/S0s concentrated in dense clumps .
4	We formulate the regularization also in terms of the algebraic Bethe ansatz method .	For the one-dimensional XXX model under the periodic boundary conditions , we discuss two types of eigenvectors , regular eigenvectors which have finite-valued rapidities satisfying the Bethe ansatz equations , and non-regular eigenvectors which are descendants of some regular eigenvectors under the action of the SU ( 2 ) spin-lowering operator .	It was pointed out by many authors that the non-regular eigenvectors should correspond to the Bethe ansatz wavefunctions which have multiple infinite rapidities .	However , it has not been explicitly shown whether such a delicate limiting procedure should be possible .	In this paper , we discuss it explicitly in the level of wavefunctions : we prove that any non-regular eigenvector of the XXX model is derived from the Bethe ansatz wavefunctions through some limit of infinite rapidities .
4	The differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is more appropriate to model population dynamics that is not well described by drift and diffusion alone .	Diffusion processes have been applied with great success to model the dynamics of large populations throughout science , in particular biology .	One advantage is that they bridge two different scales : the microscopic and the macroscopic one .	Diffusion is a mathematical idealisation , however : it assumes vanishingly small state changes at the microscopic level .	In real biological systems this is often not the case .
1	Therefore , curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales are generically not conserved .	We first point out that generic Horndeski theories in a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background are non-adiabatic .	Nevertheless , we show that the re-scaled Mukhanov-Sasaki variable is conserved implying a constraint equation for the Newtonian potential .	In the general case , the super-horizon Newtonian potential can potentially grow to very large values after inflation exit .	If that happens , inflationary predictability is lost during the oscillating period .
0	We introduce a multivariate diffusion model that is able to price derivative securities featuring multiple underlying assets .	Each asset volatility smile is modeled according to a density-mixture dynamical model while the same property holds for the multivariate process of all assets , whose density is a mixture of multivariate basic densities .	This allows to reconcile single name and index/basket volatility smiles in a consistent framework .	Our approach could be dubbed a multidimensional local volatility approach with vector-state dependent diffusion matrix .	The model is quite tractable , leading to a complete market and not requiring Fourier techniques for calibration and dependence measures , contrary to multivariate stochastic volatility models such as Wishart .
1	To do so , ( i ) the distribution of local fibre volume fraction for each tow is experimentaly determined by estimation of each pair of local areal density and thickness , ( ii ) the Kozeny-Carmen equation together with the change of variable technique are used to compute the PDF of permeability , ( iii ) using the local values of fibre volume fraction , the distribution of local average permeability is computed and subsequently the goodness of fit of the computed PDF is compared with the distribution of the permeability at microscale level .	This study addresses the issue of whether or not a normal distribution appropriately represents permeability variations .	Finally variability of local permeability at the microscale level is determined .	The first set of results reveals that ( 1 ) the relationship between the local areal density and local thickness in a woven carbon-epoxy composite is modelled by a bivariate normal distribution , ( 2 ) while fibre volume fraction follows a normal distribution , permeability follows a gamma distribution , ( 3 ) this work also shows that there is significant agreement between the analytical approach and the simulation results .	The second set of results shows that the coefficient of variation of permeability is one order of magnitude larger than that of fibre volume fraction .
0	Conformal higher spin ( CHS ) field theory , which is a solid part of recent advanced checks of AdS/CFT correspondence , finds applications in cosmology .	Hidden sector of weakly interacting CHS fields suggests a resolution of the hierarchy problem in the model of initial conditions for inflationary cosmology driven by a conformal field theory .	These initial conditions are set by thermal garland type cosmological instantons in the sub-planckian energy range for the model of CHS fields with a large positive coefficient $ \beta $ of the Gauss-Bonnet term in their total conformal anomaly and a large number of their polarizations $ \mathbb { N } $ .	The upper bound of this range $ M_P/\sqrt\beta $ is shown to be much lower than the gravitational cutoff $ M_P/\sqrt\mathbb { N } $ which is defined by the requirement of smallness of the perturbatively nonrenormalizable graviton loop contributions .	In this way we justify the approximation scheme in which the nonrenormalizable graviton sector is subject to effective field theory under this cutoff , whereas the renormalizable sector of multiple CHS fields is treated beyond perturbation theory and dynamically generates the bound on the inflation scale of the CFT cosmology $ M_P/\sqrt\beta\ll M_P/\sqrt\mathbb { N } $ .
2	The experiment had significant systematic effects caused by the rotation of the apparatus which were only partly analysed and taken into account .	A recent experiment by Antonini et.al . [ Phys.Rev .	A { \bf 71 } , 050101R 2005 ] , set new limits on Lorentz violating parameters in the frame-work of the photon sector of the Standard Model Extension ( SME ) , $ \tilde { \kappa } _ { e- } ^ { ZZ } $ , and the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl ( RMS ) framework , $ \beta-\delta-1/2 $ .	We show that this is insufficient to put a bound on $ \tilde { \kappa } _ { e- } ^ { ZZ } $ and the bound on $ \beta-\delta-1/2 $ represents a five-fold improvement not a ten-fold improvement as claimed .

4	We demonstrated that suppression of coalescence arises from coverage of interfaces by nanoparticles .	We investigated the formation of cocontinuous structures in polymer blends .	These polymeric bijels ( bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels ) were composed of polystyrene oligomer , polybutene and fluorescent hydrophobic silica nanoparticles .	A micron-sized cocontinuous morphology was stabilized by a monolayer of silica nanoparticles at the interface .	Real-time observation of coalescence dynamics in co-continuous polymer blends stabilized by interfacial particles was for the first time achieved via laser scanning confocal microscopy .
2	The neighbourhood grammar allows to select correct syntax diagrams from the set of all syntax diagrams on the given alphabet by mapping an each correct diagram to the cover consisted of the grammar 's neighbourhoods .	The method of constructing of Grothendieck 's topology basing on a neighbourhood grammar , defined on the category of syntax diagrams is described in the article .	Syntax diagrams of a formal language are the multigraphs with nodes , signed by symbols of the language 's alphabet .	Such the cover gives rise to Grothendieck 's topology on category of correct syntax diagrams extended by neighbourhoods ' diagrams .	An each object of the category may be mapped to the set of meanings ( abstract senses ) of this syntax construction .
1	The cubic selenide phase is insulating and its resistivity crosses over from $ \ln { \rho } \sim T^ { -1 } $ to $ \sim T^ { -1/2 } $ on cooling below 150 K , indicating variable range hopping ( VRH ) conduction at low temperatures .	We report resistivity , thermopower and magnetic susceptibility measurements on the Nb $ _4 $ -cluster compounds Ga $ _ { 1.33 } $ Nb $ _4 $ X $ _ { 8 } $ ( X = S , Se ) , derived from vacancy ordered spinels A $ _x $ T $ _4 $ X $ _8 $ .	This is similar to that previously reported for V $ _4 $ and Mo $ _4 $ cluster compounds .	The rhombohedrally distorted sulfide is metallic and shows a minimum in resistance at $ \sim $ 56 K below which the resistivity varies as $ \rho ( T ) \sim T^ { -1/2 } $ .	The thermopower of the selenide becomes temperature independent below the crossover temperature .
0	We describe the Voevodsky 's category $ DM^ { eff } _ { gm } $ of motives in terms of Suslin complexes of smooth projective varieties .	This shows that Voeovodsky 's $ DM_ { gm } $ is anti-equivalent to Hanamura 's one .	We give a description of any triangulated subcategory of $ DM^ { eff } _ { gm } $ ( including the category of effective mixed Tate motives ) .	We descibe 'truncation ' functors $ t_N $ for $ N & gt ; 0 $ .	$ t=t_0 $ generalizes the weight complex of Soule and Gillet ; its target is $ K^b ( Chow_ { eff } ) $ ; it calculates $ K_0 ( DM^ { eff } _ { gm } ) $ , and checks whether a motive is a mixed Tate one .
2	Let n be a natural integer and let e= [ e_1 , ... , e_l ] be a partition of n. Denote by X^e the set of l-tuples ( P_1 , ... , P_l ) of distinct nonsingular curvilinear infinitely near points of X of orders ( e_1 , ... , e_l ) .	Let X be a singular real rational surface obtained from a smooth real rational surface by performing weighted blow-ups .	Denote by Aut ( X ) the group of algebraic automorphisms of X into itself .	We show that the group Aut ( X ) acts transitively on X^e .	This statement generalizes earlier work where the case of the trivial partition e= [ 1 , ... ,1 ] was treated under the supplementary condition that X is nonsingular .
0	Global return value estimates of significant wave height and 10-m neutral wind speed are estimated from very large aggregations of archived ECMWF ensemble forecasts at +240-h lead time from the period 2003-2012 .	The upper percentiles are found to match ENVISAT wind speed better than ERA-Interim ( ERA-I ) , which tends to be biased low .	The return estimates are significantly higher for both wind speed and wave height in the extratropics and the subtropics than what is found from ERA-I , but lower than what is reported by Caires and Sterl ( 2005 ) and Vinoth and Young ( 2011 ) .	The highest discrepancies between ERA-I and ENS240 are found in the hurricane-prone areas , suggesting that the ensemble comes closer than ERA-I in capturing the intensity of tropical cyclones .	The width of the confidence intervals are typically reduced by 70 % due to the size of the data sets .
0	Understanding the chemical evolution in star-forming cores is a necessary pre-condition to correctly assess physical conditions when using molecular emission .	We follow the evolution of chemistry and molecular line profiles through the entire star formation process , including a self-consistent treatment of dynamics , dust continuum radiative transfer , gas energetics , chemistry , molecular excitation , and line radiative transfer .	In particular , the chemical code follows a gas parcel as it falls toward the center , passing through regimes of density , dust temperature , and gas temperature that are changing both because of the motion of the parcel and the evolving luminosity of the central source .	We combine a sequence of Bonnor-Ebert spheres and the inside-out collapse model to describe dynamics from the pre-protostellar stage to later stages .	The overall structures of abundance profiles show complex behavior that can be understood as interactions between freeze-out and evaporation of molecules .
0	Euclidean preferences are a widely studied preference model , in which decision makers and alternatives are embedded in d-dimensional Euclidean space .	Decision makers prefer those alternatives closer to them .	This model , also known as multidimensional unfolding , has applications in economics , psychometrics , marketing , and many other fields .	We study the problem of deciding whether a given preference profile is d-Euclidean .	For the one-dimensional case , polynomial-time algorithms are known .
4	Nevertheless , the magnitude of a graph is not determined by its Tutte polynomial , nor even by its cycle matroid , and it therefore carries information that they do not .	The magnitude of a graph is one of a family of cardinality-like invariants extending across mathematics ; it is a cousin to Euler characteristic and geometric measure .	Among its cardinality-like properties are multiplicativity with respect to cartesian product and an inclusion-exclusion formula for the magnitude of a union .	Formally , the magnitude of a graph is both a rational function over Q and a power series over Z .	It shares features with one of the most important of all graph invariants , the Tutte polynomial ; for instance , magnitude is invariant under Whitney twists when the points of identification are adjacent .
3	For a 4-unit cell device , all of the four absorption peaks can be optimized with efficiencies higher than 95 % .	We propose an efficient multiband absorber comprising a truncated one-dimensional periodic metal-dielectric photonic crystal and a reflective substrate .	The reflective substrate is actually an optically thick metallic film .	Such a planar device is easier to fabricate compared with the absorbers with complicated shapes .	Moreover , those absorption peaks are insensitive to both polarization and incident angle .
1	Among these problems are Satisfiability , Vertex Cover , Hamilton Path , Mod6-SAT , Majority-of-Majority-SAT , and Tautologies , to name a few .	A fertile area of recent research has demonstrated concrete polynomial time lower bounds for solving natural hard problems on restricted computational models .	The proofs of these lower bounds follow a certain proof-by-contradiction strategy that we call alternation-trading .	An important open problem is to determine how powerful such proofs can possibly be .	We propose a methodology for studying these proofs that makes them amenable to both formal analysis and automated theorem proving .
1	On the contrary Kaluza-Klein ( KK ) compactification of extra spatial dimensions can geometrically realize the gauge boson mass generation without invoking a fundamental Higgs scalar .	Unitarity of the 4d standard model is ensured by the conventional Higgs mechanism with a fundamental spin-0 Higgs boson , responsible for gauge boson mass-generations .	We reveal that massive gauge boson scattering in the compactified theories is unitary at low energies , and the unitarity violation is { \it delayed } to the intrinsic ultraviolet ( UV ) scale of the higher dimensional gauge theory .	We demonstrate that this is a generic consequence of the `` geometric Higgs mechanism '' ( GHM ) , manifested via Kaluza-Klein equivalence theorem ( KK-ET ) .	We further show that the presence of many gauge KK states below the UV cutoff scale imposes strong bounds on the highest KK level ( N_KK ) .
4	Our analysis suggests that the conventional gas and star threshold is not adequate for analyzing stability of the two-component discs when turbulence is considered .	Gravitational stability of a disc consisting of the gaseous and the stellar components are studied in the linear regime when the gaseous component is turbulent .	A phenomenological approach is adopted to describe the turbulence , in which not only the effective surface density but the velocity dispersion of the gaseous component are both scale-dependent as power-law functions of the wavenumber of the perturbations .	Also , the stellar component which has gravitational interaction with the gas is considered as a fluid .	We calculate growth rate of the perturbations and in the most of the studied cases , the stability of the disc highly depends on the existence of the stars and the exponents of the functions for describing the turbulence .
1	Certain permutiple problems , particularly transposable , cyclic , and , more recently , palintiple numbers , have been well-studied .	A permutiple is the product of a digit preserving multiplication , that is , a number which is an integer multiple of some permutation of its digits .	In this paper we study the problem of general digit preserving multiplication .	We show how the digits and carries of a permutiple are related and utilize these relationships to develop methods for finding new permutiple examples from old .	In particular , we shall focus on the problem of finding new permutiples from a known example having the same set of digits .
2	Sensory input , however , is only one factor that influences neural activity .	Thalamic relay cells fire action potentials that transmit information from retina to cortex .	The amount of information that spike trains encode is usually estimated from the precision of spike timing with respect to the stimulus .	For example , intrinsic dynamics , such as oscillations of networks of neurons , also modulate firing pattern .	Here , we asked if retinal oscillations might help to convey information to neurons downstream .
3	Furthermore , it calculates the whole temperature range 1.2 & lt ; T & lt ; 4.7 using only 2.2 times more computer effort than the Histogram Monte Carlo method for the range 2.1 & lt ; T & lt ; 2.2 .	We propose a way of implementing the Broad Histogram Monte Carlo method to systems with continuous degrees of freedom , and we apply these ideas to investigate the three-dimensional XY-model with periodic boundary conditions .	We have found an excellent agreement between our method and traditional Metropolis results for the energy , the magnetization , the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility on a very large temperature range .	For the calculation of these quantities in the temperature range 0.7 & lt ; T & lt ; 4.7 our method took less CPU time than the Metropolis simulations for 16 temperature points in that temperature range .	Our way of treatment is general , it can also be applied to other systems with continuous degrees of freedom .
3	The first class of solutions predicts relatively large UV attenuation at high redshift , with A ( 1500 A ) =1.9 mag at z~3 , and smaller attenuations at z & lt ; 1 , with A ( 2800 A ) =1.25 mag .	( Abridged ) We investigate the evolution of the opacity of galaxies as a function of redshift , using simple assumptions about the metal and dust enrichment of the gas and the distribution of dust in galaxies .	We use an iterative procedure to reconstruct the intrinsic Star Formation Rate ( SFR ) density of galaxies with redshift , by applying dust obscuration corrections to the observed UV emission .	The iterative procedure converges to multiple solutions for the intrinsic SFR density , divided into two basic classes .	The SFR density of this set of solutions is constant for z & gt ; ~1.2 and declines for z & lt ; 1.2 ; it resembles in shape the `` monolithic collapse '' scenario for star formation .
1	A scattering approach is used to derive explicit expressions for the first and second order conductance changes due to the perturbation by the tip potential in terms of the scattering states of the unperturbed structure .	A systematic theory of the conductance measurements of non-invasive ( weak probe ) scanning gate microscopy is presented that provides an interpretation of what precisely is being measured .	In the case of a quantum point contact , the first order correction dominates at the conductance steps and vanishes on the plateaus where the second order term dominates .	Both corrections are non-local for a generic structure .	Only in special cases , such as that of a centrally symmetric quantum point contact in the conductance quantization regime , can the second order correction be unambiguously related with the local current density .
0	We consider the small mass asymptotic ( Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation ) for the Langevin equation with a variable friction coefficient .	The friction coefficient is assumed to be vanishing within certain region .	We introduce a regularization for this problem and study the limiting motion for the 1-dimensional case and a multidimensional model problem .	The limiting motion is a Markov process on a projected space .	We specify the generator and boundary condition of this limiting Markov process and prove the convergence .
3	The main attention is payed to $ d=2 $ $ \delta $ -potential though $ d=1 $ and $ d=3 $ cases are considered in some detail .	A quantum field described by the field operator $ \Delta_ { a } =\Delta+ a\delta_\Sigma $ involving a $ \delta $ -like potential is considered .	Mathematically , the treatment of the $ \delta $ -potential is based on the theory of self-adjoint extension of the unperturbed operator $ \Delta $ .	We give the general expressions for the resolvent and the heat kernel of the perturbed operator $ \Delta_ { a } $ .	We calculate exactly the heat kernel , Green 's functions and the effective action for the operator $ \Delta_ { a } $ in diverse dimensions and for various spaces $ \Sigma $ .
1	Accurate photometry ( especially for faint sources ) requires two simple processing steps beyond the standard data reduction to remove long-term detector transients .	The absolute calibration and characterization of the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer ( MIPS ) 70 micron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are presented based on over 2.5 years of observations .	Point spread function ( PSF ) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densities than aperture photometry .	Based on the PSF fitting photometry , the calibration factor shows no strong trend with flux density , background , spectral type , exposure time , or time since anneals .	The coarse-scale calibration sample includes observations of stars with flux densities from 22 mJy to 17 Jy , on backgrounds from 4 to 26 MJy sr^-1 , and with spectral types from B to M. The coarse-scale calibration is 702 +/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 ( 5 % uncertainty ) and is based on measurements of 66 stars .
4	We use a truncation of the electric microfield distribution in the quasi-static proton broadening to take into account the fact that high electric microfields dissociate the upper state of a transition .	We present improved calculations for the Stark broadening of hydrogen lines in dense plasmas typical of white dwarf atmospheres .	Our new model is based on the unified theory of Stark broadening from Vidal , Cooper , & amp ; Smith .	For the first time , we account for the non-ideal effects in a consistent way directly inside the line profile calculations .	The Hummer & amp ; Mihalas theory is used to describe the non-ideal effects due to perturbations on the absorber from protons and electrons .
2	One crucial ingredient in this approach is the idea of `` misaligned supersymmetry '' , which explains how string theories may be finite even without exhibiting spacetime supersymmetry .	In this paper , we propose a possible new approach towards solving the gauge hierarchy problem without supersymmetry and without extra spacetime dimensions .	This approach relies on the finiteness of string theory and the conjectured stability of certain non-supersymmetric string vacua .	This approach towards solving the gauge hierarchy problem is therefore complementary to recent proposals involving both large and small extra spacetime dimensions .	This approach may also give a new perspective towards simultaneously solving the cosmological constant problem .
2	In addition , the excitation energy from the two-level systems may be exchanged with the oscillator coherently , even though the oscillator energy may be orders of magnitude smaller than the two-level system transition energy .	We consider models in which two sets of matched two-level systems are coupled to a common oscillator in the case where the oscillator energy is small relative to the two-level transition energies .	Since the two sets of two-level systems are coupled indirectly through the oscillator , excitation transfer from one set of two-level systems to the other is possible .	In the lossless case , we demonstrate these effects numerically , and also use an approximate diagonalization to show that these effects are expected from the model Hamiltonian .	We augment the model to include loss effects , and show that loss enhances the excitation transfer effect by breaking the severe cancelation between different paths that occurs in the lossless case .
0	We consider a simple model for the geminate electron-hole separation process in organic photovoltaic cells , in order to illustrate the influence of dimensionality of conducting channels on the efficiency of the process .	The Miller-Abrahams expression for the transition rates between nearest neighbor sites was used for simulating random walks of the electron in the Coulomb field of the hole .	The non-equilibrium kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results qualitatively confirm the equilibrium estimations , although quantitatively the efficiency of the higher dimensional systems is less pronounced .	The lifetime of the electron prior to recombination is approximately equal to the lifetime prior to dissociation .	Their values indicate that electrons perform long stochastic walks before they are captured by the collector or recombined .
0	The fundamental theorem of geometry of rectangular matrices describes the general form of bijective maps on the space of all $ m\times n $ matrices over a division ring $ \mathbb { D } $ which preserve adjacency in both directions .	This result proved by Hua in the nineteen forties has been recently improved in several directions .	One can study such maps without the bijectivity assumption or one can try to get the same conclusion under the weaker assumption that adjacency is preserved in one direction only .	And the last possibility is to study maps acting between matrix spaces of different sizes .	The optimal result would describe maps preserving adjacency in one direction only acting between spaces of rectangular matrices of different sizes in the absence of any regularity condition ( injectivity or surjectivity ) .
0	Discrete stability extends the classical notion of stability to random elements in discrete spaces by defining a scaling operation in a randomised way : an integer is transformed into the corresponding binomial distribution .	Similarly defining the scaling operation as thinning of counting measures we characterise the corresponding discrete stability property of point processes .	It is shown that these processes are exactly Cox ( doubly stochastic Poisson ) processes with strictly stable random intensity measures .	We give spectral and LePage representations for general strictly stable random measures without assuming their independent scattering .	As a consequence , spectral representations are obtained for the probability generating functional and void probabilities of discrete stable processes .
3	The cluster core region ( r & lt ; 200 kpc ) shows a clearly enhanced passive fraction with respect to field levels .	We present a study of galaxy populations in the central region of the IRAC-selected , X-ray detected galaxy cluster Cl J1449+0856 at z=2 .	Based on a sample of spectroscopic and photometric cluster members , we investigate stellar populations and morphological structure of cluster galaxies over an area of ~0.7Mpc^2 around the cluster core .	The cluster stands out as a clear overdensity both in redshift space , and in the spatial distribution of galaxies close to the center of the extended X-ray emission .	However , together with a population of massive passive galaxies mostly with early-type morphologies , it also hosts massive actively star-forming , often highly dust-reddened sources .
3	1987 ) are employed in pairs of calculations that are otherwise identical .	We explore the sensitivity of the nucleosynthesis of intermediate mass elements ( 28 & lt ; A & lt ; 80 ) in supernovae derived from massive stars to the nuclear reaction rates employed in the model .	Two standard sources of reaction rate data ( Woosley et al .	1978 ; and Thielemann et al .	Both include as a common backbone the experimental reactions rates of Caughlan & amp ; Fowler ( 1988 ) .
0	The study of frustrated spin systems often requires time-consuming numerical simulations .	As the simplest approach , the classical Ising model is often used to investigate the thermodynamic behavior of such systems .	Exploiting the small correlation lengths in frustrated Ising systems , we develop a method for obtaining a first approximation to the energetic properties of frustrated two-dimensional Ising systems using small networks of less than 30 spins .	These small networks allow much faster numerical simulations , and more importantly , analytical calculation of the properties from the partition function is possible .	We choose Ising systems on the triangular lattice , the Kagome lattice , and the triangular Kagome lattice as prototype systems and find small systems that can serve as good approximations to these prototype systems .
4	data with the inverse Compton ( IC ) scenario is studied in the context of dominant orbital phase dependent adiabatic losses .	PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 is a binary system where a 48 ms pulsar orbits a massive Be star with a highly eccentric orbit ( e=0.87 ) with a period of 3.4 years .	The system exhibits variable , non-thermal radiation visible from radio to very high energies ( VHE ) around periastron passage .	This radiation is thought to originate from particles accelerated in the shock region between the pulsar wind ( PW ) and stellar outflows .	The consistency of the H.E.S.S .
4	In the N=2 as well as such N=0,1 theories quantum corrections in the D3-brane gauge theories are encoded in the corresponding classical higher dimensional field theories whose actions contain the twisted fields with non-vanishing tadpoles .	We discuss non-conformal gauge theories from type IIB D3-branes embedded in orbifolded space-times .	Such theories can be obtained by allowing some non-vanishing logarithmic twisted tadpoles .	In certain cases with N=0,1 supersymmetry correlation functions in the planar limit are the same as in the parent N=2 supersymmetric theories .	In particular , the effective action in such theories perturbatively is not renormalized beyond one loop in the planar limit .
4	Within this framework , we analyze the density of states , the quasiparticle wave function , and the charge conservation of Dirac electrons .	The superconducting proximity effect on two-dimensional massless Dirac electrons is usually analyzed using a simple model consisting of the Dirac Hamiltonian and an energy-independent pair potential .	Although this conventional model is plausible , it is questionable whether it can fully describe the proximity effect from a superconductor .	Here , we derive a more general proximity model starting from an appropriate microscopic model for the Dirac electron system in planar contact with a superconductor .	The resulting model describes the proximity effect in terms of the energy-dependent pair potential and renormalization term .
3	The 2dF facility began routine observations in 1997 .	The 2dF ( Two-degree Field ) facility at the prime focus of the Anglo-Australian Telescope provides multiple object spectroscopy over a 2 degree field of view .	Up to 400 target fibres can be independently positioned by a complex robot .	Two spectrographs provide spectra with resolutions of between 500 and 2000 , over wavelength ranges of 440nm and 110nm respectively .	2dF was designed primarily for galaxy redshift surveys and has a number of innovative features .
2	The extra nucleon-meson coupling ( $ g_\delta $ ) affects the every piece of physical observables , like binding energy , radii and single particle energy of hypernuclei .	We analyze the effects of $ \delta- $ meson on hypernuclei within the frame-work of relativistic mean field theory .	The $ \delta- $ meson is included into the Lagrangian for hypernuclei .	The lambda mean field potential is investigated which is consistent with other predictions .	Flipping of single particle energy levels are observed with the strength of $ g_\delta $ in the considered hypernuclei as well as normal nuclei .
0	Calculating solvent accessible surface areas ( SASA ) is a run-of-the-mill calculation in structural biology .	Although there are many programs available for this calculation , there are no free-standing , open-source tools designed for easy tool-chain integration .	FreeSASA is an open source C library for SASA calculations that provides both command-line and Python interfaces in addition to its C API .	The library implements both Lee and Richards ' and Shrake and Rupley 's approximations , and is highly configurable to allow the user to control molecular parameters , accuracy and output granularity .	It only depends on standard C libraries and should therefore be easy to compile and install on any platform .
1	At these scales , individual galaxy disks are comfortably resolved , making it possible to assess gas-SFR relations with respect to environment within galaxies .	High resolution , multi-wavelength maps of a sizeable set of nearby galaxies have made it possible to study how the surface densities of HI , H2 and star formation rate ( Sigma_HI , Sigma_H2 , Sigma_SFR ) relate on scales of a few hundred parsecs .	Sigma_H2 , traced by CO intensity , shows a strong correlation with Sigma_SFR and the ratio between these two quantities , the molecular gas depletion time , appears to be constant at about 2Gyr in large spiral galaxies .	Within the star-forming disks of galaxies , Sigma_SFR shows almost no correlation with Sigma_HI .	In the outer parts of galaxies , however , Sigma_SFR does scale with Sigma_HI , though with large scatter .
1	The first observable can be used to determine the decay width $ \Gamma_ { H\to b\bar { b } } $ of a scalar Higgs boson to a bottom-antibottom pair , while the second one is relevant for the $ e^+e^- $ annihilation cross section .	Results on the resummation of non-power-series expansions of the Adler function of a scalar , $ D_S $ , and a vector , $ D_V $ , correlator are presented within fractional analytic perturbation theory ( FAPT ) .	The obtained estimates are compared with those from fixed-order ( FOPT ) and contour-improved perturbation theory ( CIPT ) , working out the differences .	We prove that although FAPT and CIPT are conceptually different , they yield identical results .	The convergence properties of these expansions are discussed and predictions are extracted for the resummed series of $ R_S $ and $ D_V $ using one- and two-loop coupling running , and making use of appropriate generating functions for the coefficients of the perturbative series .
3	This problem has been considered before only for stellar systems with an isothermal Maxwellian distribution of velocities ; here we study other examples and confirm our calculations with N-body simulations .	We derive a model that describes the motion of a Brownian particle in a system which is dominated by gravitational forces .	An example of such a system is a massive black hole immersed in a cluster of stars .	We compute the dispersion in the position and velocity of such a black hole , and examine whether it achieves a state of equipartition of kinetic energy with the stars .	In certain cases , depending on the stellar distribution function , the black hole can acquire a steady state kinetic energy which is very far from equipartition relative to the stars .
2	In particular , non-Gaussianity of the fluctuations has acquired much attention recently .	Bulk fluctuations of conserved charges measured by event-by-event analysis in relativistic heavy ion collisions are observables which are believed to carry significant amount of information on the hot medium created by the collisions .	Active studies have been done recently experimentally , theoretically , and on the lattice .	In this review , we give a pedagogical introduction to these issues , and survey recent developments in this field of research .	Starting from the definition of cumulants , basic concepts in fluctuation physics , such as thermal fluctuations in statistical mechanics and time evolution of fluctuations in diffusive systems , are described .
3	To gain a better understanding of the systematic errors we have conducted the analysis with two different sets of stellar evolutionary tracks which we designate as Padova ( Girardi et al .	We present a detailed analysis of the star formation history ( SFH ) of three fields in M33 located ~ 4 - 6 visual scale lengths from its nucleus .	These fields were imaged with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope and reach ~ 2.5 magnitudes below the red clump of core helium burning stars .	The observed color-magnitude diagrams are modeled as linear combinations of individual synthetic populations with different ages and metallicities .	2000 ) and Teramo ( Pietrinferni et al.2004 ) .
3	Alternatively , we interpret this result as a limit on accretion timescales as a fraction of white dwarf cooling ages ; white dwarfs accrete debris from several generations of disks for ~10Myr .	We present near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from PAIRITEL , IRTF , and Spitzer of a metallicity-unbiased sample of 117 cool , hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs from the Palomar-Green survey and find five with excess radiation in the infrared , translating to a 4.3+2.7-1.2 % frequency of debris disks .	This is slightly higher than , but consistent with the results of previous surveys .	Using an initial-final mass relation , we apply this result to the progenitor stars of our sample and conclude that 1-7Msol stars have at least a 4.3 % chance of hosting planets ; an indirect probe of the intermediate-mass regime eluding conventional exoplanetary detection methods .	The average total mass accreted by these stars ranges from that of 200km asteroids to Ceres-sized objects , indicating that white dwarfs accrete moons and dwarf planets as well as Solar System asteroid analogues .
1	Yet the choice of the reaction coordinate ( RC ) introduces an undesirable degree of arbitrariness into the problem .	The concept of a protein diffusing in its free energy folding landscape has been fruitful for both theory and experiment .	We analyze extensive simulation data of an alpha-helix in explicit water solvent as it stochastically folds and unfolds .	The free energy profiles for different RCs exhibit significant variation , some having an activation barrier , others not .	We show that this variation has little effect on the predicted folding kinetics if the diffusivity profiles are properly taken into account .
4	Our estimate of $ n_ { \rm s } $ is only marginally consistent with the scale invariant value $ n_ { \rm s } =1 $ ; this spectrum is formally excluded at the 95 % confidence level .	We derive constraints on cosmological parameters using the power spectrum of galaxy clustering measured from the final two-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dFGRS ) and a compilation of measurements of the temperature power spectrum and temperature-polarization cross-correlation of the cosmic microwave background radiation .	We analyse a range of parameter sets and priors , allowing for massive neutrinos , curvature , tensors and general dark energy models .	In all cases , the combination of datasets tightens the constraints , with the most dramatic improvements found for the density of dark matter and the energy-density of dark energy .	If we assume a flat universe , we find a matter density parameter of $ \Omega_ { \rm m } =0.237 \pm 0.020 $ , a baryon density parameter of $ \Omega_ { \rm b } = 0.041 \pm 0.002 $ , a Hubble constant of $ H_ { 0 } =74\pm2 { \rm kms } ^ { -1 } { \rm Mpc } ^ { -1 } $ , a linear theory matter fluctuation amplitude of $ \sigma_ { 8 } =0.77\pm0.05 $ and a scalar spectral index of $ n_ { \rm s } =0.954 \pm 0.023 $ ( all errors show the 68 % interval ) .
2	We show that the generalized heat kernel coefficients can be related to the standard ones in a simple way .	Following Osipov and Hiller , a generalized heat kernel expansion is considered for the effective action of bosonic operators .	In this generalization , the standard heat kernel expansion , which counts inverse powers of a c-number mass parameter , is extended by allowing the mass to be a matrix in flavor space .	This holds with or without trace and integration over spacetime , to all orders and for general flavor spaces .	Gauge invariance is manifest .
3	Methods : We show that , for $ k & gt ; k_F $ MeV/c , nuclear momentum distributions are proportional to that of the deuteron .	Background : The high momentum distribution of atoms in two spin-state ultra-cold atomic gases with strong short-range interactions between atoms with different spins , which can be described using Tan 's contact , are dominated by short range pairs of different fermions and decreases as $ k^ { -4 } $ .	In atomic nuclei the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi momentum ( $ k & gt ; k_F \approx 250 $ Mev/c ) is also dominated by short rangecorrelated different-fermion ( neutron-proton ) pairs .	Purpose : Compare high-momentum unlike-fermion momentum distributions in atomic and nuclear systems .	We then examine the deuteron momentum distributions derived from a wide variety of modern nucleon-nucleon potentials that are consistent with $ NN $ -scattering data .
1	The ALG model combines a two dimensional lattice gas where particles interact through a soft core potential and orientational degrees of freedom .	Using Monte Carlo simulations we investigate some new aspects of the phase diagram and the behavior of the diffusion coefficient in an associating lattice gas ( ALG ) model on different regions of the phase diagram .	The competition between soft core potential and directional attractive forces results in a high density liquid phase , a low density liquid phase , and a gas phase .	Besides anomalies in the behavior of the density with the temperature at constant pressure and of the diffusion coefficient with density at constant temperature are also found .	The two liquid phases are separated by a coexistence line that ends in a bicritical point .
4	Additional spectra are used in order to mimic the effect of Martian aerosols , grain size , and observation geometry discrepancies between reference and observed spectra .	Minerals detection over large volume of spectra is the challenge addressed by current hyperspectral imaging spectrometer in Planetary Science .	Instruments such OMEGA ( Mars Express ) , CRISM ( Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ) , M^ { 3 } ( Chandrayaan-1 ) , VIRTIS ( Rosetta ) and many more , have been producing very large datasets since one decade .	We propose here a fast supervised detection algorithm called LinMin , in the framework of linear unmixing , with innovative arrangement in order to treat non-linear cases due to radiative transfer in both atmosphere and surface .	We use reference laboratory and synthetic spectral library .
3	The differential color-singlet cross section at alpha_s^5 is in substantial agreement with the data , so that there is no evidence for the need of color-octet contributions .	We update the theoretical predictions for direct Y ( nS ) hadroproduction in the framework of NRQCD .	We show that the next-to-leading order corrections in alpha_s to the color-singlet transition significantly raise the differential cross section at high pT and substantially affect the polarization of the Upsilon .	Motivated by the remaining gap between the NLO yield and the cross section measurements at the Tevatron , we evaluate the leading part of the alpha_s^5 contributions , namely those coming from Y ( nS ) associated with three light partons .	Furthermore , we find that the polarization of the Y ( nS ) is longitudinal .
0	Radio relics are Mpc-scale diffuse synchrotron sources found in galaxy cluster outskirts .	They are believed to be associated with large-scale shocks propagating through the intra-cluster medium , although the connection between radio relics and the cluster merger shocks is not yet proven conclusively .	We present a first tentative detection of a pressure jump in the well-known relic of the Coma cluster through Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ( SZ ) effect imaging.The SZE data are extracted from the first public all-sky data release of Planck and we use high-frequency radio data at 2.3 GHz to constrain the shock-front geometry .	The SZE data provide evidence for a pressure discontinuity , consistent with the relic position , without requiring any additional prior on the shock-front location .	The derived Mach number M = 2.9 ( +0.8/-0.6 ) is consistent with X-ray and radio results .
4	We present predictions for the ALICE , ATLAS and CMS experiments .	We present results for exclusive $ p p \to p p \pi^+ \pi^- $ or $ p \bar p \to p \bar p \pi^+ \pi^- $ processes at high energies .	We discuss the role of new additional absorption corrections in the non-resonant Lebiedowicz-Szczurek model mediated by the pomeron and reggeon exchanges .	We discuss also the role of the $ \rho^ { 0 } $ and the Drell-S\ '' oding photoproduction mechanism .	We compare our predictions with recent experimental results obtained by the STAR and CDF Collaborations .
0	Bayesian networks ( BN ) are used in a big range of applications but they have one issue concerning parameter learning .	In real application , training data are always incomplete or some nodes are hidden .	To deal with this problem many learning parameter algorithms are suggested foreground EM , Gibbs sampling and RBE algorithms .	In order to limit the search space and escape from local maxima produced by executing EM algorithm , this paper presents a learning parameter algorithm that is a fusion of EM and RBE algorithms .	This algorithm incorporates the range of a parameter into the EM algorithm .
1	However , great resilience is needed in heterogeneous small cells in case of accidents , attacks and natural disasters .	Heterogeneous small cell networks with overlay femtocells and macrocell is a promising solution for future heterogeneous wireless cellular communications .	In this article , we first describe the network architecture of disaster resilient heterogeneous small cell networks ( DRHSCNs ) , where several self-organization inspired approaches are applied .	Based on the proposed resilient heterogeneous small cell network architecture , self-configuring ( power , physical cell ID and neighbor cell list self-configuration ) and self-optimizing ( coverage and capacity optimization and mobility robustness optimization ) techniques are investigated in the DRHSCN .	Simulation results show that self-configuration and self-optimization can effectively improve the performance of the deployment and operation of the small cell networks in disaster scenarios .
4	In a successful generation , the first scheme resets the system to one instance , while the second scheme halves the number of instances .	We present two adaptive schemes for dynamically choosing the number of parallel instances in parallel evolutionary algorithms .	This includes the choice of the offspring population size in a ( 1+ $ \lambda $ ) EA as a special case .	Our schemes are parameterless and they work in a black-box setting where no knowledge on the problem is available .	Both schemes double the number of instances in case a generation ends without finding an improvement .
4	The measured IR continuum is much more sharply peaked and is consistent with a dominant contribution from the nucleus itself .	We present spectral and spatial information for major volatile species in Comet 10P/Tempel 2 , based on high-dispersion infrared spectra acquired on UT 2010 July 26 ( heliocentric distance Rh = 1.44 AU ) and September 18 ( Rh = 1.62 AU ) , following the comet 's perihelion passage on UT 2010 July 04 .	The total production rate for water on July 26 was ( 1.90 +/- 0.12 ) x 10^28 molecules s-1 , and abundances of six trace gases ( relative to water ) were : CH3OH ( 1.58 % +/- 0.23 ) , C2H6 ( 0.39 % +/- 0.04 ) , NH3 ( 0.83 % +/- 0.20 ) , and HCN ( 0.13 % +/- 0.02 ) .	A detailed analysis of intensities for water emission lines provided a rotational temperature of 35 +/- 3 K. The mean OPR is consistent with nuclear spin populations in statistical equilibrium ( OPR = 3.01 +/- 0.18 ) , and the ( 1-sigma ) lower bound corresponds to a spin temperature & gt ; 38 K. Our measurements were contemporaneous with a jet-like feature observed at optical wavelengths .	The spatial profiles of four primary volatiles display strong enhancements in the jet direction , which favors release from a localized vent on the nucleus .
3	The growth of the core radii of such models shows a remarkable core re-virialisation .	Direct N-body calculations are presented of the early evolution of exposed clusters to quantify the influence of gas expulsion on the time-varying surface brightness .	By assuming that the embedded OB stars drive out most of the gas after a given time delay , the change of the surface brightness of expanding star clusters is studied .	The influence of stellar dynamics and stellar evolution is discussed .	The decrease of the surface mass density during gas expulsion is large and is only truncated by this re-virialisation process .
1	Based on these findings , a very plausible geometrical interpretation of the $ AdS/CFT $ correspondence could be given .	It is shown that the large $ N $ limit of SU ( N ) YM in $ curved $ $ m $ -dim backgrounds can be subsumed by a higher $ m+n $ dimensional gravitational theory which can be identified to an $ m $ -dim generally invariant gauge theory of diffs $ N $ , where $ N $ is an $ n $ -dim internal space ( Cho , Sho , Park , Yoon ) .	Conformally invariant sigma models in $ D=2n $ dimensions with target non-compact SO ( 2n,1 ) groups are reviewed .	Despite the non-compact nature of the SO ( 2n,1 ) , the classical action and Hamiltonian are positive definite .	Instanton field configurations are found to correspond geometrically to conformal `` stereographic '' mappings of $ R^ { 2n } $ into the Euclidean signature $ AdS_ { 2n } $ spaces .
3	Here , the Bayesian control rule is applied to derive BCR-MDP , a controller to solve undiscounted Markov decision processes with finite state and action spaces and unknown dynamics .	Adaptive control problems are notoriously difficult to solve even in the presence of plant-specific controllers .	One way to by-pass the intractable computation of the optimal policy is to restate the adaptive control as the minimization of the relative entropy of a controller that ignores the true plant dynamics from an informed controller .	The solution is given by the Bayesian control rule-a set of equations characterizing a stochastic adaptive controller for the class of possible plant dynamics .	In particular , we derive a non-parametric conjugate prior distribution over the policy space that encapsulates the agent 's whole relevant history and we present a Gibbs sampler to draw random policies from this distribution .
2	It is found to require large temperature gradients in the order of Kelvins across an ultra thin MgO barrier .	Thermal spin-transfer torque describes the manipulation of the magnetization by the application of a heat flow .	The effect has been calculated theoretically by Jia et al.in 2011 .	In this paper , we present results on the fabrication and the characterization of magnetic tunnel junctions with 3 monolayer thin MgO barriers .	The quality of the interfaces at different growth conditions is studied quantitatively via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging .
3	The loop corrections turn out to have a substantial impact on the decay widths of Higgs-to-Higgs decays and on the production cross section of Higgs pairs via gluon fusion .	After the discovery of a Higgs-like boson by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS , it is of crucial importance to determine its properties in order to not only identify it as the boson responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking but also to clarify the question if it is a Standard Model ( SM ) Higgs boson or the Higgs particle of some extension beyond the SM as { \it e.g . } supersymmetry .	In this context , the precise prediction of the Higgs parameters as masses and couplings play a crucial role for the proper distinction between different models .	In extension of previous works on the loop-corrected Higgs boson masses of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Extension of the SM ( NMSSM ) , we present here the calculation of the loop-corrected trilinear NMSSM Higgs self-couplings .	They are therefore indispensable for the correct interpretation of the experimental Higgs results .
3	This is made possible by making a change to standard methods of marking a particular site in the lattice .	Quantum walks have been very successful in the development of search algorithms in quantum information , in particular in the development of spatial search algorithms .	However , the construction of continuous-time quantum search algorithms in two-dimensional lattices has proved difficult , requiring additional degrees of freedom .	Here , we demonstrate that continuous-time quantum walk search is possible in two-dimensions by changing the search topology to a graphene lattice , utilising the Dirac point in the energy spectrum .	Various ways of marking a site are shown to result in successful search protocols .
4	The discretization of Cahn-Hilliard equation with obstacle potential leads to a block $ 2 \times 2 $ { \em non-linear } system , where the $ ( 1,1 ) $ block has a non-linear and non-smooth term .	The phase separation processes are typically modeled by Cahn-Hilliard equations .	This equation was originally introduced to model phase separation in binary alloys , where phase stands for concentration of different components in alloy .	When the binary alloy under preparation is subjected to a rapid reduction in temperature below a critical temperature , it has been experimentally observed that the concentration changes from a mixed state to a visibly distinct spatially separated two phase for binary alloy .	This rapid reduction in the temperature , the so-called `` deep quench limit '' , is modeled effectively by obstacle potential .
2	The approximation is done by triangulating the manifold , identifying consistency and completeness equations with respect to this triangulation , and then trying to solve the system of equations using Newton 's Method .	The computer program SnapPea can approximate whether or not a three manifold whose boundary consists of tori has a complete hyperbolic structure , but it can not prove conclusively that this is so .	This article provides a method for proving that such a manifold has a complete hyperbolic structure based on the approximations of SNAP , a program that includes the functionality of SnapPea plus other features .	This produces an approximate , not actual solution .	The method developed here uses Kantorovich 's theorem to prove that an actual solution exists , thereby assuring that the manifold has a complete hyperbolic structure .
3	A near-optimum parameter is also predestinated .	Quadratic assignment problem is one of the great challenges in combinatorial optimization .	It has many applications in Operations research and Computer Science .	In this paper , the author extends the most-used rounding approach to a one-parametric optimization model for the quadratic assignment problems .	The numerical experiments confirm the efficiency .
0	Physics education research ( PER ) aims to improve how students solve problems .	But whose problems are we teaching students to solve ?	Physics has grown up as a child of war , and PER stems from the cognitive revolution in psychology , which arose from military needs and funding .	Physics , PER , and state power are allies .	By improving physics teaching , we arm the state against ourselves and move farther from a peaceful and humane world .
1	The yield of J/Psi 's measured in the PHENIX experiment via electron-positron decay pairs at mid-rapidity for Au-Au reactions at sqrt ( s_NN ) = 200 GeV are analyzed as a function of collision centrality .	First results on charm quarkonia production in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) are presented .	For this analysis we have studied 49.3 million minimum bias Au-Au reactions .	We present the J/Psi invariant yield dN/dy for peripheral and mid-central reactions .	For the most central collisions where we observe no signal above background , we quote 90 % confidence level upper limits .
1	The CUM must be successfully applied to cosmological scale observations to be considered a cosmological model .	The changing universe model ( CUM ) describes galaxy parameter relationships ( SESAPS '03 , session EB 2 ) .	A major component of current cosmological models is the Hubble constant $ H_\mathrm { o } $ .	An equation is derived using the CUM model relating redshift $ z $ and the distance $ D $ to galaxies and is applied to a sample of 32 spiral galaxies with $ D $ calculated using Cepheid variable stars .	The equation predicts a galaxy may have $ z & lt ; 0 $ in special circumstances .
3	This effect is related to the fact that the errors in the coefficients of a rational approximant are not distributed in an arbitrary way but form the coefficients of a new approximant to the approximated function .	Several construction methods for rational approximations to functions of one real variable are described in the present paper ; the computational results that characterize the comparative accuracy of these methods are presented ; an effect of error autocorrection is considered .	This effect occurs in efficient methods of rational approximation ( e.g. , Pade approximations , linear and nonlinear Pade-Chebyshev approximations ) where very significant errors in the coefficients do not affect the accuracy of the approximation .	The matter of import is that the errors in the numerator and the denominator of a fractional rational approximant compensate each other .	Understanding of the error autocorrection mechanism allows to decrease this error by varying the approximation procedure depending on the form of the approximant .
2	Here we consider SIR-like pathogens and give an elementary proof that for any network increasing the probability of transmission increases the mean outbreak size .	Contact networks can significantly change the course of epidemics , affecting the rate of new infections and the mean size of an outbreak .	Despite this dependence , some characteristics of epidemics are not contingent on the contact network and are probably predictable based only on the pathogen .	We also introduce a simple model , termed 2FleeSIR , in which susceptibles protect themselves by avoiding contacts with infectees .	The 2FleeSIR model is non-monotonic : for some networks , increasing transmissibility actually decreases the final extent .
1	It enables researchers to verify results and to pursuit new research questions with `` old '' data .	Academic data sharing is a way for researchers to collaborate and thereby meet the needs of an increasingly complex research landscape .	It is therefore not surprising that data sharing is advocated by funding agencies , journals , and researchers alike .	We surveyed 2661 individual academic researchers across all disciplines on their dealings with data , their publication practices , and motives for sharing or withholding research data .	The results for 1564 valid responses show that researchers across disciplines recognise the benefit of secondary research data for their own work and for scientific progress as a whole-still they only practice it in moderation .
4	We have taken as pixel-by-pixel background the latest TRACE , Yohkoh and CDS images where the loop has faded out .	Several items on the diagnostics and interpretation of coronal loop observations are under debate .	In this work , we analyze a well-defined loop system detected in a time-resolved observation in several spectral bands .	The dataset includes simultaneous images in the TRACE 171 A , 195 A and 284 A bands , and Yohkoh/SXT , and two rasters taken with SoHO/CDS in twelve relevant lines .	The loop is initially best visible in the TRACE 195 A filter band , and later in the 171 A filter band , with correspondence with the CDS raster images at log T \~ 6.0-6.1 .
3	Significantly , the spin fluctuations strongly destabilize the classical ground state of the skyrmion phase .	Spin-wave excitation plays important roles in the investigation of the magnetic phases .	In this paper , we study the spin-wave excitation spectra of two-component Bose gases with spin-orbit coupling on a deep square optical lattice using spin-wave theory .	We find that , while the excitation spectrum of the vortex crystal phase is gapless with a linear dispersion in the vicinity of the minimum point , the spectra of the commensurate spiral spin phase and the skyrmion crystal phase are gapped .	It suggests the emergence of a new state in the phase diagram .
3	Flood and Towsner asked for which functions h , the principle stating the existence of an h-bounded d.n.c .	A function is diagonally non-computable ( d.n.c . )	if it diagonalizes against the universal partial computable function.D.n.c .	functions play a central role in algorithmic randomness and reverse mathematics .	function ( DNR_h ) implies the Ramsey-type K\ '' onig 's lemma ( RWKL ) .
4	Both estimators yield the correct total mass for an equilibrium system .	The projected ( PME ) and virial mass estimator ( VME ) are revisited and tested using an N-body equilibrium system .	It is found that the PME can overestimate the mass by approx 40 % if a cluster is sampled only about its effective radius , Re .	The exact value of this error depends on the mass profile of the cluster .	The VME can yield errors of approx 20 % if we are also able to sample about one Re .
1	It is shown that an SL ( 2 , R ) conformal symmetry exists if and only if the geometry admits a homothetic Killing vector $ D^a $ whose associated one-form $ D_a $ is closed .	N-particle quantum mechanics described by a sigma model with an N-dimensional target space with torsion is considered .	Further , the SL ( 2 , R ) can always be extended to Osp ( 1|2 ) superconformal symmetry , with a suitable choice of torsion , by the addition of N real fermions .	Extension to SU ( 1,1|1 ) requires a complex structure I and a holomorphic U ( 1 ) isometry $ D^a I_a { ^b } \partial_b $ .	Conditions for extension to the superconformal group D ( 2,1 ; \alpha ) , which involve a triplet of complex structures and SU ( 2 ) x SU ( 2 ) isometries , are derived .
0	Critical wetting transition for short-range forces in three dimensions ( $ d=3 $ ) is reinvestigated by means of Monte Carlo simulation .	Using anisotropic finite size scaling approach , as well as approaches that do not rely on finite size scaling , we show that the critical wetting transition shows clear deviation from mean-field behaviour .	We estimate that the effective critical exponent $ \nu_ { \| } ^ { \textrm { eff } } =1.76\pm 0.08 $ for $ J/kT=0.35 $ and $ \nu_ { \| } ^ { \textrm { eff } } =1.85\pm 0.07 $ for $ J/kT=0.25 $ .	These values are in accord with predictions of Parry { \it et al . } [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 100 } , 136105 ( 2008 ) ] .
3	The crossed susceptibility in two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators shows a quantized signature of the $ \mathbb { Z } _2 $ topological phase in response to Zeeman coupling via an averaged g-factor , and the quantization persists even when $ \sigma^z $ -conservation of electrons is broken by a tilted magnetic field .	Crossed magnetic responses between spin and orbital angular momentum are studied in time-reversal symmetric topological insulators .	Due to spin-orbit coupling in the quantum spin Hall systems and three-dimensional topological insulators , the magnetic susceptibility has crossed ( intersectional ) components between spin and orbital part of magnetism .	In this study , the crossed susceptibility for the orbital magnetization is studied in two- and three-dimensional topological insulator models , in which an external magnetic field interacts with the electron spin by Zeeman coupling via distinct g-factors for conduction and valence energy bands .	The bulk orbital magnetization is interpreted by the persistent edge current attributed to the chiral anomaly at the ( 1+1 ) -dimensional boundary .
4	Although prediction of the SWRC and SHC from available parameters , such as textural data , organic matter , and bulk density have been under investigation for decades , up to now no research has focused on the effect of measurement scale on the soil hydraulic properties pedotransfer functions development .	Soil water retention curve ( SWRC ) and saturated hydraulic conductivity ( SHC ) are key hydraulic properties for unsaturated zone hydrology and groundwater .	In particular , SWRC provides useful information on entry pore-size distribution , and SHC is required for flow and transport modeling in the hydrologic cycle .	Not only the SWRC and SHC measurements are time-consuming , but also scale dependent .	This means as soil column volume increases , variability of the SWRC and SHC decreases .
4	It enables to constrain the role of merging in the heating of stellar disks : in many cases it seems to be non-efficient .	Major mergers or/and the repeated minor mergers lead to dynamical heating of disks of galaxies .	We analyze the available data on the velocity dispersion of stellar disks of S-S0 galaxies , including the new observational data obtained at 6m telescope of SAO RAS .	As a measure of dynamical ( over ) heating , we use the ratio of the observed velocity dispersion to the minimal dispersion which provides the local stability of the stellar disks with respect to gravitational perturbations .	We came to conclusion that stellar disks in a significant part of galaxies ( including LSB and some S0 galaxies ) are close to the marginal stability condition ( or are slightly overheated ) -- at least at radial distances $ r\sim $ 2-3 radial scalelenghts .
1	In particular , I emphasize the often neglected point that degrees of beliefs are updated not by `bare facts ' alone , but by all available information pertaining to them , including how they have been acquired .	Triggered by a recent interesting New Scientist article on the too frequent incorrect use of probabilistic evidence in courts , I introduce the basic concepts of probabilistic inference with a toy model , and discuss several important issues that need to be understood in order to extend the basic reasoning to real life cases .	In this light I show that , contrary to what claimed in that article , there was no `` probabilistic pitfall '' in the Columbo 's episode pointed as example of `` bad mathematics '' yielding `` rough justice '' .	Instead , such a criticism could have a `negative reaction ' to the article itself and to the use of Bayesian reasoning in courts , as well as in all other places in which probabilities need to be assessed and decisions need to be made .	Anyway , besides introductory/recreational aspects , the paper touches important questions , like : role and evaluation of priors ; subjective evaluation of Bayes factors ; role and limits of intuition ; `weights of evidence ' and `intensities of beliefs ' ( following Peirce ) and `judgments leaning ' ( here introduced ) , including their uncertainties and combinations ; role of relative frequencies to assess and express beliefs ; pitfalls due to `standard ' statistical education ; weight of evidences mediated by testimonies .
4	We discuss these results in the context of the magnetar model .	We present results from observations of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 ( SGR J1550-5418 ) taken with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) following the source 's outbursts in 2008 October and 2009 January .	During the time span of the Chandra observations , which covers days 4 through 23 and days 2 through 16 after the 2008 and 2009 events , respectively , the source spectral shape remained stable , while the pulsar 's spin-down rate in the same span in 2008 increased by a factor of 2.2 as measured by RXTE .	The lack of spectral variation suggests decoupling between magnetar spin-down and radiative changes , hence between the spin-down-inferred magnetic field strength and that inferred spectrally .	We also found a strong anti-correlation between the phase-averaged flux and the pulsed fraction in the 2008 and 2009 Chandra data , but not in the pre-2008 measurements .
4	On the dayside of the Earth the largest value of the net response amplitude was found to be of order 0.8*10^16 m^-2 ( 1 -- 2 % of the background TEC value ) , and the delay with respect to the SC in mid-latitudes was about 200 s. In higher latitudes the delay goes as long as 15 min .	We developed a new technology for global detection of atmospheric disturbances , on the basis of phase measurements of the total electron content ( TEC ) using an international GPS networks .	Temporal dependencies of TEC are obtained for a set of spaced receivers of the GPS network simultaneously for the entire set of visible satellites .	These series are subjected to filtering in the selected range of oscillation periods using known algorithms for spatio-temporal analysis of signals .	An `` instantaneous '' ionospheric response to the sudden commencement of a strong magnetic storm of April 6 , 2000 was detected .
3	Our experiment demonstrates the first realization of weak-value amplification in the azimuthal degree of freedom .	We present a weak measurement protocol that permits a sensitive estimation of angular rotations based on the concept of weak-value amplification .	The shift in the state of a pointer , in both angular position and the conjugate orbital angular momentum bases , is used to estimate angular rotations .	This is done by an amplification of both the real and imaginary parts of the weak-value of a polarization operator that has been coupled to the pointer , which is a spatial mode , via a spin-orbit coupling .	We have achieved effective amplification factors as large as 100 , providing a sensitivity that is on par with more complicated methods that employ quantum states of light or extremely large values of orbital angular momentum .
0	Purpose : This paper presents the preliminary results of a semi-automatic method for prostate segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Images ( MRI ) which aims to be incorporated in a navigation system for prostate brachytherapy .	Methods : The method is based on the registration of an anatomical atlas computed from a population of 18 MRI exams onto a patient image .	An hybrid registration framework which couples an intensity-based registration with a robust point-matching algorithm is used for both atlas building and atlas registration .	Results : The method has been validated on the same dataset that the one used to construct the atlas using the `` leave-one-out method '' .	Results gives a mean error of 3.39 mm and a standard deviation of 1.95 mm with respect to expert segmentations .
1	We predict the primary angular bispectrum from inflation , and forecast how well we can measure the primordial non-Gaussian signal .	We present theoretical and observational studies of non-Gaussian fluctuations in CMB , by using the angular bispectrum and trispectrum .	In addition to that , secondary anisotropy sources in the low-redshift universe also produce non-Gaussianity , so do foreground emissions from extragalactic or interstellar microwave sources .	We study how well we can measure these non-Gaussian signals , including the primordial signal .	We find that slow-roll inflation produces too small bispectrum to be detected by any experiments ; thus , any detection strongly constrains this class of models .
1	In the m-variable case with modulus N and approximate common divisor of size N^beta , this improves the size of the error tolerated from N^ ( beta^2 ) to N^ ( beta^ ( ( m+1 ) /m ) ) , under a commonly used heuristic assumption .	We analyze the multivariate generalization of Howgrave-Graham 's algorithm for the approximate common divisor problem .	This gives a more detailed analysis of the hardness assumption underlying the recent fully homomorphic cryptosystem of van Dijk , Gentry , Halevi , and Vaikuntanathan .	While these results do not challenge the suggested parameters , a 2^ ( n^epsilon ) approximation algorithm with epsilon & lt ; 2/3 for lattice basis reduction in n dimensions could be used to break these parameters .	We have implemented our algorithm , and it performs better in practice than the theoretical analysis suggests .
2	First , we carefully select lexical features of the URLs that are resistant to obfuscation techniques used by attackers .	Phishing is an increasingly sophisticated method to steal personal user information using sites that pretend to be legitimate .	In this paper , we take the following steps to identify phishing URLs .	Second , we evaluate the classification accuracy when using only lexical features , both automatically and hand-selected , vs. when using additional features .	We show that lexical features are sufficient for all practical purposes .
2	At zero temperature , both spectra exhibit two or four steps ( as a function of the frequency ) , depending on whether the resonant level lies outside or within the range between the chemical potentials on the two leads .	The noise spectra associated with correlations of the current through a single level quantum dot , and with the charge fluctuations on the dot , are calculated for a finite bias voltage .	The results turn out to be sensitive to the asymmetry of the dot 's coupling to the two leads .	In addition , the low frequency shot-noise exhibits dips in the charge noise and dips , peaks , and discontinuities in the derivative of the current noise .	In spite of some smearing , several of these features persist at finite temperatures , where a dip can also turn into a peak .
2	We measure the subclusters ' gas temperatures ( ~ 2-3 keV ) , total ( ~ 1-2 x 10^14 solar masses ) and gas ( ~ 1-2 x 10^13 solar masses ) masses , gas mass fraction within r500 , entropy profiles , and X-ray luminosities ( ~ 10^43 erg/s ) .	We present results from Chandra , XMM-Newton , and ROSAT observations of the Planck SZ-detected cluster A3716 ( PLCKG345.40-39.34 - G345 ) .	We show that G345 is , in fact , two subclusters separated on the sky by 400 kpc .	Using the gas density and temperature profiles for both subclusters , we show that there is good ( 0.8 sigma ) agreement between the expected Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal predicted from the X-ray data and that measured from the Planck mission , and better agreement within 0.6 sigma when we re-computed the Planck value assuming a two component cluster model , with relative amplitudes fixed based on the X-ray data .	Dynamical analysis shows that the two galaxy subclusters are very likely ( & gt ; 97 % probability ) gravitationally bound , and in the most likely scenario , the subclusters will undergo core passage in 500 +- 200 Myr .
4	We provide an optimal estimate for this waiting time , which gives a quantified feeling for the magnitude to which the maximum principle fails .	In this paper we consider the steepest descent $ H^ { -1 } $ -gradient flow of the length functional for immersed plane curves , known as the curve diffusion flow .	It is known that under this flow there exist both initially immersed curves which develop at least one singularity in finite time and initially embedded curves which self-intersect in finite time .	We prove that under the flow closed curves with initial data close to a round circle in the sense of normalised $ L^2 $ oscillation of curvature exist for all time and converge exponentially fast to a round circle .	This implies that for a sufficiently large `waiting time ' the evolving curves are strictly convex .
2	Juno carries an ultraviolet Spectrograph ( UVS ) and an infrared spectral mapper ( JIRAM ) that will obtain high-resolution spectral images providing the auroral counterpart to Juno 's in situ particles and fields measurements with the plasma JADE and JEDI particle detectors .	In 2016 , the NASA Juno spacecraft will initiate its one-year mission around Jupiter and become the first probe to explore the polar regions of Jupiter .	The HST UV instruments ( STIS and ACS ) can greatly contribute to the success of the Juno mission by providing key complementary views of Jupiter 's UV aurora from Earth orbit .	The Juno mission will be the first opportunity to measure simultaneously the energetic particles at high latitude and the auroral emissions they produce .	Following programmatic and technical limitations , the amount of UVS data transmitted to Earth will be severely restricted .
1	Unlike for the decode-and-forward ( DF ) strategy or point-to-point ( P2P ) transmission , for which Gaussian channel inputs are known to be optimal , the input distribution that maximizes the achievable PDF rate for the Gaussian MIMO relay channel has remained unknown so far .	This paper considers the partial decode-and-forward ( PDF ) strategy for the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) relay channel .	For some special cases , e.g. , for relay channels where the optimal PDF strategy reduces to DF or P2P transmission , it could be deduced that Gaussian inputs maximize the PDF rate .	For the general case , however , the problem has remained open until now .	In this work , we solve this problem by proving that the maximum achievable PDF rate for the Gaussian MIMO relay channel is always attained by Gaussian channel inputs .
1	During their 38-year trip , they have collected data regarding solar wind properties ( such as the plasma velocity and magnetic field intensity ) .	The Voyager probes are the furthest , still active , spacecraft ever launched from Earth .	Unfortunately , a complete time evolution of the measured physical quantities is not available .	The time series contains many gaps which increase in frequency and duration at larger distances .	The aim of this work is to perform a spectral and statistical analysis of the solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic field using Voyager 2 data measured in 1979 , when the gaps/signal ratio is of order of unity .
0	We show that the linearized equations of the incompressible elastic medium admit a `Maxwell form ' in which the shear component of the stress vector plays the role of the electric field , and the vorticity plays the role of the magnetic field .	Conversely , the set of dynamic Maxwell equations are strict mathematical corollaries from the governing equations of the incompressible elastic medium .	This suggests that the nature of `electromagnetic field ' may actually be related to an elastic continuous medium .	The analogy is complete if the medium is assumed to behave as fluid in shear motions , while it may still behave as elastic solid under compressional motions .	Then the governing equations of the elastic fluid are re-derived in the Eulerian frame by replacing the partial time derivatives by the properly invariant ( frame indifferent ) time rates .
4	Finally , we use the cell decomposition to establish that the quantum grassmannian satisfies normal separation and catenarity .	We consider quantum Schubert cells in the quantum grassmannian and give a cell decomposition of the prime spectrum via the Schubert cells .	As a consequence , we show that all primes are completely prime in the generic case where the deformation parameter q is not a root of unity .	There is a torus H that acts naturally on the quantum grassmannian and the cell decomposition of the set of H-primes leads to a parameterisation of the H-spectrum via certain diagrams on partitions associated to the Schubert cells .	Interestingly , the same parameterisation occurs for the non-negative cells in recent studies concerning the totally non-negative grassmannian .
1	We learned the extent of this often-cited observation in the construction of the probabilistic part of a complex influence diagram in the field of cancer treatment .	In building Bayesian belief networks , the elicitation of all probabilities required can be a major obstacle .	Based upon our negative experiences with existing methods , we designed a new method for probability elicitation from domain experts .	The method combines various ideas , among which are the ideas of transcribing probabilities and of using a scale with both numerical and verbal anchors for marking assessments .	In the construction of the probabilistic part of our influence diagram , the method proved to allow for the elicitation of many probabilities in little time .
4	In this work , we are not restricting our efforts in studying whether any specific estimator is resilient to the attack or not , but instead we aim to present the generic sufficient and necessary conditions for resilience by considering a general class of convex optimization based estimators .	We consider the problem of resilient state estimation in the presence of integrity attacks .	There are m sensors monitoring the state and p of them are under attack .	The sensory data collected by the compromised sensors can be manipulated arbitrarily by the attacker .	The classical estimators such as the least squares estimator may not provide a reliable estimate under the so-called ( p , m ) -sparse attack .
4	Both the shape , relative size and apparent `` stochasticity '' of the region of the scattered data points agree nearly quantitatively with empirical data .	By means of microscopic simulations we show that non-instantaneous adaptation of the driving behaviour to the traffic situation together with the conventional measurement method of flow-density data can explain the observed inverse- $ \lambda $ shape and the wide scattering of flow-density data in `` synchronized '' congested traffic .	We model a memory effect in the response of drivers to the traffic situation for a wide class of car-following models by introducing a new dynamical variable describing the adaptation of drivers to the surrounding traffic situation during the past few minutes ( `` subjective level of service '' ) and couple this internal state to parameters of the underlying model that are related to the driving style .	% For illustration , we use the intelligent-driver model ( IDM ) as underlying model , characterize the level of service solely by the velocity and couple the internal variable to the IDM parameter `` netto time gap '' , modelling an increase of the time gap in congested traffic ( `` frustration effect '' ) , that is supported by single-vehicle data .	% We simulate open systems with a bottleneck and obtain flow-density data by implementing `` virtual detectors '' .
3	We introduce a generalisation of the deformation variety , which again consists of assignments of complex variables to certain dihedral angles subject to polynomial equations , but together with some extra combinatorial data concerning degenerate tetrahedra .	Given an ideal triangulation of a connected 3-manifold with non-empty boundary consisting of a disjoint union of tori , a point of the deformation variety is an assignment of complex numbers to the dihedral angles of the tetrahedra subject to Thurston 's gluing equations .	From this , one can recover a representation of the fundamental group of the manifold into the isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space .	However , the deformation variety depends crucially on the triangulation : there may be entire components of the representation variety which can be obtained from the deformation variety with one triangulation but not another .	This `` extended deformation variety '' deals with many situations that the deformation variety can not .
1	The U ( 1 ) ' symmetry is broken at the TeV scale and its remnant discrete symmetry makes one of the right-handed neutrinos stable .	We consider a U ( 1 ) ' gauge symmetry acting on three generations of right-handed neutrinos .	As a natural consequence of the anomaly cancellation , the neutrino mass matrix consists of a combination of Type I ( TeV scale ) seesaw and radiative correction .	The stable right-handed neutrino communicates with the Standard Model via s-channel exchange of the Higgs field and the U ( 1 ) ' gauge boson , so that the observed relic density for dark matter is obtained in a wide range of the parameter space .	The experimental signatures in collider and other experiments are briefly discussed .
4	Simple explicit formulas characterizing the distribution of P & amp ; Ls illustrate the basic mechanisms of momentum trading , while general matrix representations can be applied to arbitrary Gaussian models .	We investigate how price variations of a stock are transformed into profits and losses ( P & amp ; Ls ) of a trend following strategy .	In the frame of a Gaussian model , we derive the probability distribution of P & amp ; Ls and analyze its moments ( mean , variance , skewness and kurtosis ) and asymptotic behavior ( quantiles ) .	We show that the asymmetry of the distribution ( with often small losses and less frequent but significant profits ) is reminiscent to trend following strategies and less dependent on peculiarities of price variations .	At short times , trend following strategies admit larger losses than one may anticipate from standard Gaussian estimates , while smaller losses are ensured at longer times .
3	We derive the parameters of a novel class of spherical nonlinear cloaks and examine its invisibility performance by the proposed method at various nonlinear situations .	An analytical method of electromagnetic wave interactions with a general radially anisotropic cloak is established .	It is able to deal with arbitrary parameters ( $ \epsilon_r ( r ) $ , $ \mu_r ( r ) $ , $ \epsilon_t ( r ) $ and $ \mu_t ( r ) $ ) of a radially anisotropic inhomogeneous shell .	The general cloaking condition is proposed from the wave relations for the first time .	Spherical metamaterial cloaks with improved invisibility performance is achieved with optimal nonlinearity in transformation and core-shell ratio .
3	We show moreover that the transient time of the system $ t_ { tr } $ scales with system size L as $ t_ { tr } \sim L^z $ .	We numerically investigate the approach to the stationary state in the nonconservative Olami-Feder-Christensen ( OFC ) model for earthquakes .	Starting from initially random configurations , we monitor the average earthquake size in different portions of the system as a function of time ( the time is defined as the input energy per site in the system ) .	We find that the process of self-organisation develops from the boundaries of the system and it is controlled by a dynamical critical exponent z~1.3 that appears to be universal over a range of dissipation levels of the local dynamics .	We argue that the ( non-trivial ) scaling of the transient time in the OFC model is associated to the establishment of long-range spatial correlations in the steady state .
3	We claim that the fuzzieness in quantum mechanics , in statistical physics and thermodynamics is due to the fact that we do not see the real image of the object , but a holographic projection of it .	The concept of holography has lured philosophers of science for decades , and is becoming more and more popular on several fronts of science , e. g. in the physics of black holes .	In this paper we try to understand things as if the visible universe were a reading of a low-dimensional hologram generated in hyperspace .	We performed the whole process of creating and reading the hologram of a point in virtual space by using computer simulations .	We found that the projection of a point particle is a de Broglie-type wave .
0	The paper introduces the notion of off-line justification for Answer Set Programming ( ASP ) .	Justifications provide a graph-based explanation of the truth value of an atom w.r.t .	a given answer set .	The paper extends also this notion to provide justification of atoms during the computation of an answer set ( on-line justification ) , and presents an integration of on-line justifications within the computation model of Smodels .	Off-line and on-line justifications provide useful tools to enhance understanding of ASP , and they offer a basic data structure to support methodologies and tools for debugging answer set programs .
3	Both phases are distinguishable by the quark density of states at zero virtuality , with a critical quark mass of the order of 100-200 MeV .	We use a chiral random matrix model to investigate the effects of massive quarks on the distribution of eigenvalues of QCD inspired Dirac operators .	Kalkreuter 's lattice analysis of the spectrum of the massive ( hermitean ) Dirac operator for two colors and Wilson fermions is shown to follow from a cubic equation in the quenched approximation .	The quenched spectrum shows a Mott-transition from a ( delocalized ) Goldstone phase softly broken by the current mass , to a ( localized ) heavy quark phase , with quarks localized over their Compton wavelength .	At the critical point , the quark density of states is given by $ \nu_Q ( \lambda ) \sim |\lambda|^ { 1/3 } $ .
4	In addition , the model is consistent with the measured pathway of the kinesin ATPase .	Recently individual two-headed kinesin molecules have been studied in in vitro motility assays revealing a number of their peculiar transport properties .	In this paper we propose a simple and robust model for the kinesin stepping process with elastically coupled Brownian heads showing all of these properties .	The analytic and numerical treatment of our model results in a very good fit to the experimental data and practically has no free parameters .	Changing the values of the parameters in the restricted range allowed by the related experimental estimates has almost no effect on the shape of the curves and results mainly in a variation of the zero load velocity which can be directly fitted to the measured data .
0	High-energy physics data analysis relies heavily on the comparison between experimental and simulated data as stressed lately by the Higgs search at LHC and the recent identification of a Higgs-like new boson .	The first link in the full simulation chain is the event generation both for background and for expected signals .	Nowadays event generators are based on the automatic computation of matrix element or amplitude for each process of interest .	Moreover , recent analysis techniques based on the matrix element likelihood method assign probabilities for every event to belong to any of a given set of possible processes .	This method originally used for the top mass measurement , although computing intensive , has shown its power at LHC to extract the new boson signal from the background .
0	We consider Nonlinear Schrodinger type equations on $ S^1 $ .	In this paper , we obtain polynomial bounds on the growth in time of high Sobolev norms of their solutions .	The key is to derive an iteration bound based on a frequency decomposition of the solution .	This iteration bound is different than the one used earlier in the work of Bourgain , and is less dependent on the structure of the nonlinearity .	We first look at the defocusing NLS equation with nonlinearity of degree $ \geq 5 $ .
0	A frequent matter of debate in Bayesian inversion is the question , which of the two principle point-estimators , the maximum-a-posteriori ( MAP ) or the conditional mean ( CM ) estimate is to be preferred .	As the MAP estimate corresponds to the solution given by variational regularization techniques , this is also a constant matter of debate between the two research areas .	Following a theoretical argument - the Bayes cost formalism - the CM estimate is classically preferred for being the Bayes estimator for the mean squared error cost while the MAP estimate is classically discredited for being only asymptotically the Bayes estimator for the uniform cost function .	In this article we present recent theoretical and computational observations that challenge this point of view , in particular for high-dimensional sparsity-promoting Bayesian inversion .	Using Bregman distances , we present new , proper convex Bayes cost functions for which the MAP estimator is the Bayes estimator .
4	It is common statistical practice to then construct a confidence interval for theta with nominal coverage 1-alpha , using the same data , based on the assumption that the selected model had been given to us a priori ( as the true model ) .	Consider a linear regression model with regression parameter beta= ( beta_1 , ... , beta_p ) and independent normal errors .	Suppose the parameter of interest is theta = a^T beta , where a is specified .	Define the s-dimensional parameter vector tau = C^T beta - t , where C and t are specified .	Suppose that we carry out a preliminary F test of the null hypothesis H_0 : tau = 0 against the alternative hypothesis H_1 : tau not equal to 0 .
3	Here we complement the discussion by $ D^0 - \bar D^0 $ oscillations data .	The LHCb bounds on the branching ratio of rare decay $ D^0 \to \mu^+ \mu^- $ and the constraints on the branching ratio of $ D^+ \to \pi^+ \mu^+ \mu^- $ in the nonresonant regions enable us to improve constraints on new physics contributions .	Using the effective Lagrangian approach we determine sizes of the Wilson coefficients allowed by the existing LHCb bounds on rare charm decays .	Then we discuss contributions to rare charm meson decay observables in several models of new physics : a model with an additional spin-1 weak triplet , leptoquark models , Two Higgs doublets model of type III , and a $ Z ' $ model .	Among considered models , only leptoquarks can significantly modify Wilson coefficients .
4	In the thermodynamic limit , TAP states of all free energies become marginally stable .	We compute the complexity ( logarithm of the number of TAP states ) associated with minima and index-one saddle points of the TAP free energy .	Higher-index saddles have smaller complexities .	The two leading complexities are equal , consistent with the Morse theorem on the total number of turning points , and have the value given in [ A. J. Bray and M. A. Moore , J. Phys .	C 13 , L469 ( 1980 ) ] .
2	Here , it is formulated in a more general context .	We reexamine in detail a canonical quantization method a la Gupta-Bleuler in which the Fock space is built over a so-called Krein space .	This method has already been successfully applied to the massless minimally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime for which it preserves covariance .	An interesting feature of the theory is that , although the field is obtained by canonical quantization , it is independent of Bogoliubov transformations .	Moreover no infinite term appears in the computation of $ T^ { \mu\nu } $ mean values and the vacuum energy of the free field vanishes : $ & lt ; 0|T^ { 00 } |0 & gt ; =0 $ .
2	The kinematical behavior is discussed in particular in relation to their metallicities .	We present an analysis of the space motions of 742 subdwarf stars based on the sample of Carney et al . ( 1994 , CLLA ) .	Hipparcos parallaxes , TYC2+HIP proper motions and Tycho2 proper motions were combined with radial velocities and metallicities from CLLA .	The majority of these sample stars have metal abundances of [ Fe/H ] & gt ; -1 and represent the thick disk population .	The halo component , with [ Fe/H ] & lt ; -1.6 , is characterized by a low mean rotation velocity and a radially elongated velocity ellipsoid .
1	The chief result is a closed-form formula for the volume of a metric ball in the Grassmann manifold when the radius is sufficiently small .	This paper considers the quantization problem on the Grassmann manifold \mathcal { G } _ { n , p } , the set of all p-dimensional planes ( through the origin ) in the n-dimensional Euclidean space .	This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary dimension n and p , while previous results pertained only to p=1 , or a fixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on this result , several quantization bounds are derived for sphere packing and rate distortion tradeoff .	We establish asymptotically equivalent lower and upper bounds for the rate distortion tradeoff .	Since the upper bound is derived by constructing random codes , this result implies that the random codes are asymptotically optimal .
1	We prove the exponential sharp rate of strong convergence to equilibrium for conservative measure solutions having finite mass and energy .	The paper considers the convergence to equilibrium for measure solutions of the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for hard potentials with angular cutoff .	The proof is based on the regularizing property of the iterated collision operators , exponential moment production estimates , and some previous results on the exponential rate of strong convergence to equilibrium for square integrable initial data .	We also obtain a lower bound of the convergence rate and deduce that no eternal solutions exist apart from the trivial stationary solutions given by the Maxwellian equilibrium .	We finally use these convergence rates in order to deduce global-in-time strong stability of measure solutions .
1	We found that under some conditions the molecules reverse their spin direction at a resonance field in the form of an avalanche .	We report spatially resolved , time-dependent , magnetization reversal measurements of an Fe $ _ { 8 } $ single molecular magnet using a microscopic Hall bar array .	The avalanche front velocity is of the order of $ 1 $ m/sec and is sensitive to field gradients and sweep rates .	We also measured the propagation velocity of a heat pulse and found that it is much slower than the avalanche velocity .	We therefore conclude that in Fe $ _ { 8 } $ , the avalanche front propagates without thermal assistance .
3	The internal structure is then characterized by means of the minimum spanning tree method ( Q parameter ) , King profile fitting , and the correlation dimension ( Dc ) for those clusters with fractal patterns .	The analysis of the distribution of stars in open clusters may yield important information on the star formation process and early dynamical evolution of stellar clusters .	Here we address this issue by systematically characterizing the internal spatial structure of 16 open clusters in the Milky Way spanning a wide range of ages .	Cluster stars have been selected from a membership probability analysis based on a non-parametric method that uses both positions and proper motions and does not make any a priori assumption on the underlying distributions .	On average , clusters with fractal-like structure are younger than those exhibiting radial star density profiles and an apparent trend between Q and age is observed in agreement with previous ideas about the dynamical evolution of the internal spatial structure of stellar clusters .
4	Talk given by Beatriz Gato-Rivera at the `` 28th International Symposium on the Theory of Elementary Particles '' , Wendisch-Rietz ( Germany ) , August 30 - September 3 , 1994 .	A conformal field theory can be recovered , via the Kontsevich-Miwa transform , as a solution to the Virasoro constraints on the KP tau function .	That theory , which we call KM CFT , consists of d \leq 1 matter plus a scalar and a dressing prescription : \Delta = 0 for every primary field .	By adding a spin-1 bc system the KM CFT provides a realization of the N=2 twisted topological algebra .	The other twist of the corresponding untwisted N=2 superconformal theory is a DDK realization of the N=2 twisted topological algebra .
3	The use of free fields in the pure spinor formalism is justified from the first principle .	The pure spinor formalism for the superstring , initiated by N. Berkovits , is derived at the fully quantum level starting from a fundamental reparametrization invariant and super-Poincare invariant worldsheet action .	It is a simple extension of the Green-Schwarz action with doubled spinor degrees of freedom with a compensating local supersymmetry on top of the conventional kappa-symmetry .	Equivalence to the Green-Schwarz formalism is manifest from the outset .	The basic idea works also for the superparticle in 11 dimensions .
0	Utilizing { \it ab initio } ultra-high resolution hydrodynamical simulations , we investigate the properties of the interstellar and circum-galactic medium of Ly $ \alpha $ Blobs ( LABs ) at $ z=3 $ , focusing on three important emission lines : Ly $ \alpha $ 1216\AA , \heii 1640\AA\ and \civ 1449\AA .	Their relative strengths provide a powerful probe of the thermodynamic properties of the gas when confronted with observations .	By adjusting the dust attenuation effect using one parameter and matching the observed size-luminosity relation of LABs using another parameter , we show that our simulations can reproduce the observed \civ/\lya\ and \heii/\lya\ ratios adequately .	This analysis provides the first successful physical model to account for simultaneously the LAB luminosity function , luminosity-size relation , and the \civ/Ly $ \alpha $ and \heii/Ly $ \alpha $ ratios , with only two parameters .	The physical underpinning for this model is that , in addition to the stellar component for the \lya\ emission , the \lya\ and \civ\ emission lines due to shock heated gas are primarily collisional excitation driven and the \heii\ emission line collisional ionization driven .
3	Through its sizable couplings to the Z ' , the dark matter is predicted to possess an elastic scattering cross section with neutrons which can generate the signals reported by the CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA collaborations .	We explore the phenomenology of Grand Unified Models based on the E_6 group , focusing on the Z ' with suppressed couplings to leptons that can appear in such models .	We find that this Z ' can accommodate the W+dijets anomaly reported by the CDF collaboration .	Furthermore , a viable dark matter candidate in the form of a right-handed sneutrino is also present within the fundamental 27-dimensional representation of E_6 .	To avoid being overproduced in the early universe , the dark matter must annihilate to leptons through the exchange of charged or neutral fermions which appear in the 27 of E_6 , providing an excellent fit to the gamma ray spectrum observed from the Galactic Center by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope .
2	It is shown that kinetic terms are associated to the minimum value of the inner product over each gauge orbit .	We develop formalism for computing the kinetic terms of 4d fields in string compactifications , particularly with warping .	With the help of the Hamiltonian approach , we identify a gauge dependent inner product on the compactification manifold which depends on the warp factor .	We work out the kinetic term for the complex modulus of a deformed conifold with flux , i.e.the Klebanov-Strassler solution embedded in a compact Calabi-Yau manifold .	Earlier results of a power-like divergence are confirmed qualitatively ( the kinetic term does contain the main effect of warping ) but not quantitatively ( the correct results differ by an order one coefficient ) .
4	In this paper , we outline the physically motivated assumptions and key free parameters that go into the model , comparing and contrasting with other parallel efforts .	This is the first paper of a series that describes the methods and basic results of the GalICS model ( for Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations ) .	GalICS is a hybrid model for hierarchical galaxy formation studies , combining the outputs of large cosmological N-body simulations with simple , semi-analytic recipes to describe the fate of the baryons within dark matter halos .	The simulations produce a detailed merging tree for the dark matter halos including complete knowledge of the statistical properties arising from the gravitational forces .	We intend to predict the overall statistical properties of galaxies , with special emphasis on the panchromatic spectral energy distribution emitted by galaxies in the UV/optical and IR/submm wavelength ranges .
1	The EMBLA Survey successfully searched for these old , metal-poor stars by making use of the distinctive SkyMapper photometric filters to discover candidate metal-poor stars in the bulge .	Cosmological models predict the oldest stars in the Galaxy should be found closest to the centre of the potential well , in the bulge .	Their metal-poor nature was then confirmed using the AAOmega spectrograph on the AAT .	Here we present an abundance analysis of 10 bulge stars with -2.8 & lt ; [ Fe/H ] & lt ; -1.7 from MIKE/Magellan observations , in total determining the abundances of 22 elements .	Combining these results with our previous high-resolution data taken as part of the Gaia-ESO Survey , we have started to put together a picture of the chemical and kinematic nature of the most metal-poor stars in the bulge .
0	Gamma-ray astronomy has produced for several years now sky maps for low photon statistics , non-negligible background and comparatively poor angular resolution .	Quantifying the significance of spatial features remains difficult .	Besides , spectrum extraction requires regions with large statistics while maps in energy bands allow only qualitative interpretation .	The two main competing mechanisms in the VHE domain are the Inverse-Compton emission from accelerated electrons radiating through synchrotron in the X-ray domain and the interactions between accelerated hadrons and the surrounding medium , leading to the production and subsequent decay of Pi0 mesons .	The spectrum of the VHE emission from leptons is predicted to steepen with increasing distance from the acceleration zone , owing to synchrotron losses ( i.e.cooled population ) .
2	Differently from all other members it shows charge ordering , with Co2+ sitting on two sites ( Co2 , Co3 ) and mixed valent cobalt Co3+/Co2+L sitting on two other sites ( Co1 , Co4 ) .	CaBaCo4O7 represents a new class of ferrimagnets whose structure is built up of CoO4 tetrahedra only , similarly to other members LnBaCo4O7 of the 114 series , forming an alternate stacking of kagome and triangular layers .	Neutron powder diffraction reveals , that this compound exhibits the largest distortion within the 114 series , characterized by a strong buckling of the kagome layers .	The unique ferrimagnetic structure of this cobaltite at 4 K can be described as the assemblage of ferrimagnetic triple chains ( Co1 Co2 Co3 ) running perpendicular to the kagome layers , ferromagnetically coupled within the layers , and antiferromagnetically coupled with a fourth cobalt species Co4 .	The lifting of the geometrical frustration towards ferrimagnetism , which appears in spite of the triangular topology of the cobalt lattice , is explained by the very large structural distortion , charge ordering phenomena and large cobalt valence compared to other LnBaCo4O7 oxides .
4	We then comment on the role of oscillations and the relation to the breakdown of ergodicity .	We study the role of strategy correlations and timing of adaptation for the dynamics of Minority Games , both simulationally and analytically .	Using the exact generating functional approach a la De Dominicis we compute the phase diagram and the behaviour of batch and on-line games with correlated strategies , complementing exisiting replica studies of their statics .	It is shown that the timing of adaptation can be relevant ; while conventional games with uncorrelated strategies are nearly insensitive to the choice of on-line versus batch learning , we find qualitative differences when anti-correlations are present in the strategy assignments .	The available standard approximations for the volatility in terms of persistent order parameters in the stationary ergodic states become unreliable in batch games under such circumstances .
1	Unlike MoS $ _2 $ or WSe $ _2 $ , the optical and electrical properties of ReS $ _2 $ are not isotropic due to the reduced symmetry of the crystal .	ReS $ _2 $ has recently emerged as a new member in the rapidly growing family of two-dimensional materials .	Here , we present layer-dependent Raman measurements of ReS $ _2 $ samples ranging from monolayers to ten layers in the ultralow frequency regime .	We observe layer breathing and shear modes which allow for easy assignment of the number of layers .	Polarization-dependent measurements give further insight into the crystal structure and reveal an energetic shift of the shear mode which stems from the in-plane anisotropy of the shear modulus in this material .
3	The highly elongated bar is expected to fragment into small pieces during the subsequent adiabatic phase .	We have begun a systematic numerical study of the nonlinear growth of nonaxisymmetric perturbations during the ambipolar diffusion-driven evolution of initially magnetically subcritical molecular clouds , with an eye on the formation of binaries , multiple stellar systems and small clusters .	In this initial study , we focus on the $ m=2 $ ( or bar ) mode , which is shown to be unstable during the dynamic collapse phase of cloud evolution after the central region has become magnetically supercritical .	We find that , despite the presence of a strong magnetic field , the bar can grow fast enough that for a modest initial perturbation ( at 5 % level ) a large aspect ratio is obtained during the isothermal phase of cloud collapse .	Our calculations suggest that the strong magnetic fields observed in some star-forming clouds and envisioned in the standard picture of single star formation do not necessarily suppress bar growth and fragmentation ; on the contrary , they may actually promote these processes , by allowing the clouds to have more than one ( thermal ) Jeans mass to begin with without collapsing promptly .
0	We have measured the heat capacity of an optically-trapped , strongly-interacting Fermi gas of atoms .	A precise input of energy to the gas is followed by single-parameter thermometry , which determines the empirical temperature parameter $ \tilde { T } $ of the gas cloud .	Our measurements reveal a clear transition in the heat capacity .	The energy and the spatial profile of the gas are computed using a theory of the crossover from Fermi to Bose superfluids at finite temperature .	The theory calibrates $ \tilde { T } $ , yields excellent agreement with the data , and predicts the onset of superfluidity at the observed transition point .
1	Recently some first quantum cryptographic solutions became available on the market .	Quantum cryptography is going to find practically useful applications .	For clients it is important to be able to compare the quality and properties of the proposed products .	To this end one needs to elaborate on specifications and standards of solutions in quantum cryptography .	We propose and discuss a list of characteristics for the specification , which includes numerical evaluations of the security of solution and can be considered as a standard for quantum key distribution solutions .
4	Results of the Dalitz plot analyses using both models are presented .	The resonant substructures of $ B^0 \to \overline { D } ^0 \pi^+\pi^- $ decays are studied with the Dalitz plot technique .	In this study a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb $ ^ { -1 } $ of $ pp $ collisions collected by the LHCb detector is used .	The branching fraction of the $ B^0 \to \overline { D } ^0 \pi^+\pi^- $ decay in the region $ m ( \overline { D } ^0\pi^ { \pm } ) & gt ; 2.1 $ GeV $ /c^2 $ is measured to be $ ( 8.46 \pm 0.14 \pm 0.29 \pm 0.40 ) \times 10^ { -4 } $ , where the first uncertainty is statistical , the second is systematic and the last arises from the normalisation channel $ B^0 \to D^* ( 2010 ) ^-\pi^+ $ .	The $ \pi^+\pi^- $ S-wave components are modelled with the Isobar and K-matrix formalisms .
3	They also omitted the donor-phonon interaction .	We calculate the optical phonon correction to the binding energy of electrons to donors in cubic materials .	Previous theories calculated the Rydberg energy reduced by the effective mass and the static dielectric function .	They omitted an important energy term from the long-range polarization of the ionized donor , which vanishes for the neutral donor .	Including these terms yields a new formula for the donor binding energy .
1	We cast the theory in terms of a $ GSU ( 2 ) $ connection and we introduce a loop representation .	We study several aspects of the canonical quantization of supergravity in terms of the Asthekar variables .	The solution space is similar to the loop representation of ordinary gravity , the main difference being the form of the Mandelstam identities .	Physical states are in general given by knot invariants that are compatible with the $ GSU ( 2 ) $ Mandelstam identities .	There is an explicit solution to all the quantum constraint equations connected with the Chern-Simons form , which coincides exactly with the Dubrovnik version of the Kauffman Polynomial .
0	We calculate the probability that a Milky-Way-like halo in the standard cosmological model has the observed number of Magellanic Clouds ( MCs ) .	The statistics of the number of MCs in the LCDM model are in good agreement with observations of a large sample of SDSS galaxies .	Under the sub-halo abundance matching assumption of a relationship with small scatter between galaxy r-band luminosities and halo internal velocities v_max , we make detailed comparisons to similar measurements using SDSS DR7 data by Liu et al . ( 2010 ) .	Models and observational data give very similar probabilities for having zero , one , and two MC-like satellites .	In both cases , Milky Way-luminosity hosts have just a \sim 10 % chance of hosting two satellites similar to the Magellanic Clouds .
4	We see that the inclusion of the SU ( 6 ) constraints on $ qD^ { 1 } _ { 1 } $ states with angular momentum L=1 results in a shift of the lightest $ \Delta ( \frac 52^- ) $ isobar to $ \sim 2300 $ MeV .	We continue our attempts to systematize baryons , which are composed of light quarks ( $ q=u , d $ ) , as quark -- diquark systems .	The notion of two diquarks is used : ( i ) $ D^ { 1 } _ { 1 } $ , with the spin $ S_D=1 $ and isospin $ I_D=1 $ and ( ii ) $ D^ { 0 } _ { 0 } $ , with $ S_D=0 $ and $ I_D=0 $ .	Here we try to resolve the problem of the low-lying $ \Delta ( \frac 52^- ) $ states : in the last experiments the lightest state is observed at $ \ga 2200 $ MeV , not at $ 1900 - 2000 $ MeV as it has been stated 20 years ago .	We are looking for different systematization variants with the forbidden low-lying $ \Delta ( \frac 52^- ) $ states in the mass region $ \la 2000 $ MeV .
2	The XMM observations show that the X-ray emission of NGC 7590 is dominated by an off-nuclear ultra-luminous X-ray source ( ULX ) and an extended emission from the host galaxy , and the nucleus is rather weak , likely hosting a Compton-thick AGN .	We present the result of the Chandra high-resolution observation of the Seyfert~2 galaxy NGC 7590 .	This object was reported to show no X-ray absorption in the low-spatial resolution ASCA data .	Our recent Chandra observation of NGC 7590 enables to remove the X-ray contamination from the ULX and the extended component effectively .	The nuclear source remains undetected at ~4x10^ { -15 } erg/s/cm^-2 flux level .
4	We find that the accuracy of inference at fixed N will not be strongly affected by the presently available detection efficiencies if the typical MHO masses are in the range indicated by the events detected so far .	We study the accuracy of inference of the massive halo objects ' ( MHO or `Macho ' ) mass function from microlensing events observed toward LMC .	Assuming the spatial distribution and kinematics of the objects are known , the slope and the range of the MHO mass function ( modeled here by a simple power law ) will be possible to determine from 100-1000 detected events if the slope \alpha is in the range [ -2.5 , -0.5 ] , with the statistical errors reaching their minima at \alpha =-1.5 .	Outside this range the errors grow rapidly making the inference difficult even at very large numbers of events ( N\approx 10000 ) .	On the other hand , the average mass of the MHOs will be determined to better than about 30 % accuracy from N\approx 100 events for any slope .
0	The variation of the expansion rate of the Universe with time produces an evolution in the cosmological redshift of distant sources ( for example quasar Lyman- $ \alpha $ absorption lines ) , that might be directly observed by future ultra stable , high-resolution spectrographs ( such as CODEX ) coupled to extremely large telescopes ( such as European Southern Observatory 's Extremely Large Telescope , ELT ) .	This would open a new window to explore the physical mechanism responsible for the current acceleration of the Universe .	We investigate the evolution of cosmological redshift from a variety of dark energy models , and compare it with simulated data .	We perform a Fisher matrix analysis and discuss the prospects for constraining the parameters of these models and for discriminating among competing candidates .	We find that , because of parameter degeneracies , and of the inherent technical difficulties involved in this kind of observations , the uncertainties on parameter reconstruction can be rather large unless strong external priors are assumed .
1	By comparing results from atomistic computer simulations and calorimetry , we show that increasing plastic deformation of equilibrated NC $ \mathrm { Pd_ { 90 } Au_ { 10 } } $ specimen causes an increase of the stored GB enthalpy $ \Delta \gamma $ .	Grain boundary ( GB ) enthalpies in nanocrystalline ( NC ) $ \mathrm { Pd_ { 90 } Au_ { 10 } } $ are studied after preparation , thermal relaxation and plastic deformation .	We interpret this change of $ \Delta \gamma $ as stress-induced complexion transition from a low-energy to a high-energy GB-core state .	In fact , GBs behave not only as mere sinks and sources of zero- and one-dimensional defects or act as migration barriers to the latter but also have the capability of storing deformation history through configurational changes of their core structure and hence GB enthalpy .	Such a scenario can be understood as a continuous complexion transition under non-equilibrium conditions , which is related to hysteresis effects under loading-unloading conditions .
3	We calculate the critical point , the renormalization of the phonon frequency and the average lattice distortion .	We study the thermal distribution of phonons in a graphene sheet .	Due to the two electronic bands there are two out-of-plane phonon modes with respect to the two sublattices .	One of these modes undergoes an Ising transition by spontaneously breaking the sublattice symmetry .	This transition might be observable in Raman scattering and in transport properties .
4	Here , for the first time , we analytically explore secular dynamics of planetesimals in binaries such as $ \alpha $ Cen and $ \gamma $ Cep under the combined action of ( 1 ) gravity of the eccentric protoplanetary disk , ( 2 ) perturbations due to the ( coplanar ) eccentric companion , and ( 3 ) gas drag .	About $ 20\ % $ of exoplanets discovered by radial velocity surveys reside in stellar binaries .	To clarify their origin one has to understand the dynamics of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks within binaries .	The standard description , accounting for only gas drag and gravity of the companion star has been challenged recently , as the gravity of the protoplanetary disk was shown to play a crucial role in planetesimal dynamics .	An added complication is the tendency of protoplanetary disks in binaries to become eccentric , giving rise to additional excitation of planetesimal eccentricity .
3	For the first time , we present LFI maps in Stokes Q and U polarization .	We present an updated description of the Planck Low Frequency Instrument ( LFI ) data processing pipeline , associated with the 2015 data release .	We point out the places where our results and methods have remained unchanged since the 2013 paper and we highlight the changes made for the 2015 release , describing the products ( especially timelines ) and the ways in which they were obtained .	We demonstrate that the pipeline is self-consistent ( principally based on simulations ) and report all null tests .	We refer to other related papers where more detailed descriptions of the LFI data processing pipeline may be found if needed .
2	Despite the near ubiquity of structural variants , major questions about their interaction with natural selection remain .	Major unresolved questions in evolutionary genetics include determining the contributions of different mutational sources to the total pool of genetic variation in a species , and understanding how these different forms of genetic variation interact with natural selection .	Recent work has shown that structural variants ( insertions , deletions , inversions and transpositions ) are a major source of genetic variation , often out-numbering single nucleotide variants in terms of total bases affected .	For example , how does the allele frequency spectrum of structural variants differ when compared to single nucleotide variants ?	How often do structural variants affect genes , and what are the consequences ?
3	The simulated samples are compared with 18 observed LGRB hosts in the aim at discriminating whether the metallicity is a primary parameter .	We study the implication of the collapsar model for Long Gamma-Ray Bursts ( LGRBs ) on the metallicity properties of the host galaxies , by combining high-resolution N-body simulations with semi-analytic models of galaxy formation .	The cosmological model that we use reproduces the Fundamental Metallicity Relation recently discovered for the SDSS galaxies , whereby the metallicity decreases with increasing Star Formation Rate for galaxies of a given stellar mass .	We select host galaxies housing pockets of gas-particles , young and with different thresholds in metallicities , that can be sites of LRGB events , according to the collapsar model .	We find that a threshold in metallicity for the LGRB progenitors , within the model galaxies , is not necessary in order to reproduce the observed distribution of host metallicities .
3	The maximum value of $ \bar { \mathcal { S } } $ is called the entanglement of assistance ( $ E_A $ ) while the minimum value is called the entanglement of formation ( $ E_F $ ) .	For a general tripartite system in some pure state , an observer possessing any two parts will see them in a mixed state .	By the consequence of Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters theorem , each basis set of local measurement on the third part will correspond to a particular decomposition of the bipartite mixed state into a weighted sum of pure states .	It is possible to associate an average bipartite entanglement ( $ \bar { \mathcal { S } } $ ) with each of these decompositions .	An appropriate choice of the basis set of local measurement will correspond to an optimal value of $ \bar { \mathcal { S } } $ ; we find here a generic optimality condition for the choice of the basis set .
4	The study identified 74 volatile compounds present in at least 10 % of the patient samples .	A pilot study of exhaled volatile compounds and their correlation with blood glucose levels in eight children with type 1 diabetes is reported .	Five paired blood and breath samples were obtained from each child over a 6 hour period .	The blood glucose concentration ranged from 41.4 to 435.6 mg/dL .	Breath samples were collected in Tedlar bags and immediately evacuated through thermal desorption tubes packed with Carbopack B and C. The VOCs were later recovered by thermal desorption and analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry .
1	In this paper , we analyze the light curves of 8 binary lensing events detected through the channel of high-magnification events during the seasons from 2007 to 2010 .	Microlensing can provide a useful tool to probe binary distributions down to low-mass limits of binary companions .	The perturbations , which are confined near the peak of the light curves , can be easily distinguished from the central perturbations caused by planets .	However , the degeneracy between close and wide binary solutions can not be resolved with a $ 3\sigma $ confidence level for 3 events , implying that the degeneracy would be an important obstacle in studying binary distributions .	The dependence of the degeneracy on the lensing parameters is consistent with a theoretic prediction that the degeneracy becomes severe as the binary separation and the mass ratio deviate from the values of resonant caustics .
1	However , the current ER to relational model transformation algorithm is known to be insufficient in providing a complete and accurate representation of the ER model undertaken for transformation .	The entity relationship modelling using the original ER notation has been applauded providing a natural view of data in conceptual modelling of information systems .	In an effort to derive better transformations from ER models , we have understood that modifications should be introduced to both of the existing transformation algorithm as well as to the ER notation .	Introducing some new concepts , we have adapted the original ER notation and developed a new transformation algorithm based on the existing one .	This paper presents the modified ER notation with an ER diagram drawn based on the new notation .
3	The relations between closed and open string amplitudes have new forms .	KLT relations almost factorize closed string amplitudes on $ S_2 $ by two open string tree amplitudes which correspond to the left- and the right- moving sectors .	In this paper , we investigate string amplitudes on $ D_2 $ and $ RP_2 $ .	We find that KLT factorization relations do not hold in these two cases .	On $ D_2 $ and $ RP_2 $ , the left- and the right- moving sectors are connected into a single sector .
1	Of primary interest is the effect of the changing dielectric behavior of the water solvent over this temperature range on this reaction .	The nature of the CH2Cl2 neutral/acidic hydrolysis reaction from ambient to supercritical conditions ( 25 C to 600 C at 246 bar ) is explored .	Experiments reveal that significant CH2Cl2 hydrolysis occurs under subcritical temperatures , while relatively little hydrolysis occurs under supercritical conditions .	These trends can not be explain by simple Arrhenius behavior .	A combination of Kirkwood theory and ab initio modeling provides a means of successfully accounting for this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively .
0	The Great Pyramids of Egypt hide mathematic information unknown up to date .	The measurements of the three Great Pyramids of Egypt at Giza show that Egyptians knew how to calculate the circumference , the volume and the area of the sphere 2000 years before Greeks .	The Bent pyramid shows the three great problems of geometry of antiquity : cubature of the sphere , duplication of the cube , trisection of the angle .	According to these findings , we assert that Egyptians wanted to engrave basic concepts in measures and positions of Great Pyramids. -- Les grandes pyramides d'\'Egypte dissimulent des informations math\'ematiques ignor\'ees jusqu'\`a aujourd'hui .	Les mesures des trois grandes pyramides d'\'Egypte \`a Gizeh r\'ev\`elent que les \'egyptiens de la IVe dynastie savaient calculer la circonf\'erence , le volume et l'aire de la sph\`ere 2000 ans avant les Grecs .
1	This detector , which will be completed by the end of the year 2000 , is devoted to the search of neutrinoless double beta decay with various isotopes .	The NEMO collaboration is presently mounting the NEMO-3 detector in the Fr\'ejus Underground Laboratory .	Much attention has been focused on ^ { 100 } Mo and ^ { 82 } Se with their large Q_ { \beta\beta } -values .	The detector is based on the direct detection of the two electrons by a tracking device and on the measurement of their energies by a calorimeter .	The aim of the experiment is to have a sensitivity for the effective neutrino mass on the order of 0.1 eV .
4	In this short note we will try to answer these questions going beyond common sense and analyzing the current political situation by means of a scientific , original and innovative instrument , i.e.an `` agent-based simulation '' .	The recent 2013 Italian elections are over and the situation that President Napolitano will have to settle soon for the formation of the new government is not the simplest one .	After twenty years of bipolarism ( more or less effective ) , where we were accustomed to a tight battle between two great political coalitions , the center-right and center-left , now , in the new Parliament , we have four political formations .	But is it really this result , as it would seem to suggest our common sense , the prelude to an inevitable phase of ungovernability ?	Can a Parliament with changing majorities in Senate to be as efficient as a Parliament with a large majority in both the Houses ?
4	Within this dissertation , the 38 MeV O ( 8+ ) + C experiment , conducted at Western Michigan University using the tandem Van de Graaff accelerator , is discussed and the first experimental evidence of the RDEC process is presented .	Radiative double electron capture ( RDEC ) is a one-step process where two free ( or quasi-free ) target electrons are captured into a bound state of the projectile , e.g.into an empty K-shell , and the energy excess is released as a single photon .	This process can be treated as a time inverse of double photoionization .	However , unlike in case of photoionization experiments , bare ions are used during RDEC observations .	Thus , RDEC can be considered as the simplest , clean tool for investigation of the electron-electron interaction in the presence of electromagnetic fields generated during ion-atom collisions .
0	Based on the Wilemski-Fixman approach ( J. Chem.Phys .	60 , 866 ( 1974 ) ) we showed that for a flexible chain in theta solvent hydrodynamic interaction treated with an pre-averaging approximation makes ring closing faster if the chain is not very short .	Only for a very short chain the ring closing is slower with hydrodynamic interaction on .	We have also shown that the ring closing time for a chain with hydrodynamic interaction in theta solvent scales with the chain length ( N ) as N^ ( 1.527 ) , in good agreement with previous renormalization group calculation based prediction by Freidman et al . ( Phys.Rev.A .	40 , 5950 ( 1989 ) ) .
0	We study thermodynamic properties of dyonic black hole and its dual field theory .	We observe that the phase diagram of a dyonic black hole in constant electric potential and magnetic charge ensemble is similar to that of a Van der Waals fluid with chemical potential .	Phase transitions and other critical phenomena have been studied in presence of magnetic charge and chemical potential .	We also analyse magnetic properties of dual conformal field theory and observe a ferromagnetic like behavior of boundary theory when the external magnetic field vanishes .	Finally , we compute susceptibility of different phases of boundary CFT and find that , depending on the strength of the external magnetic field and temperature , these phases are either paramagnetic or diamagnetic .
2	Each node of the actin automaton takes state `0 ' ( resting ) or `1 ' ( excited ) and updates its state in discrete time depending on its neighbour 's states .	Actin is a globular protein which forms long filaments in the eukaryotic cytoskeleton , whose roles in cell function include structural support , contractile activity to intracellular signalling .	We model actin filaments as two chains of one-dimensional binary-state semi-totalistic automaton arrays to describe hypothetical signalling events therein .	We analyse the complete rule space of actin automata using integral characteristics of space-time configurations generated by these rules and compute state transition rules that support travelling and mobile localizations .	Approaches towards selection of the localisation supporting rules using the global characteristics are outlined .
1	In this paper , we define a graph for each Hecke operator with fixed ramification .	Let $ X $ be a curve over $ \F_q $ with function field $ F $ .	A priori , these graphs can be seen as a convenient language to organize formulas for the action of Hecke operators on automorphic forms .	However , they will prove to be a powerful tool for explicit calculations and proofs of finite dimensionality results .	We develop a structure theory for certain graphs $ G_x $ of unramified Hecke operators , which is of a similar vein to Serre 's theory of quotients of Bruhat Tits trees .
0	The scalability of statistical estimators is of increasing importance in modern applications .	One approach to implementing scalable algorithms is to compress data into a low dimensional latent space using dimension reduction methods .	In this paper we develop an approach for dimension reduction that exploits the assumption of low rank structure in high dimensional data to gain both computational and statistical advantages .	We adapt recent randomized low-rank approximation algorithms to provide an efficient solution to principal component analysis ( PCA ) , and we use this efficient solver to improve parameter estimation in large-scale linear mixed models ( LMM ) for association mapping in statistical and quantitative genomics .	A key observation in this paper is that randomization serves a dual role , improving both computational and statistical performance by implicitly regularizing the covariance matrix estimate of the random effect in a LMM .
3	In our method , a background model is used in which the background is learned adaptively as the compressive measurements are processed .	We address the problem of reconstructing and analyzing surveillance videos using compressive sensing .	We develop a new method that performs video reconstruction by low rank and sparse decomposition adaptively .	Background subtraction becomes part of the reconstruction .	The adaptive method has low latency , and is more robust than previous methods .
2	In non-integrable regimes we have found eigenvalue repulsion as for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble in random matrix theory .	The full spectrum of transfer matrices of the general eight-vertex model on a square lattice is obtained by numerical diagonalization .	The eigenvalue spacing distribution and the spectral rigidity are analyzed .	By contrast , in integrable regimes we have found eigenvalue independence leading to a Poissonian behavior , and , for some points , level clustering .	These first examples from classical statistical mechanics suggest that the conjecture of integrability successfully applied to quantum spin systems also holds for classical systems .
4	Due to increased energy consumption in the information and communication technology ( ICT ) industries , and its consequent environmental effects , energy efficiency has become a key factor to evaluate the performance of a communication network .	Reducing CO2 emissions is an important global environmental issue .	Over the recent years , wireless and mobile communications have increasingly become popular with consumers .	An increasingly popular type of wireless access is the so-called Wireless Mesh Networks ( WMNs ) that provide wireless connectivity through much cheaper and more flexible backhaul infrastructure compared with wired solutions .	Wireless Mesh Network ( WMN ) is an emerging new technology which is being adopted as the wireless internetworking solution for the near future .
0	This paper focuses on the consensus and formation problems of multiagent systems under unknown persistent disturbances .	Specifically , we propose a novel method that combines an existing consensus ( or formation ) algorithm with a new controller .	The new controller has an integral action that produces a control input based on an error signal locally projected onto the column space of the graph Laplacian .	This action allows agents to achieve a consensus or a predetermined formation objective under constant or time-varying disturbances .	This study has analyzed the stability properties of this architecture and provides several illustrative examples to demonstrate the proposed approach .
3	In response to feedbacks and suggestions , we upgraded it to a `` Presentation Review '' of which we provide here the Explanatory Notes , the link to the .pptx file , and some image of the slides .	The Seminar `` Dark Matter in Galaxies '' was delivered , within the Dark Matter Awareness Week ( 1-8 December 2010 ) at 140 institutes in 46 countries and it was followed by 4200 people .	A documentation of this worldwide initiative is at http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=AOBit8a-1Fw .	A reference presentation , prepared by a coordinated pool of leading scientists in the field , was available to speakers .	This Presentation Review is an innovative scientific product to meet the request of information about the phenomenology of the DM mystery at galactic scale .
2	We show that a key property which sets the fate of bubbles in the ISM is the gas surface density , through the work done by the expansion of bubbles and its role in setting the gas scaleheight .	We present a dynamical model of supernova feedback which follows the evolution of pressurised bubbles driven by supernovae in a multi-phase interstellar medium ( ISM ) .	The bubbles are followed until the point of break-out into the halo , starting from an initial adiabatic phase to a radiative phase .	The multi-phase description of the ISM is essential , and neglecting it leads to order of magnitude differences in the predicted outflow rates .	We compare our predicted mass loading and outflow velocities to observations of local and high-redshift galaxies and find good agreement over a wide range of stellar masses and velocities .
1	The privileged frame defined by the background vector diagonalises the deformed mass-shell and provides an anisotropic observer transformations .	We study the symmetries of the Lorentz violating Randers-Finsler spacetime .	The particle Randers transformations are achieved through the Finslerian Killing equation which also shows the equivalence between observer and particle Randers transformation .	For a constant background vector , the Randers transformations can be regarded as a deformed directional-dependent Poincar\'e transformation .	The Randers algebra is a deformed Poincar\'e algebra whose structure coefficients are given by the Randers metric .
1	We call this duality Spin ( 7 ) duality .	In this paper we propose a duality for non-holomorphic N=1 CS-matter theories living on M2 branes probing Spin ( 7 ) cones .	Two theories are named Spin ( 7 ) dual if they have the same moduli space : a real Spin ( 7 ) cone with base a weak G_2 manifold , and they are hence holographic dual to the same AdS_4 x G_2 M theory solution .	We provide a systematic way to generate these dualities , derived by combining toric duality for N=2 CS-matter theories and generalized non-holomorphic orientifold projections to N=1 .	Brane construction , AdS/CFT correspondence , and the computation of the moduli space support our proposal at the classical level and provide some arguments at the quantum strong coupling regime .
4	We show that the Bloch spectrum determines the Albanese torus , the block structure and the planarity of the graph .	We show that families of leafless quantum graphs that are isospectral for the standard Laplacian are finite .	We show that the minimum edge length is a spectral invariant .	We give an upper bound for the size of isospectral families in terms of the total edge length of the quantum graphs .	We define the Bloch spectrum of a quantum graph to be the map that assigns to each element in the deRham cohomology the spectrum of an associated magnetic Schr\ '' odinger operator .
3	We observed that , in the center of this quadrupolar AR , a highly sheared polarity inversion line ( PIL ) was formed through proper motions of the major magnetic elements , which built a sheared coronal arcade lying over the PIL .	We report a detailed event analysis on the M6.6-class flare in the active region ( AR ) NOAA 11158 on 2011 February 13 .	AR 11158 , which consisted of two major emerging bipoles , showed prominent activities including one X- and several M-class flares .	In order to investigate the magnetic structures related to the M6.6 event , particularly the formation process of a flare-triggering magnetic region , we analyzed multiple spacecraft observations and numerical results of a flare simulation .	The observations lend support to the interpretation that the target flare was triggered by a localized magnetic region that had an intrusive structure , namely a positive polarity penetrating into a negative counterpart .
2	In this interdisciplinary study we work to overcome a number of computational limitations within these current models .	Studies on social networks have proved that endogenous and exogenous factors influence dynamics .	Two streams of modeling exist on explaining the dynamics of social networks : 1 ) models predicting links through network properties , and 2 ) models considering the effects of social attributes .	We employ a mean-field model which allows for the construction of a population-specific socially informed model for predicting links from both network and social properties in large social networks .	The model is tested on a population of conference coauthorship behavior , considering a number of parameters from available Web data .
0	We investigate how generic the onset of chaos in interacting many-body classical systems is in the context of lattices of classical spins with nearest neighbor anisotropic couplings .	Seven large lattices in different spatial dimensions were considered .	For each lattice , more than 2000 largest Lyapunov exponents for randomly sampled Hamiltonians were numerically computed .	Our results strongly suggest the absence of integrable nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians for the infinite lattices except for the trivial Ising case .	In the vicinity of the Ising case , the largest Lyapunov exponents exhibit a power-law growth , while further away they become rather weakly sensitive to the Hamiltonian anisotropy .
4	Experiments with a large image database suggest that , relative to existing schemes , our turbo LBP approach yields state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with substantial reduction in complexity .	We propose a novel algorithm for compressive imaging that exploits both the sparsity and persistence across scales found in the 2D wavelet transform coefficients of natural images .	Like other recent works , we model wavelet structure using a hidden Markov tree ( HMT ) but , unlike other works , ours is based on loopy belief propagation ( LBP ) .	For LBP , we adopt a recently proposed `` turbo '' message passing schedule that alternates between exploitation of HMT structure and exploitation of compressive-measurement structure .	For the latter , we leverage Donoho , Maleki , and Montanari 's recently proposed approximate message passing ( AMP ) algorithm .
1	His motivation was the desire for an accurate one-parameter profile form with a simple Fourier transform ( in contrast to the Fourier transform of the Sersic profile which ca n't be written in closed form ) , but we have found that the Spergel profile almost universally makes integrals easier when it replaces the Sersic profile in the integrand .	In 2010 Spergel introduced an alternative to the traditional Sersic form for galactic luminosity profiles based on modified Bessel functions of the second kind .	In the original paper on the subject Spergel noted that his profile seems to fit galaxies on average just as well as Sersic 's .	Here we make this observation quantitative by comparing the residuals from fitting Sersic and Spergel forms to data .	We find that the Spergel profile actually fits better than the Sersic for a random sample of 16 galaxies .
2	We extract the finite part of spurious external-bubble contributions systematically ; this is crucial for the application of integrand-level CSW rules in theories without supersymmetry .	We use massive CSW rules to derive explicit compact expressions for integrands of rational terms in QCD with any number of external legs .	Specifically , we present all-n integrands for the one-loop all-plus and one-minus gluon amplitudes in QCD .	Our approach yields integrands that are independent of the choice of CSW reference spinor even before integration .	Furthermore , we present a recursive derivation of the recently proposed massive CSW-style vertex expansion for massive tree amplitudes and loop integrands on the Coulomb-branch of N=4 SYM .
1	The spectra are centered around He I 10830 A , which is formed in the wind of those stars , and is a crucial line to obtain their physical parameters .	We present a digital atlas of peculiar , high-luminosity massive stars in the near-infrared region ( 10470-11000 A ) at medium resolution ( R~7000 ) .	The instrumental configuration also sampled a rich variety of emission lines of Fe II , Mg II , C I , N I and Pa gamma .	Secure identifications for most spectral lines are given , based on synthetic atmosphere models calculated by our group .	We also propose that two unidentified absorption features have interstellar and/or circumstellar origin .
4	The [ CN ] / [ N2 H+ ] ratio is well correlated with the H ( 41 ) a emission at all spatial scales down to 100 pc .	We present interferometric observations of the CN 1-0 ( 113.491 GHz ) , N2H+ 1-0 ( 93.173 GHz ) , H ( 41 ) a ( 92.034 GHz ) , CH3CN ( 91.987 GHz ) , CS 3-2 ( 146.969 GHz ) , c-C3H2 3-2 ( 145.089 GHz ) , H2CO 2-1 ( 145.603 GHz ) and HC3N 16-15 ( 145.601 GHz ) lines towards M82 , carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer ( PdBI ) .	PDR chemical modelling is used to interpret these observations .	Our results show that the abundances of N2H+ , CS and H13 CO+ remain quite constant across the galaxy confirming that these species are excellent tracers of the dense molecular gas .	On the contrary , the abundance of CN increases by a factor of 3 in the inner x2 bar orbits .
1	Spatial maps of wave traveltimes and amplitudes are measured from the cross-covariance function of the random wave field .	We observe and characterize the scattering of acoustic wave packets by a sunspot , in a regime where the wavelength is comparable to the size of the sunspot .	The averaging procedure is such that incoming wave packets are plane wave packets .	Observations show that the magnitude of the traveltime perturbation caused by the sunspot diminishes as waves propagate away from the sunspot -- a finite-wavelength phenomenon known as wavefront healing .	Observations also show a reduction of the amplitude of the waves after their passage through the sunspot .
3	IR-calc has the right strength : it is sound and complete .	We examine the existing Resolution systems for quantified Boolean formulas ( QBF ) and answer the question which of these calculi can be lifted to the more powerful Dependency QBFs ( DQBF ) .	An interesting picture emerges : While for QBF we have the strict chain of proof systems Q-Resolution & lt ; IR-calc & lt ; IRM-calc , the situation is quite different in DQBF .	Q-Resolution and likewise universal Resolution are too weak : they are not complete .	IRM-calc is too strong : it is not sound any more , and the same applies to long-distance Resolution .
3	The obtained relation is confirmed by the direct numerical simulation of random trajectory of a magnetotactic bacterium under the action of the Poisson type internal noise due to the random switching of rotary motors .	Properties of active colloids of circle swimmers are reviewed .	As an particular example of active magnetic colloids the magnetotactic bacteria under the action of a rotating magnetic field is considered .	The relation for a diffusion coefficient due to the random switching of the direction of rotation of their rotary motors is derived on the basis of the master equation .	The results obtained are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the available experimental results and allows one to determine the characteristic time between the switching events of a rotary motor of the bacterium .
0	Observations indicate that in plage areas ( i.e.in active regions outside sunspots ) acoustic waves travel faster than in quiet sun , leading to shortened travel times and higher p-mode frequencies .	While it is clear that the ultimate cause of any difference between quiet sun and plage is the presence of magnetic fields of order 100 G in the latter , the mechanism by which the magnetic field exerts its influence has not yet been conclusively identified .	One possible such mechanism is suggested by the observation that granular motions in plage areas tend to be slightly `` abnormal '' , dampened compared to quiet sun .	In this paper we consider the effect that abnormal granulation observed in active regions should have on the propagation of acoustic waves .	Any such effect is found to be limited to a shallow surface layer where sound waves propagate nearly vertically .
0	Glycosylation is a highly complex process to produce a diverse repertoire of cellular glycans that are attached to proteins and lipids .	Glycans are involved in fundamental biological processes , including protein folding and clearance , cell proliferation and apoptosis , development , immune responses , and pathogenesis .	One of the major types of glycans , N-linked glycans , is formed by sequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of enzymes .	Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as substrates , thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their intermingled pathways .	Motivated by the quantitative methods developed in complex network research , we investigated the large-scale organization of such N-linked glycosylation pathways in mammalian cells .
1	This allows one to gather detailed information on the spread of the HIV epidemic .	An individual detected as HIV positive in Cuba is asked to provide a list of his/her sexual contacts for the previous 2 years .	Here we study the evolution of the sexual contact graph of detected individuals and also the directed graph of HIV infections .	The study covers the Cuban HIV epidemic between the years 1986 and 2004 inclusive and is motivated by an earlier study on the static properties of the network at the end of 2004 .	We use a variety of advanced graph algorithms to paint a picture of the growth of the epidemic , including an examination of diameters , geodesic distances , community structure and centrality amongst others characteristics .
3	By comparing with the exact analytic results by Scoccimarro & amp ; Frieman ( 1996 ) , it is shown that , at least for the unsmoothed case , the loop corrections to the cumulants of $ \theta $ are dominated by tidal effects .	Cosmological Perturbation Theory ( PT ) is a useful tool to study the cumulants of the density and velocity fields in the large scale structure of the Universe .	In Papers I & amp ; II of this series we saw that the Spherical Collapse ( SC ) model provides with the exact solution to PT at tree-level and gives a good approximation to the loop corrections ( next to leading orders ) , indicating negligible tidal effects .	Here , we derive predictions for the ( smoothed ) cumulants of the velocity divergence field $ \theta \equiv \nabla\cdot\vv $ for an irrotational fluid in the SC model .	However , most of the tidal contribution seems to cancel out when computing the hierarchical ratios , $ T_J = { & lt ; \theta^J & gt ; / & lt ; \theta^2 & gt ; ^ { J-1 } } $ .
0	We study theoretically the quantum motion of a neutron in a horizontal wave-guide in the gravitational field of the Earth .	The wave-guide in question is equipped with a mirror below and a rough absorber above .	We show that such a system acts as a quantum filter , i.e.it effectively absorbs quantum states with sufficiently high transversal energy but transmits low-energy states .	The states transmitted are mainly determined by the potential well formed by the gravitational field of the Earth and the mirror .	The formalism developed for quantum motion in an absorbing wave-guide is applied to the description of the recent experiment on the observation of the quantum states of neutrons in the Earth 's gravitational field .
0	We study a generalization of the classic paging problem that allows the amount of available memory to vary over time - capturing a fundamental property of many modern computing realities , from cloud computing to multi-core and energy-optimized processors .	It turns out that good performance in the `` classic '' case provides no performance guarantees when memory capacity fluctuates : roughly speaking , moving from static to dynamic capacity can mean the difference between optimality within a factor 2 in space and time , and suboptimality by an arbitrarily large factor .	More precisely , adopting the competitive analysis framework , we show that some online paging algorithms , despite having an optimal ( h , k ) -competitive ratio when capacity remains constant , are not ( 3 , k ) -competitive for any arbitrarily large k in the presence of minimal capacity fluctuations .	In this light it is surprising that several classic paging algorithms perform remarkably well even if memory capacity changes adversarially - even without taking those changes into explicit account !	In particular , we prove that LFD still achieves the minimum number of faults , and that several classic online algorithms such as LRU have a `` dynamic '' ( h , k ) -competitive ratio that is the best one can achieve without knowledge of future page requests , even if one had perfect knowledge of future capacity fluctuations ( an exact characterization of this ratio shows it is almost , albeit not quite , equal to the `` classic '' ratio k/ ( k-h+1 ) ) .
3	Such postulates enable us to reason about selecting alternative change options , and consequently to develop a machinery that automatically performs this task .	A critical issue in the evolution of software models is change propagation : given a primary change that is made to a model in order to meet a new or changed requirement , what additional secondary changes are needed to maintain consistency within the model , and between the model and other models in the system ?	In practice , there are many ways of propagating changes to fix a given inconsistency , and how to justify and automate the selection between such change options remains a critical challenge .	In this paper , we propose a number of postulates , inspired by the mature belief revision theory , that a change propagation process should satisfy to be considered rational and minimal .	We further argue that a possible implementation of such a change propagation process can be considered as a classical state space search in which each state represents a snapshot of the model in the process .
3	Contrast this with QCD where the spectral density of the current-current correlator approaches the zero temperature result like $ ( T/\omega ) ^4 $ .	We compute spectral densities of momentum and R-charge correlators in thermal $ \N=4 $ Yang Mills at strong coupling using the AdS/CFT correspondence .	For $ \omega \sim T $ and smaller , the spectral density differs markedly from perturbation theory ; there is no kinetic theory peak .	For large $ \omega $ , the spectral density oscillates around the zero-temperature result with an exponentially decreasing amplitude .	Despite these marked differences with perturbation theory , in Euclidean space-time the correlators differ by only $ \sim 10 % $ from the free result .
0	Learning problems in the text processing domain often map the text to a space whose dimensions are the measured features of the text , e.g. , its words .	Three characteristic properties of this domain are ( a ) very high dimensionality , ( b ) both the learned concepts and the instances reside very sparsely in the feature space , and ( c ) a high variation in the number of active features in an instance .	In this work we study three mistake-driven learning algorithms for a typical task of this nature -- text categorization .	We argue that these algorithms -- which categorize documents by learning a linear separator in the feature space -- have a few properties that make them ideal for this domain .	We then show that a quantum leap in performance is achieved when we further modify the algorithms to better address some of the specific characteristics of the domain .
2	A special law of variation for the Hubble parameter proposed by Berman ( 1983 ) has been utilized to solve the field equations .	The paper deals with a spatially homogeneous and isotropic FRW space-time filled with perfect fluid and dark energy components .	The two sources are assumed to interact minimally , and therefore their energy momentum tensors are conserved separately .	The Berman 's law yields two explicit forms of the scale factor governing the FRW space-time and constant values of deceleration parameter .	The role of dark energy with variable equation of state parameter has been studied in detail in the evolution of FRW universe .
4	For the contact process , surprisingly good estimates of critical parameters are obtained from a small-cell renormalisation .	The stationary state of stochastic processes such as reaction-diffusion systems can be related to the ground state of a suitably defined quantum Hamiltonian .	Using this analogy , we investigate the applicability of a real space renormalisation group approach , originally developped for quantum spin systems , to interacting particle systems .	We apply the technique to an exactly solvable reaction-diffusion system and to the contact process ( both in $ d=1 $ ) .	In the former case , several exact results are recovered .
4	Here , we report a new strategy to lase , where atomically thin crystalline semiconductor , i.e. , a tungsten-diselenide ( WSe2 ) monolayer , is nondestructively and deterministically introduced as a gain medium at the surface of a pre-fabricated PhCC .	Engineering the electromagnetic environment of a nanoscale light emitter by a photonic cavity can significantly enhance its spontaneous emission rate through cavity quantum electrodynamics in the Purcell regime .	This effect can greatly reduce the lasing threshold of the emitter , providing the ultimate low-threshold laser system with small footprint , low power consumption and ultrafast modulation .	A state-of-the-art ultra-low threshold nanolaser has been successfully developed though embedding quantum dots into photonic crystal cavity ( PhCC ) .	However , several core challenges impede the practical applications of this architecture , including the random positions and compositional fluctuations of the dots , extreme difficulty in current injection , and lack of compatibility with electronic circuits .
2	The instanton solutions of the corresponding Euclidean equations of motion are found by numerical calculations .	We investigate the cosmological model with complex scalar self-interacting inflaton field non-minimally coupled to gravity .	The different geometries of the Euclidean classically forbidden regions are represented .	These solutions give a rather non-trivial examples of real tunnelling geometries .	Possible interpretation of obtained results and their connection with inflationary cosmology is discussed .
4	In this paper , the design results of the extraction system were reported in detail .	The 28 GHz ECR ( Electron Cyclotron Resonance ) ion source is under development to supply various beams from proton to uranium at RISP ( Rare Isotope Science Project ) .	The superconducting magnet system for a 28 GHz ECR ion source consists of four solenoid coils and a saddle type sextupole .	To meet the design requirement of ECR ion source , a numerical simulation was accomplished by using the KOBRA3-INP to optimize the extraction system which is the three dimensional ion optics code .	The influence of the three dimensional magnetic field and the space charge effect was considered to extract the highly charged ion beam .
2	In this work , the base opening process was first enforced by atomistic pulling simulations and then analyzed with a novel reweighting scheme which allowed the free-energy profile along any suitable reaction coordinate , e.g.solvation , to be reconstructed .	The forming and melting of complementary base pairs in RNA duplexes are conformational transitions required to accomplish a plethora of biological functions .	Yet the dynamic steps of these transitions have not been quantitatively characterized at the molecular level .	The systematic application of such approach to different base-pair combinations provides a molecular motion picture of helix opening which is validated by comparison with an extensive set of experimental observations and links them to the enzyme-dependent unwinding mechanism .	The RNA intrinsic dynamics disclosed in this work could rationalize the directionality observed in RNA-processing molecular machineries .
3	The 17 Very Red Objects ( VROs ; 3.5 & lt ; I-K ' & lt ; 4 ) are also significantly detected ( 1.32 +/- 0.19 mJy ) , bringing the combined VRO and ERO contribution to 2.59 +/- 0.19 x 10^4 mJy per square degree .	We use deep near-infrared and submillimeter observations of three massive lensing cluster fields , A370 , A851 , and A2390 , to determine the average submillimeter properties of a K'-selected sample .	The 38 Extremely Red Objects ( EROs ; I-K ' & gt ; 4 ) with K ' & lt ; 21.25 have a very significant error-weighted mean 850-micron flux of 1.58 +/- 0.13 mJy .	The ERO contribution to the 850-micron background is 1.88 +/- 0.16 x 10^4 mJy per square degree , or about half the background light .	There is a substantial systematic uncertainty ( about a factor of two ) in this value due to field-to-field variation , but even with this uncertainty it is clear that a large fraction of the 850-micron background arises from red objects .
1	First , we discuss the peculiarities that may occur if the Hilbert space of a bi-partite system is infinite-dimensional , most notably the fact that the set of states with infinite entropy of entanglement is trace-norm dense in state space , implying that in any neighborhood of every product state there lies an arbitrarily strongly entangled state .	We investigate entanglement measures in the infinite-dimensional regime .	The starting point for a clarification of this counterintuitive property is the observation that if one imposes the natural and physically reasonable constraint that the mean energy is bounded from above , then the entropy of entanglement becomes a trace-norm continuous functional .	The considerations will then be extended to the asymptotic limit , and we will prove some asymptotic continuity properties .	We proceed by investigating the entanglement of formation and the relative entropy of entanglement in the infinite-dimensional setting .
2	We apply $ 2FACE $ to a variety of geometric routing algorithms .	We propose bi-directional face traversal algorithm $ 2FACE $ to shorten the path the message takes to reach the destination in geometric routing .	Our algorithm combines the practicality of the best single-direction traversal algorithms with the worst case message complexity of $ O ( |E| ) $ , where $ E $ is the number of network edges .	Our simulation results indicate that bi-directional face traversal decreases the latency of message delivery two to three times compared to single direction face traversal .	The thus selected path approaches the shortest possible route .
0	Chains of magnetic impurities placed on a superconducting substrate and forming helical spin order provide a promising venue for realizing a topological superconducting phase .	An effective tight-binding description of such helical Shiba chains involves long-range ( power-law ) hopping and pairing amplitudes which induce an unconventional topological critical point .	At the critical point , we find exponentially localized Majorana bound states with a short localization length unrelated to a topological gap .	Away from the critical point , this exponential decay develops a power-law tail .	Our analytical results have encouraging implications for experiment .
4	We show that the indications of the kaonic bound states can be observed in the outgoing proton energy spectra .	We study the kaonic atom and kaonic nucleus formation by the in-flight ( $ K^- , p $ ) reactions for C , O , Si and Ca target cases theoretically .	Deeply bound kaonic atoms were predicted to exist as quasi-stable states and were expected to be observed in some proper experimental methods .	Kaonic nuclear states are also expected to exist with large decay widths .	We evaluate the formation cross sections of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei using an effective number approach .
3	In a previous paper , we proved a discrete Gauss-Green identity for infinite networks which produces a boundary representation for harmonic functions of finite energy , given as a certain limit .	We study the boundary theory of a connected weighted graph $ G $ from the viewpoint of stochastic integration .	For the Hilbert space \HE of Dirichlet-finite functions on $ G $ , we construct a Gel'fand triple $ S \ci { \mathcal H } _ { \mathcal E } \ci S ' $ .	This yields a probability measure $ \mathbb { P } $ on $ S ' $ and an isometric embedding of $ { \mathcal H } _ { \mathcal E } $ into $ L^2 ( S ' , \mathbb { P } ) $ , and hence gives a concrete representation of the boundary as a certain class of `` distributions '' in $ S ' $ .	In this paper , we use techniques from stochastic integration to make the boundary $ \operatorname { bd } G $ precise as a measure space , and obtain a boundary integral representation as an integral over $ S ' $ .
0	We develop a theory of interaction effects in graphene superlattices , where tunable superlattice periodicity can be used as a knob to control the gap at the Dirac point .	Applied to graphene on hexa-boron-nitride ( G/h-BN ) , our theory predicts substantial many-body enhancement of this gap .	Tunable by the moire superlattice periodicity , a few orders of magnitude enhancement is reachable under optimal conditions .	The Dirac point gap enhancement can be much larger than that of the minigaps opened by Bragg scattering at principal superlattice harmonics .	This naturally explains the conundrum of large Dirac point gaps recently observed in G/h-BN heterostructures and their tunability by the G/h-BN twist angle .
0	We formulate an approach to the geometry of Riemann-Cartan spaces provided with nonholonomic distributions defined by generic off-diagonal and nonsymmetric metrics inducing effective nonlinear and affine connections .	Such geometries can be modelled by moving nonholonomic frames on ( pseudo ) Riemannian manifolds and describe various types of nonholonomic Einstein , Eisenhart-Moffat and Finsler-Lagrange spaces with connections compatible to a general nonsymmetric metric structure .	Elaborating a metrization procedure for arbitrary distinguished connections , we define the class of distinguished linear connections which are compatible with the nonlinear connection and general nonsymmetric metric structures .	The nonsymmetric gravity theory is formulated in terms of metric compatible connections .	Finally , there are constructed such nonholonomic deformations of geometric structures when the Einstein and/or Lagrange-Finsler manifolds are transformed equivalently into spaces with generic local anisotropy induced by nonsymmetric metrics and generalized connections .
3	[ +0.41/-0.32 ] ( syst . )	A measurement is presented of the ZZ production cross section in the ZZ to 2l 2l ' decay mode with l = e , mu and l ' = e , mu , tau in proton-proton collisions at sqrt ( s ) = 7 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC .	Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns .	The measured cross section sigma ( pp to ZZ ) = 6.24 [ +0.86/-0.80 ] ( stat . )	+/- 0.14 ( lumi . )
4	We observe highly efficient transmission of light for various waveguides .	We investigate numerically optical properties of novel two-dimensional photonic materials where parallel dielectric rods are randomly placed with the restriction that the distance between rods is larger than a certain value .	A large complete photonic gap ( PG ) is found when rods have sufficient density and dielectric contrast .	Our result shows that neither long-range nor short-range order is an essential prerequisite to the formation of PGs .	A universal principle is proposed for designing arbitrarily shaped waveguides , where waveguides are fenced with side walls of periodic rods and surrounded by the novel photonic materials .
1	The introduction of a periodicity in the third direction ( perpendicular to the layer ) is completely artificial and may lead in some cases to spurious results and to difficulties in treating the action of external fields .	Ab initio electronic structure calculations of two-dimensional layered structures are typically performed using codes that were developed for three-dimensional structures , which are periodic in all three directions .	In this paper we develop a new approach , which is `` native '' to quasi-2D materials , making use of basis function that are periodic in the plane , but atomic-like in the perpendicular direction .	We show how some of the basic tools of ab initio electronic structure theory -- density functional theory , GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation -- are implemented in the new basis .	We argue that the new approach will be preferable to the conventional one in treating the peculiarities of layered materials , including the long range of the unscreened Coulomb interaction in insulators , and the effects of strain , corrugations , and external fields .
1	The theorem of existence of solution of the Dirac equationrequires an important modification to the Dirac angular momentum constantthat was defined by Dirac 's algebra .	Using the China unitary principle to test the Dirac theoryfor the hydrogen atomic spectrum shows that the standard Dirac function withthe Dirac energy levels is only one the formal solutions of theDirac-Coulomb equation , which conceals some pivotal mathematicalcontradictions .	It derives the modified radial Diracequation which has the consistency solution involving the quantum neutronradius and the neutron binding energy .	The inevitable solution for otheratomic energy states is only equivalent to the Bohr solution .	It concludesthat the Dirac equation is more suitable to describe the structure ofneutron .
3	The coupled ladder equations are derived as an approximation of CC theory , leaving out particle-hole and non-linear diagrams from the CC doubles amplitude equation .	The aim of this work is to develop the relevant formalism for performing coupled-cluster ( CC ) calculations in nuclear matter and neutron star matter , including thereby important correlations to infinite order in the interaction and testing modern nuclear forces based on chiral effective field theory .	Our formalism includes the exact treatment of the so-called Pauli operator in a partial wave expansion of the equation of state .	Nuclear and neutron matter calculations are done using a coupled particle-particle and hole-hole ladder approximation .	This study is a first step toward CC calculations for nuclear and neutron matter .
2	For sufficiently many fundamental flavors , chiral symmetry is restored via a bulk , first-order transition .	It is widely believed that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken at zero temperature in the strong coupling limit of staggered fermions , for any number of colors and flavors .	Using Monte Carlo simulations , we show that this conventional wisdom , based on a mean-field analysis , is wrong .	This chirally symmetric phase appears to be analytically connected with the expected conformal window of many-flavor continuum QCD .	We perform simulations in the chirally symmetric phase at zero quark mass for various system sizes L , and measure the torelon mass and the Dirac spectrum .
4	The ensuing critical behavior is that of the standard equilibrium model H. At the novel unstable fixed point , the temperature ratio for the dynamic variables is renormalized to infinity , resulting in an effective decoupling between the two modes .	Second-order phase transitions in a non-equilibrium liquid-gas model with reversible mode couplings , i.e. , model H for binary-fluid critical dynamics , are studied using dynamic field theory and the renormalization group .	The system is driven out of equilibrium either by considering different values for the noise strengths in the Langevin equations describing the evolution of the dynamic variables ( effectively placing these at different temperatures ) , or more generally by allowing for anisotropic noise strengths , i.e. , by constraining the dynamics to be at different temperatures in d_par- and d_perp-dimensional subspaces , respectively .	In the first , case , we find one infrared-stable and one unstable renormalization group fixed point .	At the stable fixed point , detailed balance is dynamically restored , with the two noise strengths becoming asymptotically equal .
1	Hence thermodynamic experiments can not distinguish between phenomena occurring in a thermal bath of temperature T in the inertial frame from those in a frame accelerating through inertial vacuum with the acceleration $ a=2\pi T $ .	The existence of Davies-Unruh temperature in a uniformly accelerated frame shows that quantum fluctuations of the inertial vacuum state appears as thermal fluctuations in the accelerated frame .	We show that this indisguishability between quantum fluctuations and thermal fluctuations goes far beyond the fluctuations in the vacuum state .	We show by an exact calculation , that the reduced density matrix for a uniformly accelerated observer when the quantum field is in a thermal state of temperature $ T^\prime $ is symmetric between acceleration temperature $ T = a/ ( 2\pi ) $ and the thermal bath temperature $ T^\prime $ .	Thus thermal phenomena can not distinguish whether ( i ) one is accelerating with $ a = 2\pi T $ through a bath of temperature $ T^\prime $ or ( ii ) accelerating with $ a=2\pi T^\prime $ through a bath of temperature T. This shows that thermal and quantum fluctuations in an accelerated frame affect the observer in a symmetric manner .
0	The conjecture that several recently observed mesons have a structure , which is not dominated by an ordinary quark-antiquark pair , but by a four-quark structure , is being actively investigated both theoretical and experimentally .	Such a state may be characterized as a mesonic molecule or as a diquark-antidiquark pair .	Lattice QCD provides a theoretically sound framework to study such states .	To quantitatively investigate the internal structure of such mesons , one needs to precisely compute correlation matrices containing several interpolating operators including two and four quarks .	Here we discuss certain technical aspects of such correlation matrices suited to study tetraquark candidates with $ J^P = 0^+ $ and flavor structure $ q_1 \bar { q_2 } q_3 \bar { q } _3 $ , e.g.\ the $ a_0 ( 980 ) $ meson , the $ D_ { s0 } ^\ast $ meson and some of the charged $ c \bar { c } $ $ X $ states .
0	We show that , in the continuum limit , the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems defined on a lattice with long-range couplings is well described by the Vlasov equation .	This equation can be linearized around the homogeneous state and a dispersion relation , that depends explicitly on the Fourier modes of the lattice , can be derived .	This allows one to compute the stability thresholds of the homogeneous state , which turn out to depend on the mode number .	When this state is unstable , the growth rates are also function of the mode number .	Explicit calculations are performed for the $ \alpha $ -HMF model with $ 0 \leq \alpha & lt ; 1 $ , for which the zero mean-field mode is always found to dominate the exponential growth .
1	Central to this picture is a putative accretion disk which is believed to be the source of the majority of the radiative output .	Quasars are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes accreting surrounding gas .	It is well known , however , that the most extensively studied disk model -- an optically thick disk which is heated locally by the dissipation of gravitational binding energy -- is apparently contradicted by observations in a few major respects .	In particular , the model predicts a specific blue spectral shape asymptotically from the visible to the near-infrared , but this is not generally seen in the visible wavelength region where the disk spectrum is observable .	A crucial difficulty was that , toward the infrared , the disk spectrum starts to be hidden under strong hot dust emission from much larger but hitherto unresolved scales , and thus has essentially been impossible to observe .
3	We argue that a convenient manifestly ultraviolet convergent low energy limit of type I string theory is given by an effective field theory with an arbitrary cutoff $ \Lambda $ in the closed ( gravitational ) channel and a related cutoff $ M_s^2/\Lambda $ in the open ( Yang-Mills ) channel .	We consider , in a string theory framework , physical processes of phenomenological interest in models with a low string scale .	The amplitudes we study involve tree-level virtual gravitational exchange , divergent in a field-theoretical treatment , and massive gravitons emission , which are the main signatures of this class of models .	First , we discuss the regularization of summations appearing in virtual gravitational ( closed string ) Kaluza-Klein exchanges in Type I strings .	We find the leading string corrections to the field theory results .
1	It is found that the neutrino probability has a universal finite-distance correction if the pion has a long coherence length .	Position-dependent property of the neutrino produced in high-energy pion decay is studied theoretically using a wave packet formalism .	This correction has origins in the interference of the neutrino that is caused by the small neutrino mass and a light-cone singularity of the pion and muon system .	This term is positive definite and leads excess to the neutrino flux over the in-coherent value at macroscopic distance of near detector region .	The flux decreases slowly with distance in a universal manner that is determined by the absolute value of the neutrino mass and energy .
0	We study quantum effects in the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate loaded onto the edge of a Brillouin zone of a one-dimensional periodic potential created by an optical lattice .	We show that quantum fluctuations trigger the dynamical instability of the Bloch states of the condensate and can lead to the generation of arrays of matter-wave gap solitons .	Our approach also allows us to study the instability-induced anomalous heating of the condensate at the edge of the Brillouin zone and growth of the uncondensed atomic fraction .	We demonstrate that there are regimes in which the heating effects do not suppress the formation of the localised states .	We show that a phase imprinting technique can ensure the formation of gap soliton trains after short evolution times and at fixed positions .
0	We investigate the diffuse absolute calibration of the InfraRed Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope at 8.0microns using a sample of 43 HII regions with a wide range of morphologies near GLON=312deg .	For each region we carefully measure sky-subtracted , point-source- subtracted , areally-integrated IRAC 8.0-micron fluxes and compare these with Midcourse Space eXperiment ( MSX ) 8.3-micron images at two different spatial resolutions , and with radio continuum maps .	We determine an accurate median ratio of IRAC 8.0-micron/MSX\8.3-micron fluxes , of 1.55+/-0.15 .	From robust spectral energy distributions of these regions we conclude that the present 8.0-micron diffuse calibration of the SST is 36 % too high compared with the MSX validated calibration , perhaps due to scattered light inside the camera .	This is an independent confirmation of the result derived for the diffuse calibration of IRAC by the Spitzer Science Center ( SSC ) .
2	The model exhibits a 1-st order phase transition of the liquid-gas type .	An exact analytical solution of the statistical multifragmentation model is found in thermodynamic limit .	Excluded volume effects are taken into account in the thermodynamically self-consistent way .	An extension of the model including the Fisher 's term is also studied .	The possibility of the second order phase transition at or above the critical point is discussed .
2	In a previous work , we analyzed the non-decoupling effects in the two and three point Green 's functions of gauge fields .	We study the complete non-decoupling effects of the standard model Higgs boson to one loop .	Using effective field theory methods , we integrate out the Higgs boson and represent its non-decoupling effects by a set of gauge invariant effective operators of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian .	We complete here the calculation of the chiral effective operators by analyzing the four point functions .	We discuss in detail the relation between the renormalization of both the standard model and the effective theory , which is crutial for a correct understanding and use of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian .
3	From this field on , increasing the magnetic field does not alter the detection of photons anymore , whereas it does still change the rate of dark counts .	We experimentally investigate the effect of a magnetic field on photon detection in superconducting single-photon detectors .	At low fields , the effect of a magnetic field is through the direct modification of the quasiparticle density of states of the superconductor , and magnetic field and bias current are interchangable , as is expected for homogeneous dirty-limit superconductors .	At the field where a first vortex enters the detector , the effect of the magnetic field is reduced , up until the point where the critical current of the detector starts to be determined by flux flow .	This result points at an intrinsic difference in dark and light counts , and also shows that no enhancement of the intrinsic detection efficiency of a straight SSPD wire is achievable in a magnetic field .
4	Similarly , the occupancies of Sr/La ions at A-site and Fe/Ti ions at B-site are disordered in SrLa ( FeTi ) O6 also , ruling out the ordered perovskite structure .	The structures of the recently reported ordered perovskites SrLa ( FeTi ) O6 and BaLa ( FeTi ) O6 have been revisited using Rietveld analysis of the powder x-ray diffraction data .	Our studies clearly show that earlier authors have incorrectly reported the tetragonal structure in the I4/m space group for SrLa ( FeTi ) O6 and the cubic structure in the Fm3m space group for BaLa ( FeTi ) O6 .	The correct structure is found to be orthorhombic in the Pnma space group for SrLa ( FeTi ) O6 while cubic in the Pm3m space group for BaLa ( FeTi ) O6 .	Thus the BaLa ( FeTi ) O6 is not an ordered double perovskite as the occupancies of Ba/La ions at A-site and Fe/Ti ions at B-site are disordered resulting in the primitive cubic unit cell in the Pm3m space group .
1	This flaring event , which lasted a total of about three hours , was detected simultaneously by EPIC on XMM-Newton and the NICMOS near-infrared camera on the HST .	We present the highly significant detection of a quasi-periodic flux modulation with a period of 22.2 min seen in the X-ray data of the Sgr A* flare of 2004 August 31 .	Given the inherent difficulty in , and the lack of readily available methods for quantifying the probability of a periodic signal detected over only several cycles in a data set where red noise can be important , we developed a general method for quantifying the likelihood that such a modulation is indeed intrinsic to the source and does not arise from background fluctuations .	We here describe this Monte Carlo based method , and discuss the results obtained by its application to a other XMM-Newton data sets .	Under the simplest hypothesis that we witnessed a transient event that evolved , peaked and decayed near the marginally stable orbit of the supermassive black hole , this result implies that for a mass of 3.5 x 10^ { 6 } Msun , the central object must have an angular momentum corresponding to a spin parameter of a=0.22 .
1	For $ 0 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; 1 $ we furnish the closed form expressions for the inverse Laplace transforms $ \mathcal { L } ^ { -1 } [ F ( p^ { \alpha } ) ; x ] $ and $ \mathcal { L } ^ { -1 } [ p^ { \alpha-1 } F ( p^ { \alpha } ) ; x ] $ .	We consider the conventional Laplace transform of $ f ( x ) $ , denoted by $ \mathcal { L } [ f ( x ) ; p ] ~\equiv~F ( p ) =\int_ { 0 } ^ { \infty } e^ { -p x } f ( x ) dx $ with $ { \rm \mathfrak { Re } } ( p ) & gt ; 0 $ .	In both cases they involve definite integration with kernels which are appropriately rescaled one-sided L\ ' { e } vy stable probability distribution functions $ g_ { \alpha } ( x ) $ , $ 0 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; 1 $ , $ x & gt ; 0 $ .	Since $ g_ { \alpha } ( x ) $ are exactly and explicitly known for rational $ \alpha $ , \textit { i.e . }	for $ \alpha = l/k $ with $ l , k=1 , 2 , \ldots $ , $ l & lt ; k $ , our results extend the known and tabulated case of $ \alpha = 1/2 $ to any rational $ 0 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; 1 $ .
2	The magnetic field of the barrier $ B_0 $ is uniform and transverse to the beam velocity .	The interaction between a wide ultrarelativistic fully-ionized plasma beam and a magnetic barrier is studied numerically .	It is assumed that the plasma beam is initially homogeneous and impacts with the Lorentz factor $ \Gamma_0\gg 1 $ on the barrier .	When the energy densities of the beam and the magnetic field are comparable , $ \alpha = 8\pi n_0m_pc^2 ( \Gamma_0-1 ) /B^2_0\sim 1 $ , the process of the beam -- barrier interaction is strongly nonstationary , and the density of reversed protons is modulated in space by a factor of 10 or so .	The modulation of reversed protons decreases with decrease of $ \alpha $ .
1	: $ quantum field theory in four-dimensional space-time .	We announce results about the nonperturbative mathematically rigorous construction of the $ : \ ! \phi^4_4\ !	The complex structure of solutions of the classical nonlinear ( real-valued ) wave equation and quantization are closely connected among themselves and allow to construct non-perturbatively the quantum field theory with interaction $ : \ ! \phi^4_4\ !	: $ in four-dimensional space-time .	We consider vacuum averages , in particular , we construct Wightman functions and matrix elements of the scattering operator as generalized functions for finite energies .
3	This star is also ultra-Be deficient .	The vast majority of low-metal halo dwarfs show a similar amount of Li ; this has been attributed to the Li that was produced in the Big Bang .	However , there are nine known halo stars with T $ & gt ; $ 5900 K and [ Fe/H ] $ & lt ; $ $ - $ 1.0 that are ultra-Li-deficient .	We have looked for Be in the very low metallicity star , G 186-26 at [ Fe/H ] = $ - $ 2.71 , which is one of the ultra-Li-deficient stars .	Relative to Be in the Li-normal stars at [ Fe/H ] = $ - $ 2.7 , G 182-26 is down in Be by more than 0.8 dex .
0	String structures have played an important role in algebraic topology , via elliptic genera and elliptic cohomology , in differential geometry , via the study of higher geometric structures , and in physics , via partition functions .	We extend the description of String structures from connected covers of the definite-signature orthogonal group $ { \rm O } ( n ) $ to the indefinite-signature orthogonal group O ( p , q ) , i.e.from the Riemannian to the pseudo-Riemannian setting .	This requires that we work at the unstable level , which makes the discussion more subtle than the stable case .	Similar , but much simpler , constructions hold for other noncompact Lie groups such as the unitary group U ( p , q ) and the symplectic group Sp ( p , q ) .	This extension provides a starting point for an abundance of constructions in ( higher ) geometry and applications in physics .
3	Decoupling of four component currents of dimension 1/2 in them yields , respectively , u ( 2|1 ) and u ( 3 ) Knizhnik-Bershadsky superconformal algebras .	We construct N=2 affine current algebras for the superalgebras sl ( n|n-1 ) ^ { ( 1 ) } in terms of N=2 supercurrents subjected to nonlinear constraints and discuss the general procedure of the hamiltonian reduction in N=2 superspace at the classical level .	We consider in detail the simplest case of N=2 sl ( 2|1 ) ^ { ( 1 ) } and show how N=2 superconformal algebra in N=2 superspace follows via the hamiltonian reduction .	Applying the hamiltonian reduction to the case of N=2 sl ( 3|2 ) ^ { ( 1 ) } , we find two new extended N=2 superconformal algebras in a manifestly supersymmetric N=2 superfield form .	We also discuss how the N=2 superfield formulations of N=2 W_ { 3 } and N=2 W_ { 3 } ^ { ( 2 ) } superconformal algebras come out in this framework , as well as some unusual extended N=2 superconformal algebras containing constrained N=2 stress tensor and/or spin 0 supercurrents .
0	The specific shear viscosity $ \bar\eta $ of a classically rotating system of nucleons that interact via a monopole pairing interaction is calculated including the effects of thermal fluctuations and coupling to pair vibrations within the selfconsistent quasiparticle random-phase approximation .	It is found that $ \bar\eta $ increases with angular momentum $ M $ at a given temperature $ T $ .	In medium and heavy systems , $ \bar\eta $ decreases with increasing $ T $ at $ T\geq $ 2 MeV and this feature is not affected much by angular momentum .	But in lighter systems ( with the mass number $ A\leq $ 20 ) , $ \bar\eta $ increases with $ T $ at a value of $ M $ close to the maximal value $ M_ { max } $ , which is defined as the limiting angular momentum for each system .	The values of $ \bar\eta $ obtained within the schematic model as well as for systems with realistic single-particle energies are always larger than the universal lower-bound conjecture $ \hbar/ ( 4\pi k_B ) $ up to $ T $ =5 MeV .
1	It has been conjectured that in the continuum the model is described by the superconformal minimal model with central charge c=3/2 .	We study a model of spinless fermions with infinite nearest-neighbor repulsion on the square ladder which has microscopic supersymmetry .	Thus far it has not been possible to confirm this conjecture due to strong finite-size corrections in numerical data .	We trace the origin of these corrections to the presence of unusual marginal operators that break Lorentz invariance , but preserve part of the supersymmetry .	By relying mostly on entanglement entropy calculations with the density-matrix renormalization group , we are able to reduce finite-size effects significantly .
3	This can be attributed to the fact that , contrary to nanoparticles , the larger colloids are significantly harder to synthesize as single crystals .	Particle shape is a critical parameter that plays an important role in self-assembly , for example , in designing targeted complex structures with desired properties .	In the last decades an unprecedented range of monodisperse nanoparticle systems with control over the shape of the particles have become available .	In contrast , the choice of micron-sized colloidal building blocks of particles with flat facets , i.e. , particles with polygonal shapes , is significantly more limited .	Herein , we demonstrate that the simplest building block , such as the micron-sized polymeric spherical colloidal particle , is already enough to fabricate particles with regularly placed flat facets , including completely polygonal shapes with sharp edges .
2	In this formalism , a hierarchy of geometrical structures is constructed on a null hypersurface .	The isolated horizon formalism recently introduced by Ashtekar et al .	aims at providing a quasi-local concept of a black hole in equilibrium in an otherwise possibly dynamical spacetime .	On the other side , the 3+1 formulation of general relativity provides a powerful setting for studying the spacetime dynamics , in particular gravitational radiation from black hole systems .	Here we revisit the kinematics and dynamics of null hypersurfaces by making use of some 3+1 slicing of spacetime .
4	This suggest that the topological gravity is relevant for manifolds with special holonomy .	We construct a topological theory for euclidean gravity in four dimensions , by enforcing self-duality conditions on the spin connection .	The corresponding topological symmetry is associated to the SU ( 2 ) X diffeomorphism X U ( 1 ) invariance .	The action of this theory is that of d=4 , N=2 supergravity , up to a twist .	The topological field theory is SU ( 2 ) invariant , but the full SO ( 4 ) invariance is recovered after untwist .
2	We proved that an orthoalgebra admits cloning operation if and only if it is a Boolean algebra .	This paper discusses the no-cloning theorem in a logico-algebraic approach .	In this approach , an orthoalgebra is considered as a general structure for propositions in a physical theory .	That is , only classical theory admits the cloning of states .	If unsharp propositions are to be included in the theory , then a notion of effect algebra is considered .
1	Here we develop a simplified , idealized model of impact conditions that can be adapted to fit the details of specific deflection-test scenarios , such as what is being proposed for the AIDA project .	We define a set of procedures to numerically study the fate of ejecta produced by the impact of an artificial projectile with the aim of deflecting an asteroid .	Ongoing studies based upon the methodology described here can be used to inform observational strategies and safety conditions for an observing spacecraft .	To account for ejecta evolution , the numerical strategies we are employing are varied and include a large N-Body component , a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics ( SPH ) component , and an application of impactor scaling laws .	Simulations that use SPH-derived initial conditions show high-speed ejecta escaping at low angles of inclination , and very slowly moving ejecta lofting off the surface at higher inclination angles , some of which re-impacts the small-body surface .
0	Utilizing in-medium vector spectral functions which describe dilepton data in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions , we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of QCD and Weinberg sum rules at finite temperature .	The starting point is our recent study in vacuum , where the sum rules have been quantitatively satisfied using phenomenological axial-/vector spectral functions which describe hadronic tau-decay data .	In the medium , the temperature dependence of condensates and chiral order parameters is taken from thermal lattice QCD where available , and otherwise estimated from a hadron resonance gas .	Since little is known about the in-medium axial-vector spectral function , we model it with a Breit-Wigner ansatz allowing for smooth temperature variations of its width and mass parameters .	Our study thus amounts to testing the compatibility of the $ \rho $ -broadening found in dilepton experiments with ( the approach toward ) chiral restoration , and thereby searching for viable in-medium axial-vector spectral functions .
0	An error analysis result is given for classical Gram -- Schmidt factorization of a full rank matrix $ A $ into $ A=QR $ where $ Q $ is left orthogonal ( has orthonormal columns ) and $ R $ is upper triangular .	The work presented here shows that the computed $ R $ satisfies $ \normal { R } =\normal { A } +E $ where $ E $ is an appropriately small backward error , but only if the diagonals of $ R $ are computed in a manner similar to Cholesky factorization of the normal equations matrix .	A similar result is stated in [ Giraud at al , Numer.Math .	101 ( 1 ) :87 -- 100,2005 ] .	However , for that result to hold , the diagonals of $ R $ must be computed in the manner recommended in this work .
4	Physical quantities , such as charge densities , free energies , and Hilbert series , associated with each phase , are computed explicitly and discussed in detail .	We study the moduli space of 4d N=1 supersymmetric QCD in the Veneziano limit using Hilbert series .	In this limit , the numbers of colours and flavours are taken to be large with their ratio fixed .	It is shown that the Hilbert series , which is a partition function of an ensemble of gauge invariant quantities parametrising the moduli space , can also be realised as a partition function of a system of interacting Coulomb gas in two dimensions .	In the electrostatic equilibrium , exact and asymptotic analyses reveal that such a system exhibits two possible phases .
0	In this work we propose and analyse a numerical method for computing a family of highly oscillatory integrals with logarithmic singularities .	For these quadrature rules we derive error estimates in terms of $ N $ , the number of nodes , $ k $ the rate of oscillations and a Sobolev-like regularity of the function .	We prove that that the method is not only robust but the error even decreases , for fixed $ N $ , as $ k $ increases .	Practical issues about the implementation of the rule are also covered in this paper by : ( a ) writing down ready-to-implement algorithms ; ( b ) analysing the numerical stability of the computations and ( c ) estimating the overall computational cost .	We finish by showing some numerical experiments which illustrate the theoretical results presented in this paper .
4	We estimate the rate of magnetic heating due to the reconnection of magnetic flux tubes , which plays an important role in our dynamo model .	We present a new fast dynamo model for galactic magnetic fields , which is based on the Parker-shearing instability and magnetic reconnection , in the spirit of the model proposed by Parker ( 1992 ) .	We introduce a new scenario of flux tube interactions and estimate the dynamo transport coefficient basing on simple geometrical arguments .	The obtained expressions are equivalent to the formally derived helicity $ \alpha_d $ and diffusivity $ \eta_d $ in the first paper of this series .	The model we propose predicts that the $ \alpha $ -effect in galactic discs has opposite sign with respect to that resulting directly from the sign of the Coriolis force .
2	The decision to participate in a conference depends on several factors like the location , cost , popularity of keynote speakers , and the scientists ' association with the community .	Participation in conferences is an important part of every scientific career .	Conferences provide an opportunity for a fast dissemination of latest results , discussion and exchange of ideas , and broadening of scientists ' collaboration network .	Here we discuss and formulate the problem of discovering how a scientists ' previous participation affects her/his future participations in the same conference series .	We develop a stochastic model to examine scientists ' participation patterns in conferences and compare our model with data from six conferences across various scientific fields and communities .
2	To this end we employ the technique of extended Burnside rings .	We study 2-representations , i.e.actions of 2-groups on 2-vector spaces .	Our main focus is character theory for 2-representations .	Our main theorem is that the Ganter-Kapranov 2-character is a particular mark homomorphism of the Burnside ring .	As an application we give a new proof of Osorno formula for the Ganter-Kapranov 2-character of a finite group .
1	Most of the classical approaches assume a large sample size $ n $ whereas the dimension $ p $ of the observations is kept small .	Estimating the number of spikes in a spiked model is an important problem in many areas such as signal processing .	In this paper , we consider the case of high dimension , where $ p $ is large compared to $ n $ .	The approach is based on recent results of random matrix theory .	We extend our previous results to a more difficult situation where some spikes are equal , and compare our algorithm to an existing benchmark method .
1	We have studied the gamma-ray flux observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System ( HESS ) from the J1745-290 Galactic Center source .	We present a study of the Galactic Center region as a possible source of both secondary gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from annihilating dark matter .	The data are well fitted as annihilating dark matter in combination with an astrophysical background .	The analysis was performed by means of simulated gamma spectra produced by Monte Carlo event generators packages .	We analyze the differences in the spectra obtained by the various Monte Carlo codes developed so far in particle physics .
1	The method is based on Forster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) in intercalator-donor pair ( acridine orange as a donor and ethidium bromide as an acceptor ) .	Real time laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy usage for microanalysis of DNA double helix defects is shown .	Transition metal ions such as Cu ( II ) , Cu ( I ) , Ag ( I ) , silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs ) , photo- and thermo effects were used to cause double helix defects in DNA .	FRET radii were experimentally estimated in background electrolyte solution ( 0.01 M NaNO3 ) and proved to be 3.9 +- 0.3 nm and the data are in satisfactory agreement with the theoretically calculated value Ro = 3.5 +- 0.3 nm .	Concentration of DNA sites , exposed to Cu ( II ) , Cu ( I ) , Ag ( I ) ions , AgNPs impact as well as laser irradiation ( { \lambda } = 457 nm ) and temperature , which are applicable for intercalation , were estimated in relative units .
0	This work investigates phase separation of a monodisperse gas of inelastically colliding hard disks confined in a two-dimensional annulus , the inner circle of which represents a `` thermal wall '' .	When described by granular hydrodynamic equations , the basic steady state of this system is an azimuthally symmetric state of increased particle density at the exterior circle of the annulus .	When the inelastic energy loss is sufficiently large , hydrodynamics predicts spontaneous symmetry breaking of the annular state , analogous to the van der Waals-like phase separation phenomenon previously found in a driven granular gas in rectangular geometry .	At a fixed aspect ratio of the annulus , the phase separation involves a `` spinodal interval '' of particle area fractions , where the gas has negative compressibility in the azimuthal direction .	The heat conduction in the azimuthal direction tends to suppress the instability , as corroborated by a marginal stability analysis of the basic steady state with respect to small perturbations .
2	Spectral subtype have been estimated by a remedied Hammer program ( Original Hammer : Covey et al .	We present a spectroscopic catalog of 67082 M dwarfs from the LAMOST pilot survey .	For each spectrum of the catalog , spectral subtype , radial velocity , equivalent width of H $ { \alpha } $ , a number of prominent molecular band indices and the metal sensitive parameter $ \zeta $ are provided .	2007 ) , in which indices are reselected to obtain more accurate auto-classified spectral subtypes .	All spectra in this catalog have been visually inspected to confirm the spectral subtypes .
3	As a key step , we prove a central limit theorem for triangular arrays of stationary $ m $ -dependent random fields with unbounded $ m $ .	We establish sufficient conditions for the asymptotic normality of kernel density estimators , applied to causal linear random fields .	Our conditions on the coefficients of linear random fields are weaker than known results , although our assumption on the bandwidth is not minimal .	The proof is based on the $ m $ -approximation method .	We also apply a moment inequality recently established for stationary random fields .
4	Geometrical properties of principal Killing surfaces are investigated and it is shown that the internal geometry of $ \Sigma $ coincides with the geometry of a 2-D black or white hole ( { \it string hole } ) .	The interaction of a cosmic string with a four-dimensional stationary black hole is considered .	If a part of an infinitely long string passes close to a black hole it can be captured .	The final stationary configurations of such captured strings are investigated .	A uniqueness theorem is proved , namely it is shown that the minimal 2-D surface $ \Sigma $ describing a captured stationary string coincides with a { \it principal Killing surface } , i.e.a surface formed by Killing trajectories passing through a principal null ray of the Kerr-Newman geometry .
2	Thus obtained low-energy Hamiltonian is solved by the path-integral renormalization-group method , where spatial and dynamical fluctuations are fully considered .	A new scheme of first-principles computation for strongly correlated electron systems is proposed .	This scheme starts from the local-density approximation ( LDA ) at high-energy band structure , while the low-energy effective Hamiltonian is constructed by a downfolding procedure using combinations of the constrained LDA and the GW method .	An application to Sr $ _2 $ VO $ _4 $ shows that the scheme is powerful in agreement with experimental results .	It further predicts a nontrivial orbital-stripe order .
0	We have used multi-epoch images from the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope to search for substellar companions to stars in the solar neighborhood based on common proper motions .	Through this work , we have discovered a faint companion to the white dwarf WD 0806-661 .	The comoving source has a projected separation of 130 '' , corresponding to 2500 AU at the distance of the primary ( 19.2 pc ) .	If it is physically associated , then its absolute magnitude at 4.5um is ~1 mag fainter than the faintest known T dwarfs , making it a strong candidate for the coolest known brown dwarf .	The combination of M_4.5 and the age of the primary ( 1.5 Gyr ) implies an effective temperature of ~300 K and a mass of ~7 M_Jup according to theoretical evolutionary models .
1	In financial factor models for instance , the unknown factors can be reasonably well predicted by a few observable proxies , such as the Fama-French factors .	We provide an econometric analysis for the factor models when the latent factors can be explained partially by several observed explanatory proxies .	In diffusion index forecasts , identified factors are strongly related to several directly measurable economic variables such as consumption-wealth variable , financial ratios , and term spread .	To incorporate the explanatory power of these observed characteristics , we propose a new two-step estimation procedure : ( i ) regress the data onto the observables , and ( ii ) take the principal components of the fitted data to estimate the loadings and factors .	The proposed estimator is robust to possibly heavy-tailed distributions , which are encountered by many macroeconomic and financial time series .
4	As social psychology studies show that video game can influence human behavior , a good designed game should provide the game player with right incentives and guide the users to make wiser choices for better environmental protection .	It has been challenging to find ways to educate people to have better environmental consciousness .	In some cases , people do not know what the right behaviors are to protect the environment .	Game engine has been used in the AEC industry for visualization .	However , it has barely been used in environmental consciousness education , for example , what operation can reduce building energy consumption , what items are recyclables .
3	The self-consistent solution yields a transmission coefficient of 1 and reflection coefficient of 0 for all evanescent waves .	The widely-accepted theoretical treatment of the electromagnetic boundary problem of evanescent wave transfer at an interface between a normal medium of n=1 and an ideal negative index medium of n=-1 neglects the non-zero induced surface current and charge densities at the interface and is self-inconsistent .	We re-solve the electromagnetic boundary problem by taking into account the non-zero induced surface current and charge densities that have been neglected so far by others .	We give the exact induced surface current and charge distributions for this special case and solve the refracted and reflected fields analytically using Green 's function method .	Accordingly , we found that , on the contrary to the popular belief , negative index of refraction does not make perfect lenses .
1	For every prime divisor D in X , we set c ( D ) : =dim ker ( r : H^2 ( X , R ) - & gt ; H^2 ( D , R ) ) , where r is the natural restriction map , and we define an invariant of X as c_X : =max { c ( D ) |D is a prime divisor in X } .	Let X be a smooth , complex Fano variety .	In a previous paper we showed that c_X & lt ; 9 , and that if c_X & gt ; 2 , then either X is a product , or X has a flat fibration in Del Pezzo surfaces .	In this paper we study the case c_X=2 .	We show that up to a birational modification given by a sequence of flips , X has a conic bundle structure , or an equidimensional fibration in Del Pezzo surfaces .
0	Measurements with a bare p-type high purity germanium diode ( HPGe ) submerged in a 19 kg liquid argon ( LAr ) scintillation detector at MPIK Heidelberg are reported .	The liquid argon -- germanium system ( LArGe ) is operated as a 4 $ \pi $ anti-Compton spectrometer to suppress backgrounds in the HPGe .	This R & amp ; D is carried out in the framework of the GERDA experiment which searches for 0 $ \nu\beta\beta $ decays with HPGe detectors enriched in $ ^ { 76 } $ Ge .	The goal of this work is to develop a novel method to discriminate backgrounds in 0 $ \nu\beta\beta $ search which would ultimately allow to investigate the effective neutrino mass free of background events down to the inverse mass hierarchy scale .	Other applications in low-background counting are expected .
3	This led the authors of that work to claim that weak values have an entirely classical explanation .	The outcome of a weak quantum measurement conditioned to a subsequent postselection ( a weak value protocol ) can assume peculiar values .	These results can not be explained in terms of conditional probabilistic outcomes of projective measurements .	However , a classical model has been recently put forward that can reproduce peculiar expectation values , reminiscent of weak values .	Here we discuss what is quantum about weak values with the help of a simple model based on basic quantum mechanics .
1	Then we consider the Prym map and analyze it using tautological classes .	We prove that in characteristic p & gt ; 0 the locus of stable curves of p-rank at most f is pure of codimension g-f in the moduli space of stable curves .	We study the locus of curves with an etale double cover of p-rank 0 in some detail .	In particular , in genus 2 we obtain a formula for the number of such curves .	We end with several examples illustrating our formula .
3	In each decay mode the invariant mass spectra of the charmed mesons and the baryons are compared with a pure phase-space hypothesis in order to gain insight into the $ B $ meson decay dynamics .	The $ B^0 $ meson decay modes $ B^0 \to D^ { *- } p { \bar p } \pi^+ $ , $ D^ { - } p { \bar p } \pi^+ $ , $ { \bar D } ^ { *0 } p { \bar p } $ , and $ { \bar D } ^ { 0 } p { \bar p } $ are studied in a sample of $ 124\times 10^ { 6 } $ $ B { \bar B } $ pairs collected with the $ BaBar $ detector at the PEP-II collider .	The decay of $ B^0 \to D^ { - } p { \bar p } \pi^+ $ is observed for the first time , with a measured branching fraction $ { \cal B } ( B^0 \to D^ { - } p { \bar p } \pi^+ ) = ( 3.80\pm 0.35\pm 0.46 ) \times 10^ { -4 } $ .	The following branching fractions are also determined : $ { \cal B } ( B^0 \to D^ { *- } p { \bar p } \pi^+ ) = ( 5.61\pm 0.59\pm 0.73 ) \times 10^ { -4 } $ , $ { \cal B } ( B^0 \to { \bar D } ^ { *0 } p { \bar p } ) = ( 0.67\pm 0.21\pm 0.09 ) \times 10^ { -4 } $ , and $ { \cal B } ( B^0 \to { \bar D } ^ { 0 } p { \bar p } ) = ( 1.24\pm 0.14\pm 0.12 ) \times 10^ { -4 } $ .	In particular , the Dalitz plots of $ { \bar D } ^ { *0 } p $ versus $ { \bar D } ^ { *0 } { \bar p } $ for $ B^0 \to { \bar D } ^ { *0 } p { \bar p } $ and of $ { \bar D } ^ { 0 } p $ versus $ { \bar D } ^ { 0 } { \bar p } $ for $ B^0 \to { \bar D } ^ { 0 } p { \bar p } $ are presented .
1	For polarized neutron reflectometry , this must be included in the reference potential energy of the Schr\ '' odinger equation that is used to calculate the expected scattering from a magnetic layered structure .	The presence of a large applied magnetic field removes the degeneracy of the vacuum energy states for spin-up and spin-down neutrons .	For samples with magnetization that is purely parallel or antiparallel to the applied field which defines the quantization axis , there is no mixing of the spin states ( no spin-flip scattering ) and so this additional potential is constant throughout the scattering region .	When there is non-collinear magnetization in the sample however , there will be significant scattering from one spin state into the other and the reference potentials will differ between the incoming and outgoing wavefunctions , changing the angle and intensities of the scattering .	The theory of the scattering and recommended experimental practices for this type of measurement are presented , as well as an example measurement .
0	We investigate the free energy and the penetration depth of a quasi-two-dimensional d-wave superconductor in the presence of a weak magnetic field by taking account of thermal , nonlocal and nonlinear effects .	In an approximation in which the superfluid velocity $ v_s $ is assumed to be slowly varying , the free energy is calculated and compared with available results in several limiting cases .	It is shown that either nonlocal or nonlinear effects may cut off the linear- $ T $ dependence of both the free energy and the penetration depth in all the experimental geometries .	At extremely low $ T $ , the nonlocal effects will also generically modify the linear $ H $ dependence of the penetration depth ( `` nonlinear Meissner effect '' ) in most experimental geometries , but for supercurrents oriented along the nodal directions , the effect may be recovered .	We compare our predictions with existing experiments on the cuprate superconductors .
4	We find these uncertainties to be more pronounced at the larger missing momenta explored by the ( gamma , p ) reaction .	Relativistic calculations for the quasifree electron scattering process ( e , e'p ) and the direct knockout contribution to ( gamma , p ) reactions are presented .	The spectroscopic factors determined from the former reaction are used to fix the magnitude of the knockout contribution to the ( gamma , p ) reaction at 60 MeV .	The results obtained for several nuclei indicate that the knockout contributions are much larger in magnitude and hence closer to the data than predicted in an earlier comparison based on non-relativistic calculations .	We discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of parameters for the binding and final state interactions .
1	They go together under the term 'EPR-type disentanglement ' .	It was pointed out in the first part of this study that EPR-type entanglement is defined by the possibility of performing any of two mutually incompatible distant , i. e. , direct-interaction-free , measurements .	In this second part , quantum-mechanical insight is gained in the real random delayed-choice erasure experiment of Kim et al . [ Kim et al . : Phys.Rev.Lett .	84 , 1-5 ( 2000 ) ] by a relative-reality-of- unitarily-evolving-state ( RRUES ) approach ( explained in the first part ) .	Finally , it is shown that this remarkable experiment , which performs , by random choice , two incompatible measurements at the same time , is actually an EPR-type disentanglement experiment , closely related to the micromaser experiment discussed in the first part .
2	The formulas imply that if f and g are two non-regularly homotopic immersions of a ( 4k-1 ) -sphere into ( 4k+1 ) -space then they are also non-regularly homotopic as immersions into ( 6k-1 ) -space .	We give three formulas expressing the Smale invariant of an immersion f of a ( 4k-1 ) -sphere into ( 4k+1 ) -space .	The terms of the formulas are geometric characteristics of any generic smooth map g of any oriented 4k-dimensional manifold , where g restricted to the boundary is an immersion regularly homotopic to f in ( 6k-1 ) -space .	Moreover , any generic homotopy in ( 6k-1 ) -space connecting f to g must have at least a_k ( 2k-1 ) !	cusps , where a_k=2 if k is odd and a_k=1 if k is even .
3	The resizing library in ReSHAPE includes support for releasing and acquiring processors and efficiently redistributing application state to a new set of processors .	Traditional parallel schedulers running on cluster supercomputers support only static scheduling , where the number of processors allocated to an application remains fixed throughout the execution of the job .	This results in under-utilization of idle system resources thereby decreasing overall system throughput .	In our research , we have developed a prototype framework called ReSHAPE , which supports dynamic resizing of parallel MPI applications executing on distributed memory platforms .	In this paper , we derive an algorithm for redistributing two-dimensional block-cyclic arrays from $ P $ to $ Q $ processors , organized as 2-D processor grids .
2	The quantitative crystallographic phase analysis has been carried out by double phase Rietveld analysis of all the XRD patterns which indicates the existence of compositional driven crystal structure transformation from rhombohederal ( R3c space group , lower crystal symmetry ) to the orthorhombic ( Pbnm space group , higher crystal symmetry ) with the increase in substitution concentration due to excess chemical pressure ( lattice strain ) .	Composition-driven structural transitions in Bi1-xCaxFe1-xMnxO3 ceramics prepared by the tartaric acid modified sol-gel technique have been studied to analyze its effect on the magnetic properties of bismuth ferrite ( BiFeO3 ) .	It was observed that the co-substitution of Ca & amp ; Mn at Bi & amp ; Fe sites in BiFeO3 ( BFO ) significantly suppress the impurity phases .	Magnetic measurements reveal that co-substituted BFO nanoparticles for x = 0.15 have enhanced remnant magnetization about 14 times that of pure one due to the suppression of cycloid spin structure which could be explained in terms of field induced spin reorientation and weak ferromagnetism .	However , at the morphological phase boundary ( x = 0.15 ) , the remnant and maximum magnetization at 8 T reaches a maximum which indicates almost broken spin cycloid structure and further increase in substitution results in the reduction of both magnetizations due to the appearance of complete antiferromagnetic ordering in the orthorhombic structure because of the significant contribution from the crystallographic phase of Pbnm space group ( as obtained from double phase Rietveld analysis ) .
1	The survey covers 2.2 sq degrees of M31 , and 0.8 sq degrees of M33 , chosen so as to include all of the regions currently active in forming massive stars .	We present UBVRI photometry obtained from Mosaic images of M31 and M33 using the KPNO 4-m telescope .	The catalog contains 371,781 and 146,622 stars in M31 and M33 , respectively , where every star has a counterpart ( at least ) in B , V , and R. We compare our photometry to previous studies .	We provide cross references to the stars confirmed as members by spectroscopy , and compare the location of these to the complete set in color-magnitude diagrams .	While follow-up spectroscopy is needed for many projects , we demonstrate the success of our photometry in being able to distinguish M31/M33 members from foreground Galactic stars .
3	Furthermore , we study the precision that can be achieved for the solar parameters , $ \sin^2 2\theta_ { 12 } $ and $ \Delta m_ { 21 } ^2 $ , with a mobile reactor and with a conventional power station .	We discuss several new ideas for reactor neutrino oscillation experiments with a Large Liquid Scintillator Detector .	We consider two different scenarios for a measurement of the small mixing angle $ \theta_ { 13 } $ with a mobile $ \bar { \nu } _e $ source : a nuclear-powered ship , such as a submarine or an icebreaker , and a land-based scenario with a mobile reactor .	The former setup can achieve a sensitivity to $ \sin^2 2\theta_ { 13 } \lesssim 0.003 $ at the 90 % confidence level , while the latter performs only slightly better than Double Chooz .	With the mobile reactor , a precision slightly better than from current global fit data is possible , while with a power reactor , the accuracy can be reduced to less than 1 % .
0	We hope to be able ( in the future ) to carefully analyze this structure and to tie the Jacobian Conjecture in dimension two to certain Zeta functions , thereby invoking a powerful arithmetic machinery to handle the two dimensional Jacobian Conjecture .	Let us denote by $ { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) $ the semigroup of two dimensional Keller mappings .	We would like to prove something like the following : a ) That there exists an infinite index set $ I $ , and a family of mappings indexed by $ I $ , $ \ { F_i\ , |\ , i\in I\ } \subset { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) $ such that $ $ { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) = { \rm Aut } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) \cup\bigcup_ { i\in I } R_ { F_i } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) , $ $ where if $ i\ne j $ then $ R_ { F_i } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) \cap R_ { F_j } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) =\emptyset $ .	b ) That the parallel representation to the representation described in ( a ) above holds true , this time with respect to the left composition operators $ L_ { G_j } $ .	These two claims will be the basis for a fractal structure on $ { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) $ because the pieces $ R_ { F_i } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) $ are similar to each other in the sense that they are homeomorphic , and we further have the scaling property of self-similarity , namely $ R_F ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) $ is homeomorphic to its proper subspace $ R_ { G\circ F } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) $ that is homeomorphic to its proper subspace $ R_ { H\circ G\circ F } ( { \rm et } ( \mathbb { C } ^2 ) ) $ etc .
2	Using the softened isothermal sphere model and the universal density profile for the mass distribution of rich clusters , we calculate the CBR anisotropy by the time-delay effect and compare it with those generated by the thermal and kinematic S-Z effects as well as by the transverse motion of clusters .	We present a quantitative analysis of the time-delay effect on the cosmic background radiation ( CBR ) by static gravitational potential of galaxy clusters .	This is primarily motivated by growing observational evidence that clusters have essentially experienced no-evolution since redshift $ z\approx1 $ , indicating that the contribution of a time-dependent potential to CBR anisotropy discussed in literature could be rather small for the dynamically-relaxed clusters .	While it is unlikely that the time-delay effect is detectable in the current S-Z measurement because of its small amplitude of $ 10^ { -6 } $ - $ 10^ { -7 } $ and its achromaticity , it nevertheless leads to an uncertainty of $ \sim10 % $ in the measurement of the kinematic S-Z effect of clusters .	Future cosmological application of the peculiar velocity of clusters to be measured through the S-Z effect should therefore take this uncertainty into account .
1	To perform accurate numerical investigations by the finite differences or finite element method , one must consider a specific problem known as the numerical dispersion of waves .	The analysis of wave propagation problems in linear damped media must take into account both propagation features and attenuation process .	Numerical dispersion may increase the numerical error during the propagation process as the wave velocity ( phase and group ) depends on the features of the numerical model .	In this paper , the numerical modelling of wave propagation by the finite element method is thus analyzed and dis-cussed for linear constitutive laws .	Numerical dispersion is analyzed herein through 1D computations investigating the accuracy of higher order 15-node finite elements towards numerical dispersion .
2	Its [ CII ] and total far-infrared luminosities are $ ( 5.8 \pm 0.7 ) \times 10^9 \ , L_\odot $ and $ ( 7.6\pm1.5 ) \times 10^ { 12 } \ , L_\odot $ , respectively .	The [ CII ] 158 $ \mu $ m fine-structure line is known to trace regions of active star formation and is the main coolant of the cold , neutral atomic medium .	In this \textit { Letter } , we report a strong detection of the [ CII ] line in the host galaxy of the brightest quasar known at $ z & gt ; 6.5 $ , the Pan-STARRS1 selected quasar PSO J036.5078+03.0498 ( hereafter P036+03 ) , using the IRAM NOEMA millimeter interferometer .	This results in a $ L_ { [ CII ] } /L_ { TIR } $ ratio of $ \sim 0.8\times 10^ { -3 } $ , which is at the high end for those found for active galaxies , though it is lower than the average found in typical main sequence galaxies at $ z\sim 0 $ .	We also report a tentative additional line which we identify as a blended emission from the $ 3_ { 22 } - 3_ { 13 } $ and $ 5_ { 23 } - 4_ { 32 } $ H $ _2 $ O transitions .
0	( shortened ) Fifteen Be/X-ray binaries and candidates in the SMC were observed serendipitously with the EPIC instruments of XMM-Newton during two observations of SNR 0047-73.5 and SNR 0103-72.6 in October 2000 .	A total of twelve of those sources are detected .	For eleven of them an accurate position and in part detection of X-ray pulsations support the proposed identification as Be/X-ray binaries .	The detection of pulsations ( 172.2 s , 320.1 s and 751 s ) from three hard X-ray sources with periods known from ASCA observations confirm their proposed identifications with ROSAT sources and their optical Be star counterparts .	In addition , pulsations with a period of 263.6 s were found from XMMUJ004723.7-731226=RXJ0047.3-7312 .
3	This is a manifestation of the general property of Baecklund transformations known as spectrality .	We discuss basic properties of the Baecklund transformations for the classical string in AdS space in the context of the null-surface perturbation theory .	We explain the relation between the Baecklund transformations and the energy shift of the dual field theory state .	We show that the Baecklund transformations can be represented as a finite-time evolution generated by a special linear combination of the Pohlmeyer charges .	We also discuss the plane wave limit .
4	In the frozen-core approximation , for example , the core electrons can be eliminated in the correlated part of the calculations , greatly increasing the computational efficiency , especially for heavy atoms .	We describe the implementation of the frozen-orbital and downfolding approximations in the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo ( AFQMC ) method .	These approaches can provide significant computational savings compared to fully correlating all the electrons .	While the many-body wave function is never explicit in AFQMC , its random walkers are Slater determinants , whose orbitals may be expressed in terms of any one-particle orbital basis .	It is therefore straightforward to partition the full N-particle Hilbert space into active and inactive parts to implement the frozen-orbital method .
0	We consider the problem of Probably Approximate Correct ( PAC ) learning of a binary classifier from noisy labeled examples acquired from multiple annotators ( each characterized by a respective classification noise rate ) .	First , we consider the complete information scenario , where the learner knows the noise rates of all the annotators .	For this scenario , we derive sample complexity bound for the Minimum Disagreement Algorithm ( MDA ) on the number of labeled examples to be obtained from each annotator .	Next , we consider the incomplete information scenario , where each annotator is strategic and holds the respective noise rate as a private information .	For this scenario , we design a cost optimal procurement auction mechanism along the lines of Myerson 's optimal auction design framework in a non-trivial manner .
0	Recent experiments performed on a variety of soft glassy materials have demonstrated that any imposed shear flow serves to simultaneously fluidize these systems in all spatial directions [ Ovarlez \textit { et al . } ( 2010 ) ] .	When probed with a second shear flow , the viscous response of the experimental system is determined by the rate of the primary , fluidizing flow .	Motivated by these findings , we employ a recently developed schematic mode-coupling theory [ Brader \textit { et al . }	( 2009 ) ] to investigate the three dimensional flow of a colloidal glass , subject to a combination of simple shear and uniaxial compression .	Despite differences in the specific choice of superposed flow , the flow curves obtained show good qualitative agreement with the experimental findings and recover the observed power law describing the decay of the scaled viscosity as a function of the dominant rate .
1	A key step in this process is detecting common lines of intersection between unknown embedded image planes .	Cryo-electron microscopy is a technique in structural biology for discovering/determining the 3D structure of small molecules .	We intrinsically characterize such common lines in terms of the unembedded geometric data detected in experiments .	We show these common lines form a semi-algebraic set , i.e. , they are defined by polynomial equalities and inequalities .	These polynomials are low degree and , using techniques from spherical geometry , we explicitly derive them in this paper .
3	The first type of trigger is for short time scales ( 4 msec to 64 msec ) .	The Swift Burst Alert Telescope ( BAT ) is a huge ( 5200 cm2 ) coded aperture imager that will detect gamma-ray bursts in real time and provide a location that the Swift satellite will use to slew the optical and x-ray telescopes .	The huge size of BAT is a challenge for the on-board triggering : a change as small as 1 % is equivalent to a 1 sigma statistical variation in 1 second .	There will be three types of triggers , two based on rates and one based on images .	These will be traditional triggers ( single background ) and we check about 25,000 combinations of time-energy-focal plane subregions per second .
0	From 1979 -- 1996 the Green Bank Interferometer was used by the Naval Research Laboratory to monitor the flux density from 146 compact radio sources at frequencies near 2 and 8 GHz .	We filter the `` light curves '' to separate intrinsic variations on times of a year or more from more rapid interstellar scintilation ( ISS ) on times of 5 -- 50 d. Whereas the intrinsic variation at 2 GHz is similar to that at 8 GHz ( though diminished in amplitude ) , the ISS variation is much stronger at 2 than at 8 GHz .	We characterize the ISS variation by an rms amplitude and a timescale and examine the statistics of these parameters for the 121 sources with significant ISS at 2 GHz .	We model the scintillations using the NE2001 Galactic electron model assuming the sources are brightness-limited .	We find the observed rms amplitude to be in general agreement with the model , provided that the compact components of the sources have about 50 % of their flux density in a component with maximum brightness temperatures $ 10^ { 11 } $ -- $ 10^ { 12 } $ K .
4	In the last section we exhibit a version of the Law of Sines for Radon planes .	In this paper we study a metric generalization of the sine function which can be extended to arbitrary normed planes .	We derive its main properties and give also some characterizations of Radon planes .	Furthermore , we prove that the existence of an angular measure which is `` well-behaving '' with respect to the sine is only possible in the Euclidean plane , and we also define some new constants that estimate how non-Radon or non-Euclidean a normed plane can be .	Sine preserving self-mappings are studied , and a complete description of the linear ones is given .
0	Effects of temperature changes on the nonequilibrium spin-glass dynamics of a strongly interacting ferromagnetic nanoparticle system ( superspin glass ) are studied .	In contrary to atomic spin glasses , strong cooling rate effects are observed , and no evidence for temperature-chaos is found .	The flip time of a magnetic moment is much longer than that of an atomic spin and hence much shorter time scales are probed within the experimental time window for a superspin glass than for an atomic spin glass .	Within a real space picture the cumulative aging observed for the superspin glass can be explained considering that all investigated length scales are shorter than the temperature-chaos overlap length .	The transient relaxation , observed in experiments after temperature changes , can be understood as the adjustment of thermally active droplets , which is mutatis mutandis the Kovacs effect observed in most glassy systems .
0	Our work is a fundamental study of the notion of approximation in V-categories and in ( U , V ) -categories , for a quantale V and the ultrafilter monad U .	We introduce auxiliary , approximating and Scott-continuous distributors , the way-below distributor , and continuity of V- and ( U , V ) -categories .	We fully characterize continuous V-categories ( resp .	( U , V ) -categories ) among all cocomplete V-categories ( resp .	( U , V ) -categories ) in the same ways as continuous domains are characterized among all dcpos .
4	The prepotential techniques are trivially extended to include fundamental matter fields leading to a description in terms of loops and strings .	We solve the Gauss law and the corresponding Mandelstam constraints in the loop Hilbert space $ { \cal H } ^ { L } $ using the prepotential formulation of $ ( d+1 ) $ dimensional SU ( 2 ) lattice gauge theory .	The resulting orthonormal and complete loop basis , explicitly constructed in terms of the $ d ( 2d-1 ) $ prepotential intertwining operators , is used to transcribe the gauge dynamics directly in $ { \cal H } ^ { L } $ without any redundant gauge and loop degrees of freedom .	Using generalized Wigner-Eckart theorem and Biedenharn -Elliot identity in $ { \cal H } ^L $ , we show that the loop dynamics for pure SU ( 2 ) lattice gauge theory in arbitrary dimension , is given by the real symmetric $ 3nj $ symbols of first kind ( e.g. , n=6 , 10 for d=2 , 3 respectively ) .	The corresponding `` ribbon diagrams '' representing SU ( 2 ) loop dynamics are constructed .
1	In our earlier work , the reliability of HFB intrinsic wave functions participating in the $ \beta ^ { - } \beta ^ { - } $ decay of the above mentioned nuclei has been established by obtaining an overall agreement between the theoretically calculated spectroscopic properties , namely yrast spectra , reduced $ B ( E2 $ : $ 0^ { + } \to 2^ { + } ) $ transition probabilities , quadrupole moments $ Q ( 2^ { + } ) $ , gyromagnetic factors $ g ( 2^ { + } ) $ as well as half-lives $ T_ { 1/2 } ^ { 2\nu } $ for the $ 0^ { + } \to 0^ { + } $ transition and the available experimental data .	The $ ( \beta ^ { - } \beta ^ { - } ) _ { 0\nu } $ decay of $ ^ { 94,96 } $ Zr , $ ^ { 98,100 } $ Mo , $ ^ { 104 } $ Ru , $ ^ { 110 } $ Pd , $ ^ { 128,130 } $ Te and $ ^ { 150 } $ Nd isotopes for the $ 0^ { + } \to 0^ { + } $ transition is studied in the Projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov framework .	In the present work , we study the $ ( \beta ^ { - } \beta ^ { - } ) _ { 0\nu } $ decay for the $ 0^ { + } \to 0^ { + } $ transition in the mass mechanism and extract limits on effective mass of light as well as heavy neutrinos from the observed half-lives $ T_ { 1/2 } ^ { 0\nu } ( 0^ { + } \to 0^ { + } ) $ using nuclear transition matrix elements calculated with the same set of wave functions .	Further , the effect of deformation on the nuclear transition matrix elements required to study the $ ( \beta ^ { - } \beta ^ { - } ) _ { 0\nu } $ decay in the mass mechanism is investigated .	It is noticed that the deformation effect on nuclear transition matrix elements is of approximately same magnitude in $ ( \beta ^ { - } \beta ^ { - } ) _ { 2\nu } $ and $ ( \beta ^ { - } \beta ^ { - } ) _ { 0\nu } $ decay .
4	Theoretical models suggest that galaxies form by accumulation of numerous subcomponents , and we suggest that we are seeing this process underway in these objects .	We present the results of colour-selection of candidate high redshift ( 2.6 $ & lt ; $ z $ & lt ; $ 3.9 ) galaxies within the Hubble Deep Field based on the Ly-break at 912\AA .	We find 8 such objects in the region , giving a comoving number density comparable to that of nearby bright galaxies ( for a flat q $ _0 $ =0.5 , H $ _0 $ =100 kms $ ^ { -1 } $ Mpc $ ^ { -1 } $ universe ) .	We provide basic data on the properties of these objects , and show that despite their absolute magnitude being significantly brighter than L $ ^* $ ( typically M $ _B $ = -22 ) , they are generally smaller than nearby galaxies .	Furthermore , visual inspection of their images shows that they are all highly disturbed systems , with multiple nuclei , tails and plumes , suggesting that they are undergoing merging processes similar to most nearby starburst galaxies .
3	The product of time-reversal and four-fold rotation is preserved .	A model of copper-oxygen bonding and anti-bonding bands with the most general two-body interactions allowable by symmetry is considered .	The model has a continuous transition as a function of hole-density x and temperature T to a phase in which a current circulates in each unit cell .	This phase preserves the translational symmetry of the lattice while breaking time-reversal invariance and the four-fold rotational symmetry .	The circulating current phase terminates at a critical point at $ x=x_c , T=0 $ .
2	Each image covers 11.8 square degrees and has 100 arcsecond FWHM resolution .	We present results from a total of 459 repeated 3.1 GHz radio continuum observations ( of which 379 were used in a search for transient sources ) of the ELAIS-N1 , Coma , Lockman Hole , and NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey fields as part of the Pi GHz Sky Survey ( PiGSS ) .	The observations were taken approximately once per day between 2009 May and 2011 April .	Deep images for each of the four fields have rms noise between 180 and 310 uJy and the corresponding catalogs contain ~200 sources in each field .	Typically 40 - 50 of these sources are detected in each single-epoch image .
1	We show that the coupling strength depends sensitively on the type of vibron and is strongly sample dependent .	Motivated by recent experiments , we investigate the electron-vibron coupling in suspended carbon nanotube quantum dots , starting with the electron-phonon coupling of the underlying graphene layer .	The coupling strength becomes particularly strong when inhomogeneity-induced electronic quantum dots are located near regions where the vibronic mode is associated with large strain .	Specifically , we find that the longitudinal stretching mode and the radial breathing mode are coupled via the strong deformation potential , while twist modes couple more weakly via a mechanism involving modulation of the electronic hopping amplitudes between carbon sites .	A special case are bending modes : for symmetry reasons , their coupling is only quadratic in the vibron coordinate .
2	A secondary emission component is quite clearly needed , and while this could also be thermal at a temperature significantly lower than kT~15 keV , the best fit ( to the combined PCA and HEXTE datasets ) is obtained with a power law secondary spectral component .	A2163 was observed by the RXTE satellite for 530 ks during a 6 month period starting in August 2004 .	The cluster primary emission is from very hot intracluster gas with kT~15 keV , but this component does not by itself provide the best fitting model .	The deduced parameters of the non-thermal ( NT ) emission imply a significant fractional flux amounting to ~25 % of the integrated 3-50 keV emission .	NT emission is expected given the intense level of radio emission , most prominently from a large extended ( `halo ' ) central region of the cluster .
2	93 , 150601 ( 2004 ) ] in the general idea that the phase transition is signaled by a topological discontinuity .	We address the question of the quantitative relationship between thermodynamic phase transitions and topological changes in the potential energy manifold analyzing two classes of one dimensional models , the Burkhardt solid-on-solid model and the Peyrard-Bishop model for DNA thermal denaturation , both in the confining and non-confining version .	These models , apparently , do not fit [ M.Kastner , Phys.Rev.Lett .	We show that in both models the phase transition energy v_c is actually non-coincident with , and always higher than , the energy v_theta at which a topological change appears .	However , applying a procedure already successfully employed in other cases as the mean field phi^4 model , i.e.introducing a map M ( v ) =v_s from levels of the energy hypersurface V to the level of the stationary points `` visited '' at temperature T , we find that M ( v_c ) =v_theta .
4	However , for biologically realized network sizes , significant finite-size effects are observed including a broad in-degree distribution and an average in-degree connection between two and three .	The co-evolution of network topology and dynamics is studied in an evolutionary Boolean network model that is a simple model of gene regulatory network .	We find that a critical state emerges spontaneously resulting from interplay between topology and dynamics during the evolution .	The final evolved state is shown to be independent of initial conditions .	The network appears to be driven to a random Boolean network with uniform in-degree of two in the large network limit .

The SO ( 4 , C ) Barret-Crane interwiner is unique .	The propagators of the SO ( 4 , C ) Barrett-Crane model are discussed .	The asymptotic limit of the SO ( 4 , C ) general relativity is discussed .
0	We present Raman measurements on the iron-pnictide superconductors CeFeAsO_ { 1-x } F_ { x } and NdFeAsO { 1-x } F_ { x } .	Modeling the Fe-As plane in terms of harmonic and a cubic anharmonic Fe-As interaction we calculate the temperature dependence of the energy and lifetime of the Raman active Fe B_ { 1g } mode and fit to the observed energy shift .	The shifts and lifetimes are in good agreement with those measured also in other Raman studies which demonstrate that the phonon spectrum is well represented by phonon-phonon interactions without any significant electronic contribution .	We also estimate the anharmonic expansion from Fe ( 56- & gt ; 54 ) isotope substitution to \Delta a=5.1 10^ { -4 } \AA and \Delta d_ { Fe-As } = 2.510^ { -4 } \AA and the shift of harmonic zero point fluctuations of bond lengths & lt ; \Delta x^2 & gt ; & lt ; =3 10^ { -5 } \AA^2 , giving a total relative average decrease of electronic hopping integrals of |\delta t|/t & lt ; = 2.0 10^ { -4 } .	The results poses a serious challenge for any theory of superconductivity in the pnictides that does not include electron-phonon interactions to produce a sizable Fe-isotope effect .
0	Planetary nebulae had a double anniversary in 2014 , 250 year since their discovery and 150 year since the correct spectroscopic identification .	This paper gives an overview of planetary nebula research published in 2014 .	Topics include surveys , central stars , abundances , morphologies , magnetic fields , stellar population and galactic dynamics .	An important continuing controversy is the discrepancy between recombination-line and forbidden-line abundances .	A new controversy is the relation between symbiotic stars and [ WC ] stars .
2	1991 ; Ostensen et al .	Microlensing in Q2237+0305 between 1985 and 1995 ( eg.Irwin et al .	1989 ; Corrigan et al .	1996 ) has been interpreted in two different ways ; as microlensing by stellar mass objects of a continuum source having dimensions significantly smaller than the microlens Einstein radius ( ER ) ( eg .	Wambsganss , Paczynski & amp ; Schneider 1990 ; Rauch & amp ; Blandford 1991 ) , and as microlensing by very low mass objects of a source as large as 5 ER ( Refsdal & amp ; Stabell 1993 ; Haugan 1996 ) .
4	When the Gauss-Bonnet term is dominant , tensor perturbations exhibit violent negative instabilities on small-scales about a de Sitter background in spite of the fact that scale-invariant scalar perturbations can be achieved .	We discuss the realization of inflation and resulting cosmological perturbations in the low-energy effective string theory .	In order to obtain nearly scale-invariant spectra of density perturbations and a suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio , it is generally necessary that the dilaton field $ \phi $ is effectively decoupled from gravity together with the existence of a slowly varying dilaton potential .	We also study the effect of second-order corrections to the tree-level action which are the sum of a Gauss-Bonnet term coupled to $ \phi $ and a kinetic term $ ( \nabla \phi ) ^4 $ .	We find that it is possible to realize observationally supported spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations provided that the correction is dominated by the $ ( \nabla \phi ) ^4 $ term even in the absence of the dilaton potential .
2	The FES gas is `` ideal '' , in the sense that the quasiparticle energies do not depend on the other quasiparticle levels populations and the sum of the quasiparticle energies is equal to the total energy of the system .	We describe a mean field interacting particle system in any number of dimensions and in a generic external potential as an ideal gas with fractional exclusion statistics ( FES ) .	We define the FES quasiparticle energies , we calculate the FES parameters of the system and we deduce the equations for the equilibrium particle populations .	We prove that the FES formalism is equivalent to the semi-classical or Thomas Fermi limit of the self-consistent mean-field theory and the FES quasiparticle populations may be calculated from the Landau quasiparticle populations by making the correspondence between the FES and the Landau quasiparticle energies .	The FES provides a natural semi-classical ideal gas description of the interacting particle gas .

2	We then choose physical parameter values with explicit CP violation and a light right-handed stop , and determine the strength of the phase transition .	Using a three-dimensional ( 3d ) effective field theory and non-perturbative lattice simulations , we study the MSSM electroweak phase transition with two dynamical Higgs doublets .	We first carry out a general analysis of spontaneous CP violation in 3d two Higgs doublet models , finding that this part of the parameter space is well separated from that corresponding to the physical MSSM .	We find a transition somewhat stronger than in 2-loop perturbation theory , leading to the conclusion that from the point of view of the non-equilibrium constraint , MSSM electroweak baryogenesis can be allowed even for a Higgs mass mH \approx 115 GeV .	We also find that small values of the mass parameter mA ( \lsim 120 GeV ) , which would relax the experimental constraint on mH , do not weaken the transition noticeably for a light enough stop .
1	This article studies the coinvariants $ H_0 ( \Gamma ; C ( \Omega , { \mathbb Z } ) ) $ , where $ \Omega $ is the Furstenberg boundary of $ G $ .	Let $ ( G , { \mathfrak I } , N , S ) $ be an affine topological Tits system , and let $ \Gamma $ be a torsion free cocompact lattice in $ G $ .	It is shown that the class $ [ 1 ] $ of the identity function in $ H_0 ( \Gamma ; C ( \Omega , { \mathbb Z } ) ) $ has finite order , with explicit bounds for the order .	A similar statement applies to the $ K_0 $ group of the boundary crossed product $ C^* $ -algebra $ C ( \Omega ) \rtimes\Gamma $ .	If the Tits system has type $ \widetilde A_2 $ , exact computations are given , both for the crossed product algebra and for the reduced group $ C^* $ -algebra .
0	We compute the generating function of random planar quadrangulations with three marked vertices at prescribed pairwise distances .	In the scaling limit of large quadrangulations , this discrete three-point function converges to a simple universal scaling function , which is the continuous three-point function of pure 2D quantum gravity .	We give explicit expressions for this universal three-point function both in the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles .	Various limiting regimes are studied when some of the distances become large or small .	By considering the case where the marked vertices are aligned , we also obtain the probability law for the number of geodesic points , namely vertices that lie on a geodesic path between two given vertices , and at prescribed distances from these vertices .
1	Gravity is described in this approach not by one Riemannian metric ( i.e.a symmetric two-tensor field ) but by a multiplet of such fields , or by a matrix-valued symmetric two-tensor field that satisfies certain conditions .	We develop a novel approach to gravity that we call `matrix general relativity ' ( MGR ) or `gravitational chromodynamics ' ( GCD or GQCD for quantum version ) .	We define the matrix extensions of standard constructions of differential geometry including connections and curvatures , and finally , an invariant functional of the new field that reduces to the standard Einstein action functional in the commutative ( diagonal ) case .	Our main idea is the analogy with Yang-Mills theory ( QCD and Standard Model ) .	We call the new degrees of freedom of gravity associated with the matrix structure `gravitational color ' or simply `gravicolor ' and introduce a new gauge symmetry associated with this degree of freedom .
2	We find that the gluino mass m_ { \widetilde { g } } & gt ; 12 GeV for the standard model world-average value alpha_ { s } ( M_ { Z } ) =0.118 .	Parton distribution functions for protons are devised in which a light gluino is included along with standard model quark , antiquark , and gluon constituents .	A global analysis of a large set of hadronic scattering data provides empirical constraints on the allowed range of the gluino mass as a function of the value of the strong coupling strength alpha_s ( M_Z ) .	Gluino masses as small as 10 GeV are admissible provided that alpha_s ( M_Z ) & gt ; 0.12 , about one standard deviation above the world-average value .	Current hadron scattering data are insensitive to the presence of gluinos heavier than about 100 - 150 GeV .
4	We give a generic operational definition and an implemented logical form of this criterion .	On the one hand , termination analysis of logic programs is now a fairly established research topic within the logic programming community .	On the other hand , non-termination analysis seems to remain a much less attractive subject .	If we divide this line of research into two kinds of approaches : dynamic versus static analysis , this paper belongs to the latter .	It proposes a criterion for detecting non-terminating atomic queries with respect to binary CLP rules , which strictly generalizes our previous works on this subject .
4	For a gapless pairing state in 1D or a d-wave pairing state in 2D , $ \lambda_s/ \lambda_n $ at the Fermi energy $ E_F $ is of order 1 and determined purely by the value of gap parameter not by the random potential .	Localization lengths of superconducting quasiparticles $ \lambda_s $ are evaluated and compared with the corresponding normal state values $ \lambda_n $ in one and two dimensional lattices .	The effect of superconducting correlation on the localization of quasiparticles is generally stronger in an off-site pairing state than in an on-site pairing state .	The modification of superconducting correlation to $ \lambda $ is strongly correlated with the density of states ( DOS ) of superconducting quasiparticles .	$ \lambda_s $ drops within the energy gap but is largely enhanced around energies where DOS peaks appear .
1	In slow-roll approximation the primordial perturbation spectrums for this model are calculated .	We study warm-tachyon inflationary universe model in the context of the effective field theory of loop quantum cosmology .	We also obtain the general expressions of the tensor-to-scalar ratio , scalar spectral index .	We develop this model by using exponential potential , the characteristics of this model is calculated in great details .	The parameters of the model are restricted by recent observational data from Planck , WMAP9 and BICEP2 .
0	Observations of high-redshift Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) have provided strong evidence that the dark energy is real , and making further accurate observations of high-redshift SNe Ia is the most promising way to probe the nature of the dark energy .	We discuss one of the concerns about such a project - that of coping with SN Ia evolution .	We emphasize that SN Ia evolution differs in an important respect from the kind of evolution that has foiled some past projects in observational cosmology , and we outline empirical strategies that will take it into account .	The supporting role of physical models of SNe Ia also is discussed .	Our conclusion is that systematic errors due to SN Ia evolution will be small .
1	This method , first discussed by Tremaine & amp ; Weinberg in the context of external galaxies , requires projected positions , $ ( l , b ) $ , and line-of-sight velocities for a spatially complete sample of relaxed tracers .	We show how the continuity equation can be used to determine pattern speeds in the Milky Way Galaxy ( MWG ) .	If the local standard of rest ( LSR ) has a zero velocity in the radial direction ( $ u_ { \rm LSR } $ ) , then the quantity that is measured is $ \Delta V \equiv \Omega_p R_0 - V_ { \rm LSR } $ , where $ \Omega_p $ is the pattern speed of the non-axisymmetric feature , $ R_0 $ is the distance of the Sun from the Galactic centre and $ V_ { \rm LSR } $ is the tangential motion of the LSR , including the circular velocity .	We use simple models to assess the reliability of the method for measuring a single , constant pattern speed of either a bar or spiral in the inner MWG .	We then apply the method to the OH/IR stars in the ATCA/VLA OH 1612 MHz survey of Sevenster et al , finding $ \Delta V = 252 \pm 41 $ km/s , if $ u_ { \rm LSR } = 0 $ .
1	This technique allowed to identify contributions of the Fe and Ti originating electronic states to the valence band .	Epitaxial thin films of Fe doped SrTiO3 have been studied by the use of resonant photoemission .	Two valence states of iron Fe2+ and Fe3+ , detected on the base of XAS spectra , appeared to form quite different contributions to the valence band of SrTiO3 .	The electronic states within the in-gap region can be attributed to Fe2+ , Fe3+ and Ti3+ ions .	Fe2+ originating states which can be connected to the presence of oxygen vacancies form a broad band reaching binding energies of about 0.5 eV below the conduction band while Fe3+ states form in the gap a sharp feature localized just above the top of the valence band .
2	We define the mean extrinsic curvature for spaces with Minkowski signature and introduce the concept of mean torsion .	In the present article , we study the local features of the world-sheet in the case when probe bosonic string moves in antisymmetric background field .	We generalize the geometry of surfaces embedded in space-time to the case when the torsion is present .	Its orthogonal projection defines the dual mean extrinsic curvature .	In this language , the field equation is just the equality of mean extrinsic curvature and extrinsic mean torsion , which we call CT-duality .
0	The design and the implementation of a genetic algorithm are described .	The applicability domain is on structure-activity relationships expressed as multiple linear regressions and predictor variables are from families of structure-based molecular descriptors .	An experiment to compare different selection and survival strategies was designed and realized .	The genetic algorithm was run using the designed experiment on a set of 206 polychlorinated biphenyls searching on structure-activity relationships having known the measured octanol-water partition coefficients and a family of molecular descriptors .	The experiment shows that different selection and survival strategies create different partitions on the entire population of all possible genotypes .
0	Net atomic charges ( NACs ) are widely used in all chemical sciences to concisely summarize key information about the partitioning of electrons among atoms in materials .	Although widely used , there is currently no atomic population analysis method suitable for being used as a default method in quantum chemistry programs .	To address this challenge , we introduce a new atoms-in-materials method with the following nine properties : ( 1 ) exactly one electron distribution is assigned to each atom , ( 2 ) core electrons are assigned to the correct host atom , ( 3 ) NACs are formally independent of the basis set type because they are functionals of the total electron distribution , ( 4 ) the assigned atomic electron distributions give an efficiently converging polyatomic multipole expansion , ( 5 ) the assigned NACs usually follow Pauling scale electronegativity trends , ( 6 ) NACs for a particular element have good transferability among different conformations that are equivalently bonded , ( 7 ) the assigned NACs are chemically consistent with the assigned atomic spin moments , ( 8 ) the method has predictably rapid and robust convergence to a unique solution , and ( 9 ) the computational cost of charge partitioning scales linearly with increasing system size .	Across a broad range of material types , the DDEC6 NACs reproduced electron transfer trends , core electron binding energy shift trends , and electrostatic potentials across multiple system conformations with excellent accuracy compared to other charge assignment methods .	Due to non-nuclear attractors , Bader 's quantum chemical topology could not assign NACs for some of these materials .
3	The phase field model obeys a Cahn -- Hilliard equation and is two-way coupled to the standard Navier -- Stokes equations .	The Rayleigh -- Taylor instability of two immiscible fluids in the limit of small Atwood numbers is studied by means of a phase-field description .	In this method the sharp fluid interface is replaced by a thin , yet finite , transition layer where the interfacial forces vary smoothly .	This is achieved by introducing an order parameter ( the phase field ) whose variation is continuous across the interfacial layers and is uniform in the bulk region .	Starting from this system of equations we have first performed a linear analysis from which we have analytically rederived the known gravity-capillary dispersion relation in the limit of vanishing mixing energy density and capillary width .
3	Here $ \beta_k $ and $ \gamma_k $ are the critical exponents for $ P_\infty $ and $ S $ when the growth of clusters spontaneously breaks the $ Z_k $ symmetry of the $ k $ -partite graph ( Lau , Paczuski , and Grassberger , 2012 ) .	We study the agglomerative percolation ( AP ) models on the Bethe lattice and the triangular cactus to establish the exact mean-field theory for AP .	Using the self-consistent simulation method , based on the exact self-consistent equation , we directly measure the order parameter $ P_ { \infty } $ and average cluster size $ S $ .	From the measured $ P_ { \infty } $ and $ S $ we obtain the critical exponents $ \beta_k $ and $ \gamma_k $ for $ k=2 $ and 3 .	The obtained values are $ \beta_2=1.79 ( 3 ) $ , $ \gamma_2=0.88 ( 1 ) $ , $ \beta_3=1.35 ( 5 ) $ , and $ \gamma_3=0.94 ( 2 ) $ .
0	Who discovered the expanding universe ?	Was it Hubble , or Lema\^itre , or was it just the end result of a long series of investigations ?	In this article we summarise the main steps and contributions that led to one of the most exciting discoveries ever made , of which Lema\^itre was the principal architect .	In 1927 he combined his dynamical solutions of the Einstein equations with astronomical observations to conclude that the universe is expanding .	He derived the linear velocity-distance relationship and calculated the first numerical value of what later was called the `` Hubble constant '' .
2	It is analytically found that when ghost fields relax on the same time scale as the hydrodynamic ones , their major effect is a net enhancement of the fluid viscosity .	A lattice Boltzmann scheme simulating the dynamics of shell models of turbulence is developed .	The influence of high order kinetic modes ( ghosts ) on the dissipative properties of turbulence dynamics is studied .	The bare fluid viscosity is recovered by letting ghost fields evolve on a much longer time scale .	Analytical results are borne out by high-resolution numerical simulations .
4	What is new in this three-dimensional experiment is , multiple separation events of the vertical magnetic elements are observed in the photospheric magnetogram , and they reflect the interchange instability .	We have performed a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation to study the emergence of a twisted magnetic flux tube from -20,000 km of the solar convection zone to the corona through the photosphere and the chromosphere .	The middle part of the initial tube is endowed with a density deficit to instigate a buoyant emergence .	As the tube approaches the surface , it extends horizontally and makes a flat magnetic structure due to the photosphere ahead of the tube .	Further emergence to the corona breaks out via the interchange-mode instability of the photospheric fields , and eventually several magnetic domes build up above the surface .
0	The EROS collaboration has developed a real time alert system , which was operational in 1999 and 2000 .	A very long binary-lensing caustic crossing event , EROS-BLG-2000-5 , was found in the 2000 season and monitored by EROS .	EROS photometric data for this event are presented .	The data are well fitted by the model of An et al .	2002 based on a completely different dataset .
2	The data from the Spitzer infrared spectrograph ( IRS ) of these galaxies , which spans 5-40 micron , is anchored to their photometric counterparts .	We present continuous , monochromatic star formation rate ( SFR ) indicators over the mid-infrared wavelength range of 6-70 micron .	We use a sample of 58 star forming galaxies ( SFGs ) in the Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey ( SSGSS ) at z & lt ; 0.2 , for which there is a rich suite of multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy from the ultraviolet through to the infrared .	The spectral region between 40-70 micron is interpolated using dust model fits to the IRS spectrum and Spitzer 70 and 160 micron photometry .	Since there are no sharp spectral features in this region , we expect these interpolations to be robust .
3	Here we propose a new method based on the interaction between the spiral arms and the stars in the disc .	In the last few decades many efforts have been made to understand the effect of spiral arms on the gas and stellar dynamics in the Milky Way disc .	One of the fundamental parameters of the spiral structure is its angular velocity , or pattern speed $ \Omega_p $ , which determines the location of resonances in the disc and the spirals ' radial extent .	The most direct method for estimating the pattern speed relies on backward integration techniques , trying to locate the stellar birthplace of open clusters .	Using a sample of around 500 open clusters from the { \it New Catalogue of Optically Visible Open Clusters and Candidates } , and a sample of 500 giant stars observed by APOGEE , we find $ \Omega_p = 23.0\pm0.5 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ kpc $ ^ { -1 } $ , for a local standard of rest rotation $ V_0=220 $ ~km s $ ^ { -1 } $ and solar radius $ R_0=8.0 $ ~kpc .
4	E \textbf { 75 } , 055101 ( R ) ( 2007 ) ] .	The self-organized criticality in Ehrenfest 's historical dog-flea model is analyzed by simulating the underlying stochastic process .	The fluctuations around the thermal equilibrium in the model are treated as avalanches .	We show that the distributions for the fluctuation length differences at subsequent time steps are in the shape of a $ q $ -Gaussian ( the distribution which is obtained naturally in the context of nonextensive statistical mechanics ) if one avoids the finite size effects by increasing the system size .	We provide a clear numerical evidence that the relation between the exponent $ \tau $ of avalanche size distribution obtained by maximum likelihood estimation and the $ q $ value of appropriate q-Gaussian obeys the analytical result recently introduced by Caruso et al . [ Phys.Rev .
4	The method is variation diminishing , entropy decreasing , exactly conservative , and has no numerical dissipation away from shocks .	A particle scheme for scalar conservation laws in one space dimension is presented .	Particles representing the solution are moved according to their characteristic velocities .	Particle interaction is resolved locally , satisfying exact conservation of area .	Shocks stay sharp and propagate at correct speeds , while rarefaction waves are created where appropriate .
1	We then turn to examine this solution .	We prove that the NS cubic superstring field theories are classically equivalent , regardless of the choice of Y_ { -2 } in their definition , and illustrate it by an explicit evaluation of the action of Erler 's solution .	First , we explain that its cohomology is trivial also in the Ramond sector .	Then , we show that the boundary state corresponding to it is identically zero .	We conclude that this solution is indeed a closed string vacuum solution despite the absence of a tachyon field on the BPS D-brane .
0	We present 3 mm observations obtained with the IRAM 30-m telescope for ten nearby gas-rich active galaxies spanning three orders of magnitude in infrared luminosity .	Emission lines of HCO+ ( 1-0 ) , HCN ( 1-0 ) , and C2H ( 1-0 ) were simultaneously detected in most galaxies of our sample .	We also tentatively detected the rare isotopic species , H13CN , HC15N and H13CO+ in up to four galaxies ( IC 694 , NGC 3690 , NGC 4258 and NGC 6240 ) .	Our estimation shows that the optical depth of HCN is low to moderate in these galaxies ( tau ~ 1-5 ) .	After comparing the intensity ratios of different molecular emission lines ( HCN/HCO+ , C2H/HCN , and C2H/HCO+ ) with the infrared luminosity ( LIR ) , we find that in the infrared luminous sample of five composite ( AGN+Starburst ) galaxies , these ratios vary with LIR : the HCN/HCO+ ratio increases with LIR , which is consistent with previous studies , while there is a slight trend in the composite galaxies that both C2H/HCN and C2H/HCO+ ratios decrease with increasing LIR .
2	We present a detailed discussion of the supergravity moduli space , which involves flat form fields on asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau manifolds , and match this to the gauge theory vacuum moduli space .	We study the gravity duals of symmetry-breaking deformations of superconformal field theories , AdS/CFT dual to Type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x Y where Y is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold .	In these vacua both conformal invariance and baryonic symmetries are spontaneously broken .	We discuss certain linearised fluctuations of the moduli , identifying the Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneous breaking of non-anomalous baryonic symmetries .	The remaining moduli fields are related to spontaneous breaking of anomalous baryonic symmetries .
0	The combination of a vortex line in a one-dimensional optical lattice with fermions bound to the vortex core makes up an ultracold superstring .	We give a detailed derivation of the way to make this supersymmetric string in the laboratory .	In particular , we discuss the presence of a fermionic bound state in the vortex core and the tuning of the laser beams needed to achieve supersymmetry .	Moreover , we discuss experimental consequences of supersymmetry and identify the precise supersymmetry in the problem .	Finally , we make the mathematical connection with string theory .
1	We detect more than 14 400 spectral features of which 10 040 have been identified up to date and attributed to 43 different molecules , including 148 isotopologues and lines from vibrationally excited states .	We perform a sensitive ( line confusion limited ) , single-side band spectral survey towards Orion KL with the IRAM 30m telescope , covering the following frequency ranges : 80-115.5 GHz , 130-178 GHz , and 197-281 GHz .	In this paper , we focus on the study of OCS , HCS+ , H2CS , CS , CCS , C3S , and their isotopologues .	In addition , we map the OCS J=18-17 line and complete complementary observations of several OCS lines at selected positions around Orion IRc2 ( the position selected for the survey ) .	We report the first detection of OCS v2 = 1 and v3 = 1 vibrationally excited states in space and the first detection of C3S in warm clouds .
0	The availability of large on-line text corpora provides a natural and promising bridge between the worlds of natural language processing ( NLP ) and machine learning ( ML ) .	In recent years , the NLP community has been aggressively investigating statistical techniques to drive part-of-speech taggers , but application-specific text corpora can be used to drive knowledge acquisition at much higher levels as well .	In this paper we will show how ML techniques can be used to support knowledge acquisition for information extraction systems .	It is often very difficult to specify an explicit domain model for many information extraction applications , and it is always labor intensive to implement hand-coded heuristics for each new domain .	We have discovered that it is nevertheless possible to use ML algorithms in order to capture knowledge that is only implicitly present in a representative text corpus .
4	For sparse random graphs with $ p=c/n $ , $ c $ constant , we prove that $ \tau_2 ( G_ { n , p } ) = \lceil { { \sqrt { 8\Delta+1 } +5 } / { 2 } } \rceil $ where $ \Delta $ represents the maximum degree .	A proper 2-tone $ k $ -coloring of a graph is a labeling of the vertices with elements from $ \binom { [ k ] } { 2 } $ such that adjacent vertices receive disjoint labels and vertices distance 2 apart receive distinct labels .	The 2-tone chromatic number of a graph $ G $ , denoted $ \tau_2 ( G ) $ is the smallest $ k $ such that $ G $ admits a proper 2-tone $ k $ coloring .	In this paper , we prove that w.h.p .	for $ p\ge Cn^ { -1/4 } \ln^ { 9/4 } n $ , $ \tau_2 ( G_ { n , p } ) = ( 2+o ( 1 ) ) \chi ( G_ { n , p } ) $ where $ \chi $ represents the ordinary chromatic number .
0	Using the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper ( WHAM ) , we have measured at high spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise the profile of the scattered solar Mg I 5184 absorption line in the zodiacal light .	The observations were carried out toward 49 directions that sampled the ecliptic equator from solar elongations of 48\dg ( evening sky ) to 334\dg ( morning sky ) plus observations near +47\dg and +90\dg ecliptic latitude .	The spectra show a clear prograde kinematic signature that is inconsistent with dust confined to the ecliptic plane and in circular orbits influenced only by the sun 's gravity .	In particular , the broadened widths of the profiles , together with large amplitude variations in the centroid velocity with elongation angle , indicate that a significant population of dust is on eccentric orbits .	In addition , the wide , flat-bottomed line profile toward the ecliptic pole indicates a broad distribution of orbital inclinations extending up to about 30\dg - 40\dg with respect to the ecliptic plane .
3	We show that the Cyg X-1 spectrum accumulated by OSSE , BATSE , and COMPTEL in 1991 -- 95 , as well as the HEAO-3 gamma1 and gamma2 spectra can be well fitted by our model .	We construct a model of Cyg X-1 which describes self-consistently its emission from soft X-rays to MeV gamma rays .	Instead of a compact pair-dominated gamma-ray emitting region , we consider a hot optically thin and spatially extended proton-dominated cloud surrounding the whole accretion disc .	The gamma-ray emission is due to the bremsstrahlung , Comptonization , and positron annihilation , while the corona-disc model is retained for the X-ray emission .	The derived parameters are in qualitative agreement with the picture in which the spectral changes are governed by the mass flow rate in the accretion disc .
3	We provide a systematic treatment of color superconductivity in the instanton model .	Instantons generate strong non-perturbative interactions between quarks .	In the vacuum , these interactions lead to chiral symmetry breaking and generate constituent quark masses on the order of 300-400 MeV .	The observation that the same forces also provide attraction in the scalar diquark channel leads to the prediction that cold quark matter is a color superconductor , with gaps as large as $ \sim $ ~100 MeV .	We show that the structure of the superconductor depends on the number of flavors .
0	We present the first non-trivial online algorithms for the non-uniform , multicommodity buy-at-bulk ( MC-BB ) network design problem in undirected and directed graphs .	Our competitive ratios qualitatively match the best known approximation factors for the corresponding offline problems .	The main engine for our results is an online reduction theorem of MC-BB problems to their single-sink ( SS-BB ) counterparts .	We use the concept of junction-tree solutions ( Chekuri et al. , FOCS 2006 ) that play an important role in solving the offline versions of the problem via a greedy subroutine -- an inherently offline procedure .	Our main technical contribution is in designing an online algorithm using only the existence of good junction-trees to reduce an MC-BB instance to multiple SS-BB sub-instances .
2	Recent work has used frequency and energy-dependent time lags as a tool for studying relativistic reverberation around the black holes in several Seyfert galaxies .	Timing techniques offer powerful tools to study dynamical astrophysical phenomena .	In the X-ray band , they offer the potential of probing accretion physics down to the event horizon .	This was achieved thanks to the evenly-sampled light curves obtained using XMM-Newton .	Continuous-sampled data is however not always available and standard Fourier techniques are not applicable .
3	Particular emphasis lies on temporal dissipative Kerr solitons with regard to optical frequency comb generation where they are of particular importance .	This chapter describes the discovery and stable generation of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in continuous-wave ( CW ) laser driven optical microresonators .	The experimental signatures as well as the temporal and spectral characteristics of this class of bright solitons are discussed .	Moreover , analytical and numerical descriptions are presented that do not only reproduce qualitative features but can also be used to accurately model and predict the characteristics of experimental systems .	Here , one example is spectral broadening and self-referencing enabled by the ultra-short pulsed nature of the solitons .
4	Globally , however , the model is not finite , because solutions tend to generate infinite fractals .	Matter interacting classically with gravity in 3+1 dimensions usually gives rise to a continuum of degrees of freedom , so that , in any attempt to quantize the theory , ultraviolet divergences are nearly inevitable .	Here , we investigate matter of a form that only displays a finite number of degrees of freedom in compact sections of space-time .	In finite domains , one has only exact , analytic solutions .	This is achieved by limiting ourselves to straight pieces of string , surrounded by locally flat sections of space-time .
0	It is generally recognized that the traffic generated by an individual connected to a network acts as his biometric signature .	Several tools exploit this fact to fingerprint and monitor users .	Often , though , these tools assume to access the entire traffic , including IP addresses and payloads .	This is not feasible on the grounds that both performance and privacy would be negatively affected .	In reality , most ISPs convert user traffic into NetFlow records for a concise representation that does not include , for instance , any payloads .
3	Furthermore , we proved that the dark energy density parameter $ \Omega_ { \phi } $ would obey the same differential equation not only for all the scalar models in this paper but also for all the non-coupled dark energy models under the GR frame .	We give the three-dimensional dynamical autonomous systems for most of the popular scalar field dark energy models including ( phantom ) quintessence , ( phantom ) tachyon , k-essence and general non-canonical scalar field models and change the dynamical variables from trivial variables $ ( x , y , \lambda ) $ to observable related variables $ ( w_ { \phi } , \Omega_ { \phi } , \lambda ) $ .	We show the intimate relationships between those scalar fields that the three-dimensional system of k-essence can reduce to ( phantom ) tachyon , general non-canonical scalar field can reduce to ( phantom ) quintessence and k-essence can also reduce to ( phantom ) quintessence for some special cases .	For the applications of the three-dimensional dynamical systems , we investigate several special cases and give the exactly dynamical solutions in detail .	We therefore get the result that , if we want to find a dark energy phenomenological model which possesses a stable attractor corresponding to current universe with $ \Omega_ { de } \sim 0.70 $ and $ \gamma_ { de } \sim 0.1 $ to solve or at least alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem without fine-tunings , we must consider the interaction between dark energy and other barotropic fluids .
3	The Polyakov-loop extended Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio ( PNJL ) model has the same properties as two-color QCD for $ { \cal C } { \mathbb Z } _ { 2 } $ symmetry and the pseudo-reality .	We study properties of two-color QCD at imaginary chemical potential ( $ \mu $ ) from the viewpoint of the Roberge-Weiss ( RW ) periodicity , the charge conjugation and the pseudo-reality .	At $ \mu=\pm i\pi T/2 $ , where $ T $ is temperature , the system is symmetric under the combination of the charge conjugation $ { \cal C } $ and the $ { \mathbb Z } _ { 2 } $ transformation .	The symmetry , called $ { \cal C } { \mathbb Z } _ { 2 } $ symmetry , is preserved at lower $ T $ but broken at higher $ T $ .	The nontrivial correlation between the chiral restoration and the deconfinement are investigated by introducing the entanglement vertex in the PNJL model .
1	We systematically compare measurements using a 3T configuration , probing spin accumulation directly beneath the injecting contact , with results from nonlocal measurements , where solely spin accumulation in the GaAs channel is probed .	We investigate the correlation between spin signals measured in three-terminal ( 3T ) geometry by the Hanle effect and the spin accumulation generated in a semiconductor channel in a lateral ( Ga , Mn ) As/GaAs Esaki diode device .	We find that the spin signal detected in the 3T configuration is dominated by a bias-dependent spin detection sensitivity , which in turn is strongly correlated with charge-transport properties of the junction .	This results in a particularly strong enhancement of the detected spin signal in a region of increased differential resistance .	We find additionally that two-step tunneling via localized states ( LS ) in the gap of ( Ga , Mn ) As does not compromise spin injection into the semiconductor conduction band .
3	This ansatz yields compelling results : Quark Yukawas naturally accommodate hierarchical masses and small mixing whereas Lepton Yukawas exhibit a hierarchical pattern for charged leptons and simultaneously degeneracy in the neutrino sector correlated with large mixing and Majorana phases .	The matter content of the Standard Model admits a global symmetry due to the generational structure of the spectrum respected by all interactions except for fermion couplings to the Higgs doublet .	This symmetry is identified as the largest possible global symmetry of the free theory and extended to the case of massive neutrinos .	The violation of such symmetry is then assumed dynamical and the value of the Yukawa couplings is fixed by a variational principle .	The difference in the mixing patterns of Quark and Leptons in this scheme stem from the Dirac vs Majorana nature of fermions .
1	In particular we show new lower bounds on knowledge compilation to SDD and DNNF forms .	We show new limits on the efficiency of using current techniques to make exact probabilistic inference for large classes of natural problems .	We give strong lower bounds on the complexity of SDD representations by relating SDD size to best-partition communication complexity .	We use this relationship to prove exponential lower bounds on the SDD size for representing a large class of problems that occur naturally as queries over probabilistic databases .	A consequence is that for representing unions of conjunctive queries , SDDs are not qualitatively more concise than OBDDs .
2	We see a Cronin-like enhancement in d+Au collisions at midrapidity , going to a strong suppression at eta & gt ; = 2 .	The BRAHMS experiment at RHIC has measured the production of charged hadrons as a function of pseudorapidity and transverse momentum in Au+Au , d+Au and p+p collisions at a common energy of sqrt ( s_NN ) =200GeV , and from these spectra we construct the nuclear modification factors for both `` hot '' and `` cold '' nuclear matter .	In this contribution I will show how these factors evolve with pseudorapidity and collision centrality .	In central Au+Au collisions we find a suppression both at mid- and forward rapidities that vanishes for peripheral collisions .	We interpret this as signs of several different medium related effects modifying bulk particle production in Au+Au and d+Au collisions at RHIC energies .
4	We also discuss the observable implications of open heavy meson pair production from the intrinsic heavy quark Fock states .	Double $ J/\psi $ production on the order of 20-30 pb has been observed by the NA3 collaboration .	These $ \psi \psi $ pairs , measured in $ \pi^- N $ interactions at 150 and 280 GeV $ /c $ and in $ pN $ interactions at 400 GeV $ /c $ , carry a large fraction of the projectile momentum , $ x_ { \psi \psi } \geq 0.6 $ for the 150 GeV $ /c $ beam and $ \geq 0.4 $ at 280 GeV $ /c $ .	We examine several sources of $ \psi \psi $ pair production within QCD , including $ { \cal O } ( \alpha_s^4 ) $ $ \psi \psi $ production , leading-twist $ b \overline b $ production and decay , and the materialization of heavy-quark Fock states in the projectile .	We estimate the production cross section and the single and double $ J/\psi $ momentum and mass distributions for each , comparing the results with the NA3 data , and predict $ \psi \psi $ production in $ pN $ interactions at 800 GeV $ /c $ , accessible to current fixed-target experiments .
3	Even so , the analysis based on the full list of pulsars may suffer from selection effects .	Observations by Fermi LAT enabled us to explore the population of non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars with the set of 89 objects .	It was recently noted that there are apparent differences in properties of radio-quiet and radio-loud subsets .	In particular , average observed radio-loud pulsar is younger than radio-quiet one and is located at smaller galactic latitude .	Namely , most of radio-loud pulsars are first discovered in the radio-band , while radio-quiet ones are found using the gamma-ray data .
0	Kramers-Kronig analysis is commonly used to estimate the optical properties of new materials .	The analysis typically uses data from far infrared through near ultraviolet ( say , 40 -- 40,000 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ or 5 mev -- 5 eV ) and uses extrapolations outside the measured range .	Most high-frequency extrapolations use a power law , 1/ $ \omega^n $ , transitioning to $ 1/\omega^ { 4 } $ at a considerably higher frequency and continuing this free-carrier extension to infinity .	The mid-range power law is adjusted to match the slope of the data and to give pleasing curves , but the choice of power ( usually between 0.5 and 3 ) is arbitrary .	Instead of an arbitrary power law , it is is better to use X-ray atomic scattering functions such as those presented by Henke and co-workers .
4	They were derived in collaboration with Abhay Ashtekar .	This is a contribution to the MG9 session QG1-a .	A new quantum representation for the Lorentzian gravity is created from the Pullin vaccum by the operators assigned to 2-complexes .	The representation uses the original , spinorial Ashtekar variables , the reality conditions are well posed and Thiemann 's Hamiltonian is well defined .	The results on the existence of a suitable Hilbert product are partial .
2	Here we study the effects of electric charge ( electric energy density ) on the spacetime outside a rotating electrically charged system bound by a strong gravitational force .	Electrically charged systems bound by a strong gravitational force can sustain a huge amount of electric charge ( up to 10^20C ) against Coulomb repulsion .	General relativistically such systems form a stable hydrostatic configuration both in the non-rotating and rotating cases .	In particular we investigate the effect of charge density on frame-dragging of spacetime in the exterior region .	Using the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations it is found that in the slow rotation approximation charge accumulations not only acts like an additional mass , thus modifying the spherically symmetric part of the spacetime , the electric charge also contributes directly to the dragging of spacetime .
4	Thus our algorithm is optimal w.r.t .	Recent results by Harrow et.al .	and by Ta-Shma , suggest that quantum computers may have an exponential advantage in solving a wealth of linear algebraic problems , over classical algorithms .	Building on the quantum intuition of these results , we step back into the classical domain , and explore its usefulness in designing classical algorithms .	We achieve an algorithm for solving the major linear-algebraic problems in time $ O ( n^ { \omega+\nu } ) $ for any $ \nu & gt ; 0 $ , where $ \omega $ is the optimal matrix-product constant .
0	Analytical expressions for the magnetization and the longitudinal conductivity of nanowires are derived in a magnetic field , B .	We show that the interplay between size and magnetic field energy-level quantizations manifests itself through novel magnetic quantum oscillations in metallic nanowires .	There are three characteristic frequencies of de Haas-van Alphen ( dHvA ) and Shubnikov-de Haas ( SdH ) oscillations , F=F_0 , F_1 , and F_2 in contrast with a single frequency F'_0 in simple bulk metals .	The amplitude of oscillations is strongly enhanced in some `` magic '' magnetic fields .	The wire cross-section S can be measured along with the Fermi surface cross-section , S_F .
4	We also introduce the notion of the compound curling number of a simple connected graph $ G $ and then initiate a study on the curling number of certain standard graphs like Jaco graphs and set-graphs .	In this paper , we introduce the concept of curling subsequence of simple , finite and connected graphs .	A curling subsequence is a maximal subsequence $ C $ of the degree sequence of a simple connected graph $ G $ for which the curling number $ cn ( G ) $ corresponds to the curling number of the degree sequence per se and hence we call it the curling number of the graph $ G $ .	A maximal degree subsequence with equal entries is called an identity subsequence .	The number of identity curling subsequences in a simple connected graph $ G $ is denoted $ ic ( G ) . $ We show that the curling number conjecture holds for the degree sequence of a simple connected graph $ G $ on $ n \geq 1 $ vertices .
1	This is obtained by modifying the energy levels of the non interacting Hamiltonian in a way consistent with the corresponding one particle density of states in the thermodynamic limit .	An efficient scheme is introduced for a fast and smooth convergence to the thermodynamic limit with finite size cluster calculations .	After this modification exact free electron energies are obtained with finite size calculations and for particular fillings that satisfy the so called `` closed shell condition '' .	In this case the `` sign problem '' is particularly mild in the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo technique and therefore , with this technique , it is possible to obtain converged energies for the Hubbard model even for $ U & gt ; 0 $ .	We provide a strong numerical evidence that phase separation occurs in the low doping region and moderate $ U\lesssim 4t $ regime of this model .
1	Monte Carlo simulations using semiempirical interatomic potential , first-principles total energy calculations , and experimental spectroscopy are used .	Segregation , precipitation , and phase separation in Fe-Cr systems is investigated .	In order to obtain a general picture of the relation of the atomic interactions and properties of Fe-Cr alloys in bulk , surface , and interface regions several complementary methods has to be used .	Using Exact Muffin-Tin Orbitals method the effective chemical potential as a function of Cr content ( 0-15 at. % Cr ) is calculated for a surface , second atomic layer and bulk .	At ~10 at. % Cr in the alloy the reversal of the driving force of a Cr atom to occupy either bulk or surface sites is obtained .
1	Our model corresponds to a network of coupled non-negative matrix factorization ( NMF ) modules , which we refer to as a positive factor network ( PFN ) .	We present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential data with hierarchical structure .	The data model is linear , subject to non-negativity constraints , so that observation data consisting of an additive combination of individually representable observations is also representable by the network .	This is a desirable property for modeling problems in computational auditory scene analysis , since distinct sound sources in the environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding magnitude spectrogram .	We propose inference and learning algorithms that leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement .
2	USFD2 identifies and anchors temporal expressions , and also attempts two of the four temporal relation assignment tasks .	We describe the University of Sheffield system used in the TempEval-2 challenge , USFD2 .	The challenge requires the automatic identification of temporal entities and relations in text .	A rule-based system picks out and anchors temporal expressions , and a maximum entropy classifier assigns temporal link labels , based on features that include descriptions of associated temporal signal words .	USFD2 identified temporal expressions successfully , and correctly classified their type in 90 % of cases .
1	We show how a formal series expansion of the invariant measure of a Langevin dynamics numerical method can be obtained in a straightforward way using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff lemma .	In this article , we focus on the sampling of the configurational Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution , that is , the calculation of averages of functions of the position coordinates of a molecular $ N $ -body system modelled at constant temperature .	We then compare Langevin dynamics integrators in terms of their invariant distributions and demonstrate a superconvergence property ( 4th order accuracy where only 2nd order would be expected ) of one method in the high friction limit ; this method , moreover , can be reduced to a simple modification of the Euler-Maruyama method for Brownian dynamics involving a non-Markovian ( coloured noise ) random process .	In the Brownian dynamics case , 2nd order accuracy of the invariant density is achieved .	All methods considered are efficient for molecular applications ( requiring one force evaluation per timestep ) and of a simple form .
3	We investigate the suggestion that this signal could be due to an active region on the star , emitting enhanced ultraviolet or X-ray radiation leading to an increased mass loss rate of the planet ; we confirm that such a scenario could cause both modulation of the transit depths of KIC 12557548b , and small enough transit-timing variations that they might not be detected in the Kepler data .	Kawahara and collaborators analyzed the transits of the candidate disintegrating Mercury-mass planet KIC 12557548b and suggested that the transit depths were correlated with the phase of the stellar rotation .	We analyze the transit depths of KIC 12557548b and confirm that there is indeed a robust , statistically significant signal in the transit depths at the rotation period of the spotted host star .	This signal is more prominent in the first-half of the Kepler data , and is not due to leakage of the rotating spot signal into our measurement of the transit depths , or due to unocculted starspots .	Our preferred explanation for the fact that the transit depths of KIC 12557548b are modulated with the stellar rotation phase is that the candidate transiting planet is occulting starspots on this highly spotted star ; such a scenario could cause transit depth variations as large as have been observed , and cause transit-timing variations small enough that they are arguably consistent with the Kepler data .
0	We present optimal competitive algorithms for two interrelated known problems involving Steiner Arborescence .	One is the continuous problem of the Symmetric Rectilinear Steiner Arborescence ( SRSA ) , studied by Berman and Coulston .	A very related , but discrete problem ( studied separately in the past ) is the online Multimedia Content Delivery ( MCD ) problem on line networks , presented originally by Papadimitriu , Ramanathan , and Rangan .	An efficient content delivery was modeled as a low cost Steiner arborescence in a grid of network*time they defined .	We study here the version studied by Charikar , Halperin , and Motwani ( who used the same problem definitions , but removed some constraints on the inputs ) .
0	We are interested in the kernel of one-dimensional diffusion equations with continuous coefficients as evaluated by means of explicit discretization schemes of uniform step $ h & gt ; 0 $ in the limit as $ h\to0 $ .	We consider both semidiscrete triangulations with continuous time and explicit Euler schemes with time step small enough for the method to be stable .	We find sharp uniform bounds for the convergence rate as a function of the degree of smoothness which we conjecture .	The bounds also apply to the time derivative of the kernel and its first two space derivatives .	Our proof is constructive and is based on a new technique of path conditioning for Markov chains and a renormalization group argument .
3	In both the aforesaid prescriptions , the energy thus obtained depends on the radial coordinate , the mass of the black hole and a parameter $ \lambda_ { 0 } $ , while all the momenta are found to be zero .	In general relativity one of the most fundamental issues consists in defining a generally acceptable definition for the energy-momentum density .	As a consequence , many coordinate-dependent definitions have been presented , whereby some of them utilize appropriate energy-momentum complexes .	We investigate the energy-momentum distribution for a metric exterior to a spherically symmetric black hole in the brane world by applying the Landau-Lifshitz and Weinberg prescriptions .	It is shown that for a special value of the parameter $ \lambda_ { 0 } $ , the Schwarzschild space-time geometry is recovered .
1	A neural-network based hadronic $ B $ -meson tagging method is used in this study .	We find evidence for the semileptonic baryonic decay $ B^-\to p\bar p\ell^-\bar\nu_\ell $ ( $ \ell=e , \mu $ ) , based on a data sample of 772 million $ B\bar B $ pairs collected at the $ \Upsilon ( 4S ) $ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider .	The branching fraction of $ B^-\to p\bar p\ell^-\bar\nu_\ell $ is measured to be $ ( 5.8^ { +2.4 } _ { -2.1 } \textrm { ( stat .	) } \pm 0.9\textrm { ( syst .	) } ) \times 10^ { -6 } $ with a significance of 3.2 $ \sigma $ , where lepton universality is assumed .
2	In our analysis , we pursue the simplest physical description of the dominant features in the radiation , providing an interpretation of the waveforms in terms of an { \em implicit rotating source } .	We present a detailed descriptive analysis of the gravitational radiation from black-hole binary mergers of nonspinning black holes , based on numerical simulations of systems varying from equal-mass to a 6:1 mass ratio .	Our primary goal is to present relatively complete information about the waveforms , including all the leading multipolar components , to interested researchers .	This interpretation applies uniformly to the full wave train , from inspiral through ringdown .	We emphasize strong relationships among the $ \ell=m $ modes that persist through the full wave train .
1	For a positive integer n , let f_ { \kappa } ( n ) denote the smallest non-negative integer b such that for each system S \subseteq E_n which has a solution in non-negative integers x_1 , ... , x_n and which has less than \kappa solutions in non-negative integers x_1 , ... , x_n , there exists a solution of S in non-negative integers not greater than b .	Let E_n= { x_k=1 , x_i+x_j=x_k , x_i \cdot x_j=x_k : i , j , k \in { 1 , ... , n } } , and let \kappa \in { 2,3,4 , ... , \omega , \omega_1 } .	We prove : ( 1 ) if a function g : N \setminus { 0 } \to N has a n-fold ( alternatively , finite-fold ) Diophantine representation , then f_ { n+1 } ( respectively , f_ { \omega } ) dominates g , ( 2 ) f_ { \omega_1 } dominates all computable functions , ( 3 ) if the function f_n ( alternatively , f_ { \omega } ) is majorized by a computable function , then a ( n-1 ) -fold ( respectively , finite-fold ) Diophantine representation does not exist for any function of exponential growth .	Let \kappa \neq \omega_1 , and let us consider the following three statements : ( a ) there exists an algorithm A ( whose execution always terminates ) which takes as input a Diophantine equation D and returns the answer YES or NO which indicates whether or not the equation D has a solution in non-negative integers , if the solution set Sol ( D ) satisfies card ( Sol ( D ) ) & lt ; \kappa , ( b ) the function f_ { \kappa } is majorized by a computable function , ( c ) if a set M \subseteq N^n has a ( \kappa-1 ) -fold ( finite-fold , if kappa=\omega ) Diophantine representation , then M is computable .	We prove that ( a ) is equivalent to ( b ) and ( a ) implies ( c ) .
1	These projections are the de facto standard and are widely used by international organizations , governments and researchers .	The United Nations regularly publishes projections of the populations of all the world 's countries broken down by age and sex .	Like almost all other population projections , they are produced using the standard deterministic cohort-component projection method and do not yield statements of uncertainty .	We describe a Bayesian method for producing probabilistic population projections for most countries which are projections that the United Nations could use .	It has at its core Bayesian hierarchical models for the total fertility rate and life expectancy at birth .
4	With their large radii , WASP-52b and 58b are new cases of low-density , inflated planets , whereas WASP-59b is likely to have a large , dense core .	We present the discovery of four new transiting hot jupiters , detected mainly from SuperWASP-North and SOPHIE observations .	These new planets , WASP-52b , WASP-58b , WASP-59b , and WASP-60b , have orbital periods ranging from 1.7 to 7.9 days , masses between 0.46 and 0.94 M_Jup , and radii between 0.73 and 1.49 R_Jup .	Their G1 to K5 dwarf host stars have V magnitudes in the range 11.7-13.0 .	The depths of the transits are between 0.6 and 2.7 % , depending on the target .
0	Bose-Einstein Correlations ( BEC ) of three identical charged pions were studied in 4 x 10^6 hadronic Z^0 decays recorded with the OPAL detector at LEP .	The genuine three-pion correlations , corrected for the Coulomb effect , were separated from the known two-pion correlations by a new subtraction procedure .	A significant genuine three-pion BEC enhancement near threshold was observed having an emitter source radius of r_3 = 0.580 +/- 0.004 ( stat . )	+/- 0.029 ( syst . )	fm and a strength of \lambda_3 = 0.504 +/- 0.010 ( stat . )
0	We construct an action of a polynomial ring on the colored sl ( 2 ) link homology of Cooper-Krushkal , over which this homology is finitely generated .	We define a new , related link homology which is finite dimensional , extends to tangles , and categorifies a scalar-multiple of the sl ( 2 ) Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant .	We expect this homology to be functorial under 4-dimensional cobordisms .	The polynomial action is related to a conjecture of Gorsky-Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende on the stable Khovanov homology of torus knots , and as an application we obtain a weak version of this conjecture .	A key new ingredient is the construction of a bounded chain complex which categorifies a scalar multiple of the Jones-Wenzl projector , in which the denominators have been cleared .
4	We have defined the dependence of perturbing potential value , under which the galaxy shock wave appeared with respect to the parameters characterizing the gas disk ( such as sound speed in gas , disk rotation speed , `` spiral design '' rotation speed ) .	Nonlinear solutions for the large-scale flow of interstellar gas in the presence of a spiral gravitational field have received considerable attention because this model allows to explain a lot of observations for galaxy disks .	However this investigations were forced to limit by numerable analysis of the problem because of its nonlinearity .	In this paper we wish to carry out the analytical expression which allows us to describe the super sonic nonlinear interstellar gas flow in rapidly rotating galaxy disk which is made by the spiral density wave .	One of characteristic parameters of theory is the amplitude of spiral density wave potential corresponding to separatrix , which separates super sonic flows from flows containing the jump from super sonic flows to subsonic .
0	Using Lamperti 's relationship between L\ ' { e } vy processes and positive self-similar Markov processes ( pssMp ) , we study the weak convergence of the law $ \mathbb { P } _x $ of a pssMp starting at $ x & gt ; 0 $ , in the Skorohod space of c\` { a } dl\` { a } g paths , when $ x $ tends to 0 .	To do so , we first give conditions which allow us to construct a c\` { a } dl\` { a } g Markov process $ X^ { ( 0 ) } $ , starting from 0 , which stays positive and verifies the scaling property .	Then we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the laws $ \mathbb { P } _x $ to converge weakly to the law of $ X^ { ( 0 ) } $ as $ x $ goes to 0 .	In particular , this answers a question raised by Lamperti [ Z. Wahrsch.Verw .	Gebiete 22 ( 1972 ) 205 -- 225 ] about the Feller property for pssMp at $ x=0 $ .
3	The detector setup is a pixelated detector from the Medipix/Timepix family with high-voltage post-acceleration capabilities .	Microscope mode imaging for secondary ion mass spectrometry is a technique with the promise of simultaneous high spatial resolution and high speed imaging of biomolecules from complex surfaces .	Technological developments such as new position-sensitive detectors , in combination with polyatomic primary ion sources , are required to exploit the full potential of microscope mode mass spectrometry imaging , i.e.to efficiently push the limits of ultra-high spatial resolution , sample throughput and sensitivity .	In this work , a C60 primary source is combined with a commercial mass microscope for microscope mode secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging .	The mass spectral and imaging performance of the system is tested with various benchmark samples and thin tissue sections .
1	For similar algebraic structures $ B_i $ , $ i\in I $ let $ \Pi ( B_i|i\in I ) $ and $ \Pi _ { \mathcal { D } } ( B_i|i\in I ) $ denote the direct product and the ultraproduct of $ B_i $ , respectively .	Let $ I $ be a non-empty set and $ \mathcal { D } $ an ultrafilter over $ I $ .	Let $ \mathcal { D } ^* $ denote the ultraproduct congruence on $ \Pi ( B_i|i\in I ) $ .	Let the $ \wedge $ -semilattice of all congruences on an algebraic structure $ B $ denoted by $ { \bf Con } ( B ) $ .	In this paper we show that , for any similar algebraic structures $ A_i $ , $ i\in I $ , there is an embedding $ \Phi $ of $ \Pi _ { \mathcal { D } } ( { \bf Con } ( A_i ) |i\in I ) $ into $ { \bf Con } ( \Pi _ { \mathcal { D } } ( A_i|i\in I ) $ .
3	Despite the strong coupling between optical depth and temperature which determines a spectral shape insensitive to their precise values , moderate spectral changes are possible .	The current status of understanding of the X-ray emission from Seyfert galaxies involves Comptonization of soft photons by hot subrelativistic electrons .	After briefly reviewing the early theoretical basis for the presence of hot optically thin plasma in or around accretion disks and the key observations that led to develop the presently popular model of an accretion disk with a hot corona , we summarize recent progress in accretion models that take into account energy dissipation and/or angular momentum transport in the corona .	Finally , adopting the simple scheme of a homogeneous plane parallel corona , we discuss in detail the dependence of the X-ray spectrum on the coronal parameters .	The spectral variability patterns can be used as diagnostics for coronal physics and should allow to determine whether the optical depth of the corona is dominated by e+e- pairs .
4	We consider ton-scale extrapolations of three current experiments : CDMS , XENON and COUPP , with 1000 kg-years of raw exposure each .	Weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) are amongst the most interesting dark matter ( DM ) candidates .	Many DM candidates naturally arise in theories beyond the standard model ( SM ) of particle physics , like weak-scale supersymmetry ( SUSY ) .	Experiments aim to detect WIMPs by scattering , annihilation or direct production , and thereby determine the underlying theory to which they belong , along with its parameters .	Here we examine the prospects for further constraining the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ( CMSSM ) with future ton-scale direct detection experiments .
4	We find no correlation between core radius and distance from the SMC center , although consistent with other studies of dwarf galaxies , some relatively old and massive clusters have low densities .	We present structural parameters for the seven intermediate-age and old star clusters NGC121 , Lindsay 1 , Kron 3 , NGC339 , NGC416 , Lindsay 38 , and NGC419 in the Small Magellanic Cloud .	We fit King profiles and Elson , Fall , and Freeman profiles to both surface-brightness and star count data taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope .	Clusters older than 1 Gyr show a spread in cluster core radii that increases with age , while the youngest clusters have relatively compact cores .	No evidence for post core collapse clusters was found .
2	In this paper , an experimental method is presented for investigating the ion wakefield which employs a new oscillation technique designed to perturb a two-particle vertical chain .	Dust particles often form vertical chains due to the influence of the wakefield produced by the streaming ions in the plasma sheath .	These particle chains are proving useful as a unique diagnostic tool for investigating the physics behind the basic properties of the ion wakefield within the plasma sheath .	Using this technique , damped free fall oscillations are generated via an external DC bias to the lower electrode .	A fast Fourier transformation is then used to produce a spectrum from the collected oscillation data and a center of mass oscillation is identified .
3	Based on the unique feature , we demonstrate that highly entangled photons can be produced and photonic controlled phase gate can be constructed .	We propose an asymmetric quantum well structure to realize strong interaction between two slow optical pulses .	The linear optical properties and nonlinear optical responses associated with cross-Kerr nonlinearity are analyzed .	Combining the resonant tunneling and the advantages of inverted-Y type scheme , giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity can be achieved with vanishing absorptions .	In this construction , the scheme is symmetric for the probe and signal pulses .
2	We analyze the structure of the resulted four-dimensional dynamical system with the methods of the center manifold theory and the normal form theory .	We study the closed universe recollapse conjecture for positively curved FRW models with a perfect fluid matter source and a scalar field which arises in the conformal frame of the $ R+\alpha R^ { 2 } $ theory .	By including ordinary matter , we extend the analysis of a previous work .	It is shown that an initially expanding closed FRW universe , starting close to the Minkowski spacetime , can not avoid recollapse .	We discuss the posibility that potentials with a positive minimum may prevent the recollapse of closed universes .
1	In the first part we introduce flags of lattices and associated injective systems of ( non-normal ) cones and projective systems of ( non-normal ) affine toric varieties .	The paper consist of two parts .	We study the associated field of multidimensional Laurent power series .	In the second part we use the resolution of singularities techniques to study the geometry near a complete flag of subvarieties and the Parshin 's residues .	The first part plays the role of a standard coordinate neighborhood for Parshin 's points .
4	We thus conjecture that the corresponding ratio is universal for general CFTs in three dimensions .	We study the contribution to the entanglement entropy of ( 2+1 ) -dimensional conformal field theories coming from a sharp corner in the entangling surface .	This contribution is encoded in a function $ a ( \theta ) $ of the corner opening angle , and was recently proposed as a measure of the degrees of freedom in the underlying CFT .	We show that the ratio $ a ( \theta ) /C_T $ , where $ C_T $ is the central charge in the stress tensor correlator , is an almost universal quantity for a broad class of theories including various higher-curvature holographic models , free scalars and fermions , and Wilson-Fisher fixed points of the $ O ( N ) $ models with $ N=1,2,3 $ .	Strikingly , the agreement between these different theories becomes exact in the limit $ \theta\rightarrow \pi $ , where the entangling surface approaches a smooth curve .
0	We present JHK images of the young ( ~20 Myrs ) nearby ( ~48 pc ) stars HD 199143 and HD 358623 to search for ( sub- ) stellar companions around them .	The images were obtained in JHK with the speckle camera SHARP-I in July 2001 and in H with SofI in Dec 2000 , July 2001 , and Dec 2001 , all at the ESO 3.5m NTT .	We present a companion candidate with a 2 arc sec offset being almost 2 mag fainter than HD 358623 with proper motion consistent with the known proper motion of the primary star HD 358623 A .	Then , we obtained a spectrum in the H-band ( with SofI at the NTT ) of this companion showing that it has spectral type M1-3 , consistent with being a companion of HD 358623 A ( K7-M0 ) .	Also , a companion candidate with a 1 arcsecond offset being 2 mag fainter than HD 199143 is detected .
1	Our typical result shows that under some extra conditions , if the closed unit disc is complete $ K ' $ -spectral for $ \phi ( T ) $ for every $ \phi\in \Phi $ , then $ \overline\Omega $ is complete $ K $ -spectral for $ T $ for some constant $ K $ .	Let $ \Phi $ be a family of functions analytic in some neighborhood of a complex domain $ \Omega $ , and let $ T $ be a Hilbert space operator whose spectrum is contained in $ \overline\Omega $ .	In particular , we prove that under a geometric transversality condition , the intersection of finitely many $ K ' $ -spectral sets for $ T $ is again $ K $ -spectral for some $ K\ge K ' $ .	These theorems generalize and complement results by Mascioni , Stessin , Stampfli , Badea-Beckerman-Crouzeix and others .	We also extend to non-convex domains a result by Putinar and Sandberg on the existence of a skew dilation of $ T $ to a normal operator with spectrum in $ \partial\Omega $ .
1	The samples with x = 0.60 crystallize in an orthorhombic structure ( with orthorhombic distortion decreasing with increasing x ) , while the samples with x=0.80 and 1.0 crystallize in a pseudo tetragonal structure .	Samples of Y0.4Pr0.6Ba2-xSrxCu3O7 have been synthesized by a solid- state reaction route .	Resistance ( R ) measurements as a function of temperature ( T ) show that x = 0.0 sample is highly semiconducting with R2K/R300K ratio of ~ 65 .	This ratio decreases to only ~23 and 5 for x=0.20 and x=0.4 samples , respectively .	Further , the x=0.60 sample shows onset of a broad superconducting transition temperature ( Tconset ) at around 20 K without achieving the TcR=0 state down to 2 K. The TcR=0 state is observed in x = 0.80 and 1.00 samples at around 5 and 14 K , respectively .
1	We establish the existence of an universal AE ( 0 ) -group of a given weight as well as the existence of an universal action of AE ( 0 ) -group of a given weight on a AE ( 0 ) -space of the same weight .	We investigate topological AE ( 0 ) -groups class of which contains the class of Polish groups as well as the class of all locally compact groups .	A complete characterization of closed subgroups of powers of the symmetric group is obtained .	It is also shown that every AE ( 0 ) -group is Baire isomorphic to the product of Polish groups .	These results are obtained by using the spectral descriptions of AE ( 0 ) -groups which are presented in Section 3 .
0	We introduce a theoretical model for the compaction of granular materials by discrete vibrations which is expected to hold when the intensity of vibration is low .	The dynamical unit is taken to be clusters of granules that belong to the same collective structure .	We rigourously construct the model from first principles and show that numerical solutions compare favourably with a range of experimental results .	This includes the logarithmic relaxation towards a statistical steady state , the effect of varying the intensity of vibration resulting in a so-called `` annealing '' curve , and the power spectrum of density fluctuations in the steady state itself .	A mean field version of the model is introduced which shares many features with the exact model and is open to quantitative analysis .
3	For small wavelength modes , the Green 's function for $ f_+ $ exhibits a remarkable transition from Lorentz to Galilean invariance , whereas for $ f_- $ such modes effectively do not propagate .	Quantum mechanics with a generalized uncertainty principle arises through a representation of the commutator $ [ \hat { x } , \hat { p } ] = i f ( \hat { p } ) $ .	We apply this deformed quantization to free scalar field theory for $ f_\pm =1\pm \beta p^2 $ .	The resulting quantum field theories have a rich fine scale structure .	For both cases Lorentz invariance is recovered at long wavelengths .
3	Such particles are produced through the interactions with other fields , whose mass terms are varying due to a time-dependent background .	We have investigated effects of interaction terms on non-perturbative particle production .	It is well known that time-varying masses induce abundant particle production .	In this paper we have shown that it is possible to induce particle production even if the mass term of a particle species is not varying in time .	The necessary formalism has been introduced and analytic and numerical calculations have been performed in a simple but illustrative model .
0	We introduce an extended Dicke model with controllable long-range atom-atom interaction to simulate topologically ordered states and achieve decoherence-protected qubits .	We illustrate our idea in an experimentally feasible circuit quantum electrodynamics scenario .	Due to the intrinsic competition with the atom-field coupling strength , we first demonstrate that this atom-atom interaction can exhibit a novel topological quantum interference effect arising from the instanton and anti-instanton tunneling paths .	As a consequence , this proposed model only with a few odd-number of atoms has a two-fold absolute degenerate ground-subspace with a large energy gap , which can become larger with the increasing of the system-size .	It may also support the excitation of anyonic statistics , and thus can be regarded as a possible candidate for processing topological quantum memory .
4	In the steady state , comparison with an analytical solution shows good agreement .	We introduce a nonlinear generalized tensorial Maxwell-type constitutive equation to describe shear-thinning glass-forming fluids , motivated by a recent microscopic approach to the nonlinear rheology of colloidal suspensions .	The model captures a nonvanishing dynamical yield stress at the glass transition and incorporates normal-stress differences .	A modified lattice-Boltzmann ( LB ) simulation scheme is presented that includes non-Newtonian contributions to the stress tensor and deals with flow-induced pressure differences .	We test this scheme in pressure-driven 2D Poiseuille flow of the nonlinear generalized Maxwell fluid .
0	We consider a hierarchical network that consists of mobile users , a two-tiered cellular network ( namely small cells and macro cells ) and central routers , each of which follows a Poisson point process ( PPP ) .	In this scenario , small cells with limited-capacity backhaul are able to cache content under a given set of randomized caching policies and storage constraints .	Moreover , we consider three different content popularity models , namely fixed content popularity , distance-dependent and load-dependent , in order to model the spatio-temporal behavior of users ' content request patterns .	We derive expressions for the average delay of users assuming perfect knowledge of content popularity distributions and randomized caching policies .	Although the trend of the average delay for all three content popularity models is essentially identical , our results show that the overall performance of cached-enabled heterogeneous networks can be substantially improved , especially under the load-dependent content popularity model .
1	Composing Web services makes the processes capable of doing complex tasks .	Web services are building blocks of interoperable systems .	Composite services may fail during their execution which can be diagnosed by a mediator .	The mediator adapts the structure so that the failure is recovered .	Moreover , future executions should avoid the situation or organize a strategy to repair the structure with a minimum delay .
1	In the case of the curve originating from the real morsification method the link is isotopic to the link of the corresponding singularity .	A few years ago N.A'Campo invented a construction of a link from a real curve immersed into a disk .	There are some curves which do not occur in the singularity theory .	In this article we describe the Casson invariant of A'Campo 's knots as a J^ { +/- } -type invariant of the immersed curves .	Thus we get an integral generalization of the Gusein-Zade -- Natanzon theorem which says that the Arf invariant of a singularity is equal to J^ { - } /2 ( mod 2 ) of the corresponding immersed curve .
0	The most extreme starbursts occur in galaxy mergers , and it is now acknowledged that dynamical triggering has a primary importance in star formation .	This triggering is due partly to the enhanced velocity dispersion provided by gravitational instabilities , such as density waves and bars , but mainly to the radial gas flows they drive , allowing large amounts of gas to condense towards nuclear regions in a small time scale .	Numerical simulations with several gas phases , taking into account the feedback to regulate star formation , have explored the various processes , using recipes like the Schmidt law , moderated by the gas instability criterion .	May be the most fundamental parameter in starbursts is the availability of gas : this sheds light on the amount of external gas accretion in galaxy evolution .	The detailed mechanisms governing gas infall in the inner parts of galaxy disks are discussed .
4	After giving readers some feel of this topology , we prove that each conformal class in the moduli space is dense with respect to this topology .	The moduli space of isometry classes of Riemannian structures on a smooth manifold was emphasized by J.A.Wheeler in his superspace formalism of quantum gravity .	A natural question concerning it is : What is a natural topology on such moduli space that reflects best quantum fluctuations of the geometries within the Planck 's scale ?	This very question has been addressed by B.DeWitt and others .	In this article we introduce Gromov 's $ \varepsilon $ -approximation topology on the above moduli space for a closed smooth manifold .
0	It is known that the $ k $ -faces of the permutohedron $ \Pi_n $ are labeled by ( all possible ) linearly ordered partitions of the set $ [ n ] =\ { 1 , ... , n\ } $ into $ ( n-k ) $ non-empty parts .	The incidence relation corresponds to the refinement : a face $ F $ contains a face $ F ' $ whenever the label of $ F ' $ refines the label of $ F $ .	In the paper we consider the cell complex $ { CP } $ defined in analogous way , replacing linear ordering by cyclic ordering .	Namely , $ k $ -cells of the complex $ { CP } $ are labeled by ( all possible ) cyclically ordered partitions of the set $ [ n+1 ] =\ { 1 , ... , n , n+1\ } $ into $ ( n+1-k ) $ non-empty parts , where $ ( n+1-k ) & gt ; 2 $ .	The incidence relation again corresponds to the refinement : a cell $ F $ contains a cell $ F ' $ whenever the label of $ F ' $ refines the label of $ F $ .
3	We divide the whole range of redshift into a few bins and set the interacting term $ \delta ( z ) $ to be a constant in each redshift bin .	It is possible that there exist some interactions between dark energy ( DE ) and dark matter ( DM ) , and a suitable interaction can alleviate the coincidence problem .	Several phenomenological interacting forms are proposed and are fitted with observations in the literature .	In this paper we investigate the possible interaction in a way independent of specific interacting forms by use of observational data ( SNe , BAO , CMB and Hubble parameter ) .	We consider four parameterizations of the equation of state $ w_ { de } $ for DE and find that $ \delta ( z ) $ is likely to cross the non-interacting ( $ \delta=0 $ ) and have an oscillation form .
0	The Cherenkov Telescope Array ( CTA ) is the next generation of ground-based very high energy gamma-ray instruments and is planned to be built on two sites ( one in each hemisphere ) in the coming years , with full array operation foreseen to begin 2020 .	The goal of performing high precision gamma-ray energy measurements while maximizing the use of observation time demands detailed and fast information about atmospheric conditions .	Besides LIDARs designed to monitor clouds and aerosol content of the atmosphere in the pointing direction of the CTA telescopes , we propose to use the `` FRAM '' ( F ( /Ph ) otometric Robotic Atmospheric Monitor ) device , which is a small robotic astronomical telescope with a large field of view and a sensitive CCD camera that together ensure precise atmospheric characterization over the complete field-of-view of the CTA .	FRAM will use stellar photometry to measure atmospheric extinction across the field of view of the CTA without interfering with the observation ( unlike laser-based methods ) .	This allows FRAM to operate with high temporal resolution and provide both real-time data for on-the-fly scheduling decisions and an offline database for calibration and selection of scientific data .
2	Exactly what conditions are needed , however , to maintain liquid water remains a topic for debate .	The habitable zone ( HZ ) around a star is typically defined as the region where a rocky planet can maintain liquid water on its surface .	That definition is appropriate , because this allows for the possibility that carbon-based , photosynthetic life exists on the planet in sufficient abundance to modify the planet 's atmosphere in a way that might be remotely detected .	Historically , modelers have restricted themselves to water-rich planets with CO2 and H2O as the only important greenhouse gases .	More recently , some researchers have suggested broadening the definition to include arid , 'Dune ' planets on the inner edge and planets with captured H2 atmospheres on the outer edge , thereby greatly increasing the HZ width .
1	Those works focus only on the region close to the black hole thus it is unknown whether or where the wind production stops at large radii .	Previous works show strong winds exist in hot accretion flows around black holes .	In this paper , we investigate this problem by hydrodynamical simulations .	We take into account gravities of both the black hole and the nuclear star clusters .	For the latter , we assume that the velocity dispersion of stars is a constant and its gravitational potential $ \propto \sigma^2 \ln ( r ) $ , where $ \sigma $ is the velocity dispersion of stars and $ r $ is the distance from the center of the galaxy .
1	To this purpose , we simulate the propagation of a relativistic Gaussian wavepacket through a graphene sample with randomly distributed potential barriers ( impurities ) .	In this paper , we study Klein tunneling in random media .	The simulations , based on a relativistic quantum lattice Boltzmann method , permit to compute the transmission coefficient across the sample , thereby providing an estimate for the conductivity as a function of impurity concentration and strength of the potentials .	It is found that the conductivity loss due to impurities is significantly higher for wave-packets of massive particles , as compared to massless ones .	A general expression for the loss of conductivity as a function of the impurity percentage is presented and successfully compared with the Kozeny-Carman law for disordered media in classical fluid dynamics .
1	The typical Doppler parameters found for the Ly-alpha lines lie in the interval b=20\div30 km/s , corresponding to temperatures T & gt ; 24000K , with a fraction of the order 15 % in the range 10 & lt ; b & lt ; 20km/s .	We present results from high resolution ( R\simeq 28000 ) spectra of six high- redshift QSOs taken at the ESO NTT telescope that allow the detailed study of the Ly-alpha population in the redshift interval z=2.8-4.1 .	These values are still consistent with models of low density , highly ionized clouds .	The observed redshift and column density distributions obtained from these spectra and from the observations of 4 a dditional QSOs taken in the literature allow an accurate estimate of the proximity effect from a relatively large Ly-alpha sample ( more than 1100 lines with logN_ { HI } & gt ; =13.3 ) in the redshift interval z=1.7-4.1 .	A Maximum Likelihood analysis has been applied to estimate SIMULTANEOUSLY the best fit parameters of the Ly-alpha $ statistics AND of the UV background .
1	We show that $ \nua { m } { d } $ is a smooth space , stratified over a certain hyperplane arrangement in $ \bbr^m $ .	We study the space $ \nua { m } { d } $ of clouds in $ \bbr^d $ ( ordered sets of $ m $ points modulo the action of the group of affine isometries ) .	We give an algorithm to list all the chambers and other strata ( this is independent of $ d $ ) .	With the help of a computer , we obtain the list of all the chambers for $ m\leq 9 $ and all the strata when $ m\leq 8 $ .	As the strata are the product of a polygon spaces with a disk , this gives a classification of $ m $ -gon spaces for $ m\leq 9 $ .
3	Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable .	In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching ' , in which we are given a domain theory , some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed , and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept .	The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory , such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples .	Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory .	We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories , and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable ' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory .
1	Based on this fundamental property for example the holonomy-flux *-algebra has been formulated .	The philosophy of the Loop Quantum Gravity approach is to construct the canonical variables by using the duality of infinitesimal connections and holonomies along loops .	A generalisation of the one-to-one correspondence between infinitesimal objects : connections and curvature and path based objects : holonomy maps and parallel transports is used to replace the configuration space of the theory .	This generalised duality is related to the concept of path connections and holonomy groupoids , which originally has been invented by Mackenzie and which is presented shortly in this article .	Finally these objects are used to propose some new algebras of quantum variables for Loop Quantum Gravity .
1	The strength of this alignment has been found to depend strongly on the colours of the satellite and central galaxies , and only weakly on the mass of the halo in which the galaxies reside .	Recent studies have shown that the distribution of satellite galaxies is preferentially aligned with the major axis of their central galaxy .	In this paper we study whether these alignment signals , and their dependence on galaxy and halo properties , can be reproduced in a hierarchical structure formation model of a $ \Lambda $ CDM concordance cosmology .	To that extent we use a large $ N $ -body simulation which we populate with galaxies following a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation .	We find that if the orientation of the central galaxy is perfectly aligned with that of its dark matter halo , then the predicted central-satellite alignment signal is much stronger than observed .
2	We show that the method of Zhang ( 2008 ) exactly measures the reduced shears at the second order level in the presence of PSF .	Neglecting the second order corrections in weak lensing measurements can lead to a few percent uncertainties on cosmic shears , and becomes more important for cluster lensing mass reconstructions .	Existing methods which claim to measure the reduced shears are not necessarily accurate to the second order when a point spread function ( PSF ) is present .	A simple theorem is provided for further confirming our calculation , and for judging the accuracy of any shear measurement method at the second order based on its properties at the first order .	The method of Zhang ( 2008 ) is well defined mathematically .
1	Such material might be expected to be present theoretically , but is usually claimed to make a negligible contribution at optical and infrared wavelengths .	We consider current observational constraints on the presence of cool , optically thick disk material in quiescent black hole binaries , specifically focusing on a case study of the prototypical system A0620-00 .	The primary argument is based on measurements of the veiling of stellar photospheric absorption lines , in which it is assumed that the disk spectrum is featureless .	We use simulated spectra to explore the sensitivity of veiling measurements to uncertainties in companion temperature , gravity , and metallicity .	We find that the derived veiling is extremely sensitive to a mismatch between the temperature and metallicity of the companion and template , but that the effect of a plausible gravity mismatch is much smaller .
2	We show that for convex billiards of constant width with time reversal symmetry and `` almost '' chaotic dynamics the energy level distribution is of GUE-type .	It is a common assumption that quantum systems with time reversal invariance and classically chaotic dynamics have energy spectra distributed according to GOE-type of statistics .	Here we present a class of systems which fail to follow this rule .	The effect is due to the lack of ergodicity in the `` momentum '' part of the phase space and , as we argue , is generic in two dimensions .	Besides , we show that certain billiards of constant width in multiply connected domains are of interest in relation to the quantum ergodicity problem .
1	The implementation is carried out in an ensemble of $ ^ { 133 } $ Cs nuclei with spin $ I=7/2 $ of a lyotropic liquid crystal sample .	We have characterized spin-squeezed states produced at a temperature of $ 26^\circ { \mathrm C } $ on a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) quadrupolar system .	We identify the source of spin squeezing due to the interaction between the quadrupole moment of the nuclei and the electric field gradients internally present in the molecules .	We use the spin angular momentum representation to describe formally the nonlinear operators that produce the spin squeezing .	The quantitative and qualitatively characterization of the spin squeezing phenomena is performed through a squeezing parameter and squeezing angle developed for the two-mode BEC system , and , as well , by the Wigner quasi-probability distribution function .
4	We also extract ( via realizability ) a bound from ( a formalization of ) our proof of the descent lemma .	We consider a special case of Dickson 's lemma : for any two functions $ f , g $ on the natural numbers there are two numbers $ i & lt ; j $ such that both $ f $ and $ g $ weakly increase on them , i.e. , $ f_i\le f_j $ and $ g_i \le g_j $ .	By a combinatorial argument ( due to the first author ) a simple bound for such $ i , j $ is constructed .	The combinatorics is based on the finite pigeon hole principle and results in a descent lemma .	From the descent lemma one can prove Dickson 's lemma , then guess what the bound might be , and verify it by an appropriate proof .
0	Thermal properties are of great interest in modern electronic devices and nanostructures .	Calculating these properties is straightforward when the device is made from a pure material , but problems arise when alloys are used .	Specifically , only approximate bandstructures can be computed for random alloys and most often the Virtual Crystal Approximation ( VCA ) is used .	Unfolding methods [ T. B. Boykin , N. Kharche , G. Klimeck , and M. Korkusinski , J.Phys . : Condens.Matt .	19 , 036203 ( 2007 ) . ]
3	This mass loss extends down to the level of the horizontal branch and increases with luminosity .	Using the Spitzer IRAC camera we have obtained mid-IR photometry of the red giant branch stars in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc .	About 100 stars show an excess of mid-infrared light above that expected from their photospheric emission .	This is plausibly due to dust formation in mass flowing from these stars .	The mass loss is episodic , occurring in only a fraction of stars at a given luminosity .
3	The study reveals that the damping of the medium has strong effect in the propagation of torsional wave .	The present paper has been framed to show the effect of damping on the propagation of torsional waves in an initially stressed , dissipative , incompressible cylinder of infinite length .	A governing equation has been formulated on Biot 's incremental deformation theory .	The velocities of torsional waves are obtained as complex ones , in which real part gives the phase velocity of propagation and corresponding imaginary part gives the damping .	Since every medium has damping so it is more realistic to use the damped wave equation instead of the undamped wave equation .
1	It has turned out to be an unusually fruitful idea , crossing boundaries between particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology .	The hypothesis of an `invisible ' axion was made by Misha Shifman and others , approximately thirty years ago .	An axion with mass of order $ 10^ { -5 } $ eV ( with large uncertainties ) is one of the leading candidates for the dark matter of the universe .	It was found recently that dark matter axions thermalize and form a Bose-Einstein condensate ( BEC ) .	Because they form a BEC , axions differ from ordinary cold dark matter ( CDM ) in the non-linear regime of structure formation and upon entering the horizon .
2	These methods offer the currently best approach to several central problems such as learning half spaces and learning DNF 's .	Many popular learning algorithms ( E.g .	Regression , Fourier-Transform based algorithms , Kernel SVM and Kernel ridge regression ) operate by reducing the problem to a convex optimization problem over a vector space of functions .	In addition they are widely used in numerous application domains .	Despite their importance , there are still very few proof techniques to show limits on the power of these algorithms .
0	We present results of a study of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission ( GRXE ) in hard X-rays with the IBIS telescope on board INTEGRAL in the region near the Galactic Anticenter ( GA ) at l=155 deg .	We assumed a conservative 2 sigma upper limit on the flux from the GA in the 25-60 keV energy band of 1.25E-10 erg/s/cm^2 ( 12.8 mCrab ) per IBIS field of view , or 6.6E-12 erg/s/cm^2 ( 0.7 mCrab ) per degree longitude in the 135 deg .	& lt ; l & lt ; 175 deg.region .	This upper limit exceeds the expected GRXE intensity in the GA direction by an order of magnitude , given the near-infrared ( NIR ) surface brightness of the Milky Way in this region and the standard hard X-ray-to-NIR intensity ratio for the GRXE , assuming stellar origin .	Based on the CGRO/EGRET surface brightness of the Galaxy above 100 MeV as a tracer of the cosmic-ray ( CR ) induced gamma-ray background , the expected GRXE flux in GA exceeds the measured 2 sigma upper limit by a factor of 4 .
0	It is shown that the deviation of fractional quantum Hall edge fluid from power law correlation functions with universal exponent $ \alpha=1/\nu $ as observed in recent experiment may be explained when analyzed from the viewpoint of chiral anomaly and Berry phase .	It is observed that at the edge anomaly vanishes and this induces a nonlocal effect in the construction of the electron creation operator in terms of the edge boson fields .	This nonlocality is responsible for the deviation of the power law exponent from $ \alpha=1/\nu $ of the edge fluid .	There are gapless edge excitations described by chiral boson fields and the number of branches of chiral boson fields can be related to the polarization states of electrons in the bulk .	We have noted that for fully polarized state at $ \nu=\frac { 1 } { 2m \pm 1 } $ we will have a single branch whereas for partially polarized state at $ \nu=\frac { n } { 2mn \pm 1 } $ , with $ n & gt ; 1 $ and odd , we will have $ n $ branches .
4	We compute the equal-time one-point and two-point Green 's functions in zero and one dimension , where comparisons to known results can be made .	Many non-Hermitian but PT-symmetric theories are known to have a real positive spectrum .	Since the action is complex for there theories , Monte Carlo methods do not apply .	In this paper the first field-theoretic method for numerical simulations of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians is presented .	The method is the complex Langevin equation , which has been used previously to study complex Hamiltonians in statistical physics and in Minkowski space .
2	Accordingly , these networks can exhibit optimal synchronization properties through fine tuning of the local interaction strength as a function of node degree [ Motter , Zhou , and Kurths , Phys.Rev .	Bearings are mechanical dissipative systems that , when perturbed , relax toward a synchronized ( bearing ) state .	Here we find that bearings can be perceived as physical realizations of complex networks of oscillators with asymmetrically weighted couplings .	E 71 , 016116 ( 2005 ) ] .	We show that , in analogy , the synchronizability of bearings can be maximized by counterbalancing the number of contacts and the inertia of their constituting rotor disks through the mass-radius relation , $ m\sim r^ { \alpha } $ , with an optimal exponent $ \alpha=\alpha_ { \times } $ which converges to unity for a large number of rotors .
1	The most common dose algorithms are fast but they are approximate analytical approaches .	An essential component in proton radiotherapy is the algorithm to calculate the radiation dose to be delivered to the patient .	However their level of accuracy is not always satisfactory , especially for heterogeneous anatomic areas , like the thorax .	Monte Carlo techniques provide superior accuracy , however , they often require large computation resources , which render them impractical for routine clinical use .	Track-repeating algorithms , for example the Fast Dose Calculator , have shown promise for achieving the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations for proton radiotherapy dose calculations in a fraction of the computation time .
4	In this paper , we propose a new direct method to estimate a causal ordering based on non-Gaussianity .	Structural equation models and Bayesian networks have been widely used to analyze causal relations between continuous variables .	In such frameworks , linear acyclic models are typically used to model the datagenerating process of variables .	Recently , it was shown that use of non-Gaussianity identifies a causal ordering of variables in a linear acyclic model without using any prior knowledge on the network structure , which is not the case with conventional methods .	However , existing estimation methods are based on iterative search algorithms and may not converge to a correct solution in a finite number of steps .
3	The comparative study is conducted on the basis of a same prescribed Cartesian workspace for the three mechanisms .	Parallel kinematic mechanisms are interesting alternative designs for machining applications .	Three 2-DOF parallel mechanism architectures dedicated to machining applications are studied in this paper .	The three mechanisms have two constant length struts gliding along fixed linear actuated joints with different relative orientation .	The common desired workspace properties are a rectangular shape and given kinetostatic performances .
3	Based on our construction , a lower bound of symmetric Boolean functions with algebraic immunity not less than $ d $ is derived , which is $ 2^ { \lfloor \log_2 { d } \rfloor + 2 ( k-d+1 ) } $ .	In this paper , we explicitly construct a large class of symmetric Boolean functions on $ 2k $ variables with algebraic immunity not less than $ d $ , where integer $ k $ is given arbitrarily and $ d $ is a given suffix of $ k $ in binary representation .	If let $ d = k $ , our constructed functions achieve the maximum algebraic immunity .	Remarkably , $ 2^ { \lfloor \log_2 { k } \rfloor + 2 } $ symmetric Boolean functions on $ 2k $ variables with maximum algebraic immunity are constructed , which is much more than the previous constructions .	As far as we know , this is the first lower bound of this kind .
2	The observations span a period of about 12 years starting from mid-1996 ( the minimum of cycle 23 ) to early-2008 ( near minimum of cycle 24 ) , corresponding to a nearly complete solar activity cycle .	We analyze intermediate degree p-mode eigenfrequencies measured by GONG and MDI/SOHO over a solar cycle to study the source of their variability .	We carry out a correlation analysis between the change in frequencies and several measures of the Sun 's magnetic activity that are sensitive to changes at different levels in the solar atmosphere .	We demonstrate that the frequencies do vary in phase with the solar activity indices , however the degree of correlation differs from phase to phase of the cycle .	During the rising and declining phases , the mode frequency shifts are strongly correlated with the activity proxies whereas during the high-activity period , the shifts have significantly lower correlation with all activity proxies , except for the 10.7-cm radio flux .
3	The persistent spin current is modulated by the cosine function of the spin precession angle .	We have calculated the persistent spin current of an open ring induced by the Aharonov-Casher phase .	For unpolarized electrons there exist no persistent charge currents , but persistent spin currents .	We show that , in general , the magnitude of the persistent spin current in a ring depends on the direction of the direct current flow from one reservoir to another .	The nonadiabatic Aharonov-Casher phase gives anomalous behaviors .
4	We accomplish our 'screening ' by ranking genes/miRNAs by the correlation of their expression misregulation with differential patient survival .	The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) provides researchers with clinicopathological data and genomic characterizations of various carcinomas .	These data sets include expression microarrays for genes and microRNAs -- short , non-coding strands of RNA that downregulate gene expression through RNA interference -- as well as days_to_death and days_to_last_followup fields for each tumor sample .	Our aim is to develop a software tool that screens TCGA data sets for genes/miRNAs with functional involvement in specific cancers .	Furthermore , our computational pipeline is intended to produce a set of visualizations , or profiles , that place our screened outputs in a pathway-centric context .
1	Besides the rheological characteristics , we analyze the Kelvin-Helmholtz ( K-H ) instability resulting from the tangential velocity difference of the fluids on two sides of the interface .	We study liquid-vapor phase separation under shear via the Shan-Chen lattice Boltzmann model .	We discuss also the growth behavior of droplets .	The domains being close to the walls are lamellar-ordered , where the hydrodynamic effects dominate .	The patterns in the bulk of the system are nearly isotropic , where the domain growth results mainly from the diffusion mechanism .
1	We solve the covariant coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation with the interaction kernel truncated at chiral order Q^3 where we include only those terms which are leading in the large N_c limit of QCD .	The relativistic chiral SU ( 3 ) Lagrangian is used to describe kaon-nucleon scattering imposing constraints from the pion-nucleon sector and the axial-vector coupling constants of the baryon octet states .	The baryon decuplet states are an important explicit ingredient in our scheme , because together with the baryon octet states they form the large N_c baryon ground states of QCD .	Part of our technical developments is a minimal chiral subtraction scheme within dimensional regularization , which leads to a manifest realization of the covariant chiral counting rules .	All SU ( 3 ) symmetry-breaking effects are well controlled by the combined chiral and large N_c expansion , but still found to play a crucial role in understanding the empirical data .
1	These varieties are acted upon by the automorphism group of a certain representation of a type A quiver , containing a maximal torus T. Using the group action , we describe the moment graphs , encoding the zero- and one-dimensional T-orbits .	We study geometric and combinatorial properties of the degenerate flag varieties of type A .	We also study the smooth and singular loci of the degenerate flag varieties .	We show that the Euler characteristic of the smooth locus is equal to the large Schr\ '' oder number and the Poincar\'e polynomial is given by a natural statistics counting the number of diagonal steps in a Schr\ '' oder path .	As an application we obtain a new combinatorial description of the large and small Schr\ '' oder numbers and their q-analogues .
2	One such family of pathways contains the cell cyclins .	A new approach to the modular , complex systems analysis of nonlinear dynamics in cell cycling network transformations involved in carcinogenesis is proposed .	Carcinogenesis is a complex process that involves dynamically inter-connected biomolecules in the intercellular , membrane , cytosolic , nuclear and nucleolar compartments that form numerous inter-related pathways .	Cyclins are proteins that link several critical pro-apoptotic and other cell cycling/division components , including the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and its product , the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen ( T antigen ) , Rb , mdm2 , c-Myc , p21 , p27 , Bax , Bad and Bcl-2 , which all play major roles in neoplastic transformation of many tissues .	This novel theoretical analysis based on recently published studies of cyclin signaling , with special emphasis placed on the roles of cyclins D1 and E , suggests novel clinical trials and rational therapies of cancer through reestablishment of cell cycling inhibition in metastatic cancer cells .
0	VLT-Interferometry will allow imaging of the Galactic Center ( GC ) and the nuclei of extragalactic sources at an angular resolution of a few milliarcseconds .	VLTI will be a prime instrument to study the immediate environment of the massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way .	With the MID infrared Interferometric instrument ( MIDI ) for example the enigmatic compact dust embedded MIR-excess sources within the central parsec should be resolvable .	Further the observations of external galactic nuclei will allow unprecedented measurements of physical parameters ( i.e.structure and luminosity ) in these systems .	With the exception of a few 'self-referencing ' sources these faint-target observations will benefit from the available off-axis wavefront-correction system .
3	We have compared these push-pull systems with donor-acceptor substituted polymethine imine ( PMI ) , $ D- ( CHN ) _ { x } -A $ , systems in which besides electron affinities , the nature of $ p_ { z } $ orbitals in conjugation also alternate from site to site .	In this paper we investigate the effect of terminal substituents on the dynamics of spin and charge transport in donor-acceptor substituted polyenes ( $ D- ( CH ) _ { x } -A $ ) chains , also known as push-pull polyenes .	We employ long-range correlated model Hamiltonian for the $ D- ( CH ) _ { x } -A $ system , and time-dependent density matrix renormalization group technique for time propagating the wave packet obtained by injecting a hole at a terminal site , in the ground state of the system .	Our studies reveal that the end groups do not affect spin and charge velocities in any significant way , but change the amount of charge transported .	We note that spin and charge dynamics in the PMIs are very different from that observed in the case of push-pull polyenes , and within the time scale of our studies , transport of spin and charge leads to the formation of a `` quasi-static '' state .
1	The pi-A isotherms and molefraction versus area per molecule studies indicate complete immiscibility of sample ( BQ ) and matrix ( PMMA or SA ) molecules .	This communication reports the -A isotherms and spectroscopic characterizations of mixed Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett ( LB ) films of nonamphiphilic 2 , -biquinoline ( BQ ) molecules , mixed with polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) and stearic acid ( SA ) .	This immiscibility may lead to the formation of microcrystalline aggregates of BQ molecules in the mixed LB films .	The scanning electron micrograph gives the visual evidence of microcrystalline aggregates of BQ molecules in the mixed LB films .	UV-Vis absorption , fluorescence and excitation spectroscopic studies reveal the nature of these microcrystalline aggregates .
2	While the massless limit is relevant for pristine graphene , keeping finite mass allows for generalizations onto situations with broken symmetry between the two sublattices , and provides a link to the scattering theory of electrons in a parabolic band .	Electron properties of graphene are described in terms of Dirac fermions .	Here we thoroughly outline the elastic scattering theory for the two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions in the presence of an axially symmetric potential .	We demonstrate that the Dirac theory requires short-distance regularization for potentials which are more singular than 1/r .	The formalism is then applied to scattering off a smooth short-ranged potential .
1	The analysis of such data often leads to a two-step approach where groups containing similar biological entities are firstly identified and the spatial information is used afterwards to improve the ecological interpretation .	Spatial ecological networks are widely used to model interactions between georeferenced biological entities ( e.g. , populations or communities ) .	We develop an integrative approach to retrieve groups of nodes that are geographically close and ecologically similar .	Our model-based spatially-constrained method embeds the geographical information within a regularization framework by adding some constraints to the maximum likelihood estimation of parameters .	A simulation study and the analysis of real data demonstrate that our approach is able to detect complex spatial patterns that are ecologically meaningful .
4	For parameters corresponding to symmetric monomethines , the model predicts two low-energy twisting channels on the excited-state surface that lead to a manifold of twisted intramolecular charge-transfer ( TICT ) states .	We propose and analyze a two-state valence-bond model of non-equilibrium solvation effects on the excited-state twisting reaction of monomethine cyanines .	Suppression of this reaction is thought responsible for environment-dependent fluorescence yield enhancement in these dyes .	Fluorescence is quenched because twisting is accompanied via the formation of dark twisted intramolecular charge-transfer ( TICT ) states .	For monomethine cyanines , where the ground state is a superposition of structures with different bond and charge localization , there are two possible twisting pathways with different charge localization in the excited state .
3	Bose-Einstein condensation can happen either from the chiral symmetry broken phase or from the restored phase .	With the linear sigma model , we have studied Bose-Einstein condensation and the chiral phase transition in the chiral limit for an interacting pion system .	A $ \mu-T $ phase diagram including these two phenomena is presented .	It is found that the phase plane has been divided into three areas : the Bose-Einstein condensation area , the chiral symmetry broken phase area and the chiral symmetry restored phase area .	We show that the onset of the chiral phase transition is restricted in the area where there is no Bose-Einstein condensation .
0	We study biased { \em orientation games } , in which the board is the complete graph $ K_n $ , and Maker and Breaker take turns in directing previously undirected edges of $ K_n $ .	At the end of the game , the obtained graph is a tournament .	Maker wins if the tournament has some property $ \mathcal P $ and Breaker wins otherwise .	We provide bounds on the bias that is required for a Maker 's win and for a Breaker 's win in three different games .	In the first game Maker wins if the obtained tournament has a cycle .
4	For branes expanded in AdS , we argue that the anomalous dimensions are due to loop corrections to the effective action .	We study excited spherical branes ( `` giant gravitons '' ) in $ AdS \times S $ spacetimes with background flux .	For large excitation , these branes may be treated semiclassically .	We compute their spectra using Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization and use the AdS/CFT correspondence to relate them to anomalous dimensions in the dual field theory at strong coupling , expressed as a series expansion in powers of 1/N .	These effects resemble those due to $ k $ -body forces between quarks in Hartree-Fock models of baryons at large $ N $ .
0	In this paper we study Open Wilson Lines ( OWL 's ) in the context of two Supersymmetric Yang Mills theories .	First we consider four dimensional N=2 Supersymmetric Yang Mills Theory with hypermultiplets transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group , and find supersymmetric OWL 's only in the superconformal versions of these theories .	We then consider four dimensional N=4 SYM coupled to a three dimensional defect hypermultiplet .	Here there is a semi-circular supersymmetric OWL , which is related to the ray by a conformal transformation .	We perform a perturbative calculation of the operators in both theories , and discuss using localization to compute them non-perturbatively .
2	The balancing principle as an adaptive choice of the step size is also studied .	We study quadrature methods for solving Volterra integral equations of the first kind with smooth kernels under the presence of noise in the right-hand sides , with the quadrature methods being generated by linear multistep methods .	The regularizing properties of an a priori choice of the step size are analyzed , with the smoothness of the involved functions carefully taken into consideration .	It is considered in a version which sometimes requires less amount of computational work than the standard version of this principle .	Numerical results are included .
1	In this paper we discuss physics laws that relate to the mechanics of bow and arrow , to the shooting process and to the flight of the arrow .	Archery lends itself to scientific analysis .	In parallel , we describe experiments that address these laws .	The detailed results of these measurements , performed with a specific bow and arrow , provide insight into many aspects of archery and illustrate the importance of quantitative information in the scientific process .	Most of the proposed experiments use only modest tools and can be carried out by archers with their own equipment .
2	This presentation includes regimes not identified in earlier work [ I. Bena and C. Van den Broeck , Europhys.Lett .	We revisit the mean field model of globally and harmonically coupled parametric oscillators subject to periodic block pulses with initially random phases .	The phase diagram of regions of collective parametric instability is presented , as is a detailed characterization of the motions underlying these instabilities .	{ \bf 48 } , 498 ( 1999 ) ] .	In addition to the familiar parametric instability of individual oscillators , two kinds of collective instabilities are identified .
0	The matching energy is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the zeros of the matching polynomial of a graph , which is proposed first by Gutman and Wagner [ The matching energy of a graph , Discrete Appl.Math .	160 ( 2012 ) 2177 -- 2187 ] .	And they gave some properties and asymptotic results of the matching energy .	In this paper , we characterize the trees with $ n $ vertices whose complements have the maximal , second-maximal and minimal matching energy .	Further , we determine the trees with a perfect matching whose complements have the second-maximal matching energy .
4	The presence of the parameter that drives the `` inertial '' term mentioned above gives the possibility to control the degree of parallelism of the numerical implementation of the dynamics .	We consider the problem of approximate sampling from the finite volume Gibbs measure with a general pair interaction .	We exhibit a parallel dynamics ( Probabilistic Cellular Automaton ) which efficiently implements the sampling .	In this dynamics the product measure that gives the new configuration in each site contains a term that tends to favour the original value of each spin .	This is the main ingredient that allows to prove that the stationary distribution of the PCA is close in total variation to the Gibbs measure .
4	The distribution of 36 GHz masers in the outflow of DR21 ( OH ) is similar to that of the other class I methanol transitions , with numerous multitransition spatial overlaps .	Class I methanol masers are believed to be produced in the shock-excited environment around star-forming regions .	Many authors have argued that the appearance of various subsets of class I masers may be indicative of specific evolutionary stages of star formation or excitation conditions .	Until recently , however , no major interferometer was capable of imaging the important 36 GHz transition .	We report on Expanded Very Large Array observations of the 36 GHz methanol masers and Submillimeter Array observations of the 229 GHz methanol masers in DR21 ( OH ) , DR21N , and DR21W .
4	In addition to our polynomial-time algorithms we provide NP-completeness results for a couple of our nonuniform bribery problems for weighted voters , and a couple of approximation algorithms for NP-complete bribery problems defined in [ FHH06 ] ( in particular , an FPTAS for plurality-weighted- $ bribery problem ) .	We study the concept of bribery in the situation where voters are willing to change their votes as we ask them , but where their prices depend on the nature of the change we request .	Our model is an extension of the one of Faliszewski et al .	[ FHH06 ] , where each voter has a single price for any change we may ask for .	We show polynomial-time algorithms for our version of bribery for a broad range of voting protocols , including plurality , veto , approval , and utility based voting .
0	Nitrogen is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe , yet the gas-phase chemistry of N-bearing species remains poorly understood .	Nitrogen hydrides are key molecules of nitrogen chemistry .	Their abundance ratios place strong constraints on the production pathways and reaction rates of nitrogen-bearing molecules .	We observed the class 0 protostar IRAS16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument HIFI , covering most of the frequency range from 0.48 to 1.78~THz at high spectral resolution .	The hyperfine structure of the amidogen radical o-NH2 is resolved and seen in absorption against the continuum of the protostar .
1	First-principles total-energy calculations reveal that the rutile structure is the most stable phase among the phases of GeO $ _2 $ , while SiO $ _2 $ preferentially forms quartz .	The detailed analysis of the structural variations of three GeO $ _2 $ and SiO $ _2 $ polymorphs ( $ \alpha $ -quartz , $ \alpha $ -cristobalite , and rutile ) under compression and expansion pressure is reported .	GeO $ _4 $ tetrahedras of quartz and cristobalite GeO $ _2 $ phases at the equilibrium volume are more significantly distorted than those of SiO $ _2 $ .	Moreover , in the case of quartz GeO $ _2 $ and cristobalite GeO $ _2 $ , all O-Ge-O bond angles vary when the volume of the GeO $ _2 $ bulk changes from the equilibrium point , which causes further deformation of tetrahedra .	In contrast , the tilt angle formed by Si-O-Si in SiO $ _2 $ markedly changes .
4	The model treats the morphology acquisition problem as one of learning to map forms onto meanings and vice versa .	The morphological systems of natural languages are replete with examples of the same devices used for multiple purposes : ( 1 ) the same type of morphological process ( for example , suffixation for both noun case and verb tense ) and ( 2 ) identical morphemes ( for example , the same suffix for English noun plural and possessive ) .	These sorts of similarity would be expected to convey advantages on language learners in the form of transfer from one morphological category to another .	Connectionist models of morphology acquisition have been faulted for their supposed inability to represent phonological similarity across morphological categories and hence to facilitate transfer .	This paper describes a connectionist model of the acquisition of morphology which is shown to exhibit transfer of this type .
4	Astonishing to describe fermions we are forced to use not the superalgebra h ( 1|1 ) but su ( 2 ) in the fundamental representation .	Usual quantum statistics is written in Fock space but it is not an algebraic theory .	We show that at a deeper level it can be algebraically formalized defining the different statistics as ( multi-mode ) coherent states of the appropriate ( but different from the usual ones ) Lie-Hopf groups .	The traditional connection between groups and statistics , established in vacuum , is indeed subverted by the interaction with the thermal bath .	We show indeed that h ( 1 ) , related in quantum field theory to bosons , must be used to define in presence of a bath the Boltzmann statistics while , to build the Bose statistics , we have to take into account su ( 1,1 ) .
2	Meanwhile , when we turn to its electrical properties , diamond is a rather featureless electrical insulator .	Diamond has always been adored as a jewel .	Even more fascinating is its outstanding physical properties ; it is the hardest material known in the world with the highest thermal conductivity .	However , with boron doping , it becomes a p-type semiconductor , with boron acting as a charge acceptor .	Therefore the recent news of superconductivity in heavily boron-doped diamond synthesized by high pressure sintering was received with considerable surprise .
3	We have also considered additional samples of X-ray detected EROs available in the literature .	We present the results of a deep ( about 80 ks ) XMM-Newton survey of the largest sample of near-infrared selected Extremely Red Objects ( R-K & gt ; 5 ) available to date to K_S & lt ; 19.2 .	At the relatively bright X-ray fluxes ( F_ { 2-10 keV } & gt ; 4x10^ { -15 } cgs ) and near-infrared magnitude probed by the present observations , the fraction of AGN ( i.e. , X-ray detected ) among the ERO population is small ( ~3.5 % ) ; conversely , the fraction of EROs among hard X-ray selected sources is much higher ( ~20 % ) .	The X-ray properties of EROs detected in our XMM-Newton observation indicate absorption in excess of 10^ { 22 } cm^ { -2 } in a large fraction of them .	X-ray spectral analysis of the highest S/N sources unambiguously indicates that large columns of cold gas ( even & gt ; 10^ { 23 } cm^ { -2 } ) are the rule rather than the exception .
0	One of the fundamental requirements for visual surveillance using smart camera networks is the correct association of each persons observations generated on different cameras .	Recently , distributed data association that involves only local information processing on each camera node and mutual information exchanging between neighboring cameras has attracted many research interests due to its superiority in large scale applications .	In this paper , we formulate the problem of data association in smart camera networks as an Integer Programming problem by introducing a set of linking variables , and propose two distributed algorithms , namely L-DD and Q-DD , to solve the Integer Programming problem using dual decomposition technique .	In our algorithms , the original IP problem is decomposed into several sub-problems , which can be solved locally and efficiently on each smart camera , and then different sub-problems reach consensus on their solutions in a rigorous way by adjusting their parameters based on projected sub-gradient optimization .	The proposed methods are simple and flexible , in that ( i ) we can incorporate any feature extraction and matching technique into our framework to measure the similarity between two observations , which is used to define the cost of each link , and ( ii ) we can decompose the original problem in any way as long as the resulting sub-problem can be solved independently on individual camera .
3	We provide an $ O ( n^3 ) $ -time algorithm that solves this variant , where $ n $ is the number of clients .	In this paper we study a facility location problem in the plane in which a single point ( facility ) and a rapid transit line ( highway ) are simultaneously located in order to minimize the total travel time from the clients to the facility , using the $ L_1 $ or Manhattan metric .	The rapid transit line is given by a segment with any length and orientation , and is an alternative transportation line that can be used by the clients to reduce their travel time to the facility .	We study the variant of the problem in which clients can enter and exit the highway at any point .	We also present a detailed characterization of the solutions , which depends on the speed given in the highway .
3	For such a system , we present a general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation rates of the nucleating phases .	We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastable phases , the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by the parameters of the system .	With this model we can construct , for example , a system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable phases .	We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate competitively from a single initial phase .	The results show that the Ostwald rule , which predicts which phase will nucleate , must be modified probabilistically when the new phases are almost equally stable .
4	We find that in settings where the FI term drives inflation , gauge invariance prevents a decoupling of the modulus from the inflationary dynamics .	Two of the most attractive realizations of inflation in supergravity are based upon the presence of a constant Fayet-Iliopoulos ( FI ) term .	In D-term hybrid inflation it is the FI term itself which sets the energy scale of inflation .	Alternatively , the breaking of a U ( 1 ) symmetry induced by the FI term can dynamically generate the quadratic potential of chaotic inflation .	The purpose of this note is to study the possible UV embedding of these schemes in terms of the `field-dependent FI term ' related to a string modulus field which is stabilized by a non-perturbative superpotential .
2	( Here we focus on the planar setting , although the results can be generalized to three-dimensional motion . )	Motion camouflage is a stealth strategy observed in nature .	We formulate the problem as a feedback system for particles moving at constant speed , and define what it means for the system to be in a state of motion camouflage .	We propose a biologically plausible feedback law , and use a high-gain limit to prove accessibility of a motion camouflage state in finite time .	We discuss connections to work in missile guidance .
4	We believe that our article will be of interest for those readers who teach courses on abstract algebra , real analysis , general topology , logic and the history of mathematics .	We present a characterization of the completeness of the field of real numbers in the form of a \emph { collection of ten equivalent statements } borrowed from algebra , real analysis , general topology and non-standard analysis .	We also discuss the completeness of non-Archimedean fields and present several examples of such fields .	As an application we exploit one of our results to argue that the Leibniz infinitesimal calculus in the $ 18^\textrm { th } $ century was already a rigorous branch of mathematics -- at least much more rigorous than most contemporary mathematicians prefer to believe .	By advocating our particular historical point of view , we hope to provoke a discussion on the importance of mathematical rigor in mathematics and science in general .
4	In an active region observed with SDO/AIA , Hinode/EIS and XRT , we select a subregion with a very hot plasma component and another cooler one for comparison .	In previous studies a very hot plasma component has been diagnosed in solar active regions through the images in three different narrow-band channels of SDO/AIA .	This diagnostic from EUV imaging data has also been supported by the matching morphology of the emission in the hot Ca XVII line , as observed with Hinode/EIS .	This evidence is debated because of unknown distribution of the emission measure along the line of sight .	Here we investigate in detail the thermal distribution of one of such regions using EUV spectroscopic data .
2	Two of these essential parameters have a local meaning and characterize the gravitational field strength .	The general stationary cylindrically symmetric solution of Einstein-massless scalar field system with a non-positive cosmological constant is presented .	It is shown that the general solution is characterized by four integration constants .	The other two have a topological origin , as they define an improper coordinate transformation that provides the stationary solution from the static one .	The Petrov scheme is considered to explore the effects of the scalar field on the algebraic classification of the solutions .
2	Recognition that `` we did n't know anything '' is the basic scientific driver for the next generation .	Answering well-known fundamental questions is usually regarded as the major goal of science .	Discovery of other unknown and fundamental questions is , however , even more important .	Cosmology indeed enjoys such an exciting epoch .	What is the composition of our universe ?
2	No statistical information about the primary traffic is assumed to be available a-priori to the secondary user .	We consider the design of cognitive Medium Access Control ( MAC ) protocols enabling an unlicensed ( secondary ) transmitter-receiver pair to communicate over the idle periods of a set of licensed channels , i.e. , the primary network .	The objective is to maximize data throughput while maintaining the synchronization between secondary users and avoiding interference with licensed ( primary ) users .	We investigate two distinct sensing scenarios .	In the first , the secondary transmitter is capable of sensing all the primary channels , whereas it senses one channel only in the second scenario .
4	The extreme values are attained when the module $ M $ has the equal images property or the equal kernels property .	Given a finite group scheme $ \cG $ over an algebraically closed field $ k $ of characteristic $ \Char ( k ) =p & gt ; 0 $ , we introduce new invariants for a $ \cG $ -module $ M $ by associating certain morphisms $ \deg^j_M : U_M \lra \Gr_d ( M ) \ \ ( 1\ ! \le\ ! j\ ! \le\ !	p\ ! -\ ! 1 ) $ to $ M $ that take values in Grassmannians of $ M $ .	These maps are studied for two classes of finite algebraic groups , infinitesimal group schemes and elementary abelian group schemes .	The maps associated to the so-called modules of constant $ j $ -rank have a well-defined degree ranging between $ 0 $ and $ j\rk^j ( M ) $ , where $ \rk^j ( M ) $ is the generic $ j $ -rank of $ M $ .
0	Using two Chandra observations we have derived estimates of the dust distribution and distance to the eclipsing high mass X-ray binary ( HMXB ) Cen X-3 using the energy-resolved dust-scattered X-ray halo .	By comparing the observed X-ray halos in 200 eV bands from 2-5 keV to the halo profiles predicted by the Weingartner & amp ; Draine interstellar grain model , we find that the vast majority ( about 70 % ) of the dust along the line of sight to the system is located within about 300 pc of the Sun , although the halo measurements are insensitive to dust very close to the source .	One of the Chandra observations occurred during an egress from eclipse as the pulsar emerged from behind the mass-donating primary .	By comparing model halo light curves during this transition to the halo measurements , a source distance of 5.7 +/- 1.5 kpc ( 68 % confidence level ) is estimated , although we find this result depends on the distribution of dust on very small scales .	Nevertheless , this value is marginally inconsistent with the commonly accepted distance to Cen X-3 of 8 kpc .
0	We investigate the prompt photon photoproduction at HERA within the framework of kt-factorization QCD approach .	Our consideration is based on the off-shell matrix elements for the underlying partonic subprocesses .	The unintegrated parton densities in a proton and in a photon are determined using the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin ( KMR ) prescription .	Additionally , we use the CCFM-evolved unintegrated gluon as well as valence and sea quark distributions in a proton .	A conservative error analisys is performed .
0	We develop a theory of the field of double Laurent series , iterated Laurent series , and Malcev-Neumann series that applies to most constant term evaluation problems .	These include ( i ) MacMahon 's partition analysis , counting solutions of systems of linear Diophantine equations or inequalities , counting the number of lattice points in convex polytopes , ( ii ) evaluating combinatorial sums and their generating functions , and proving combinatorial identities , and ( iii ) lattice path enumeration such as walks on the slit plane and walks on the quarter plane .	In the general setting of this new theory , the natural definition of `` taking the constant term '' of a formal series works well and thus the operators of taking constant terms commute with each other .	The proof of Bousquet-M\ ' { e } lou and Schaeffer 's conjecture about walks on the slit plane is included .	In addition , the counting problem of walks on the half plane avoiding the half line is solved .
2	We prove that the multireflections of heat carriers in the nanostructure significantly increase resistance in contradiction with former predictions .	The thermal resistance between a nanostructure and a half-body is calculated in the framework of particle-phonons physics .	The current models approximate the nanostructure as a thermal bath .	This increase depends on the shape of the nanostructure and the heat carriers mean free path only .	We provide a general and simple expression for the contact resistance and examine the specific cases of nanowires and nanoparticles .
1	Using this concept , we construct a class of closed prime ideals in Banach function algebras and discuss some problems related to Alling 's conjecture in $ H^\infty $ .	In this note we introduce the notion of $ t $ -analytic sets .	A description of all closed $ t $ -analytic sets for the disk-algebra is given .	Moreover , we show that some of the assertions in Daoui et al . ( Proc.Am.Math.Soc .	131:3211-3220 , 2003 ) concerning the $ O $ -analyticity and $ S $ -regularity of certain Banach function algebras are not correct .
3	Furthermore , we see an offset of 1.0 +- 0.2 arcseconds , which corresponds to 8.4 +- 1.7 kpc , between the host and the afterglow position .	We present our successful Chandra program designed to identify , with sub-arcsecond accuracy , the X-ray afterglow of the short GRB 111117A , which was discovered by Swift and Fermi .	Thanks to our rapid target of opportunity request , Chandra clearly detected the X-ray afterglow , though no optical afterglow was found in deep optical observations .	The host galaxy was clearly detected in the optical and near-infrared band , with the best photometric redshift of z=1.31_ { -0.23 } ^ { +0.46 } ( 90 % confidence ) , making it one of the highest known short GRB redshifts .	We discuss the importance of using Chandra for obtaining sub-arcsecond X-ray localizations of short GRB afterglows to study GRB environments .
0	We propose a flexible and robust scheme to create closed quasi-one dimensional guides for ultra-cold atoms through the dressing of hyperfine sub-levels of the atomic ground state .	The dressing field is spatially modulated by inductive effects over a micro-engineered conducting loop , freeing the trapping region from leading wires in its proximity .	We show that arrays of connected ring traps can also be created by carefully designing the shape of the conducting loop .	We report on characteristics of the trap and mechanisms that limit the range of parameters available for experimental implementation , including non-adiabatic losses and heat dissipation by induced currents .	We outline conditions to select appropriate parameters for operation of the trap with atom-chip technology .
0	We study pattern formation on the plane transverse to propagation direction , in a ring cavity filled with a Kerr-like medium , subject to an elliptically polarized incoming field , by means of two coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations .	We consider a wide range of possible values for the coupling parameter between different polarizations , *B* , as may happen in composite materials .	Positive and also negative refraction index materials are considered .	Examples of marginal instability diagrams are shown .	It is shown that , within the model , instabilities can not be of codimension higher than 3 .
1	Dispersion sum rules are considered within the ladder approximation of a field-theoretic model with OPE given by ordinary loop diagrams which are computable for any number of loops .	We check quantitatively the validity of some popular phenomenological approaches of QCD in simple models .	A correlator of two currents within the model complies with all requirements of standard QCD sum rules approach for fitting low-lying resonances such as fast convergence and good stability while the exact spectrum contains no resonance .	Optimized PT as it is inspired by the principle of minimal sensitivity is analyzed within a quantum mechanical model and is shown to work well as compared to pure asymptotic expansion in the coupling constant or Pad\'e approximation .	Renormalon technique is tested within another quantum mechanical model and is found to fail to detect its low-energy structure .
4	We apply both state dependent/ state independent cloners , both locally and non-locally , in each of these cases .	In this work , we extensively study the problem of broadcasting of entanglement .	In the first part of the work , we reconceptualize the idea of state dependent quantum cloning machine , and in that process we introduce different types of state dependent cloners like static and dynamic state dependent cloners .	We derive the conditions under which we can make these cloners independent of the input state .	In the broadcasting part , as our resource initial state , we start with general two qubit state and consider specific examples like , non maximally entangled state ( NME ) , Werner like state ( WS ) , and Bell diagonal state ( BDS ) .
0	In this paper , we construct stationary classical solutions of the shallow water equation with vanishing Froude number $ Fr $ in the so-called lake model .	To this end we need to study solutions to the following semilinear elliptic problem \ [ { cases } -\varepsilon^2\text { div } ( \frac { \nabla u } { b } ) =b ( u-q\log\frac { 1 } { \varepsilon } ) _+^ { p } , & amp ; \text { in } \ ; \Omega , u=0 , & amp ; \text { on } \ ; \partial \Omega , { cases } \ ] for small $ \varepsilon & gt ; 0 $ , where $ p & gt ; 1 $ , $ \text { div } ( \frac { \nabla q } { b } ) =0 $ and $ \Omega\subset\mathbb { R } ^2 $ is a smooth bounded domain , .	We showed that if $ \frac { q^2 } { b } $ has $ m $ strictly local minimum ( maximum ) points $ \bar z_i , \ , i=1 , ... , m $ , then there is a stationary classical solution approximating stationary $ m $ points vortex solution of shallow water equations with vorticity $ \sum_ { i=1 } ^m\frac { 2\pi q ( \bar z_i ) } { b ( \bar z_i ) } $ .	Moreover , strictly local minimum points of $ \frac { q^2 } { b } $ on the boundary can also give vortex solutions for the shallow water equation .	As a further study we construct vortex pair solutions as well .
0	We consider a natural generalization of the Partial Vertex Cover problem .	Here an instance consists of a graph G = ( V , E ) , a positive cost function c : V- & gt ; Z^ { + } , a partition $ P_1 , ... , P_r $ of the edge set $ E $ , and a parameter $ k_i $ for each partition $ P_i $ .	The goal is to find a minimum cost set of vertices which cover at least $ k_i $ edges from the partition $ P_i $ .	We call this the Partition Vertex Cover problem .	In this paper , we give matching upper and lower bound on the approximability of this problem .
1	Even though the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope will be able to resolve few star-forming galaxies individually , their fractional contribution to the CGB should become far more significant than it was for past measurements of the CGB as many of the brighter , formerly unresolved sources will be resolved out .	Star-forming galaxies are predicted to contribute considerably to the cosmic gamma-ray background ( CGB ) as they are confirmed gamma-ray emitters and are the most numerous population of gamma-ray sources , although individually faint .	Thus , the clustering feature of galaxies imprinted on the CGB might be detectable by Fermi .	In anticipation of such measurements , we calculate the predicted angular auto-power and cross-power spectra of the CGB from normal galaxies .	We find that the amplitude of the auto-power spectrum is smaller than that for other sources such as blazars and dark-matter annihilation ; the shape is also characteristic .
3	Those cloud cores with IRAS point sources are seen to be already forming stars , but this is found to be only a small fraction of the total number of cores .	We present a catalogue of molecular cloud cores drawn from high latitude , medium opacity clouds , using the all-sky IRAS Sky Survey Atlas ( ISSA ) images at 60 and 100~ $ \mu $ m .	The typical column densities of the cores are $ N ( H_2 ) \sim 3.8 \times 10^ { 21 } $ cm $ ^ { -2 } $ and the typical volume densities are $ n ( H_2 ) \sim 2 \times 10^3 $ cm $ ^ { -3 } $ .	They are therefore significantly less dense than many other samples obtained in other ways .	The fraction of the cores in the protostellar stage is used to estimate the prestellar timescale - the time until the formation of a hydrostatically supported protostellar object .
3	We prove it in some cases with stronger hypoteses .	Let $ \A $ be an affine line arrangement in $ \C^2 , $ with complement $ \M ( \A ) . $ The twisted ( co ) homology of $ \M ( \A ) $ is an interesting object which has been considered by many authors , strictly related to the ( co ) homology of the Milnor fibre associated to the conified arrangement .	In this paper we give a vanishing conjecture of such homology of a different nature with respect to the known results : namely , we conjecture that if the graph of double points of the arrangement is connected then there is no nontrivial monodromy .	This conjecture is obviously combinatorial ( meaning that it depends only on the lattice of the intersections ) .	We also consider the integral case , relating the property of having trivial monodromy over $ \Z $ with a certain property of `` commutativity '' of the fundamental group up to some subgroup .
2	At radio wavelengths , Abell 3667 reveals a double radio-relic feature in the outskirts of the cluster .	The galaxy cluster Abell 3667 is an ideal laboratory to study the plasma processes in the intracluster medium ( ICM ) .	High resolution Chandra X-ray observations show a cold front in Abell 3667 .	These suggest multiple merger events in this cluster .	In this paper , we analyze the substantial archival X-ray observations of Abell 3667 from ChandraX-ray Observatory and compare these with existing radio observations as well as state-of-the-art AMR ( Adaptive Mesh Refinement ) MHD cosmological simulations using Enzo .
1	In his formal analysis of EPR-type entangled quantum states , Bell ( 1964 ) concluded that any hidden variable theory designed to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics must necessarily be nonlocal and allow superluminal interactions .	In the 80 years since the seminal Einstein , Podolsky , and Rosen ( EPR ) paper , physicists and philosophers have mused about the `spooky action at a distance ' aspect of quantum mechanics that so bothered Einstein .	This does n't immediately imply that nonlocality is a characteristic feature of quantum mechanics let alone a fundamental property of nature ; however , many physicists and philosophers of science do harbor this belief .	Experts in the field often use the term `nonlocality ' to designate particular non-classical aspects of quantum entanglement and do not confuse the term with superluminal interactions .	However , many physicists seem to take the term more literally .
0	Detailed physisorption data from experiment for the H_2 molecule on low-index Cu surfaces challenge theory .	Recently , density-functional theory ( DFT ) has been developed to account for nonlocal correlation effects , including van der Waals ( dispersion ) forces .	We show that the functional vdW-DF2 gives a potential-energy curve , potential-well energy levels , and difference in lateral corrugation promisingly close to the results obtained by resonant elastic backscattering-diffraction experiments .	The backscattering barrier is found selective for choice of exchange-functional approximation .	Further , the DFT-D3 and TS-vdW corrections to traditional DFT formulations are also benchmarked , and deviations are analyzed .
4	The theory is applied to the system composed of a 40Ca+ ion and a Na atom , and compared to numerical coupled-channel calculations carried out using ab initio potentials .	We develop an analytical model for ultracold atom-ion collisions using the multichannel quantum-defect formalism .	The model is based on the analytical solutions of the r^-4 long-range potential and on the application of a frame transformation between asymptotic and molecular bases .	This approach allows the description of the atom-ion interaction in the ultracold domain in terms of three parameters only : the singlet and triplet scattering lengths , assumed to be independent of the relative motion angular momentum , and the lead dispersion coefficient of the asymptotic potential .	We also introduce corrections to the scattering lengths that improve the accuracy of our quantum-defect model for higher order partial waves , a particularly important result for an accurate description of shape and Feshbach resonances at finite temperature .
3	A positive magnetoresistance is found as a function of the perpendicular component , in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations .	We have calculated the resistivity of a GaAs\slash AlGaAs heterojunction in the presence of both an in -- plane magnetic field and a weak perpendicular component using a semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory .	These calculations take into account fully the distortion of the Fermi contour which is induced by the parallel magnetic field .	The scattering of electrons is assumed to be due to remote ionized impurities .	The main source of this effect is the strong variation of the electronic scattering rate around the Fermi contour which is associated with the variation in the mean distance of the electronic states from the remote impurities .
3	The other group ( 17 stars ) shows a clearly deviating trend ranging from [ alpha/Fe ] = 0.20 at [ Fe/H ] = -1.3 to [ alpha/Fe ] = 0.08 at [ Fe/H ] = -0.8 .	New information on the relations between the Galactic disks , the halo , and satellite galaxies is being obtained from elemental abundances of stars having metallicities in the range -1.5 & lt ; [ Fe/H ] & lt ; -0.5 .	The first results for a sample of 26 halo stars and 13 thick-disk stars observed with the ESO VLT/UVES spectrograph are presented .	The halo stars fall in two distinct groups : One group ( 9 stars ) has [ alpha/Fe ] = 0.30 +-0.03 like the thick-disk stars .	The kinematics of the stars are discussed and the abundance ratios Na/Fe , Ni/Fe , Cu/Fe and Ba/Y are applied to see if the low-alpha stars are connected to the thin disk or to Milky Way satellite galaxies .
1	By decomposing the full sky survey into distinct patches and using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic redshift data , we use both parametric and non-parametric methods to obtain the shape of the luminosity function in each patch .	We test the isotropy of the local distribution of galaxies using the 2MASS extended source catalogue .	We use the shape of the luminosity function to test the statistical isotropy of the underlying galaxy distribution .	The parametric estimator shows some evidence of a hemispherical asymmetry in the north/south Galactic plane .	However the non-parametric estimator exhibits no significant anisotropy , with the galaxy distribution being consistent with the assumption of isotropy in all regions considered .
3	Consider the extremal case where phi ( h ( X ) ) = t ( X ) .	Let X be a K3 surface with the Neron-Severi lattice S_X and transcendental lattice T_X .	Nukulin considered the kernel H_X of the natural representation Aut ( X ) -- - & gt ; O ( S_X ) and proved that H_ { X } is a finite cyclic group with phi ( h ( X ) ) ) | t ( X ) and acts faithfully on the space H^ { 2,0 } ( X ) = C omega_ { X } , where h ( X ) = ord ( H_X ) , t ( X ) = rank T_X and phi ( . )	is the Euler function .	In the situation where T_ { X } is unimodular , Kondo has determined the list of t ( X ) , as well as the actual realizations , and showed that t ( X ) alone uniquely determines the isomorphism class of X ( with phi ( h ( X ) ) = t ( X ) ) .
4	The results provide a precise description of the quantum phases and universal thermodynamics which are applicable to experiments with cold fermionic atoms confined to one-dimensional tubes .	Exactly solvable models of ultracold Fermi gases are reviewed via their thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz solution .	Analytical and numerical results are obtained for the thermodynamics and ground state properties of two- and three-component one-dimensional attractive fermions with population imbalance .	New results for the universal finite temperature corrections are given for the two-component model .	For the three-component model , numerical solution of the dressed energy equations confirm that the analytical expressions for the critical fields and the resulting phase diagrams at zero temperature are highly accurate in the strong coupling regime .
2	We propose a theoretical model , which , in the limit of low axial flow resistance , predicts that the sugar front indeed should travel with a constant velocity .	We perform experimental investigations of osmotically driven flows in artificial microchannels by studying the dynamics and structure of the front of a sugar solution traveling in 200 um wide and 50-200 um deep microchannels .	We find that the sugar front travels with constant speed , and that this speed is proportional to the concentration of the sugar solution and inversely proportional to the depth of the channel .	The model also predicts an inverse relationship between the depth of the channel and the speed and a linear relation between the sugar concentration and the speed .	We thus find good agreement between the experimental results and the predictions of the model .
1	Making the same assumption , the adjoint action of the unique inner-implementing representation U^A associated with A\subset B on the local observables in B is found to define net-endomorphisms of B .	The local algebras of the maximal Coset model C_max associated with a chiral conformal subtheory A\subset B are shown to coincide with the local relative commutants of A in B , provided A contains a stress energy tensor .	This property is exploited for constructing from B a conformally covariant holographic image in 1+1 dimensions which proves useful as a geometric picture for the joint inclusion A\vee C_max \subset B .	Immediate applications to the analysis of current subalgebras are given and the relation to normal canonical tensor product subfactors is clarified .	A natural converse of Borchers ' theorem on half-sided translations is made accessible .
0	Homogeneous nucleation of a vapor bubble from a bulk metastable phase is studied here for the first time using the multibody dissipative particle dynamics model .	The van der Waals equation of state is used to define a conservative force that describes the model fluid used in this study .	Additional computational tools were developed to help visualize the vapor bubble formed in the system .	Continuum thermodynamic ideas are used to help identify the bubble interface and separate particles that constitute the vapor bubble and bulk liquid regions respectively .	Using this idea , the density variation is found to vary smoothly from the liquid to vapor regions in the system .
3	All susceptibilities diverge at some energy scale and the antiferromagnetic SDW correlations produce indeed the dominant instability in the physical system .	We present the two-loop renormalization group ( RG ) calculations of all the susceptibilities associated with the two-dimensional flat Fermi surface with rounded corners ( FS ) .	Our approach follows our fermionic field theory RG method presented in detail earlier on .	In one loop order our calculation reproduce the results obtained previously by other RG schemes .	In contrast , in two-loop order , for a given initial set of values of coupling constant regime only one of the susceptibilities at a time seems to diverge .
2	We identify the `` catch-up phenomenon '' as a novel explanation for the slow convergence of Bayesian methods .	Bayesian model averaging , model selection and its approximations such as BIC are generally statistically consistent , but sometimes achieve slower rates og convergence than other methods such as AIC and leave-one-out cross-validation .	On the other hand , these other methods can br inconsistent .	Based on this analysis we define the switch distribution , a modification of the Bayesian marginal distribution .	We show that , under broad conditions , model selection and prediction based on the switch distribution is both consistent and achieves optimal convergence rates , thereby resolving the AIC-BIC dilemma .
0	Despite extensive observational efforts , the brightest sub -- mm source in the Hubble Deep Field , HDF850.1 , has failed to yield a convincing optical/infrared identification almost 4 years after its discovery .	This failure is all the more notable given the availability of supporting multi-frequency data of unparalleled depth , and sub-arcsec positional accuracy for the sub-mm/mm source .	Consequently , HDF850.1 has become a test case of the possibility that the most violently star-forming objects in the universe are too red and/or distant to be seen in the deepest optical images .	Here we report the discovery of the host galaxy of HDF850.1 .	This object has been revealed by careful analysis of a new , deep K-prime image of the HDF obtained with the Subaru 8.2-m telescope .
0	Fourier ptychographic microscopy ( FPM ) is a novel computational coherent imaging technique for high space-bandwidth product imaging .	Mathematically , Fourier ptychographic ( FP ) reconstruction can be implemented as a phase retrieval optimization process , in which we only obtain low resolution intensity images corresponding to the sub-bands of the sample 's high resolution ( HR ) spatial spectrum , and aim to retrieve the complex HR spectrum .	In real setups , the measurements always suffer from various degenerations such as Gaussian noise , Poisson noise , speckle noise and pupil location error , which would largely degrade the reconstruction .	To efficiently address these degenerations , we propose a novel FP reconstruction method under a gradient descent optimization framework in this paper .	The technique utilizes Poisson maximum likelihood for better signal modeling , and truncated Wirtinger gradient for error removal .
1	This is a novel application in the field of astronomy , because we are using such resources for data mining , and not just performing simulations .	We present recent results from the LCDM ( Laboratory for Cosmological Data Mining ; http : //lcdm.astro.uiuc.edu ) collaboration between UIUC Astronomy and NCSA to deploy supercomputing cluster resources and machine learning algorithms for the mining of terascale astronomical datasets .	Via a modified implementation of the NCSA cyberenvironment Data-to-Knowledge , we are able to provide improved classifications for over 100 million stars and galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , improved distance measures , and a full exploitation of the simple but powerful k-nearest neighbor algorithm .	A driving principle of this work is that our methods should be extensible from current terascale datasets to upcoming petascale datasets and beyond .	We discuss issues encountered to-date , and further issues for the transition to petascale .
1	The main elements of the system are blocks ( modeling cars ) , springs with unidirectional interactions ( modeling distance keeping interactions between neighbors ) , static and kinetic friction ( modeling inertia of drivers and cars ) and spatiotemporal disorder in the values of these friction forces ( modeling differences in the driving attitudes ) .	A simple one-dimensional spring-block chain with asymmetric interactions is considered to model an idealized single-lane highway traffic .	The traveling chain of cars correspond to the dragged spring-block system .	Our statistical analysis for the spring-block chain predicts a non-trivial and rich complex behavior .	As a function of the disorder level in the system a dynamic phase-transition is observed .
2	The Perdew-Wang functional incorrectly gives the fcc site as the most favorable adsorption site , in accord with a set of previous studies .	The adsorption of CO on the Pt ( 111 ) surface in a root3 x root3 pattern has been studied with the gradient corrected functional of Perdew and Wang and the B3LYP hybrid functional .	A slab which is periodic in two dimensions is used to model the system .	The B3LYP functional gives the top site as the preferred site .	This confirms results from cluster studies where it was suggested that the different splitting , dependent on the functional , between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital , could be the reason for this change of the adsorption site .
0	The question as to why most higher organisms reproduce sexually has remained open despite extensive research , and has been called `` the queen of problems in evolutionary biology '' .	Theories dating back to Weismann have suggested that the key must lie in the creation of increased variability in offspring , causing enhanced response to selection .	Rigorously quantifying the effects of assorted mechanisms which might lead to such increased variability , and establishing that these beneficial effects outweigh the immediate costs of sexual reproduction has , however , proved problematic .	Here we introduce an approach which does not focus on particular mechanisms influencing factors such as the fixation of beneficial mutants or the ability of populations to deal with deleterious mutations , but rather tracks the entire distribution of a population of genotypes as it moves across vast fitness landscapes .	In this setting simulations now show sex robustly outperforming asex across a broad spectrum of finite or infinite population models .
0	Let $ P $ be a polynomial of degree $ d $ with a Cremer point $ p $ and no repelling or parabolic periodic bi-accessible points .	We show that there are two types of such Julia sets $ J_P $ .	The \emph { red dwarf } $ J_P $ are nowhere connected im kleinen and such that the intersection of all impressions of external angles is a continuum containing $ p $ and the orbits of all critical images .	The \emph { solar } $ J_P $ are such that every angle with dense orbit has a degenerate impression disjoint from other impressions and $ J_P $ is connected im kleinen at its landing point .	We study bi-accessible points and locally connected models of $ J_P $ and show that such sets $ J_P $ appear through polynomial-like maps for generic polynomials with Cremer points .
4	At low temperatures $ \tilde { T } =0.04-0.33 $ , the heat capacity clearly deviates from normal Fermi gas behavior .	We report on the measurement of the heat capacity for an optically-trapped , strongly-interacting Fermi gas of atoms .	In the experiments , a precise input of energy to the gas is followed by single-parameter thermometry .	The thermometry determines a temperature parameter $ \tilde { T } $ from the best fit of a Thomas-Fermi distribution with a fixed Fermi radius to the spatial density of the cloud .	At $ \tilde { T } =0.33 $ , we observe a transition between two patterns of behavior : For $ \tilde { T } =0.33-2.15 $ , we find that the heat capacity closely corresponds to that of a trapped normal Fermi gas of atoms with increased mass .
4	These attributes of the proposed method are in contrast to past analysis methods for tilted-layer media that often place limitations on the source and medium characteristics .	We propose and investigate an `` interface-flattening '' transformation , hinging upon Transformation Optics ( T.O . )	techniques , to facilitate the rigorous analysis of electromagnetic ( EM ) fields radiated by sources embedded in tilted , cylindrically-layered geophysical media .	Our method addresses the major challenge in such problems of appropriately approximating the domain boundaries in the computational model while , in a full-wave manner , predicting the effects of tilting in the layers .	When incorporated into standard pseudo-analytical algorithms , moreover , the proposed method is quite robust , as it is not limited by absorption , anisotropy , and/or eccentering profile of the cylindrical geophysical formations , nor is it limited by the radiation frequency .
0	Recent general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic ( MHD ) simulations of accretion onto black holes have shown that , contrary to the basic assumptions of the Novikov-Thorne model , there can be substantial magnetic stress throughout the plunging region .	Additional dissipation and radiation can therefore be expected .	We use data from a particularly well-resolved simulation of accretion onto a non-spinning black hole to compute both the radiative efficiency of such a flow and its spectrum if all emitted light is radiated with a thermal spectrum whose temperature matches the local effective temperature .	This disk is geometrically thin enough ( H/r ~= 0.06 ) that little heat is retained in the flow .	In terms of light reaching infinity ( i.e. , after allowance for all relativistic effects and for photon capture by the black hole ) , we find that the radiative efficiency is at least ~=6-10 % greater than predicted by the Novikov-Thorne model ( complete radiation of all heat might yield another ~6 % ) .
1	Relying on the general projected normal distribution , our approach allows for bimodal and/or skewed cluster-specific distributions for the circular variable .	We introduce a multivariate hidden Markov model to jointly cluster time-series observations with different support , i.e.circular and linear .	Furthermore , we relax the independence assumption between the circular and linear components observed at the same time .	Such an assumption is generally used to alleviate the computational burden involved in the parameter estimation step , but it is hard to justify in empirical applications .	We carry out a simulation study using different data-generation schemes to investigate model behavior , focusing on well recovering the hidden structure .
0	Playout buffers are used in VoIP systems to compensate for network delay jitter by making a trade-off between delay and loss .	In this work we propose a playout buffer algorithm that makes the trade-off based on maximization of conversational speech quality , aiming to keep the computational complexity lowest possible .	We model the network delay using a Pareto distribution and show that it is a good compromise between providing an appropriate fit to the network delay characteristics and yielding a low arithmetical complexity .	We use the ITU-T E-Model as the quality model and simplify its delay impairment function .	The proposed playout buffer algorithm finds the optimum playout delay using a closed-form solution that minimizes the sum of the simplified delay impairment factor and the loss-dependent equipment impairment factor of the E-model .
4	It follows that the family of Kahlerian structures of above type on $ T^*M $ depends on three essential parameters ( one is a certain proportionality factor , the other two are parameters involved in the definition of $ J $ ) .	We study the conditions under which an almost Hermitian structure $ ( G , J ) $ of general natural lift type on the cotangent bundle $ T^*M $ of a Riemannian manifold $ ( M , g ) $ is K\ '' ahlerian .	First , we obtain the algebraic conditions under which the manifold $ ( T^*M , G , J ) $ is almost Hermitian .	Next we get the integrability conditions for the almost complex structure $ J $ , then the conditions under which the associated 2-form is closed .	The manifold $ ( T^*M , G , J ) $ is K\ '' ahlerian iff it is almost Kahlerian and the almost complex structure $ J $ is integrable .
4	This paper provides a survey of several recently proposed techniques for this purpose .	The massive amounts of bandwidth available at millimeter-wave frequencies ( roughly above 10 GHz ) have the potential to greatly increase the capacity of fifth generation cellular wireless systems .	However , to overcome the high isotropic pathloss experienced at these frequencies , high directionality will be required at both the base station and the mobile user equipment to establish sufficient link budget in wide area net- works .	This reliance on directionality has important implications for control layer procedures .	Initial access in particular can be significantly delayed due to the need for the base station and the user to find the proper alignment for directional transmission and reception .
1	These coefficients are large , and have both even and odd moments .	Experiments at the LHC have recently reported results on the angular asymmetry coefficients $ v_n [ m ] $ , for various angular moments $ n $ and orders of cumulants $ m $ , in high multiplicity p+Pb collisions .	We discuss here some of the implications of these results for our understanding of the initial state of the collision ( Color Glass Condensate ) and for the evolution in the final state ( Glasma and thermalized Quark Gluon Plasma ) .	We show the Color Glass Condensate predicts large even moments , $ v_n $ with $ n $ an even integer .	Odd moments are generated by final state interactions or fragmentation .
0	In this work we introduce the concept of Modular Framization or simply Framization .	We construct a framization $ F_ { d , n } $ of the Birman -- Wenzl -- Murakami algebra , also known as BMW algebra , and start a systematic study of this framization .	We show that $ F_ { d , n } $ is finite dimensional and the \lq braid generators\rq\ of this algebra satisfy a quartic relation which is of minimal degree not containing the generators $ t_i $ .	They also satisfy a quintic relation , as the smallest closed relation .	We conjecture that the algebras $ F_ { d , n } $ support a Markov trace which allow to define polynomial invariants for unoriented knots in an analogous way that the Kauffman polynomial is derived from the BMW algebra .
0	Numerical models of disc galaxy formation predict the existence of extended , hot ( T~10^6 K ) gas haloes around present day spirals .	The X-ray luminosity of these haloes is predicted to increase strongly with galaxy mass .	However , searches for their X-ray emission have not been successful so far .	We calculate the all sky O VII column density distributions for the haloes of three Milky Way like disc galaxies , resulting from cosmological high-resolution , N-body/gasdynamical simulations .	We perform calculations both including the disc gas and without it , so the disc contribution to the column density is quantified .
2	Specifically , the osmotic pressure calculated within the RJM using the contact value theorem can be very different from the pressure calculated using the Kirkwood-Buff fluctuation relations .	The thermodynamic properties of highly charged colloidal suspensions in contact with a salt reservoir are investigated in the framework of the Renormalized Jellium Model ( RJM ) .	It is found that the equation of state is very sensitive to the particular thermodynamic route used to obtain it .	On the other hand , Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulations show that both the effective pair potentials and the correlation functions are accurately predicted by the RJM .	It is suggested that the lack of self-consistency in the thermodynamics of the RJM is a result of neglected electrostatic correlations between the counterions and coions .
2	We identify a dense G-delta subset of B ( X ) on which the action of G is Borel-amenable , and describe the relation of these two spaces to the Roller boundary .	We consider a finite-dimensional , locally finite CAT ( 0 ) cube complex X admitting a co-compact properly discontinuous countable group of automorphisms G. We construct a natural compact metric space B ( X ) on which G acts by homeomorphisms , the action being minimal and strongly proximal .	Furthermore , for any generating probability measure on G , B ( X ) admits a unique stationary measure , and when the measure has finite logarithmic moment , it constitutes a compact metric model of the Poisson boundary .	Our construction can be used to give a simple geometric proof of Property A for the complex .	Our methods are based on direct geometric arguments regarding the asymptotic behavior of half-spaces and their limiting ultrafilters , which are of considerable independent interest .
3	The dynamics of these plastic regions determines the selection of microstructure .	We study the nucleation dynamics of a model solid state transformation and the criterion for microstructure selection using a molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation .	Our simulations show a range of microstructures depending on the depth of quench .	We closely follow the dynamics of the solid and find that transient { \em non-affine zones } ( NAZ ) are created at and evolve with the rapidly moving transformation front .	We formulate an { \it elastoplastic model } which couples the elastic strain to the non-affine deformation , and recover all the qualitative features of the MD simulation .
4	To characterize the statistics of these longest lasting records , we compute : ( i ) the probability that the record of the longest age is broken at step $ n $ , denoted by $ Q^ { \alpha } ( n ) $ , which we call the probability of record breaking and : ( ii ) the duration of the longest lasting record , $ \ell_ { \max } ^ { \alpha } ( n ) $ .	We study the record statistics of random walks after $ n $ steps , $ x_0 , x_1 , \ldots , x_n $ , with arbitrary symmetric and continuous distribution $ p ( \eta ) $ of the jumps $ \eta_i = x_i - x_ { i-1 } $ .	We consider the age of the records , i.e.the time up to which a record survives .	Depending on how the age of the current last record is defined , we propose three distinct sequences of ages ( indexed by $ \alpha $ = I , II , III ) associated to a given sequence of records .	We then focus on the longest lasting record , which is the longest element among this sequence of ages .
3	The domain of attraction is described , and convergence results are presented for quantile approximation and for a simple quantile estimator based on the log-GW tail .	Motivated by applications requiring quantile estimates for very small probabilities of exceedance , this article addresses estimation of high quantiles for probabilities bounded by powers of sample size with exponents below -1 .	As regularity assumption , an alternative to the Generalised Pareto tail limit is explored for this purpose .	Motivation for the alternative regularity assumption is provided , and it is shown to be equivalent to a limit relation for the logarithm of survival function , the log-GW tail limit , which generalises the GW ( Generalised Weibull ) tail limit , a generalisation of the Weibull tail limit .	Simulations are presented , and advantages and limitations of log-GW-based estimation of high quantiles are indicated .
4	A simplicial complex is topologically d-representable if it is isomorphic to the nerve of a good cover in R^d .	A good cover in R^d is a collection of open contractible sets in R^d such that the intersection of any subcollection is either contractible or empty .	Motivated by an analogy with convex sets , intersection patterns of good covers were studied intensively .	Our main result is that intersection patterns of good covers are algorithmically unrecognizable .	More precisely , the intersection pattern of a good cover can be stored in a simplicial complex called nerve which records which subfamilies of the good cover intersect .
3	Importantly , the simulation data is analysed using the same processes by which structural parameters are extracted from observed star clusters .	There is currently much interest in the possible presence of intermediate-mass black holes in the cores of globular clusters .	Based on theoretical arguments and simulation results it has previously been suggested that a large core radius -- or particularly a large ratio of the core radius to half-mass radius -- is a promising indicator for finding such a black hole in a star cluster .	In this study N-body models of 100000 stars with and without primordial binaries are used to investigate the long-term structural evolution of star clusters .	This gives a ratio of the core and half-mass ( or half-light ) radii that is directly comparable to the Galactic globular cluster sample .
0	X-ray burst spectra have long been used to estimate neutron star masses and radii .	These estimates assumed that burst spectra are accurately described by the model atmosphere spectra developed over the last three decades .	We compared RXTE data from a superburst with these spectra and found that the spectra predicted by previously published model atmospheres are strongly inconsistent with these high-precision measurements .	In contrast , a simple Bose-Einstein spectrum is fully consistent with the data , as are recently published model atmosphere spectra .	We discuss the implications of our results for determinations of neutron star masses and radii via constraints on their surface gravity and redshift , as originally suggested by Majczyna and Madej .
0	This presentation describes a measurement of the neutrino mixing parameter , sin^2 ( 2theta_13 ) , from the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment .	Disappearance of electron antineutrinos at a distance of ~2 km from a set of six reactors , where the reactor flux is constrained by near detectors , has been clearly observed .	The result , based on the ratio of observed to expected rate of antineutrinos , using 139 days of data taken between December 24 , 2011 and May 11 , 2012 , is sin^2 ( 2theta_13 ) = 0.089 +/- 0.010 ( stat . )	+/- 0.005 ( syst . ) .	Improvements in sensitivity from inclusion of additional data , spectral analysis , and improved calibration are expected in the future .
0	A generalized Baumslag-Solitar group ( GBS group ) is a finitely generated group $ G $ which acts on a tree with all edge and vertex stabilizers infinite cyclic .	We show that Out ( G ) either contains non-abelian free groups or is virtually nilpotent of class at most 2 .	It has torsion only at finitely many primes .	One may decide algorithmically whether Out ( G ) is virtually nilpotent or not .	If it is , one may decide whether it is virtually abelian , or finitely generated .
4	The large quantity of simulations allowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracy suitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the first time .	We present the results of the GREAT08 Challenge , a blind analysis challenge to infer weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from images .	The primary goal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchers outside the shear measurement community .	Six GREAT08 Team methods were presented at the launch of the Challenge and five additional groups submitted results during the 6 month competition .	Participants analyzed 30 million simulated galaxies with a range in signal to noise ratio , point-spread function ellipticity , galaxy size , and galaxy type .
0	The present paper is devoted to implementation of the immersed boundary technique into the Fourier pseudo-spectral solution of the vorticity-velocity formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier -- Stokes equations .	The immersed boundary conditions are implemented via direct modification of the convection and diffusion terms , and therefore , in contrast to many other similar methods , there is not an explicit external forcing function in the present formulation .	The desired immersed boundary conditions are approximated on some regular grid points , using different orders ( up to second-order ) polynomial extrapolations .	At the beginning of each timestep , the solenoidal velocities ( also satisfying the desired immersed boundary conditions ) , are obtained and fed into a conventional pseudo-spectral solver , together with a modified vorticity .	The zero-mean pseudo-spectral solution is employed , and therefore , the method is applicable to the confined flows with zero mean velocity and vorticity , and without mean vorticity dynamics .
0	This paper introduces an approach to Reinforcement Learning Algorithm by comparing their immediate rewards using a variation of Q-Learning algorithm .	Unlike the conventional Q-Learning , the proposed algorithm compares current reward with immediate reward of past move and work accordingly .	Relative reward based Q-learning is an approach towards interactive learning .	Q-Learning is a model free reinforcement learning method that used to learn the agents .	It is observed that under normal circumstances algorithm take more episodes to reach optimal Q-value due to its normal reward or sometime negative reward .
2	A hybrid UPO detection method from return maps that combines topological recurrence criterion , matrix fit algorithm and stringent criterion for fixed point location gives accurate and statistically significant UPOs even in the presence of significant noise .	Presence of recurrent and statistically significant unstable periodic orbits ( UPOs ) in time series obtained from biological systems are now routinely used as evidence for low dimensional chaos .	Extracting accurate dynamical information from the detected UPO trajectories are vital for successful control strategies that either aim to stabilize the system near the fixed point or steer the system away from the periodic orbits .	Geometry of the return map , frequency of UPOs visiting the same trajectory , length of the data set , strength of the noise and degree of nonstationarity affect the efficacy of the proposed method .	Results suggest that establishing determinism from unambiguous UPO detection is often possible in short data sets with significant noise , but derived dynamical properties are rarely accurate and adequate for controlling the dynamics around these UPOs .
3	The technique is showcased by printing linear bellows actuators , gear pumps , soft grippers and a hexapod robot , using a commercially-available 3D printer .	This work introduces a novel technique for fabricating functional robots using 3D printers .	Simultaneously depositing photopolymers and a non-curing liquid allows complex , pre-filled fluidic channels to be fabricated .	This new printing capability enables complex hydraulically actuated robots and robotic components to be automatically built , with no assembly required .	We detail the steps required to modify the printer and describe the design constraints imposed by this new fabrication approach .
2	Our main results are as follows ( 1 ) Feedback mechanisms that are based on Bondi accretion fail .	For the recent four years we have been studying feedback heating in cooling flow ( CF ) clusters by AGN activity that inflate bubbles by jets ; this short contribution to a meeting summarizes our main results .	To achieve our results we had to self-consistently inflate the bubbles with jets , rather than inject them artificially .	Instead , the accretion to the central super-massive black hole ( SMBH ) is in the form of cold dense blobs that fall-in from an extended region .	( 2 ) Slow massive wide ( SMW ) jets , or rapidly precessing jets , can inflate bubbles similar to those observed in CF clusters .
3	It is found that the degenerate chiral Majorana edge modes for $ { \cal N } =2 $ are lifted off by applying Zeeman magnetic field along the parallel to the interface or the shift of the chemical potential by doping .	We study the edge states for a quantum anomalous Hall system ( QAHS ) coupled with a spin-singlet s-wave superconductor through the proximity effect , and clarify the topological nature of them .	When we consider a superconducting pair potential induced in the QAHS , there appear topological phases with nonzero Chern numbers , $ i.e. $ , $ { \cal N } =1 $ and $ { \cal N } =2 $ , where Andreev bound states appear as chiral Majorana edge modes .	We calculate the energy spectrum of the edge modes and the resulting local density of states .	The degeneracy of the chiral Majorana edge modes and its lifting are explained by two different winding numbers defined at the time-reversal invariant point of the edge momentum .
2	Indeed , numerical investigations reveal a hysteresis behavior associated with the transition .	Spontaneous explosive is an abrupt transition to collective behavior taking place in heterogeneous networks when the frequencies of the nodes are positively correlated to the node degree .	This explosive transition was conjectured to be discontinuous .	Here , we analyze explosive synchronization in star graphs .	We show that in the thermodynamic limit the transition to ( and out ) collective behavior is indeed discontinuous .
0	Motivation : Prediction of ligands for proteins of known 3D structure is important to understand structure-function relationship , predict molecular function , or design new drugs .	Results : We explore a new approach for ligand prediction in which binding pockets are represented by atom clouds .	Each target pocket is compared to an ensemble of pockets of known ligands .	Pockets are aligned in 3D space with further use of convolution kernels between clouds of points .	Performance of the new method for ligand prediction is compared to those of other available measures and to docking programs .
0	The role of nonvalence , { \it e.g . }	sea quarks and/or meson degrees of freedom in static and quasistatic baryon electroweak observables , is discussed within the phenomenological sum rule approach .	The inclusion of nonvalence degrees of freedom in the analysis of baryon magnetic moments explains extremely strong violation of the standard SU ( 6 ) symmetry-based quark-model prediction for the magnetic moment ratio $ R_ { \Sigma /\Lambda } = ( \Sigma^ { + } + 2\Sigma^ { - } ) / ( -\Lambda ) \simeq .23 $ , while the value $ R_ { \Sigma /\Lambda } ( SU ( 6 ) ) = 1 $ corresponds to the nonrelativistic quark model .	We also obtain $ F/D=.72 $ for the quark-current-baryon coupling $ SU ( 3 ) _ { f } $ ratio .	The implications for the `` strangeness '' magnetism of the nucleon and for weak axial-to-vector coupling constant relations measured in the lowest octet baryon $ \beta $ -decays are discussed .
2	A Monte Carlo study has been performed using boosted-top techniques to reduce QCD background for the reconstruction of heavy particles with masses in the range of 8-20 TeV , and various widths .	We discuss the sensitivity of a 100 TeV pp collider to heavy particles decaying to top-antitop final states .	This center-of-mass energy , together with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab-1 , can produce heavy particles in the mass range of several tens of teraelectronvolts ( TeV ) .	In particular , we have studied two models that predict heavy states , a model with an extra gauge boson ( Zprime ) and with a Kaluza-Klein ( KK ) excitation of the gluon ( gKK ) .	We estimate the sensitive values of $ \sigma \times $ Br of about 2 ( 4 ) fb for Zprime ( gKK ) , with a corresponding mass reach of 13 ( 20 ) TeV .
2	For a particle with anomalous magnetic moment , singularity in the relativistic equations generally occurs at the speed different from the speed of light .	We found Lagrangian action which describes spinning particle on the base of non-Grassmann vector and involves only one auxiliary variable .	It provides the right number of physical degrees of freedom and yields generalization of the Frenkel and BMT equations to the case of an arbitrary electromagnetic field .	Detailed discussion of the ultra-relativistic motion is presented in the work : A .	A. Deriglazov and W. G. Ramirez , World-line geometry probed by fast spinning particle , arXiv:1409.4756 .
1	This multiscale biological assembly inspires new synthetic routes to complex materials .	Intricate biomineralization processes in molluscs engineer hierarchical structures with meso- , nano- , and atomic architectures that give the final composite material exceptional mechanical strength and optical iridescence on the macroscale .	Our investigation of the prism-nacre interface reveals nanoscale details governing the onset of nacre formation using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy .	A wedge polishing technique provides unprecedented , large-area specimens required to span the entire interface .	Within this region , we find a transition from nanofibrillar aggregation to irregular early-nacre layers , to well-ordered mature nacre suggesting the assembly process is driven by aggregation of nanoparticles ( ~50-80 nm ) within an organic matrix that arrange in fiber-like polycrystalline configurations .
1	We use two independent methods ( recursive Green 's function and self-consistent Born approximation ) to extract the scattering mean free path , the scattering mean free time , the density of states and the localization length as a function of the disorder strength .	We consider a tight-binding model on the regular honeycomb lattice with uncorrelated on-site disorder .	The two methods give excellent quantitative agreement for these single-particle properties .	Furthermore , a finite-size scaling analysis reveals that all localization lengths for different lattice sizes and different energies ( including the energy at the Dirac points ) collapse onto a single curve , in agreement with the one-parameter scaling theory of localization .	The predictions of the self-consistent theory of localization however fail to quantitatively reproduce these numerically-extracted localization lengths .
0	Extracting Times of Arrival from pulsar radio signals depends on the knowledge of the pulsars pulse profile and how this template is generated .	We examine pulsar template generation with Bayesian methods .	We will contrast the classical generation mechanism of averaging intensity profiles with a new approach based on Bayesian inference .	We introduce the Bayesian measurement model imposed and derive the algorithm to reconstruct a `` statistical template '' out of noisy data .	The properties of these `` statistical templates '' are analysed with simulated and real measurement data from PSR B1133+16 .
1	The melt was dumped from a Pt-crucible with a downpipe in water which resulted in the formation of phase separated droplets with a size of around 100 - 150 nm .	A potassium alumina borosilicate glass with the composition 13K2O*13Al2O3*16B2O3*43SiO2*15Fe2O3-x was melted using Fe2O3 as raw material .	In this droplets , magnetite crystals with a size of around 10-20 nm were observed .	These magnetite nanoparticles with superparamagnetic behaviour are arranged to larger aggregates .	This leads to a higher effective magnetic radius .
4	We find that the terrestrial thermal plume model needs to be modified to satisfyingly account for deep turbulent plumes found in the Martian convective PBL .	The Martian Planetary Boundary Layer [ PBL ] is a crucial component of the Martian climate system .	Global Climate Models [ GCMs ] and Mesoscale Models [ MMs ] lack the resolution to predict PBL mixing which is therefore parameterized .	Here we propose to adapt the `` thermal plume '' model , recently developed for Earth climate modeling , to Martian GCMs , MMs , and single-column models .	The aim of this physically-based parameterization is to represent the effect of organized turbulent structures ( updrafts and downdrafts ) on the daytime PBL transport , as it is resolved in Large-Eddy Simulations [ LESs ] .
4	It is predicted that the view angle $ \zeta $ should be larger than the inclination angle ( $ \zeta & gt ; \alpha $ ) , otherwise the $ \gamma $ -ray radiation will have little possibility to be observed .	The inner annular gap ( IAG ) , a new type of inner gap whose magnetic field lines intersect the null charge surface ( NCS ) , is proposed to explain $ \gamma $ -ray and radio emission from pulsars .	The IAG can be an important source for high-energy particles .	The particles can radiate between the NCS and the IAG .	Some observational characteristics in both $ \gamma $ -ray and radio bands , such as the $ \gamma $ -ray emission beams of Crab-like , Vela-like and Geminga-like , can be reproduced by numerical method .
1	One interesting possibility is presented by shear-free models in which the anisotropy emerges at the level of the curvature of the homogeneous spatial sections , whereas the expansion is dictated by a single scale factor .	If one is willing to give up the cherished hypothesis of spatial isotropy , many interesting cosmological models can be developed beyond the simple anisotropically expanding scenarios .	We show that such models represent viable alternatives to describe the large-scale structure of the inflationary universe , leading to a kinematically equivalent Sachs-Wolfe effect .	Through the definition of a complete set of spatial eigenfunctions we compute the two-point correlation function of scalar perturbations in these models .	In addition , we show how such scenarios would modify the spectrum of the CMB assuming that the observations take place in a small patch of a universe with anisotropic curvature .
0	Light neutron-rich even-even nuclei , of which the ground state is oblately deformed , are looked for , examining the Nilsson diagram based on realistic Woods-Saxon potentials .	One-particle energies of the Nilsson diagram are calculated by solving the coupled differential equations obtained from the Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation in coordinate space with the proper asymptotic behavior for $ r \rightarrow \infty $ for both one-particle bound and resonant levels .	The eigenphase formalism is used in the calculation of one-particle resonant energies .	Large energy gaps on the oblate side of the Nilsson diagrams are found to be related to the magic numbers for the oblate deformation of the harmonic-oscillator potential where the frequency ratios ( $ \omega_ { \perp } : \omega_ { z } $ ) are simple rational numbers .	In contrast , for the prolate deformation the magic numbers obtained from simple rational ratios of ( $ \omega_ { \perp } : \omega_ { z } $ ) of the harmonic-oscillator potential are hardly related to the particle numbers , at which large energy gaps appear in the Nilsson diagrams based on realistic Woods-Saxon potentials .
3	Unlike previously monitored Seyfert 1 galaxies , in which the X-ray continuum generally varies with a larger amplitude than the UV , in 3C 390.3 the UV continuum light-curve is similar in both amplitude and shape to the X-ray light-curve observed by ROSAT .	As part of an extensive multi-wavelength monitoring campaign , the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite was used to observe the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 390.3 during the period 1994 December 31 to 1996 March 5 .	Spectra were obtained every 6-10 days .	The UV continuum varied by a factor of 7 through the campaign , while the broad emission-lines varied by factors of 2-5 .	The UV broad emission-line variability lags that of the UV continuum by 35-70 days for Ly-alpha and CIV 1549 ; values larger than those found for Seyfert 1 galaxies of comparable UV luminosity .
1	In ATF , 15 ps length electron beam is generated by combination of a thermionic gun , a couple of 357 MHz SHBs , and a S-band TW buncher .	KEK-ATF is doing R & amp ; D establishing high-current and low-emittance electron beam for the future linear colliders .	In the linac , beam instability caused by the fluctuated amplitude and phase of SHBs has been observed .	The reason of the fluctuation is considered to be the multi-pacting in the SHB cavity .	In addition , Q value of the cavity is almost half of the designed value , then SHBs are not operated in an optimum condition .
1	6 , p597-531 , 1986 ) .	Previously , Bennet and Feynman asked if Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle puts a limitation on a quantum computer ( Quantum Mechanical Computers , Richard P. Feynman , Foundations of Physics , Vol.16 , No .	Feynman 's answer was negative .	In this paper , we will revisit the same question for the discrete time Fourier transform uncertainty principle .	We will show that the discrete time Fourier transform uncertainty principle plays a fundamental role in showing that Shor 's type of quantum algorithms has efficient running time and conclude that the discrete time uncertainty principle is an aid in our current formulation and understanding of Shor 's type of quantum algorithms .
3	Moreover , as shown recently , these Hamiltonian systems are non-integrable if their resonant tori form a dense set .	It has been proved by S.L.Ziglin , for a large class of 2-degree-of-freedom ( d.o.f ) Hamiltonian systems , that transverse intersections of the invariant manifolds of saddle fixed points imply infinite branching of solutions in the complex time plane and the non-existence of a second analytic integral of the motion .	Here , we review in detail our recent results , following a similar approach to show the existence of infinitely-sheeted solutions for 2 d.o.f .	Hamiltonians which exhibit , upon perturbation , subharmonic bifurcations of resonant tori around an elliptic fixed point .	These results can be extended to the case where the periodic perturbation is not Hamiltonian .
4	No statistically significant signal for chi_c2 production is observed in either case .	Using a sample of 9.7 million B meson pairs collected with the CLEO detector , we study B decays to the chi_c1 and chi_c2 charmonia states , which are reconstructed via their radiative decays to J/psi .	We first measure the branching fraction for inclusive chi_c1 production in B decays to be Br ( B- & gt ; chi_c1 X ) = ( 4.14+-0.31+-0.40 ) *10^-3 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second one is systematic .	We derive the branching fractions for direct chi_c1 and chi_c2 production in B decays by subtracting the known contribution of the decay chain B- & gt ; psi ( 2S ) X with psi ( 2S ) - & gt ; chi_c1,2 gamma .	We obtain Br [ B- & gt ; chi_c1 ( direct ) X ] = ( 3.83+-0.31+-0.40 ) *10^-3 .
4	The proof relies on the careful analysis of the circular problem , which has a hyperbolic structure , but for which diffusion is prevented by KAM tori .	We study the dynamics of the restricted planar three-body problem near mean motion resonances , i.e.a resonance involving the Keplerian periods of the two lighter bodies revolving around the most massive one .	This problem is often used to model Sun -- Jupiter -- asteroid systems .	For the primaries ( Sun and Jupiter ) , we pick a realistic mass ratio $ \mu=10^ { -3 } $ and a small eccentricity $ e_0 & gt ; 0 $ .	The main result is a construction of a variety of non local diffusing orbits which show a drastic change of the osculating ( instant ) eccentricity of the asteroid , while the osculating semi major axis is kept almost constant .
4	Subsequently , we study the shortest path problem and the min-cut problem under these two correlated models .	Solving the shortest path and the min-cut problems are key in achieving high performance and robust communication networks .	Those problems have often beeny studied in deterministic and independent networks both in their original formulations as well as in several constrained variants .	However , in real-world networks , link weights ( e.g. , delay , bandwidth , failure probability ) are often correlated due to spatial or temporal reasons , and these correlated link weights together behave in a different manner and are not always additive .	In this paper , we first propose two correlated link-weight models , namely ( i ) the deterministic correlated model and ( ii ) the ( log-concave ) stochastic correlated model .
3	Based on this interpretation , Countopoulos et al .	Contopoulos et al .	recently argued that there is observational evidence for a preferred sense of the Faraday rotation-measure gradients across jets from active galactic nuclei ( AGNs ) .	Such behaviour could arise if there were a deterministic relationship between the polarity of the poloidal magnetic field that threads the outflow and the sense of rotation of the outflow 's source .	suggested that their finding supports a model for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields in a Poynting-Robertson process operating in AGN accretion discs .
0	Using the recently developed effective field theory of inflation , we argue that the size and the shape of the non-Gaussianities generated by single-field inflation are generically well described by two parameters : f_NL^equil , which characterizes the size of the signal that is peaked on equilateral configurations , and f_NL^orthog , which instead characterizes the size of the signal which is peaked both on equilateral configurations and flat-triangle configurations ( with opposite signs ) .	The shape of non-Gaussianities associated with f_NL^orthog is orthogonal to the one associated to f_NL^equil , and former analysis have been mostly blind to it .	We perform the optimal analysis of the WMAP 5-year data for both of these parameters .	We find no evidence of non-Gaussianity , and we have the following constraints : -125 & lt ; f_NL^equil & lt ; 435 , -369 & lt ; f_NL^orthog & lt ; 71 at 95 % CL .	We show that both of these constraints can be translated into limits on parameters of the Lagrangian of single-field inflation .
3	In this paper we extend this result to general graphs by proving that the cop has a winning strategy on $ G^ { 1/m } $ provided $ m \geqslant n/2 $ for all but a few small values of $ n $ ; this bound is best possible .	We consider a game in which a cop searches for a moving robber on a graph using distance probes , which is a slight variation on one introduced by Seager .	Carragher , Choi , Delcourt , Erickson and West showed that for any n-vertex graph $ G $ there is a winning strategy for the cop on the graph $ G^ { 1/m } $ obtained by replacing each edge of $ G $ by a path of length $ m $ , if $ m \geqslant n $ .	They conjectured that this bound was best possible for complete graphs , but the present authors showed that in fact the cop wins on $ K^ { 1/m } $ if and only if $ m \geqslant n/2 $ , for all but a few small values of $ n $ .	We also consider replacing the edges of $ G $ with paths of varying lengths .
1	We quantitatively estimate the field dependence of the pair potential , magnetization , and flux line lattice form factor , and study the transition from the chiral p_- state at low fields to the nonchiral p_y state at high fields .	On the basis of Eilenberger theory , we study the vortex state when a magnetic field is applied nearly parallel to the ab plane in a chiral p-wave superconductor with a large anisotropy ratio of ab and c , as in Sr2RuO4 .	Even for exactly parallel fields to the ab plane , transverse fields exist in the chiral state .	The chiral-nonchiral transition disappears when the magnetic field orientation is tilted within 1 degree from the ab plane .	This may be a reason why the experimental detection of this transition is difficult .
3	We then explicitly calculate Bures correlations for two relevant families of states : Werner states and rank-2 Bell-diagonal states , highlighting the subadditivity which holds for total correlations with respect to the sum of classical and quantum ones when using Bures distance .	The notion of distance defined on the set of states of a composite quantum system can be used to quantify total , quantum and classical correlations in a unifying way .	We provide new closed formulae for classical and total correlations of two-qubit Bell-diagonal states by considering the Bures distance .	Complementing the known corresponding expressions for entanglement and more general quantum correlations , we thus complete the quantitative hierarchy of Bures correlations for Bell-diagonal states .	Finally , we analyse a dynamical model of two independent qubits locally exposed to non-dissipative decoherence channels , where both quantum and classical correlations measured by Bures distance exhibit freezing phenomena , in analogy with other known quantifiers of correlations .
3	In such models , the dark matter can annihilate into other hidden sector particles , which then decay into Standard Model fermions through a small degree of mixing with the photon , Z , or Higgs bosons .	The gamma-ray excess observed from the Galactic Center can be interpreted as dark matter particles annihilating into Standard Model fermions with a cross section near that expected for a thermal relic .	Although many particle physics models have been shown to be able to account for this signal , the fact that this particle has not yet been observed in direct detection experiments somewhat restricts the nature of its interactions .	One way to suppress the dark matter 's elastic scattering cross section with nuclei is to consider models in which the dark matter is part of a hidden sector .	After discussing the gamma-ray signal from hidden sector dark matter in general terms , we consider two concrete realizations : a hidden photon model in which the dark matter annihilates into a pair of vector gauge bosons that decay through kinetic mixing with the photon , and a scenario within the generalized NMSSM in which the dark matter is a singlino-like neutralino that annihilates into a pair of singlet Higgs bosons , which decay through their mixing with the Higgs bosons of the MSSM .
1	The moduli spaces of such models with $ \NF=3 $ quark flavors and $ \NA=1 $ antisymmetric field are analogous to that of SUSY QCD with $ \NF=\NC+1 $ flavors .	We investigate the confining phase vacua of supersymmetric $ Sp ( 2\NC ) $ gauge theories that contain matter in both fundamental and antisymmetric representations .	In particular , the forms of their quantum superpotentials are fixed by classical constraints .	When mass terms are coupled to $ W_ { ( \NF=3 , \NA=1 ) } $ and heavy fields are integrated out , complete towers of dynamically generated superpotentials for low energy theories with fewer numbers of matter fields can be derived .	Following this approach , we deduce exact superpotentials in $ Sp ( 4 ) $ and $ Sp ( 6 ) $ theories which can not be determined by symmetry considerations or integrating in techniques .
1	Under the trend of miniaturization , such quantum electrodynamical effects are expected to play an important role in micro- and nano-mechanical devices .	Quantum fluctuations give rise to van der Waals and Casimir forces that dominate the interaction between electrically neutral objects at sub-micron separations .	Nevertheless , utilization of Casimir forces on the chip level remains a major challenge because all experiments so far require an external object to be manually positioned close to the mechanical element .	Here , by integrating a force-sensing micromechanical beam and an electrostatic actuator on a single chip , we demonstrate the Casimir effect between two micromachined silicon components on the same substrate .	A high degree of parallelism between the two near-planar interacting surfaces can be achieved because they are defined in a single lithographic step .
0	Strongly interacting particles in one dimension subject to external confinement have become a topic of considerable interest due to recent experimental advances and the development of new theoretical methods to attack such systems .	In the case of equal mass fermions or bosons with two or more internal degrees of freedom , one can map the problem onto the well-known Heisenberg spin models .	However , many interesting physical systems contain mixtures of particles with different masses .	Therefore , a generalization of the recent strong-coupling techniques would be highly desirable .	This is particularly important since such problems are generally considered non-integrable and thus the hugely successful Bethe ansatz approach can not be applied .
0	In specular reflection experiments the reflected beam from the end side of thick substrates is typically neglected .	This is equivalent to assuming the substrates as semi-infinite matter .	However , it is known that we should also consider the reflected beam from the end sides .	Here we have investigated the effect of this consideration on the average reflectivity in a completely general case .	It is shown that in some cases , especially in local minima of reflectivity vs. neutron wave number , this consideration can result in high enough differences such that it should be included in the interpretation of measured neutron specular reflectivity .
2	However , none of these measures satisfy all the Granger 's axioms for an `` ideal measure '' .	In data science , it is often required to estimate dependencies between different data sources .	These dependencies are typically calculated using Pearson 's correlation , distance correlation , and/or mutual information .	One such ideal measure , proposed by Granger himself , calculates the Bhattacharyya distance between the joint probability density function ( pdf ) and the product of marginal pdfs .	We call this measure the mutual dependence .
3	One of the key point of this study is the investigation of the time decay properties of the solutions to the 2-D inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system .	The purpose of this paper is to provide a large class of initial data which generates global smooth solution of the 3-D inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes system in the whole space~ $ \R^3 $ .	This class of data is based on functions which vary slowly in one direction .	The idea is that 2-D inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system with large data is globally well-posedness and we construct the 3-D approximate solutions by the 2-D solutions with a parameter .	We obtained the same optimal decay estimates as the solutions of 2-D homogeneous Navier-Stokes system .
3	We report the discovery of 47 new candidate companions of Sco OB2 members .	For understanding the process of star formation it is essential to know how many stars are formed as singles or in multiple systems , as a function of environment and binary parameters .	This requires a characterization of the primordial binary population , which we define as the population of binaries that is present just after star formation has ceased , but before dynamical and stellar evolution have significantly altered its characteristics .	In this article we present the first results of our adaptive optics survey of 200 ( mainly ) A-type stars in the nearby OB association Sco OB2 .	The next step will be to combine these observations with detailed simulations of young star clusters , in order to find the primordial binary population .
1	In this paper , we determine conditions under which such operators satisfy conical square function estimates in a range of $ L^p $ spaces , thus allowing us to apply the theory of Hardy spaces associated with an operator , to prove that they have a bounded holomorphic functional calculus in those $ L^p $ spaces .	Perturbed Hodge-Dirac operators and their holomorphic functional calculi , as investigated in the papers by Axelsson , Keith and the second author , provided insight into the solution of the Kato square-root problem for elliptic operators in $ L^2 $ spaces , and allowed for an extension of these estimates to other systems with applications to non-smooth boundary value problems .	We also obtain functional calculi results for restrictions to certain subspaces , for a larger range of $ p $ .	This provides a framework for obtaining $ L^p $ results on perturbed Hodge Laplacians , generalising known Riesz transform bounds for an elliptic operator $ L $ with bounded measurable coefficients , one Sobolev exponent below the Hodge exponent , and $ L^p $ bounds on the square-root of $ L $ by the gradient , two Sobolev exponents below the Hodge exponent .	Our proof shows that the heart of the harmonic analysis in $ L^2 $ extends to $ L^p $ for all $ p \in ( 1 , \infty ) $ , while the restrictions in $ p $ come from the operator-theoretic part of the $ L^2 $ proof .
4	Crucially , we show that noise measurements can directly verify entanglement generation .	Lorentz invariance requires local interactions , with force laws such as the Coulomb interaction arising via virtual exchange of force carriers such as photons .	Many have considered the possibility that , at long distances or large mass scales , this process changes in some way to lead to classical behavior .	Here we hypothesize that classical behavior could be due to an inability of some force carriers to convey entanglement , a characteristic measure of nonlocal , quantum behavior .	We then prove that there exists a local test that allows one to verify entanglement generation , falsifying our hypothesis .
1	This makes these compounds good candidates for Ce activated scintillator gamma-ray detectors particularly for the hafnate systems which have a very high density .	Lanthanum and yttrium compounds with composition RE2M2O7 ( RE=Y , La ; M = Ti , Zr , Hf ) have high density and high Z and can be doped with Ce onto the La and Y sites .	There is disagreement in the literature concerning La2Hf2O7 : Ce as it has been reported to show both bright as well as no Ce activated luminescence by different experimental groups .	We have performed first-principles electronic structure calculations of these compounds doped with Ce using the pseudopotential method based on the generalized gradient approximation in density functional theory .	The positions of the Ce 4f states relative to the valence band maximum and the position of the Ce 5d states relative to the conduction band minimum ( CBM ) of the host material are determined .
4	The first gives an asymptotic answer to the question : `` what is the minimum number of non-basis-preserving gates required to generate a good approximation to a given state '' .	We propose an approach for quantifying a quantum circuit 's quantumness as a means to understand the nature of quantum algorithmic speedups .	Since quantum gates that do not preserve the computational basis are necessary for achieving quantum speedups , it appears natural to define the quantumness of a quantum circuit using the number of such gates .	Intuitively , a reduction in the quantumness requires an increase in the amount of classical computation , hence giving a `` quantum and classical tradeoff '' .	In this paper we present two results on this direction .
4	Numerical simulations reveal that this zero-frequency undulation suppresses the instability when its spatial extension is infinite , and when its phase is near that of a `` shadow soliton '' solution attached to the sonic horizon .	We analyze the peculiar infrared instability that characterizes stationary inhomogeneous flows when their velocity crosses the sound speed by decreasing values .	For definiteness , we work in the context of one dimensional atomic Bose condensates .	These flows are unstable under ultra low real frequency perturbations because of the unbounded mode amplification near the sonic horizon .	This results in a condensation of low frequency phonons which produces a spatially structured flow in the supersonic domain .
1	In neutrino free matter at zero temperature , color neutrality guarantees that the number densities of u , d , and s quarks in the Color-Flavor-Locked ( CFL ) phase will be equal even with physical current quark masses .	We investigate the consequences of enforcing local color neutrality on the color superconducting phases of quark matter by utilizing the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model supplemented by diquark and the t'Hooft six-fermion interactions .	Electric charge neutrality follows as a consequence and without the presence of electrons .	In contrast , electric charge neutrality in the less symmetric 2-flavor superconducting ( 2SC ) phase with ud pairing requires more electrons than the normal quark phase .	The free energy density cost of enforcing color and electric charge neutrality in the CFL phase is lower than that in the 2SC phase , which favors the formation of the CFL phase .
3	We compute the evolution of the curvature perturbation and show that the primordial power spectrum follows a broken power law with an oscillation feature .	The conventional slow-roll approximation is broken in the so called `` ultra slow-roll '' models of inflation , for which the inflaton potential is exactly ( or extremely ) flat .	The interesting nature of ( canonical ) ultra slow-roll inflation is that the curvature perturbation grows on superhorizon scales , but has a scale-invariant power spectrum .	We study the ultra slow-roll inflationary dynamics in the presence of non-canonical kinetic terms of the scalar field , namely ultra slow-roll G-inflation .	It is demonstrated that this could explain the lack of large-scale power in the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies .
4	The results are compared to the analogous results found for a sample of light quark ( uds ) jets , also defined inclusively .	Gluon jets are identified in e+e- hadronic annihilation events by tagging two quark jets in the same hemisphere of an event .	The gluon jet is defined inclusively as all the particles in the opposite hemisphere .	Gluon jets defined in this manner have a close correspondence to gluon jets as they are defined for analytic calculations , and are almost independent of a jet finding algorithm .	The charged particle multiplicity distribution of the gluon jets is presented , and is analyzed for its mean , dispersion , skew , and curtosis values , and for its factorial and cumulant moments .
2	Implementations of extended quantifier elimination via virtual substitution have been successfully applied to various problems in science and engineering .	We consider existential problems over the reals .	Extended quantifier elimination generalizes the concept of regular quantifier elimination by providing in addition answers , which are descriptions of possible assignments for the quantified variables .	So far , the answers produced by these implementations included infinitesimal and infinite numbers , which are hard to interpret in practice .	We introduce here a post-processing procedure to convert , for fixed parameters , all answers into standard real numbers .
0	In this paper we introduce the concept of metasurfaces which are fully transparent when looking from one of the two sides of the sheet and have controllable functionalities for waves hitting the opposite side ( one-way transparent sheets ) .	We address the question on what functionalities are allowed , considering limitations due to reciprocity and passivity .	In particular , we have found that it is possible to realize one-way transparent sheets which have the properties of a twist-polarizer in reflection or transmission when illuminated from the other side .	Also one-way transparent sheets with controllable co-polarized reflection and transmission from the opposite side are feasible .	We show that particular non-reciprocal magneto-electric coupling inside the sheet is necessary to realize lossless non-active transparent sheets .
1	These cells exhibit strain softening behavior under compression , which can be tuned by modifying their geometrical configurations or initial folded conditions .	We investigate the nonlinear wave dynamics of origami-based metamaterials composed of Tachi-Miura polyhedron ( TMP ) unit cells .	We assemble these TMP cells into a cluster of origami-based metamaterials , and we theoretically model and numerically analyze their wave transmission mechanism under external impact .	Numerical simulations show that origami-based metamaterials can provide a prototypical platform for the formation of nonlinear coherent structures in the form of rarefaction waves , which feature a tensile wavefront upon the application of compression to the system .	We also demonstrate the existence of numerically exact traveling rarefaction waves .
4	Their minimal rank increases with increasing of $ N $ .	We consider Dirac monopoles embedded into SU ( N ) gauge theory with theta-term for $ \theta = 4\pi M $ ( where $ M $ is half-integer for $ N = 2 $ and is integer for $ N & gt ; 2 $ ) .	Due to the theta - term those monopoles obtain the SU ( N ) charge and become the dyons .	They belong to different irreducible representations of SU ( N ) ( but not to all of them ) .	The admitted representations are enumerated .
3	These patterns determine the behaviour of plasma .	A fast and efficient numerical-analytical approach is proposed for description of complex behaviour in non-equilibrium ensembles in the BBGKY framework .	We construct the multiscale representation for hierarchy of partition functions by means of the variational approach and multiresolution decomposition .	Numerical modeling shows the creation of various internal structures from fundamental localized ( eigen ) modes .	The localized pattern ( waveleton ) is a model for energy confinement state ( fusion ) in plasma .
1	This 1+1 dimensional field theory may be viewed as the `` standard model '' for studying black hole physics .	We give a Hamiltonian analysis of the asymptotically flat spherically symmetric system of gravity coupled to a scalar field .	Our analysis is adapted to the flat slice Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates .	We give a Hamiltonian action principle for this system , which yields an asymptotic mass formula .	We then perform a time gauge fixing that gives a Hamiltonian as the integral of a local density .
2	Probabilistic interconvertability is used to define an equivalence relation between gates .	We study when a non -- local unitary operation acting on two $ d $ -- level systems can probabilistically simulate another one when arbitrary local operations and classical communication are allowed .	We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the simulation to be possible .	We show that this relation induces a finite number of classes , that we identify .	In the case of two qubits , two classes of non -- local operations exist .
1	Simulations on empirical complex networks reveal two specific regimes of disease spreading : local containment and epidemic outbreak .	The disease spreading on complex networks is studied in SIR model .	The variables measuring the extent of disease spreading are in general characterized by a bimodal probability distribution .	Phase diagrams of disease spreading for empirical complex networks are introduced .	A theoretical model of disease spreading on m-ary tree is investigated both analytically and in simulations .
3	Overall shape of the L-dwarf spectra is governed by the K I + Na I resonance line wings of the huge strength .	Theoretical aspects of modeling of spectra of late M- and L-dwarfs are discussed .	We show , that the processes of formation of spectra of M- and L-dwarfs are basically different .	Instead of the case of M-dwarfs , atoms of Ti and V should be depleted into grains in the atmospheres of L-dwarfs .	To fit lithium lines observed in spectra of the coolest dwarfs we used two additional suggestions : a ) there are some EXTRA depletions of molecular species absorbed in the optical spectra of L-dwarfs ; b ) there may be ( a few ? )
4	We adopt up-to-date cosmological evolution models of extragalactic sources able to fit well the new data on high-frequency radio surveys and we discuss our current results on point source detection by comparing them with those obtained using the Mexican Hat Wavelet ( MHW ) technique , which has been already proven a suitable tool for detecting point sources .	We propose a new detection technique in the plane based on an isotropic wavelet family .	This family is naturally constructed as an extension of the Gaussian-Mexican Hat Wavelet pair and for that reason we call it the Mexican Hat Wavelet Family ( MHWF ) .	We show the performance of these wavelets when dealing with the detection of extragalactic point sources in cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) maps : a very important issue within the most general problem of the component separation of the microwave sky .	Specifically , flat two-dimensional simulations of the microwave sky comprising all astrophysical components plus instrumental noise have been analyzed for the channels at 30 , 44 and 70 GHz of the forthcoming ESA 's Planck mission Low Frequency Instrument ( LFI ) .
3	Acceleration and propagation effects lead to an observed composition that is different from the one at the source .	The simple interpretation of PAO 's UHECRs ' penetration depth measurements suggests a transition at the energy range $ 1.1 - 35 \cdot 10^ { 18 } $ eV from protons to heavier nuclei .	A detailed comparison of this data with air shower simulations reveals strong restrictions on the amount of light nuclei ( protons and He ) in the observed flux .	We find a robust upper bound on the observed proton fraction of the UHECRs flux and we rule out a composition dominated by protons and He .	Using a simple toy model that take into account these effects , we show that the observations requires an extreme metallicity at the sources with metals to protons mass ratio of 1:1 , a ratio that is larger by a factor of a hundred than the solar abundance .
3	An important role in this paper is played by a class of noncommutative cones associated with positive linear maps , the Fourier type representation of their elements , and the constrained noncommutative Berezin transforms associated with these elements .	In this paper we consider several problems of joint similarity to tuples of bounded linear operators in noncommutative polydomains and varieties associated with sets of noncommutative polynomials .	We obtain analogues of classical results such as Rota 's model theorem for operators with spectral radius less than one , Sz.-Nagy characterization of operators similar to isometries ( or unitary operators ) , and the refinement obtained by Foia\c s and by de Branges and Rovnyak for strongly stable contractions .	We also provide analogues of these results in the context of joint similarity of commuting tuples of positive linear maps on the algebra of bounded linear operators on a separable Hilbert space .	It is shown that there is a intimate relation between the similarity problems and the existence of positive invertible elements in these noncommutative cones and the corresponding Berezin kernels .
3	This scale dependence has significant consequences for the extraction of the first moment from the experimental data , reducing its value while increasing the error .	We discuss perturbative evolution of the polarized structure function g_1 in the ( x , Q^2 ) plane , with special regard to the small-x region .	We determine g_1 in terms of polarized quark and gluon distributions using coefficient functions to order alpha_s .	At small x g_1 then displays substantial scale dependence , which necessarily implies a corresponding scale dependence in the large-x region .	Conversely , the scale dependence may be used to constrain the size of the polarized gluon distribution .
4	The graphs for which q ( G ) is at least the number of vertices of G less one are characterized .	For a given graph G and an associated class of real symmetric matrices whose off-diagonal entries are governed by the adjacencies in G , the collection of all possible spectra for such matrices is considered .	Building on the pioneering work of Colin de Verdiere in connection with the Strong Arnold Property , two extensions are devised that target a better understanding of all possible spectra and their associated multiplicities .	These new properties are referred to as the Strong Spectral Property and the Strong Multiplicity Property .	Finally , these ideas are applied to the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues associated with G , denoted by q ( G ) .
1	Here , we propose and analyze a controlled-phase ( CPHASE ) gate for the spins of two NV centers embedded in a common optical cavity and driven by two off-resonant lasers .	While long spin coherence times and efficient single-qubit quantum control have been implemented successfully in nitrogen-vacancy ( NV ) centers in diamond , the controlled coupling of remote NV spin qubits remains challenging .	In combination with previously demonstrated single-qubit gates , CPHASE allows for arbitrary quantum computations .	The coupling of the NV spin to the cavity mode is based upon Raman transitions via the NV excited states and can be controlled with the laser intensities and relative phase .	We find characteristic laser frequencies at which a laser photon is only scattered into the cavity mode if the NV center spin is $ |m_s=0\rangle $ , and not in the case $ |m_s=-1\rangle $ , or vice versa .
1	The abstract model that is developed is easily adapted to any particular field .	A model is developed to study the effectiveness of innovation and its impact on structure creation and structure change on agent-based societies .	In any interacting environment , the agents receive something from the environment ( the other agents ) in exchange for their effort and pay the environment a certain amount of value for the fulfilling of their needs or for the very price of existence in that environment .	This is coded by two bit strings and the dynamics of the exchange is based on the matching of these strings to those of the other agents .	Innovation is related to the adaptation by the agents of their bit strings to improve some utility function .
1	We use large , hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project to investigate the effect of feedback from galaxy formation on the probability distribution function and the power spectrum of the Lyman-alpha transmitted flux .	The forest of Lyman-alpha absorption lines seen in the spectra of distant quasars has become an important probe of the distribution of matter in the Universe .	While metal-line cooling is unimportant , both galactic outflows from massive galaxies driven by active galactic nuclei and winds from low-mass galaxies driven by supernovae have a substantial impact on the flux statistics .	At redshift z=2.25 , the effects on the flux statistics are of a similar magnitude as the statistical uncertainties of published data sets .	The changes in the flux statistics are not due to differences in the temperature-density relation of the photo-ionised gas .
3	The sample contains O -- M , long-period variable ( LPV ) , C and S stars .	We present the first release of XSL , the X-Shooter Spectral Library .	This release contains 237 stars spanning the wavelengths 3000 -- 10200 \AA\ observed at a resolving power $ R \equiv \lambda / \Delta\lambda \sim 10000 $ .	The spectra were obtained at ESO 's 8-m Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) .	The spectra are flux-calibrated and telluric-corrected .
2	We optimized the structure in both phases and in all different magnetic states to explore the possibility of the structural and magnetic phase transitions at ground state .	Using first-principles density functional calculations , we study the possible phases of CeMnNi $ _ { 4 } $ and show that the ground state is ferromagnetic .	We observed the hexagonal phase to be lowest in energy whereas experimentally observed cubic phase lies slightly higher in energy .	We do not find any phase transitions between the magnetic and non-magnetic phases .	The calculated structural , magnetic properties of cubic phase are in excellent agreement with experiments .
3	Characterizations of Steiner and Minkowski symmetrization , in terms of natural properties that they enjoy , are given and examples are provided to show that none of the assumptions made can be dropped or significantly weakened .	The concept of an $ i $ -symmetrization is introduced , which provides a convenient framework for most of the familiar symmetrization processes on convex sets .	Various properties of $ i $ -symmetrizations are introduced and the relations between them investigated .	New expressions are provided for the Steiner and Minkowski symmetrals of a compact convex set which exhibit a dual relationship between them .	Other familiar symmetrizations , such as Schwarz symmetrization , are discussed and several new ones introduced .
1	It hosts several outflows , including broad-line winds , radio jets , and a poorly-understood kpc scale outflow .	The quasi-stellar object ( QSO ) /merger Mrk 231 is arguably the nearest and best laboratory for studying QSO feedback .	In this Letter , we present integral field spectroscopy from the Gemini telescope that represents the first unambiguous detection of a wide-angle , kpc scale outflow from a powerful QSO .	Using neutral gas absorption , we show that the nuclear region hosts an outflow with blueshifted velocities reaching 1100 km/s , extending 2-3 kpc from the nucleus in all directions in the plane of the sky .	A radio jet impacts the outflow north of the nucleus , accelerating it to even higher velocities ( up to 1400 km/s ) .
0	DNA Copy number variation ( CNV ) has recently gained considerable interest as a source of genetic variation that likely influences phenotypic differences .	Many statistical and computational methods have been proposed and applied to detect CNVs based on data that generated by genome analysis platforms .	However , most algorithms are computationally intensive with complexity at least $ O ( n^2 ) $ , where $ n $ is the number of probes in the experiments .	Moreover , the theoretical properties of those existing methods are not well understood .	A faster and better characterized algorithm is desirable for the ultra high throughput data .
1	We show that the recent computation of the soft-virtual corrections to Higgs boson production at N $ ^3 $ LO [ 1 ] together with the universality structure of soft-gluon emission can be exploited to extract the general expression of the hard-virtual coefficient that contributes to threshold resummation at N $ ^3 $ LL accuracy .	We consider QCD radiative corrections to the production of colourless high-mass systems in hadron collisions .	The hard-virtual coefficient is directly related to the process-dependent virtual amplitude through a universal ( process-independent ) factorization formula that we explicitly evaluate up to three-loop order .	As an application , we present the explicit expression of the soft-virtual N $ ^3 $ LO corrections for the production of an arbitrary colourless system .	In the case of the Drell-Yan process , we confirm the recent result of Ref . [ 2 ] .
1	The factorization proof is not trivial because various kinds of divergences are intertwined in the collinear and soft parts at high orders .	We consider the structure of divergences in Drell-Yan process with small transverse momentum .	We prescribe a method to disentangle the divergences in the framework of the soft-collinear effective theory .	The rapidity divergence is handled by introducing the $ \delta $ regulator in the collinear Wilson lines .	The collinear part , which consists of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function ( TMDPDF ) , is free of the rapidity divergence after the soft zero-bin subtraction .
1	A common and intuitive interpretation of this result is that the spontaneous emission rate is proportional to the probability that the electron and the hole are located at the same point or region in space , i.e.they must coincide spatially to recombine .	The spontaneous emission rate of excitons strongly confined in quantum dots is proportional to the overlap integral of electron and hole envelope wave functions .	Here we show that this interpretation is not correct even loosely speaking .	By general mathematical considerations we compare the envelope wave function overlap , the exchange overlap integral , and the probability of electrons and holes coinciding and find that the frequency dependence of the envelope wave function overlap integral is very different from that expected from the common interpretation .	We show that these theoretical considerations lead to predictions for measurements .
4	It is also shown that the force between two non-BPS vortices is repulsive .	Moduli space dynamics of multi-D-vortices from D2 $ { \bar { \rm D } } $ ( equivalently , parallel straight D-strings from D3 $ { \bar { \rm D } } $ 3 ) is systematically studied .	For the BPS D-vortices , we show through exact calculations that the classical motion of randomly-distributed $ n $ D-vortices is governed by a relativistic Lagrangian of free massive point-particles .	When the head-on collision of two identical BPS D-vortices of zero radius is considered , it predicts either 90 $ { } ^ { \circ } $ scattering or 0 $ { } ^ { \circ } $ scattering equivalent to 180 $ { } ^ { \circ } $ scattering .	Since the former leads to a reconnection of two identical D-strings and the latter does to a case of their passing through each other , two possibilities are consistent with the prediction of string theory .
4	Try it on your computer algebra systems !	Most computer algebra systems incorrectly simplify ( z - z ) / ( sqrt ( w^2 ) /w^3 - 1/ ( w*sqrt ( w^2 ) ) ) to 0 rather than to 0/0 .	The reasons for this are : 1 .	The default simplification does n't succeed in simplifying the denominator to 0.2 .	There is a rule that 0 is the result of 0 divided by anything that does n't simplify to either 0 or 0/0 .
3	For large input dimension the parameter trajectory of both algorithms passes through a sequence of unstable fixed points , each described by a diffusion process in a polynomial potential .	The learning dynamics of on-line independent component analysis is analysed in the limit of large data dimension .	We study a simple Hebbian learning algorithm that can be used to separate out a small number of non-Gaussian components from a high-dimensional data set .	The de-mixing matrix parameters are confined to a Stiefel manifold of tall , orthogonal matrices and we introduce a natural gradient variant of the algorithm which is appropriate to learning on this manifold .	Choosing the learning rate too large increases the escape time from each of these fixed points , effectively trapping the learning in a sub-optimal state .
4	The spectrum of the massive modes of the fluctuations is analyzed using supersymmetric quantum mechanics .	A generalization of the Bardeen formalism to the case of warped geometries is presented .	The system determining the gauge-invariant fluctuations of the metric induced by the scalar fluctuations of the brane is reduced to a set of Schr\ '' odinger-like equations for the Bardeen potentials and for the canonical normal modes of the scalar-tensor action .	Scalar , vector and tensor modes of the geometry are classified according to four-dimensional Lorentz transformations .	While the tensor modes of the geometry live on the brane determining the corrections to Newton law , the scalar and and vector fluctuations exhibit non normalizable zero modes and are , consequently , not localized on the brane .
3	We use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of F and G dwarfs from the Geneva-Copehnagen Survey ( GCS ) to infer the mean metallicity of M dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood , we use theoretical models of M dwarf interiors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on M dwarfs in the V-K_s -- M_Ks CMD , and we base our final calibration purely on high-resolution spectroscopy of FGK primaries with M dwarf companions .	The location of M dwarfs in the V-K_s -- M_Ks color-magnitude diagram ( CMD ) has been shown to correlate with metallicity .	We demonstrate that previous empirical photometric calibrations of M dwarf metallicity exploiting this correlation systematically underestimate or overestimate metallicity at the extremes of their range .	We improve upon previous calibrations in three ways .	As a result , we explain an order of magnitude more of the variance in the calibration sample than previous photometric calibrations .
4	These formulas are compared with the direct expansion of the full results for free compactified boson and Ising model .	We continue the study of the entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals in conformal field theories that we started in J . Stat.Mech . ( 2009 ) P11001 .	We compute Tr\rho_A^n for any integer n for the Ising universality class and the final result is expressed as a sum of Riemann-Siegel theta functions .	These predictions are checked against existing numerical data .	We provide a systematic method that gives the full asymptotic expansion of the scaling function for small four-point ratio ( i.e.short intervals ) .
1	The scheme is based on a set partitioning of the Golden Code using two-sided ideals whose norm is a power of two .	In this paper we present a block coded modulation scheme for a 2 x 2 MIMO system over slow fading channels , where the inner code is the Golden Code .	In this case , a lower bound for the minimum determinant is given by the minimum Hamming distance .	The description of the ring structure of the quotients suggests further optimization in order to improve the overall distribution of determinants .	Performance simulations show that the GC-RS schemes achieve a significant gain over the uncoded Golden Code .
3	The present paper , relying on the recently obtained noncommutativity effect on a static , spherically symmetric metric , considers from a new perspective the quantum amplitudes in black hole evaporation .	Recent work in the literature has studied the quantum-mechanical decay of a Schwarzschild-like black hole , formed by gravitational collapse , into almost-flat space-time and weak radiation at a very late time .	The relevant quantum amplitudes have been evaluated for bosonic and fermionic fields , showing that no information is lost in collapse to a black hole .	On the other hand , recent developments in noncommutative geometry have shown that , in general relativity , the effects of noncommutativity can be taken into account by keeping the standard form of the Einstein tensor on the left-hand side of the field equations and introducing a modified energy-momentum tensor as a source on the right-hand side .	The general relativity analysis of spin-2 amplitudes is shown to be modified by a multiplicative factor F depending on a constant non-commutativity parameter and on the upper limit R of the radial coordinate .
3	In particular the tails of the distributions are very well reproduced .	The Convolution and Master equations governing the time behavior of the term structure of Interest Rates are set up both for continuous variables and for their discretised forms .	The notion of Seed is introduced .	The discretised theoretical distributions matching the empirical data from the Federal Reserve System ( FRS ) are deduced from a discretised seed which enjoys remarkable scaling laws .	These results may be used to develop new methods for the computation of the value-at-risk and fixed-income derivative pricing .
0	Recent observations of non-thermal X-rays from supernova remnants have been attributed to synchrotron radiation from the loss-steepened tail of a non-thermal distribution of electrons accelerated at the remnant blast wave .	In diffusive shock acceleration , the maximum particle energy depends on the energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient kappa .	Most work on shock acceleration has made the plausible assumption that kappa is proportional to the particle gyroradius , implying a wavelength-independent spectrum of MHD turbulence , where Kolmogorov or Kraichnan spectra might be more physically plausible .	I derive the wave-spectrum-dependence of the maximum electron energy resulting from limitations due to radiative ( synchrotron and inverse-Compton ) losses and to finite remnant age ( or size ) .	I then exhibit calculations of synchrotron X-ray spectra , and model images , for supernova remnants as a function of spectrum , and compare to earlier results .
3	Resonant luminescence experiments allowed determining the oscillator strength ratio of the two exciton eigenstates .	We investigate polarization properties of neutral exciton emission in single self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots .	The in-plane shape and strain anisotropy strongly couple the heavy and light hole states and lead to large optical anisotropy with non-orthogonal linearly polarized states misaligned with respect to the crystallographic axes .	Owing to a waveguiding experimental configuration , luminescence polarization along the growth axis has been observed revealing the presence of shear components of the deformation tensor out of the growth plane .	Valence band mixing governs this ratio and can be very different from dot to dot , however the polarization anisotropy axis is quite fixed inside a scanned area of one \mum^ { 2 } and indicates that the in-plane deformation direction to which it is related has a correlation length of the order of magnitude of one \mum^ { 2 } .
4	Testing and reliability are aided by built-in logic state analysis and test-data sourcing at each board 's input and output , a common inter-board data link , and a universal `` Merger '' board for data fan-in/fan-out .	The CDF experiment 's Silicon Vertex Trigger is a system of 150 custom 9U VME boards that reconstructs axial tracks in the CDF silicon strip detector in a 15 microsecond pipeline .	SVT 's 35 micron impact parameter resolution enables CDF 's Level 2 trigger to distinguish primary and secondary particles , and hence to collect large samples of hadronic bottom and charm decays .	We review some of SVT 's key design features .	Speed is achieved with custom VLSI pattern recognition , linearized track fitting , pipelining , and parallel processing .
4	If in addition K is algebraically closed , then this condition implies that the center is a fusion category , so that we recover M\ '' uger 's result .	M\ '' uger proved in 2003 that the center of a spherical fusion category C of non-zero dimension over an algebraically closed field is a modular fusion category whose dimension is the square of that of C. We generalize this theorem to a pivotal fusion category C over an arbitrary commutative ring K , without any condition on the dimension of the category .	( In this generalized setting , modularity is understood as 2-modularity in the sense of Lyubashenko . )	Our proof is based on an explicit description of the Hopf algebra structure of the coend of the center of C. Moreover we show that the dimension of C is invertible in K if and only if any object of the center of C is a retract of a `free ' half-braiding .	As a consequence , if K is a field , then the center of C is semisimple ( as an abelian category ) if and only if the dimension of C is non-zero .
3	It has as corollary a summation formula of Slater .	Euler 's transformation formula for the Gauss hypergeometric function 2F1 is extended to hypergeometric functions of higher order .	Unusually , the generalized transformation constrains the hypergeometric function parameters algebraically but not linearly .	Its consequences for hypergeometric summation are explored .	From this formula new one-term evaluations of 2F1 ( -1 ) and 3F2 ( 1 ) are derived , by applying transformations in the Thomae group .
3	The neutron and proton drip lines have been predicted using this extended Bethe-Weizsacker mass formula .	Proton and neutron separation energies have been calculated using the extended Bethe-Weizsacker mass formula .	This modified Bethe-Weizsacker mass formula describes minutely the positions of all the old and the new magic numbers .	It accounts for the disappearance of some traditional magic numbers for neutrons and provides extra stability for some new neutron numbers .	The implications of the proton drip line on the astrophysical rp-process and of the neutron drip line on the astrophysical r-process have been discussed .
1	An important example is the mixture Kalman filter , but other models and algorithms of practical interest fall in this category .	Several particle algorithms admit a Feynman-Kac representation such that the potential function may be expressed as a recursive function which depends on the complete state trajectory .	We study the asymptotic stability of such particle algorithms as time goes to infinity .	As a corollary , practical conditions for the stability of the mixture Kalman filter , and a mixture GARCH filter , are derived .	Finally , we show that our results can also lead to weaker conditions for the stability of standard particle algorithms , such that the potential function depends on the last state only .
0	We propose a generalization of the topological vertex , which we call the `` non-commutative topological vertex '' .	This gives open BPS invariants for a toric Calabi-Yau manifold without compact 4-cycles , where we have D0/D2/D6-branes wrapping holomorphic 0/2/6-cycles , as well as D2-branes wrapping disks whose boundaries are on D4-branes wrapping non-compact Lagrangian 3-cycles .	The vertex is defined combinatorially using the crystal melting model proposed recently , and depends on the value of closed string moduli at infinity .	The vertex in one special chamber gives the same answer as that computed by the ordinary topological vertex .	We prove an identify expressing the non-commutative topological vertex of a toric Calabi-Yau manifold X as a specialization of the closed BPS partition function of an orbifold of X , thus giving a closed expression for our vertex .
2	Its thermodynamics is consistently established , with the extreme cases and phase transitions , where the analysis is performed through two methods , the usual one and that of Geometrothermodynamics .	We obtain a new solution of the Einstein-anti-Maxwell theory with cosmological constant , called anti-Reissner-Nordstrom- ( A ) de Sitter ( anti-RN- ( A ) dS ) solution .	The basic properties of this solution is reviewed .	The Geometrothermodynamics analysis does not provide a result in agreement with the usual method or by the specific heat .	We establish local and global thermodynamic stabilities of anti-RN-AdS solution through the specific heat and the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles .
4	An inexpensive line search is then employed to ensure a monotonic decrease in the objective function and acceptance of large step sizes .	In this paper we present a novel randomized block coordinate descent method for the minimization of a convex composite objective function .	The method uses ( approximate ) partial second-order ( curvature ) information , so that the algorithm performance is more robust when applied to highly nonseparable or ill conditioned problems .	We call the method Robust Coordinate Descent ( RCD ) .	At each iteration of RCD , a block of coordinates is sampled randomly , a quadratic model is formed about that block and the model is minimized approximately/inexactly to determine the search direction .
1	We found the photometric redshifts of the two main arc systems are both at z=1.6 .	We reanalyze the strong lens modeling of the cluster of galaxies MS2137-23 using a new data set obtained with the ESO VLT .	After subtraction of the central cD star light of the HST image we found that only one object lying underneath has the expected properties of the fifth image associated to the tangential arc .	We improve the previous lens modelings of the central dark matter distribution of the cluster , using an isothermal model with a core ( IS ) and the NFW-like model with a cusp .	Without the fifth image , the arc properties together with the shear map profile are equally well fit by the and by an IS and a sub-class of generalized-NFW mass profiles having inner slope power index in the range 0.7 & lt ; alpha & lt ; 1.2 .
3	We also propose a statistical model for spike trains that exhibits the variance-to-mean power relationship , and based on this a maximum likelihood method is developed for inferring the parameters from rate-modulated spike trains .	We propose a statistical method for modeling the non-Poisson variability of spike trains observed in a wide range of brain regions .	Central to our approach is the assumption that the variance and the mean of interspike intervals are related by a power function characterized by two parameters : the scale factor and exponent .	It is shown that this single assumption allows the variability of spike trains to have an arbitrary scale and various dependencies on the firing rate in the spike count statistics , as well as in the interval statistics , depending on the two parameters of the power function .	The proposed method is illustrated on simulated and experimental spike trains .
2	However , the computing technologies that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystems research .	A primary motivation for our research in digital ecosystems is the desire to exploit the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems .	Ecosystems are thought to be robust , scalable architectures that can automatically solve complex , dynamic problems .	Here , we discuss how different computing technologies can contribute to providing the necessary self-organising features , including Multi-Agent Systems , Service-Oriented Architectures , and distributed evolutionary computing .	The potential for exploiting these properties in digital ecosystems is considered , suggesting how several key features of biological ecosystems can be exploited in Digital Ecosystems , and discussing how mimicking these features may assist in developing robust , scalable self-organising architectures .
2	A plausible option , which does not rely on supersymmetry , is that the Higgs in fact has a much larger tree level quartic coupling than in the Standard Model , which is possible with an extended scalar sector .	Light , electrically charged vector-like `leptons ' with order one Yukawa couplings can enhance the Higgs to diphoton decay rate , as is suggested by measurements of the signal strength \mu_ { \gamma\gamma } by ATLAS and CMS .	However , the large Yukawa interactions tend to drive the Higgs quartic coupling negative at a low scale \Lambda & lt ; 10 TeV , and as such new physics is required to stabilize the electroweak vacuum .	We investigate in detail the minimal model with a new real singlet scalar which condenses and mixes with the Higgs .	The mechanism is very efficient when the singlet is heavier than the weak scale m_s ~ O ( TeV ) , in which case the vacuum can be stable and the couplings can be perturbative up to scales \Lambda ~ 10^9 GeV while \mu_ { \gamma\gamma } = 1.7 .
2	We show that there is a region $ \Omega\subseteq ( 0,2\pi ) \times R^+ $ such that there exists at least one local minimizer of the Lagrangian action functional on the path space satisfying SPBC $ \ { q ( t ) \in H^1 ( [ 0 , T ] , $ $ ( \mathbf { R } ^2 ) ^4 ) | $ $ q ( 0 ) \in $ $ \mathbf { A } , q ( T ) \in $ $ \mathbf { B } \ } $ for any $ ( \theta , \mu ) \in \Omega $ .	In this paper , we apply the variational method with the Structural Prescribed Boundary Conditions ( SPBC ) to prove the existence of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions for planar four-body problem with $ m_1=m_3 $ and $ m_2=m_4 $ .	A path $ q ( t ) $ in $ [ 0 , T ] $ satisfies SPBC if the boundaries $ q ( 0 ) \in \mathbf { A } $ and $ q ( T ) \in \mathbf { B } $ , where $ \mathbf { A } $ and $ \mathbf { B } $ are two structural configuration spaces in $ ( \mathbf { R } ^2 ) ^4 $ and they depend on a rotation angle $ \theta\in ( 0,2\pi ) $ and the mass ratio $ \mu=\frac { m_2 } { m_1 } \in \mathbf { R } ^+ $ .	The corresponding minimizing path of the minimizer can be extended to a non-homographic periodic solution if $ \theta $ is commensurable with $ \pi $ or a quasi-periodic solution if $ \theta $ is not commensurable with $ \pi $ .	In the variational method with SPBC , we only impose constraints on boundary and we do not impose any symmetry constraint on solutions .
1	Several interpretations have been formulated for this magnetic spacetime .	The three -- dimensional magnetic solution to the Einstein -- Maxwell field equations have been considered by some authors .	Up to now this solution has been considered as a two -- parameter self -- consistent field .	We point out that the parameter related to the mass of this solution is just a pure gauge and can be rescaled to minus one .	This implies that the magnetic metric has really a simple form and it is effectively one-parameter solution , which describes a distribution of a radial magnetic field in a 2+1 anti -- de Sitter background space -- time .
0	We give a useful new characterization of the set of all completely positive , trace-preserving ( i.e. , stochastic ) maps from 2x2 matrices to 2x2 matrices .	These conditions allow one to easily check any trace-preserving map for complete positivity .	We also determine explicitly all extreme points of this set , and give a useful parameterization after reduction to a certain canonical form .	This allows a detailed examination of an important class of non-unital extreme points which can be characterized as having exactly two images on the Bloch sphere .	We also discuss a number of related issues about the images and the geometry of the set of stochastic maps , and show that any stochastic map on 2x2 matrices can be written as a convex combination of two `` generalized '' extreme points .
0	The structure of a biological population affects the outcome of evolutionary processes .	Understanding evolution in structured populations is difficult .	Precise results have been absent for a long time , but have recently emerged for the special case where each individual has the same number of neighbors .	But the general problem of determining natural selection , when the number of neighbors varies , has remained open .	For arbitrary selection intensity , the problem is in a computational complexity class which suggests there is no efficient algorithm .
2	Estimates from a variety of simulated setups are obtained and the observed features compared with experimental results to verify to which extent they are correctly described by this method .	Monte Carlo simulations are powerful tools for understanding the effects of radiation interactions within detector devices allowing not only to evaluate typical estimates for experimental measurements and to serve as means for designing experiments but to provide additional information that are usually not easily accessible experimentally .	A simple numerical approach to describe the functioning of pixelated detectors is presented in this paper .	Fundamental curves such as interaction probability and reconstructed energy deposited are calculated as function of beam energy .	Pixel response , charge sharing effects and resolution estimates are also obtained .
1	We give a necessary and sufficient condition for skew semi-invariant submanifold of order 1 to be a locally warped product .	We introduce warped product skew semi-invariant submanifolds of order $ 1 $ of a locally product Riemannian manifold .	We also prove that the invariant distribution which is involved in the definition of the submanifold is integrable under some restrictions .	Moreover , we find an inequality between the warping function and the squared norm of the second fundamental form for such submanifolds .	Equality case is also discussed .
1	The experiments were perfomed on a 18 nm thick TiN film with a critical temperature of 3.4 K. Measurements were carried out from room temperature down to 2 K , and in magnetic fields up to 7 T. We extract the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity as a function of frequency and temperature , directly providing the superconducting energy gap .	We report on the charge carrier dynamics of superconducting titanium nitride ( TiN ) in the frequency range 90 - 510 GHz ( 3 - 17 cm-1 ) .	Further analysis yields the superconducting London penetration depth .	The findings as well as the normal state properties strongly suggest conventional BCS superconductivity , underlined by the BCS ratio 3.44 .	Detailed analysis of the charge carrier dynamics of the silicon substrate is also discussed .
3	The lack of strict numerical convergence from these idealized configurations suggest that quantitative predictions of the ejected elemental abundances that are generated by binary white dwarf collision and merger simulations should be viewed with caution .	We systematically explore zero impact parameter collisions of white dwarfs with the Eulerian adaptive grid code FLASH for 0.64+0.64 M $ _ { \odot } $ and 0.81+0.81 M $ _ { \odot } $ mass pairings .	Our models span a range of effective linear spatial resolutions from 5.2 $ \times10^ { 7 } $ to 1.2 $ \times10^ { 7 } $ cm .	However , even the highest resolution models do not quite achieve strict numerical convergence , due to the challenge of properly resolving small-scale burning and energy transport .	Nevertheless , the convergence trends do allow some patterns to be discerned .
2	We study in particular ( i ) the effect of mismatches on the hybridization of complementary strands ( ii ) the hybridization of non complementary strands ( as resulting from point mutations ) of unequal lengths $ N_ { 1 } $ and $ N_ { 2 } $ .	The Poland-Scheraga ( PS ) model for the helix-coil transition of DNA considers the statistical mechanics of the binding ( or hybridization ) of two complementary strands of DNA of equal length , with the restriction that only bases with the same index along the strands are allowed to bind .	In this paper , we extend this model by relaxing these constraints : We propose a generalization of the PS model which allows for the binding of two strands of unequal lengths $ N_ { 1 } $ and $ N_ { 2 } $ with unrelated sequences .	The use of a Fixman-Freire scheme scales down the computational complexity of our algorithm from $ O ( N_ { 1 } ^ { 2 } N_ { 2 } ^ { 2 } ) $ to $ O ( N_ { 1 } N_ { 2 } ) $ .The simulation of complementary strands of a few kbps yields results almost identical to the PS model .	For short strands of equal or unequal lengths , the binding displays a strong sensitivity to mutations .
3	The validity of a given model is subject to the compliance of the synthetic seismic activity it produces to the well known empirical laws which describe the statistical features of observed seismic activity .	Our understanding of earthquakes is based on the theory of plate tectonics .	Earthquake dynamics is the study of the interactions of plates ( solid disjoint parts of the lithosphere ) which produce seismic activity .	Over the last about fifty years many models have come up which try to simulate seismic activity by mimicking plate plate interactions .	Here we present a review of two such models of earthquake dynamics with main focus on a relatively new model namely The Two Fractal Overlap Model .
0	We consider the finite temperature Casimir interaction between two Dirichlet spheres in $ ( D+1 ) $ -dimensional Minkowski spacetime .	The Casimir interaction free energy is derived from the zero temperature Casimir interaction energy via the Matsubara formalism .	In the high temperature region , the Casimir interaction is dominated by the term with zero Matsubara frequency , and it is known as the classical term since this term is independent of the Planck constant $ \hbar $ .	Explicit expression of the classical term is derived and it is computed exactly using appropriate similarity transforms of matrices .	We then compute the small separation asymptotic expansion of this classical term up to the next-to-leading order term .
4	Clarity has been achieved on the basis of a group-theoretical approach and the distinction between absolute and dynamical objects .	The treatment of the principle of general covariance based on coordinate systems , i.e. , on classical tensor analysis suffers from an ambiguity .	A more preferable formulation of the principle is based on modern differential geometry : the formulation is coordinate-free .	Then the principle may be called `` principle of geometricity . ''	In relation to coordinate transformations , there had been confusions around such concepts as symmetry , covariance , invariance , and gauge transformations .
4	In this study a qualitative overview of all features due to crystalline silicates and water ice in these high mass loss rate objects is presented .	Infrared spectra of a number of evolved O-rich stars have been obtained with the Short- and Long- Wavelength spectrometers on board the Infrared Space Observatory .	The very broad wavelength coverage ( 2.4-197 micron ) obtained by combining observations made with the two spectrometers includes practically all of the flux emitted by the sources , and allows us to determine the emission and absorption features of the dense circumstellar dust shells .	Agreement between the fluxes obtained by the two instruments is generally very good ; the largest discrepancies are probably due to source variability .	Our sample of oxygen-rich AGB stars exhibits a wealth of spectral features due to crystalline silicates and crystalline water ice in emission and absorption .
2	We present 1D , spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the escaping atmospheres of 18 hot gas planets in the solar neighborhood .	Absorption of high-energy radiation in planetary thermospheres is believed to lead to the formation of planetary winds .	The resulting mass-loss rates can affect the evolution , particularly of small gas planets .	Our sample only includes strongly irradiated planets , whose expanded atmospheres may be detectable via transit spectroscopy .	The simulations were performed with the PLUTO-CLOUDY interface , which couples a detailed photoionization and plasma simulation code with a general MHD code .
2	We have implemented orbital integrators based on drift-kick , bend-kick , and matrix-kick splits .	Accurate spin tracking is a valuable tool for understanding spin dynamics in particle accelerators and can help improve the performance of an accelerator .	In this paper , we present a detailed discussion of the integrators in the spin tracking code gpuSpinTrack .	On top of the orbital integrators , we have implemented various integrators for the spin motion .	These integrators use quaternions and Romberg quadratures to accelerate both the computation and the convergence of spin rotations .
1	This procedure allows an easier treatment of non-local effects that can be extended to three-body problems .	We study radiative capture reactions using quasi-separable potentials .	Using this technique , we calculate the neutron and proton radiative capture cross sections on $ ^ { 12 } $ C .	The results obtained are shown to be in good agreement with the available experimental data .	The experimental phase shifts are also well reproduced and can be straightforwardly be extended to multi-channel problems .
3	The space derivative of the valley antisymmetric potential gives a force field that accelerates intervalley phonons , while it corresponds to the longitudinal component of the previously discussed pseudoelectric field acting on the electrons .	When graphene is deformed in a dynamical manner , a time-dependent potential is induced for the electrons .	The potential is antisymmetric with respect to valleys , and some straightforward applications are found for Raman spectroscopy .	We show that a valley-antisymmetric potential broadens Raman $ D $ band but does not affect $ 2D $ band , which is already observed by recent experiments .	Effects of a pseudoelectric field on the electron is quite difficult to observe due to the valley-antisymmetric coupling constant , on the other hand , such obstacle is absent for intervalley phonons with $ A_ { 1g } $ symmetry that constitute the $ D $ and $ 2D $ bands .
0	In a recent paper [ 4 ] , Duarte and Jutten investigated the Blind Source Separation ( BSS ) problem , for the nonlinear mixing model that they introduced in that paper .	They proposed to solve this problem by using information-theoretic tools , more precisely by minimizing the mutual information ( MI ) of the outputs of the separating structure .	When applying the MI approach to BSS problems , one usually determines the analytical expressions of the derivatives of the MI with respect to the parameters of the considered separating model .	In the literature , these calculations were mainly reported for linear mixtures up to now .	They are more complex for nonlinear mixtures , due to dependencies between the considered quantities .
2	We find that IR-luminous galaxies have SEDs with broad far-IR peaks characterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures in the 25-45K range .	Using Herschel data from the deepest SPIRE and PACS surveys ( HerMES and PEP ) in COSMOS and GOODS ( N+S ) , we examine the dust properties of IR-luminous ( L_IR & gt ; 10^10 L_sun ) galaxies at 0.1 & lt ; z & lt ; 2 and determine how these evolve with cosmic time .	The unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of survey selection effects , making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated , IR-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selection biases .	Hot ( T & gt ; 45K ) SEDs and cold ( T & lt ; 25K ) , cirrus-dominated SEDs are rare , with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such as M82 and cool spirals such as M51 .	We observe a luminosity-temperature ( L-T ) relation , where the average dust temperature of log [ L_IR/L_sun ] =12.5 galaxies is about 10K higher than that of their log [ L_IR/L_sun ] =10.5 counterparts .
4	The spaces $ L^'^ { \ , p } $ and $ L^p $ are isometrically isomorphic .	For each $ 1\leq p & lt ; \infty $ a space of integrable Schwartz distributions , $ L^'^ { \ , p } $ , is defined by taking the distributional derivative of all functions in $ L^p $ .	Here , $ L^p $ is with respect to Lebesgue measure on the real line .	If $ f\in L^'^ { \ , p } $ such that $ f $ is the distributional derivative of $ F\in L^p $ then the integral is defined as $ \int^\infty_ { -\infty } fG=-\int^\infty_ { -\infty } F ( x ) g ( x ) \ , dx $ , where $ g\in L^q $ , $ G ( x ) = \int_0^x g ( t ) \ , dt $ and $ 1/p+1/q=1 $ .	A norm is $ \lVert f\rVert'_p=\lVert F\rVert_p $ .
4	We give a brief survey of the developments in this field .	General elliptic hypergeometric functions are defined by elliptic hypergeometric integrals .	They comprise the elliptic beta integral , elliptic analogues of the Euler-Gauss hypergeometric function and Selberg integral , as well as elliptic extensions of many other plain hypergeometric and $ q $ -hypergeometric constructions .	In particular , the Bailey chain technique , used for proving Rogers-Ramanujan type identities , has been generalized to integrals .	At the elliptic level it yields a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation as an integral operator with an elliptic hypergeometric kernel .
3	Core convective overshooting and semi-convection are treated as a whole part and the development of them are found to present nearly opposite tendency , more intensive core convective overshooting lead to weaker semi-convection .	Properties of semi-convection and core convective overshooting of stars with 15 $ M_ { \odot } $ and 30 $ M_ { \odot } $ are calculated in the present paper .	New methods are used to deal with semi-convection .	Different entropy gradient is used when adopting the Schwarzschild method and the Ledoux method which are used to confine the convective boundary and to calculate the turbulent quantities : $ \frac { \partial \overline { s } } { \partial r } =-\frac { c_ { p } } { H_P } ( \nabla-\nabla_ { \rm ad } ) $ when the Schwarzschild method is adopted and $ \frac { \partial \overline { s } } { \partial r } =-\frac { c_ { p } } { H_P } ( \nabla-\nabla_ { \rm ad } -\nabla_ { \mu } ) $ when the Ledoux method is adopted .	The influences of different parameters and the convection processing methods on the turbulent quantities are analyzed in this paper .
3	Strong constrains between these exchange energies are established .	We present a method to build magnetic models for insulators based on high-temperature expansions by fitting both the magnetic susceptibility and the low temperature specific heat data .	It is applied to the frustrated magnet kapellasite ( Cu3Zn ( OH ) 6Cl2 ) with the J1-J2-Jd-Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice .	Experimental data are reproduced with a set of `` competing '' exchange energies closed to J1 = -12K , J2= -4K and Jd=15.6K , where Jd is the third neighbor exchange energy across the hexagon .	These values confirm the results of B. F { \aa } k et al . ( Phys.Rev .
1	At $ z \sim $ 6 to 8 , $ ^ { 12 } $ CO $ ( J=1-0 ) $ line intensity results in a mean brightness temperature of about 0.5 $ \mu $ K with rms fluctuations of 0.1 $ \mu $ K at 1 to 10 Mpc spatial scales , corresponding to 30 arcminute angular scales .	We propose observations of the molecular gas distribution during the era of reionization .	This intensity fluctuations can be mapped with an interferometer , similar to existing and planned 21-cm background experiments , but operating at $ \sim $ 12 to 17 GHz .	We discuss the feasibility of detecting the cross-correlation between HI and CO molecular gas since such a cross-correlation has the advantage that it will be independent of systematics and most foregrounds in each of the 21-cm and CO $ ( 1-0 ) $ line experiments .	Additional instruments tuned to higher-order transitions of the CO molecule or an instrument operating with high spectral resolution at mm-wavelengths targeting 158 $ \mu $ m CII could further improve the reionization studies with molecular gas .
0	The monopole solution of the Einstein vacuum field equations ( Schwarzschild`s solution ) in Weyl coordinates involves a metric function that can be interpreted as the gravitational potential of a bar of length $ 2m $ with constant linear density .	The question addressed in this work is whether similar representations can be constructed for Weyl solutions other than the spherically symmetric one .	A new family of static solutions of the axisymmetric vacuum field equations generalizing the M-Q $ ^ { ( 1 ) } $ solution is developed .	These represent slight deviations from spherical symmetry in terms of the relativistic multipole moments ( RMM ) we wish the solution to contain .	A Newtonian object referred to as a dumbbell can be used to describe these solutions in a simple form by means of the density of this object , since the physical properties of the relativistic solution are characterized by its behaviour .
4	Being of a dynamic origin the currents can be destroyed by inelastic scattering , but we argue that the corresponding decay time can at low enough temperatures be large compared to all other time scales of the system .	A dynamic response to a magnetic field of a chain of connected mesoscopic rings is considered .	We show that the low frequency behavior corresponds to localization of the elctrons along the chain and to diamagnetic dynamic currents inside rings .	The magnetization density due to these currents does not vanish even in the limit of the infinitely long chain of strongly connected rings .	showing that this is a macroscopic effect .
1	Topological superconductivity could be realized in a type II , band-inverted , InAs/GaSb quantum well if it is in proximity to a conventional superconductor .	Superconductivity in topological materials has attracted a great deal of interest in both electron physics and material sciences since the theoretical predictions that Majorana fermions can be realized in topological superconductors [ 1-4 ] .	Here we report observations of the proximity effect induced giant supercurrent states in an InAs/GaSb bilayer system that is sandwiched between two superconducting tantalum electrodes to form a superconductor-InAs/GaSb-superconductor junction .	Electron transport results show that the supercurrent states can be preserved in a surprisingly large temperature-magnetic field ( T-H ) parameter space .	In addition , the evolution of differential resistance in T and H reveals an interesting superconducting gap structure .
3	Using observations of fluxes and period variations in the model of disk accretion one can estimate the magnetic momentum of a neutron star and the distance to X-ray pulsar .	Estimates of the magnetic field of neutron stars in X-ray pulsars are obtained using the hypothesis of the equilibrium period for disk and wind accretion and also from the BATSE data on timing of X-ray pulsars using the observed maximum spin-down rate .	Cyclotron lines at energies $ \ge 100 $ keV in several Be-transient are predicted for future observations .	We suggest a new method of estimating distances to X-ray pulsars and their magnetic fields .	As an illustration the method is applied to the system GROJ1008-57 .
2	We exclude generic WIMP candidates annihilating into b-bbar with mass less than 40 GeV that reproduce the observed relic abundance .	Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are known to be excellent targets for the detection of annihilating dark matter .	We present new limits on the annihilation cross section of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ( WIMPs ) based on the joint analysis of seven Milky Way dwarfs using a frequentist Neyman construction and Pass 7 data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope .	To within 95 % systematic errors on the dark matter distribution within the dwarfs , the mass lower limit can be as low as 19 GeV or as high as 240 GeV .	For annihilation into tau+tau- these limits become 19 GeV , 13 GeV , and 80 GeV respectively .
3	The full single-particle spectra are obtained from an exact diagonalization by using a group-theoretical treatment .	The optical spectra of CdSe nanocrystals up to 55 A in diameter are analyzed in a wide range of energies from the fine structure of the low-energy excitations to the so-called high-energy transitions .	We apply a symmetry-based method in two steps .	First we take the tight-binding ( TB ) parameters from the bulk sp^ { 3 } s^ { * } TB model , extended to include the spin-orbit interaction .	The electron-hole interaction is next introduced : Both the Coulomb ( direct ) and exchange terms are considered .
2	Adopting this result , we explicitly calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentum tensors , $ & lt ; T^A_B & gt ; _ { Ren .	In this paper we investigate the vacuum polarization effects associated with quantum fermionic charged fields in a generalized $ ( d+1 ) - $ dimensional cosmic string space-times considering the presence of a magnetic flux along the string .	In order to develop this analysis we calculate a general expression for the respective Green function , valid for several different values of $ d $ , which is expressed in terms of a bispinor associated with the square of the Dirac operator .	} $ , associated with massless fields .	Moreover , for specific values of the parameters which codify the cosmic string and the fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one , we were able to present in closed forms the bispinor and the respective Green function for massive fields .
4	Therefore , although useful in many applications the Darwin-Fowler method may not be suitable , in general , for a detailed microscopic analysis of the nuclear structure in connection with the Shell Model approach , as it is usually done in studies of the pre-equilibrium stage of nuclear reactions .	We present a brief numerical study of the Darwin-Fowler method applied to the analysis of the energy partition of essembles of bosons and fermions .	We analyze the assertion of the existence of a `` strong maximum '' made in the original paper of Darwin and Fowler and other studies and show that although the presumed saddle point along the real axis of the grand canonical parameters may exist it can not , in general , be characterized as `` strong '' , in the sense of having much larger magnitude than the other points along the path of integration .	We show that in some cases the saddle point is not even present and the various approximations of the method can be interpreted as a tricky reformulation of usual thermodynamic relations .	The close connection of the method with the formalism of the Laplace transform may produce wrong results if the internal energy of the components of the ensemble is not large enough .
4	These yield expansions of the irreducible p-modular S_n-characters in terms of the ordianry ones as well as expressions for the Alexander Polynomial of a 3-manifold evaluated at a p-th root of unity in terms of traces in the irreducible modular TQFT 's over covering cobordisms .	We construct families of TQFT 's over the finite field Z/pZ starting from an integral TQFT obtained by Frohman and Nicas .	These TQFT 's are likely to describe the constant order contributions of the cyclotomic integer expansions of the Reshetikhin Turaev Ohtsuki theories .	Their modular structure is intimately related to the p-modular representation theory of the symmetric groups S_n .	We construct resolutions of simple p-modular TQFT 's and S_n-modules over Z/pZ using powers of Lefschetz operators .
3	The links and structures of layered communities can also be formalized to gain a better understanding of their modelling .	Online communities have increased in size and importance dramatically over the last decade .	The fact that many communities are online means that it is possible to extract information about these communities and the connections between their members much more easily using software tools , despite their potentially very large size .	The links between members of the community can be presented visually and often this can make patterns in the structure of sub-communities immediately obvious .	This paper explores these links with some specific examples , including visualization of these relationships and a formalized model of communities using the Z notation .
2	We formulate and solve the renormalization group flow equation for the scale-dependent thermodynamic potential in the presence of the gluonic background field at finite temperature and density .	Thermodynamics and the phase structure of the Polyakov loop-extended two flavors chiral quark -- meson ( PQM ) model is explored beyond the mean-field approximation .	The analysis of the PQM model is based on the functional renormalization group ( FRG ) method .	We determine the phase diagram of the PQM model in the FRG approach and discuss its modification in comparison with the one obtained under the mean-field approximation .	We focus on properties of the net-quark number density fluctuations as well as their higher moments and discuss the influence of non-perturbative effects on their properties near the chiral crossover transition .
0	The Fermi-Hubbard model is a key concept in condensed matter physics and provides crucial insights into electronic and magnetic properties of materials .	Yet , the intricate nature of Fermi systems poses a barrier to answer important questions concerning d-wave superconductivity and quantum magnetism .	Recently , it has become possible to experimentally realize the Fermi-Hubbard model using a fermionic quantum gas loaded into an optical lattice .	In this atomic approach to the Fermi-Hubbard model the Hamiltonian is a direct result of the optical lattice potential created by interfering laser fields and short-ranged ultracold collisions .	It provides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system .
3	Special attention is paid to the transition energy region where the onset of the effect of a finite nuclear size is observed .	The needs of various accelerator and space projects stimulated recent developments to the MARS Monte Carlo code .	One of the essential parts of those is heavy ion ionization energy loss .	This paper describes an implementation of several corrections to dE/dx in order to take into account the deviations from the Bethe theory at low and high energies as well as the effect of a finite nuclear size at ultra-relativistic energies .	Comparisons with experimental data and NIST data are presented .
1	In particular , we focus on the minimum sample size P_c ( sample complexity ) necessary for perfectly identifying D of the optimal learning scheme when D and X are independently generated from certain distributions .	We consider a learning problem of identifying a dictionary matrix D ( M times N dimension ) from a sample set of M dimensional vectors Y = N^ { -1/2 } DX , where X is a sparse matrix ( N times P dimension ) in which the density of non-zero entries is 0 & lt ; rho & lt ; 1 .	By using the replica method of statistical mechanics , we show that P_c=O ( N ) holds as long as alpha = M/N & gt ; rho is satisfied in the limit of N to infinity .	Our analysis also implies that the posterior distribution given Y is condensed only at the correct dictionary D when the compression rate alpha is greater than a certain critical value alpha_M ( rho ) .	This suggests that belief propagation may allow us to learn D with a low computational complexity using O ( N ) samples .
0	The ground state energy of hydrogen molecular ion H2+ confined by a hard prolate spheroidal cavity is calculated .	The case in which the nuclear positions are clamped at the foci is considered .	Our calculations are based on using the variational Monte Carlo method with an accurate trial wave function depending on many variational parameters .	The calculations were extended also to include the HeH++ molecular ion .	The obtained results are in good agreement with the recent results .
4	An explicit construction of two-group decodable distributed non-coherent space-time codes achieving full cooperative diversity for all even number of relays is provided .	Unitary space-time modulation is known to be an efficient means to communicate over non-coherent Multiple Input Multiple Output ( MIMO ) channels .	In this letter , differential unitary space-time coding and non-coherent space-time coding for the training based approach of Kim and Tarokh are addressed .	For this approach , necessary and sufficient conditions for multi-group decodability are derived in a simple way assuming a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test receiver and a unitary codebook .	Extending Kim and Tarokh 's approach for colocated MIMO systems , a novel training based approach to distributed non-coherent space-time coding for wireless relay networks is proposed .
2	Using these results we exactly enumerate the native states of all proteins for a wide range of energy parameters .	The concept of the reduced set of contact maps is introduced .	Using this concept we find the ground state candidates for Hydrophobic-Polar lattice model on a two dimensional square lattice .	In this way , we show that there are some sequences , which have an absolute native state .	Moreover , we study the scale-dependence of the number of the members of the reduced set , the number of ground state candidates , and the number of perfectly stable sequences by comparing the results for sequences with lengths of 6 up to 20 .
2	Major controversies exist between authors proposing an allochthonous or autochthonous origin of the Bird 's Head block .	The Banda Arc , situated west of Irian Jaya and in the easternmost extension of the Sunda subduction zone system , reveals a characteristic bowl-shaped geometry in seismic tomographic images .	This indicates that the oceanic lithosphere still remains attached to the surrounding continental margins of northern Australia and the Bird 's Head microcontinent .	Either scenario has important implications for plate kinematic models aiming to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the region and the late Jurassic seaoor spreading geometry of this now subducted Argo-Tanimbar-Seram ( ATS ) ocean basin .	Wider implications affect the tectonic conguration of the Tethyan-Pacic realm , the distribution of plate boundaries as well as the shape and size of continental blocks which have been rifted off the northeastern Gondwana margin during the Late Jurassic and are now accreted to the SE Asia margin .
1	These results are confronted with those of nuclear many-body calculations close to the critical temperature $ T_c $ .	The interactions of heavy quarks with the partonic environment at finite temperature $ T $ and finite quark chemical potential $ \mu_q $ are investigated in terms of transport coefficients within the Dynamical Quasi-Particle model ( DQPM ) designed to reproduce the lattice-QCD results ( including the partonic equation of state ) in thermodynamic equilibrium .	The hadronic and partonic spatial diffusion coefficients join smoothly and show a pronounced minimum around $ T_c $ , at $ \mu_q=0 $ as well as at finite $ \mu_q $ .	Close and above $ T_c $ its absolute value matches the lQCD calculations for $ \mu_q=0 $ .	The smooth transition of the heavy quark transport coefficients from the hadronic to the partonic medium corresponds to a cross over in line with lattice calculations , and differs substantially from perturbative QCD ( pQCD ) calculations which show a large discontinuity at $ T_c $ .
0	In this paper , a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type V model filled with an imperfect fluid with bulk viscosity and particle creation , is investigated within the framework of General Relativity .	Particle creation and bulk viscosity have been considered as separate irreversible processes .	The energy- momentum tensor is modified to accommodate the viscous pressure and creation pressure which is associated with creation of matter out of gravitational field .	Exact solutions of the field equations are obtained by applying a special law of variation of Hubble parameter .	Using this assumption , we obtain two types of cosmological models .
0	Experiments on one- and two-photon laser excitation of 232Th+ ions in a radiofrequency ion trap are reported .	As the first excitation step , the strongest resonance line at 402 nm from the 6d^2 7s J=3/2 ground state to the 6d7s7p J=5/2 state at 24874 cm^ { -1 } is driven by radiation from an extended cavity diode laser .	Spontaneous decay of the intermediate state populates a number of low-lying metastable states , thus limiting the excited state population and fluorescence signal obtainable with continuous laser excitation .	We study the collisional quenching efficiency of helium , argon , and nitrogen buffer gases , and the effect of repumping laser excitation from the three lowest-lying metastable levels .	The experimental results are compared with a four-level rate equation model , that allows us to deduce quenching rates for these buffer gases .
1	Such accelerators will employ advanced beam conditioning systems such as emittance exchangers to manipulate high brightness beams .	Next generation accelerators will require a high current , low emittance beam with a low energy spread .	One of the goals of the Fermilab A0 photoinjector is to investigate the transverse to longitudinal emittance exchange principle .	Coherent synchrotron radiation could limit high current operation of the emittance exchanger .	In this paper , we report on the preliminary experimental and simulation study of the coherent synchroton radiation ( CSR ) in the emittance exchange line at the A0 photoinjector .
3	All diagrams are calculated by expanding the photon wavefunctions into partial waves and using realistic deuteron wavefunctions .	A calculation of deuteron Compton scattering using non-relativistic diagrammatic perturbation theory is presented , with the primary motivation of investigating the feasibility of determining the neutron polarizabilities from this type of experiment .	This calculation is expected to be valid for energies below 100 MeV .	Previous theoretical and experimental estimates for the polarizabilities are given .	The Green 's function for the intermediate state in the dispersive states is determined numerically .
1	the weighting coefficients are determined through latent random variables , following a hidden Markov model .	This paper introduces a new parsimonious structure for mixture of autoregressive models .	We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for the application of forecasting .	We also derive the limiting behavior of unconditional first moment of the process and an appropriate upper bound for the limiting value of the variance .	This can be considered as long run behavior of the process .
1	With new observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer ( EIS ) and X-ray Telescope ( XRT ) on \textit { Hinode } we have the ability to investigate the properties of high temperature coronal plasma in extraordinary detail .	Previous observations have not been able to exclude the possibility that high temperature active region loops are actually composed of many small scale threads that are in various stages of heating and cooling and only appear to be in equilibrium .	We examine the emission in the core of an active region and find three independent lines of evidence for steady heating .	We find that the emission observed in XRT is generally steady for hours , with a fluctuation level of approximately 15 % in an individual pixel .	Short-lived impulsive heating events are observed , but they appear to be unrelated to the steady emission that dominates the active region .
1	In order to study such phenomena , several nonlinear constitutive models were proposed and were generally implemented for 1D soil columns .	Strong seismic motions in soils generally lead to both a stiffness reduction and an increase of the energy dissipation in the surficial layers .	However , one of the main difficulties of complex rheologies is the large number of parameters needed to describe the model .	In this sense , the multi-surface cyclic plasticity approach , developed by Iwan in 1967 but linked to Prandtl or Preisach theoretical work , is an interesting choice : the only data needed is the modulus reduction curve .	Past studies have generally implemented such models for one-directional shear wave propagation in a `` 1D '' soil column considering one motion component only ( `` 1C '' ) .
0	New combinatorial games are introduced , of which the most pertinent is Maharaja Nim .	The rules extend those of the well-known impartial game of Wythoff Nim in which two players take turn in moving a single Queen of Chess on a large board , attempting to be the first to put her in the lower left corner .	Here , in addition to the classical rules a player may also move the Queen as the Knight of Chess moves .	We prove that the second player 's winning positions of Maharaja Nim are close to the ones of Wythoff Nim , namely they are within a bounded distance to the lines with slope $ \frac { \sqrt { 5 } +1 } { 2 } $ and $ \frac { \sqrt { 5 } -1 } { 2 } $ respectively .	For a close relative to Maharaja Nim , where the Knight 's jumps are of the form $ ( 2,3 ) $ and $ ( 3,2 ) $ ( rather than $ ( 1,2 ) $ and $ ( 2,1 ) $ ) , we also demonstrate polynomial time complexity to the decision problem of the outcome of a given position .
3	We also find that beyond a characteristic length scale related to the atomic acceleration , non-thermal effects in the radiation reaction contribution change the distance-dependence of the resonance interaction .	We study the resonance interaction between two uniformly accelerated identical atoms , one excited and the other in the ground state , prepared in a correlated ( symmetric or antisymmetric ) state and interacting with the scalar field or the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state .	In this case ( resonance interaction ) , the interatomic interaction is a second-order effect in the atom-field coupling .	We separate the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the resonance energy shift of the system , and show that only radiation reaction contributes , while Unruh thermal fluctuations do not affect the resonance interaction .	Finally , we find that new features appear , compared with the scalar field case , when the interaction with the electromagnetic field is considered , as a consequence of the peculiar nature of the vacuum quantum noise of the electromagnetic field in a relativistically accelerated background .
2	In discrete time the problem is reduced to finding the optimal martingale transport for the cost function $ |x+y| $ .	In this article we discuss the problem of calculating optimal model-independent ( robust ) bounds for the price of Asian options with discrete and continuous averaging .	We will give geometric characterisations of the maximising and the minimising pricing model for certain types of Asian options in discrete and continuous time .	In the continuous time case we consider the cases with one and two given marginals .	We describe the maximising models in both of these cases as well as the minimising model in the one-marginal case and relate the two-marginals case to the discrete time problem with two marginals .
2	We write the general form of the two functions S_m defining the first-order equations for the fields .	In this paper we consider axisymmetric black holes in supergravity and address the general issue of defining a first order description for them .	The natural setting where to formulate the problem is the De Donder-Weyl-Hamilton-Jacobi theory associated with the effective two-dimensional sigma-model action describing the axisymmetric solutions .	It is invariant under the global symmetry group G_ ( 3 ) of the sigma-model .	We also discuss the general properties of the solutions with respect to these global symmetries , showing that they can be encoded in two constant matrices belonging to the Lie algebra of G_ ( 3 ) , one being the Noether matrix of the sigma model , while the other is non-zero only for rotating solutions .
1	While the basic theory of RF trapping is well understood , studies of more complicated setups involving multiple resonant frequencies in the limit where their effects can not be treated independently are rare .	Adiabatic radio frequency ( RF ) potentials are powerful tools for creating advanced trapping geometries for ultra-cold atoms .	Here we present an approach based on Floquet theory and show that it offers significant corrections to existing models when two RF frequencies are near degenerate .	Furthermore it has no restrictions on the dimension , the number of frequencies or the orientation of the RF fields .	We show that the added degrees of freedom can , for example , be used to create a potential that allows for easy creation of ring vortex solitons .
0	We have observed continuum emission at lambda = 850 microns over ~4 square degrees of the Ophiuchus star-forming cloud using SCUBA on the JCMT , producing a submillimetre continuum map twenty times larger than previous Ophiuchus surveys .	Our sensitivity is 40 mJ/beam , a factor of ~2 less sensitive than earlier maps .	Using an automated identification algorithm , we detect 100 candidate objects .	Only two new objects are detected outside the boundary of previous maps , despite the much wider area surveyed .	We compare the submillimetre continuum map with a map of visual extinction across the Ophiuchus cloud derived using a combination of 2MASS and R-band data .
2	We show that all these datasets exhibit diversity of perspective , a property seen in other collective systems and a criterion in wise crowds .	This paper is focused on the computational analysis of collective discourse , a collective behavior seen in non-expert content contributions in online social media .	We collect and analyze a wide range of real-world collective discourse datasets from movie user reviews to microblogs and news headlines to scientific citations .	Our experiments also confirm that the network of different perspective co-occurrences exhibits the small-world property with high clustering of different perspectives .	Finally , we show that non-expert contributions in collective discourse can be used to answer simple questions that are otherwise hard to answer .
0	Spectral partitioning is a simple , nearly-linear time , algorithm to find sparse cuts , and the Cheeger inequalities provide a worst-case guarantee for the quality of the approximation found by the algorithm .	Local graph partitioning algorithms [ ST08 , ACL06 , AP09 ] run in time that is nearly linear in the size of the output set , and their approximation guarantee is worse than the guarantee provided by the Cheeger inequalities by a polylogarithmic $ \log^ { \Omega ( 1 ) } n $ factor .	It has been a long standing open problem to design a local graph clustering algorithm with an approximation guarantee close to the guarantee of the Cheeger inequalities and with a running time nearly linear in the size of the output .	In this paper we solve this problem ; we design an algorithm with the same guarantee ( up to a constant factor ) as the Cheeger inequality , that runs in time slightly super linear in the size of the output .	This is the first sublinear ( in the size of the input ) time algorithm with almost the same guarantee as the Cheeger 's inequality .
3	We refer to this channel as { \em quantized broadcast channel ( QBC ) } .	In this paper , we study the achievable rate region of Gaussian multiuser channels with the messages transmitted being from finite input alphabets and the outputs being { \em quantized at the receiver } .	In particular , we focus on the achievable rate region of $ i ) $ Gaussian broadcast channel ( GBC ) and $ ii ) $ Gaussian multiple access channel ( GMAC ) .	First , we study the achievable rate region of two-user GBC when the messages to be transmitted to both the users take values from finite signal sets and the received signal is quantized at both the users .	We observe that the capacity region defined for a GBC does not carry over as such to QBC .
4	We also explored the hierarchy above and below the subject level , including clusters that reflect gender and ethnicity .	Similarity scores in face recognition represent the proximity between pairs of images as computed by a matching algorithm .	Given a large set of images and the proximities between all pairs , a similarity score space is defined .	Cluster analysis was applied to the similarity score space to develop various taxonomies .	Given the number of subjects in the dataset , we used hierarchical methods to aggregate images of the same subject .
4	Compared to the ADS commercial software , TMM provides nearly the same simulation results for the same networks .	Recently , two-dimensional ( 2D ) periodically L and C loaded transmission-line ( TL ) networks have been applied to represent metamaterials .	The commercial Agilent 's Advanced Design System ( ADS ) is a commonly-used tool to simulate the TL metamaterials .	However , it takes a lot of time to set up the TL network and perform numerical simulations using ADS , making the metamaterial analysis inefficient , especially for large-scale TL networks .	In this paper , we propose transmission-matrix method ( TMM ) to simulate and analyze the TL-network metamaterials efficiently .
0	We use a combined ab-initio calculations and k.p theory based approach to derive a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for monolayer MoS2 at the K point of the Brillouin zone .	It captures the features which are present in first-principles calculations but not explained by the theory of Xiao et al .	[ Phys Rev Lett 108 , 196802 ( 2012 ) ] , namely the trigonal warping of the valence and conduction bands , the electron-hole symmetry breaking , and the spin-splitting of the conduction band .	We also consider other points in the Brillouin zone which might be important for transport properties .	Our findings lead to a more quantitative understanding of the properties of this material in the ballistic limit .
3	We introduce growth and culling probabilities appropriate for condensation and evaporation on a two-dimensional surface , and compare results with existing models for this problem .	We study the evolution of an initially random distribution of particles on a square lattice , under certain rules for `growing ' and `culling ' of particles .	In one version we allow the particles to move laterally along the surface ( mobile layer ) and in the other version this motion is not allowed ( immobile case ) .	In the former case both analytical and computer simulation results are presented , while in the latter only simulation is possible .	Our results show very interesting behaviour , under certain conditions quite different from earlier models .
0	We present spectroscopy of the optical counterpart to 1RXS J162848.1-41524 , also known as the microquasar candidate MCQC J162847-4152 .	All the data indicate that this X-ray source is not a microquasar , and that it is a single-lined chromospherically active binary system with a likely orbital period of 4.9 days .	Our analysis supports a K3IV spectral classification for the star , which is dominant at optical wavelengths .	The unseen binary component is most likely a late-type ( K7-M ) dwarf or a white dwarf .	Using the high resolution spectra we have measured the K3 star 's rotational broadening to be vsini = 43 +/- 3 km/s and determined a lower limit to the binary mass ratio of q ( =M2/M1 ) & gt ; 2.0 .
3	These data are studied statistically to fit the first three terms of the appropriate finite lattice scaling equations .	In this paper finite bcc lattices are defined by a triple of vectors in two different ways - upper triangular lattice form and compact form .	In Appendix A are lists of some 260 distinct and useful bcc lattices of 9 to 32 vertices .	The energy and magnetization of the S = 1/2 XY ferromagnet have been computed on these bcc lattices in the lowest states for $ S_z $ = 0 , 1/2 , 1 and 3/2 .	Our estimates of the T = 0 energy and magnetization agree very well with spin wave and series expansion estimates .
2	This process is an important background to weak boson scattering , to the measurement of quartic gauge couplings and to searches for signals of new physics beyond the Standard Model .	We present the first calculation of next-to-leading order QCD corrections to QCD-induced ZZ production in association with two jets at hadron colliders .	Both Z bosons decay leptonically with all off-shell effects , virtual photon contributions and spin-correlation effects fully taken into account .	As expected , the next-to-leading order corrections reduce significantly the scale uncertainty and show a non-trivial phase space dependence in kinematic distributions .	Our code will be publicly available as part of the parton level Monte Carlo program VBFNLO .
4	Counter intuitively , this pronounced in-medium dynamics throughout the propagation leads to an additional enhancement of the cavity bandwidth .	We discuss in-medium propagation dynamics in a white light cavity that leads to an enhancement of the cavity 's bandwidth without reducing its maximum intensity buildup .	We analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of our system with a full simulation of the field propagation in a regime that leads to strong absorption of the control fields .	We find that an additional coherent field is generated within the medium via four-wave mixing .	This self-generated field leads to a backaction of the medium onto the probe field .
1	The method is applicable to arbitrary factor graphs , provided that the size of the Markov blankets is not too large .	We propose a method for improving approximate inference methods that corrects for the influence of loops in the graphical model .	It is an alternative implementation of an idea introduced recently by Montanari and Rizzo ( 2005 ) .	In its simplest form , which amounts to the assumption that no loops are present , the method reduces to the minimal Cluster Variation Method approximation ( which uses maximal factors as outer clusters ) .	On the other hand , using estimates of the effect of loops ( obtained by some approximate inference algorithm ) and applying the Loop Correcting ( LC ) method usually gives significantly better results than applying the approximate inference algorithm directly without loop corrections .
1	In this paper , we consider a novel solution for this challenge that combines generative planning on incomplete domain models with a library of plan cases that are known to be correct .	There is increasing awareness in the planning community that depending on complete models impedes the applicability of planning technology in many real world domains where the burden of specifying complete domain models is too high .	While this was arguably the original motivation for case-based planning , most existing case-based planners assume ( and depend on ) from-scratch planners that work on complete domain models .	In contrast , our approach views the plan generated with respect to the incomplete model as a `` skeletal plan '' and augments it with directed mining of plan fragments from library cases .	We will present the details of our approach and present an empirical evaluation of our method in comparison to a state-of-the-art case-based planner that depends on complete domain models .
0	Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two categories -- domain independent and domain dependent .	The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains , but may not be very efficient in any one given domain .	The domain dependent approaches need to be ( re ) designed for each domain separately , but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed .	One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning .	In this paper , we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis .
0	In spite of the great success of LHC experiments , we do not know whether the discovered `` standard model-like '' Higgs particle is really what the standard model predicts or a particle some new physics has in its low energy effective theory .	Also the long-standing problems concerning the property of Higgs and its interactions are still there , and we still do not have any conclusive argument of the origin of the Higgs itself .	In this article we focus on higher-dimensional theories as new physics .	First we give a brief review of their representative scenarios and closely related 4-dimensional scenarios .	Among them , we mainly discuss two interesting possibilities of the origin of the Higgs : Higgs as a gauge boson and Higgs as a ( pseudo ) Nambu-Goldstone boson .
0	We investigate both analytically and numerically the motion of massless particles orbiting primary star in a close circular binary system with particular focus on the gas drag effects .	These are the first calculations with particles ranging in size from 1m to 10km , which account for the presence of a tidally perturbed gaseous disk .	We have found numerically that the radial mass transport by the tidal waves plays a crucial role in the orbital evolution of particles .	Numerical results are confirmed analytical calculations that do not assume anything about origin of the radial flow in the disk .	We demonstrate that the migration rate of a particle in a disk out of radial equilibrium is enhanced due to the enhanced mass flux of gas colliding with the particle and the migration is always directed inward regardless of the sign of the radial gas velocity .
0	In this paper we present a discrete dynamical population modeling of invasive species , with reference to the swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii .	Since this species can cause environmental damage of various kinds , it is necessary to evaluate its expected in not yet infested areas .	A structured discrete model is built , taking into account all biological information we were able to find , including the environmental variability implemented by means of stochastic parameters ( coefficients of fertility , death , etc . ) .	This model is based on a structure with 7 age classes , i.e.a Leslie mathematical population modeling type and it is calibrated with laboratory data provided by the Department of Evolutionary Biology ( DEB ) of Florence ( Italy ) .	The model presents many interesting aspects : the population has a high initial growth , then it stabilizes similarly to the logistic growth , but then it exhibits oscillations ( a kind of limit-cycle attractor in the phase plane ) .
4	The nature of the growth of domains with time at different temperatures has been modelled using these mechanisms .	The mechanism of the evolution of the deformed microstructure at the earliest stage of annealing where the existence of the lowest length scale substructure paves the way to the formation of the so-called subgrains , has been studied for the first time .	The study has been performed at high temperature on heavily deformed Ti-modified austenitic stainless steel using X-ray diffraction technique .	Significant changes were observed in the values of the domain size , both with time and temperature .	Two different types of mechanism have been proposed to be involved during the microstructural evolution at the earliest stages of annealing .
2	We investigate the size distributions of the longest neutral segments in random charge sequences , using analytical and Monte Carlo methods .	The ground state of randomly charged polyampholytes is conjectured to have a structure similar to a necklace , made of weakly charged parts of the chain , compacting into globules , connected by highly charged stretched `strings ' .	We suggest a specific structure , within the necklace model , where all the neutral parts of the chain compact into globules : The longest neutral segment compacts into a globule ; in the remaining part of the chain , the longest neutral segment ( the 2nd longest neutral segment ) compacts into a globule , then the 3rd , and so on .	We show that the length of the n-th longest neutral segment in a sequence of N monomers is proportional to N/ ( n^2 ) , while the mean number of neutral segments increases as sqrt ( N ) .	The polyampholyte in the ground state within our model is found to have an average linear size proportional to sqrt ( N ) , and an average surface area proportional to N^ ( 2/3 ) .
3	They give direct X-ray evidence for density variations , implying densities between 2x10^ { 10 } - 4x10^ { 11 } cm^ { -3 } and providing estimates of the mass and the volume of the line-emitting plasma .	Using the XMM-Newton X-ray observatory to monitor the nearest star to the Sun , Proxima Centauri , we recorded the weakest X-ray flares on a magnetically active star ever observed .	Correlated X-ray and optical variability provide strong support for coronal energy and mass supply by a nearly continuous sequence of rapid explosive energy releases .	Variable emission line fluxes were observed in the He-like triplets of OVII and NeIX during a giant flare .	We discuss the data in the context of the chromospheric evaporation scenario .
1	However , tremendous challenges have remained not only for the integration of these building blocks into functional devices , but also in the characterization of the fundamental transport properties in these nanoscale model systems .	Recent advances in the synthesis of inorganic and organic nanowires and nanotubes have provided both components for various functional devices and platforms for the study of low- dimensional transport phenomena .	In particular , thermal and thermoelectric transport measurements can be considerably more complicated than electron transport measurements , especially for individual nanostructures .	During the past decade , a number of experimental methods for measuring the thermal and thermoelectric properties of individual nanowires and nanotubes have been devised to address these challenges , some of which are reviewed and analyzed in this chapter .	Although the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity can also be obtained from some of the measurement methods , this chapter is focused on measurement techniques of the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of nanowires and nanotubes .
4	The correlation between CT and US images being naturally rather poor , the images have been preprocessed in order to increase their similarity .	This paper presents a method to register a pre-operative Computed-Tomography ( CT ) volume to a sparse set of intra-operative Ultra-Sound ( US ) slices .	In the context of percutaneous renal puncture , the aim is to transfer planning information to an intra-operative coordinate system .	The spatial position of the US slices is measured by optically localizing a calibrated probe .	Assuming the reproducibility of kidney motion during breathing , and no deformation of the organ , the method consists in optimizing a rigid 6 Degree Of Freedom ( DOF ) transform by evaluating at each step the similarity between the set of US images and the CT volume .
4	We discuss our results in terms of Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and a recently proposed theory based on the Doppler shift in the quasiparticle spectrum .	We have measured the transverse thermal conductivity $ \kappa_ { xy } $ of twinned and untwinned YBa $ _2 $ Cu $ _3 $ O $ _7 $ single crystals as a function of angle $ \theta $ between the magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO $ _2 $ planes and the heat current direction , at different magnetic fields and temperatures .	For both crystals we observed a clear twofold variation in the field-angle dependence of $ \kappa_ { xy } ( \theta ) = - \kappa^0_ { xy } ( T , B ) \sin ( 2\theta ) $ .	We have found that the oscillation amplitude $ \kappa^0_ { xy } $ depends on temperature and magnetic field .	Our results show that $ \kappa^0_ { xy } = a B \ln ( 1/ ( bB ) ) $ with the temperature- and sample-dependent parameters $ a $ and $ b $ .
0	We present for the first time the band structure calculation of $ Bi_2Sr_2Ca_2Cu_3O_ { 10 } $ compound in the tetragonal structure ( space group $ I4/mmm $ ) .	We used the Local Density Approximation ( LDA ) as in the Wien2k code .	We analyze in detail the band structure and the Fermi surface ( FS ) .	Our results are in very good agreement with recent experiments .	The FS shows the feature known as the Bi-O pocket problem which we associate with the interaction of the O3 atoms with the Cu2-O2 and Bi-O4 planes .
1	In this paper we probe if future data from KamLAND can increase the accuracy of the allowed range in $ \theta_ { \odot } $ and conclude that even after 3 kton-year of statistics and most optimistic error estimates , KamLAND { \it may } find it hard to significantly improve the bounds on the mixing angle obtained from the solar neutrino data .	However the allowed range of $ \theta_ { \odot } $ ( $ \theta_ { 12 } $ ) did not change much with the inclusion of the KamLAND results .	We discuss the $ \theta_ { 12 } $ sensitivity of the survival probabilities in matter ( vacuum ) as is relevant for the solar ( KamLAND ) experiments .	We find that the presence of matter effects in the survival probabilities for $ ^8B $ neutrinos give the solar neutrino experiments SK and SNO an edge over KamLAND , as far as $ \theta_ { 12 } $ sensitivity is concerned , particularly near maximal mixing .	Among solar neutrino experiments we identify SNO as the most promising candidate for constraining $ \theta_ { 12 } $ and make a projected sensitivity test for the mixing angle by reducing the error in the neutral current measurement at SNO .
2	In contrast , in hadroproduction , which at high energies mainly involves gluon -- gluon collisions , the fragmentation mechanism dominates at transverse momenta $ p_T & gt ; m_ { B_c } $ , providing a simple and satisfactory approximation of the complete $ O ( \alpha_s^4 ) $ results in the high- $ p_T $ regime .	We discuss two-photon and hadronic production of $ B_c $ mesons in nonrelativistic bound state approximation and to lowest order in the coupling constants $ \alpha $ and $ \alpha_s $ .	It is shown that in photon-photon collisions , heavy quark fragmentation is dominated by recombination of $ \bar b $ and $ c $ quarks up to the highest accessible transverse momenta .	Contradictions in previous publications on hadroproduction of $ B_c $ mesons are clarified .	We also present predictions for cross sections and differential distributions at present and future accelerators .
2	The star formation rates derived from the FIR luminosity range from about 300 to 5000 M ( sun ) per year and the molecular mass from 4 x 10^9 to 1 x 10^ { 11 } M ( sun ) .	The Early Universe Molecular Emission Line Galaxies ( EMGs ) are a population of galaxies with only 36 examples that hold great promise for the study of galaxy formation and evolution at high redshift .	The classification , luminosity of molecular line emission , molecular mass , far-infrared ( FIR ) luminosity , star formation efficiency , morphology , and dynamical mass of the currently known sample are presented and discussed .	At the lower end , these star formation rates , gas masses , and diameters are similar to those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies , and represent starbursts in centrally concentrated disks , sometimes , but not always , associated with active galactic nuclei .	The evidence for large ( & gt ; 5 kpc ) molecular disks is limited .
4	We furthermore introduce a class of measures with an operational interpretation in terms of interferometry .	Measures are introduced to quantify the degree of superposition in mixed states with respect to orthogonal decompositions of the Hilbert space of a quantum system .	These superposition measures can be regarded as analogues to entanglement measures , but can also be put in a more direct relation to the latter .	By a second quantization of the system it is possible to induce superposition measures from entanglement measures .	We consider the measures induced from relative entropy of entanglement and entanglement of formation .
3	The field equation is scale-invariant not only for the sum of them , but also for $ F=R\ln R $ .	We consider the lagrangian $ L=F ( R ) $ in classical ( =non-quantized ) two-dimensional fourth-order gravity and give new relations to Einstein 's theory with a non-minimally coupled scalar field .	We distinguish between scale-invariant lagrangians and scale-invariant field equations .	$ L $ is scale-invariant for $ F = c_1 R\sp { k+1 } $ and a divergence for $ F=c_2 R $ .	We prove this to be the only exception and show in which sense it is the limit of $ \frac { 1 } { k } R\sp { k+1 } $ as $ k\to 0 $ .
0	We present spectroscopic observations of galaxies in 4 clusters at z = 0.7-0.8 and in one cluster at z~0.5 obtained with the FORS2 spectrograph on the VLT as part of the ESO Distant Cluster Survey ( EDisCS ) , a photometric and spectroscopic survey of 20 intermediate to high redshift clusters .	We describe our target selection , mask design , observation and data reduction procedures , using these first 5 clusters to demonstrate how our strategies maximise the number of cluster members for which we obtain spectroscopy .	We present catalogues containing positions , I-band magnitudes and spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies in the fields of our 5 clusters .	These contain 236 cluster members , with the number of members per cluster ranging from 30 to 67 .	Our spectroscopic success rate , i.e.the fraction of spectroscopic targets which are cluster members , averages 50 % and ranges from 30 % to 75 % .
1	For processing time distributions with unbounded support , it has been shown that standard diffusion scaling yields an identically zero limit .	We develop a heavy traffic diffusion limit theorem under nonstandard spatial scaling for the queue length process in a single server queue employing shortest remaining processing time ( SRPT ) .	We specify an alternative spatial scaling that produces a nonzero limit .	Our model allows for renewal arrivals and i.i.d .	processing times satisfying a rapid variation condition .
0	We compare the single inclusive spectra of isolated photons measured at high transverse energy in proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt ( s ) =1.96 TeV with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions with various parametrizations of the parton distribution functions ( PDFs ) .	Within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties , the Tevatron data can be reproduced equally well by the recent CTEQ6.6 , MSTW08 and NNPDF1.2 PDF sets .	We present also the predictions for isolated gamma spectra in proton-proton collisions at sqrt ( s ) =14TeV for central ( y=0 ) and forward ( y=4 ) rapidities relevant for LHC experiments .	Different proton PDFs result in maximum variations of order 30 % in the expected E_T-differential isolated gamma cross sections .	The inclusion of the isolated photon data in global PDF fits will place extra independent constraints on the gluon density .
4	The method takes binary fraction into account and uses a Monte-Carlo approach to obtain uncertainties on the determined parameters for the cluster by running the fitting algorithm many times with a re-sampled data set through a bootstrapping procedure .	We present a new technique to fit color-magnitude diagrams of open clusters based on the Cross-Entropy global optimization algorithm .	The method uses theoretical isochrones available in the literature and maximizes a weighted likelihood function based on distances measured in the color-magnitude space .	The weights are obtained through a non parametric technique that takes into account the star distance to the observed center of the cluster , observed magnitude uncertainties , the stellar density profile of the cluster among others .	The parameters determined simultaneously are distance , reddening , age and metallicity .
0	In big data image/video analytics , we encounter the problem of learning an overcomplete dictionary for sparse representation from a large training dataset , which can not be processed at once because of storage and computational constraints .	To tackle the problem of dictionary learning in such scenarios , we propose an algorithm for parallel dictionary learning .	The fundamental idea behind the algorithm is to learn a sparse representation in two phases .	In the first phase , the whole training dataset is partitioned into small non-overlapping subsets , and a dictionary is trained independently on each small database .	In the second phase , the dictionaries are merged to form a global dictionary .
3	As a differential equation , the p-minimal surface equation is degenerate ( hyperbolic and elliptic ) .	We consider surfaces immersed in three-dimensional pseudohermitian manifolds .	We define the notion of ( p- ) mean curvature and of the associated ( p- ) minimal surfaces , extending some concepts previously given for the ( flat ) Heisenberg group .	We interpret the p-mean curvature not only as the tangential sublaplacian of a defining function , but also as the curvature of a characteristic curve , and as a quantity in terms of calibration geometry .	To analyze the singular set , we formulate some { \em extension } theorems , which describe how the characteristic curves meet the singular set .
3	Using 2dF measurements , we extract information related to conditional mass function for halos from extreme voids to dense regions in terms of the galaxy overdensity .	( Summary ) Making use of scaling relations between the central and the total galaxy luminosity of a dark matter halo as a function of the halo mass , and the scatter in these relations , we present an empirical model to describe the luminosity function ( LF ) of galaxies .	We extend this model to describe relative statistics of early-type , or red , and late-type , or blue , galaxies , with the fraction of early type galaxies at halo centers , relative to the total sample , determined only by the halo mass and the same fraction in the case of satellites is taken to be dependent on both the halo mass and the satellite galaxy luminosity .	This simple model describes the conditional luminosity functions , LF of galaxies as a function of the halo mass , measured with the 2dF galaxy group catalog from cluster to group mass scales .	We also calculate the probability distribution function of halo mass , as a function of the galaxy overdensity , and use these probabilities to address preferred environments of red and blue galaxies .
4	The detection of the event confirmed the main prediction of the population synthesis performed with the `` Scenario Machine '' formulated in Lipunov1997b .	The Advanced LIGO observatory recently reported the first direct detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein ( 1916 ) .	We report on the first optical observations of the Gravitational Wave ( GW ) source GW150914 error region with the Global MASTER Robotic Net .	We detected several optical transients , which proved to be unconnected with the GW event .	Our result is consistent with the assumption that gravitational waves were produced by a binary black hole merger .
0	While important advances were recently made towards temporally localizing and recognizing specific human actions or activities in videos , efficient detection and classification of long video chunks belonging to semantically defined categories such as `` pursuit '' or `` romance '' remains challenging.We introduce a new dataset , Action Movie Franchises , consisting of a collection of Hollywood action movie franchises .	We define 11 non-exclusive semantic categories - called beat-categories - that are broad enough to cover most of the movie footage .	The corresponding beat-events are annotated as groups of video shots , possibly overlapping.We propose an approach for localizing beat-events based on classifying shots into beat-categories and learning the temporal constraints between shots .	We show that temporal constraints significantly improve the classification performance .	We set up an evaluation protocol for beat-event localization as well as for shot classification , depending on whether movies from the same franchise are present or not in the training data .
4	No or little intrinsic X-ray neutral absorption is found for one third of the spectroscopically analyzed BALQSO sample ( N_H & lt ; 4 x 10^ { 21 } cm^ { -2 } at 90 % confidence level ) , and lower than typical X-ray absorption is found in the remaining sources ( & lt ; N_H & gt ; ~ 5 x 10^ { 22 } cm^ { -2 } ) even including the faintest sources analyzed through hardness ratio analysis .	Most X-ray studies of BALQSOs found significant ( N_H~10^ { 22-24 } cm^ { -2 } ) intrinsic column densities of gas absorbing an underlying typical power-law continuum emission , in agreement with expectations from radiatively driven accretion disk wind models .	However , direct spectral analysis was performed only on a limited number of bright sources .	We investigate the X-ray emission of a large BALQSO sample at medium to high redshift ( 0.8 & lt ; z & lt ; 3.7 ) , drawn from the cross-correlation of SDSS DR5 and 2XMM catalogs .	We perform on it moderate-quality X-ray spectral and hardness ratio analysis , and X-ray/optical photometry .
1	Using the discrete-dipole-approximation , we compute the scattering phase function and linear polarization for random aggregates with various sizes and porosities , and with two different compositions : 100 % silicate and 50 % silicate-50 % graphite .	We study the light scattering properties of random ballistic aggregates constructed in Shen et al . ( Paper I ) .	We investigate the dependence of light scattering properties on wavelength , cluster size and porosity using these aggregate models .	We find that while the shape of the phase function depends mainly on the size parameter of the aggregates , the linear polarization depends on both the size parameter and the porosity of the aggregates , with increasing degree of polarization as the porosity increases .	Contrary to previous studies , we argue that monomer size has negligible effects on the light scattering properties of ballistic aggregates , as long as the constituent monomer is smaller than the incident wavelength up to 2*pi*a_0/lambda\sim 1.6 where a_0 is the monomer radius .
3	On some of these worlds , we predict limited O_2 and O_3 build up , caused by fast chemical production of these gases .	The search for life on planets outside our solar system will use spectroscopic identification of atmospheric biosignatures .	The most robust remotely-detectable potential biosignature is considered to be the detection of oxygen ( O_2 ) or ozone ( O_3 ) simultaneous to methane ( CH_4 ) at levels indicating fluxes from the planetary surface in excess of those that could be produced abiotically .	Here , we use an altitude-dependent photochemical model with the enhanced lower boundary conditions necessary to carefully explore abiotic O_2 and O_3 production on lifeless planets with a wide variety of volcanic gas fluxes and stellar energy distributions .	This results in detectable abiotic O_3 and CH_4 features in the UV-visible , but no detectable abiotic O_2 features .
3	The nonlinear and oscillating behaviors arise from the weakened and enhanced interband coupling .	We investigate theoretically the Rashba spin-orbit interaction in InAs/GaSb quantum wells ( QWs ) .	We find that the Rashba spin-splitting ( RSS ) depends sensitively on the thickness of the InAs layer .	The RSS exhibits nonlinear behavior for narrow InAs/GaSb QWs and the oscillating feature for wide InAs/GaSb QWs .	The RSS also show asymmetric features respect to the direction of the external electric field .
4	We also present estimates for derivatives and traces of the solution and formulate a natural energy space , for which the data-to-solution map becomes an isomorphism .	We present a self-contained analysis of the stationary radiative transfer equation in weighted $ L^p $ spaces .	The use of weighted spaces allows us to derive uniform a-priori estimates for $ 1 \le p \le \infty $ under minimal assumptions on the parameters .	By constructing an explicit example , we show that our estimates are sharp and can not be improved in general .	Better estimates are however derived under additional assumptions on the parameters .
3	We find that the joint spectra are difficult to fit with a single power law ; a broken power-law model with a break at around 6.5 keV can improve the fit significantly .	We present and interpret several new X-ray features of the X-ray pulsar PSR J1838-0655 .	The X-ray data are obtained from the archival data of CHANDRA , RXTE } , and SUZAKU .	We combine all these X-ray data and fit the spectra with different models .	The photon index changes from $ \Gamma $ = 1.0 ( below 6.5 keV ) to $ \Gamma $ = 1.5 ( above 6.5 keV ) ; this indicates a softer spectral behaviour at hard X-rays .
1	The energy of a deformed crystal is calculated in the context of a lattice model with general binary interactions in two dimensions .	We investigate connections between the continuum and atomistic descriptions of deformable crystals , using certain interesting results from number theory .	A new bond counting approach is used , which reduces the problem to the lattice point problem of number theory .	The main contribution is an explicit formula for the surface energy density as a function of the deformation gradient and boundary normal .	The result is valid for a large class of domains , including faceted ( polygonal ) shapes and regions with piecewise smooth boundaries .
2	In this paper we analyze the two Kerr oscillators coupler and we show that there is a possibility to control the dynamics of this system , especially by switching its dynamics from periodic to chaotic motion and vice versa .	Kerr oscillators are model systems which have practical applications in nonlinear optics .	Optical Kerr effect i.e.interaction of optical waves with nonlinear medium with polarizability $ \chi^ { ( 3 ) } $ is the basic phenomenon needed to explain for example the process of light transmission in fibers and optical couplers .	Moreover the switching between two different stable periodic states is investigated .	The stability of the system is described by the so-called maps of Lyapunov exponents in parametric spaces .
0	In this work a method is proposed for computing step free energies for faceted solid-liquid interfaces based on atomistic simulations .	The method is demonstrated in an application to ( 111 ) interfaces in elemental Si , modeled with the classical Stillinger-Weber potential .	The approach makes use of an adiabatic trapping procedure , and involves simulations of systems with coexisting solid and liquid phases separated by faceted interfaces containing islands with different sizes , for which the corresponding equilibrium temperatures are computed .	We demonstrate that the calculated coexistence temperature is strongly affected by the geometry of the interface .	We find that island radius is inversely proportional to superheating , allowing us to compute the step free energy by fitting simulation data within the formalism of classical nucleation theory .
0	The massless harmonic oscillator is a rare example of a system whose Feynman path integral can be explicitly computed and receives its main contributions from regions of the functional space that are far from the classical and semiclassical configurations near the stationary point of the action .	The functional average $ \langle q_m^2 \rangle $ of the square of the coordinate at a time $ t_m $ which is intermediate between the initial and final time gives a measure of the amplitude of quantum fluctuations with respect to the classical path .	This average , or `` transition element '' , is divergent in the massless limit , signaling a quantum runaway .	We show that the divergence is not due to the continuum limit and formulate the conjecture that the divergent contributions come from regions where the action $ S $ is constant and therefore the interference factor $ e^ { -iS/\hbar } $ does not oscillate .	For most systems these regions have zero functional measure and thus give a null contribution to the path integral , but this is not the case for the massless oscillator .
3	In this work , we try to develop a suitable framework to model this varying cosmological constant $ \Lambda\propto\alpha^ { -6 } $ , in which we view it from an interacting vacuum energy perspective .	In this work , we consider the cosmological constant model $ \Lambda\propto\alpha^ { -6 } $ , which is well motivated from three independent approaches .	As is well known , the evidence of varying fine structure constant $ \alpha $ was found in 1998 .	If $ \Lambda\propto\alpha^ { -6 } $ is right , it means that the cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ should be also varying .	We propose two types of models to describe the evolutions of $ \Lambda $ and $ \alpha $ .
2	Our analytic solutions are given as an infinite opacity series , which represents a cluster expansion of the sequential multiple scattering .	We use a formal recurrence relation approach to multiple parton scattering to find the complete solution to the problem of medium-induced gluon emission from partons propagating in cold nuclear matter .	The differential bremsstrahlung spectrum , where Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal destructive interference effects are fully accounted for , is calculated for three different cases : ( 1 ) a generalization of the incoherent Bertsch-Gunion solution for asymptotic on-shell jets , ( 2 ) initial-state energy loss of incoming jets that undergo hard scattering and ( 3 ) final-state energy loss of jets that emerge out of a hard scatter .	These new solutions allow , for the first time , direct comparison between initial- and final-state energy loss in cold nuclei .	We demonstrate that , contrary to the naive assumption , energy loss in cold nuclear matter can be large .
3	A cut and count method and two likelihood methods were employed to measure the cross section and important systematic effects were investigated .	We present simulations of the production cross-section measurement of top-antitop pairs in the di-leptonic decay channel with the ATLAS detector .	This study uses the Commissioning Service Challenge ( CSC ) data , which is the latest and centrally produced Monte-Carlo data set to validate the detector simulation before the actual data taking .	The signal process was generated with MC @ NLO and important background processes were studied .	The expected statistical and systematic errors for a luminosity of 100 $ \ipb $ are also given .
2	In the quartuplet , four fields interact appropriately and resonantly with the five-level atom .	We extend the concepts of the Autler-Townes doublet and triplet spectroscopy to quartuplet , quintuplet and suggest linkages in sodium atom in which to display these spectra .	We explore the involved fundamental processes of quantum interference of the corresponding spectroscopy by examining the Laplace transform of the corresponding state-vector subjected to steady coherent illumination in the rotating wave approximation and Weisskopf-Wigner treatment of spontaneous emission as a simplest probability loss .	The spectral profile of the single decaying level , upon interaction with three other levels , splits into four destructively interfering dressed states generating three dark lines in the spectrum .	These dark lines divide the spectrum into four spectral components ( bright lines ) whose widths are effectively controlled by the relative strength of the laser fields and the relative width of the single decaying level .
1	Analytically , we derive the probability density distribution of the angles between the minor axes of the substructures and the major axes of their host halos from the physical principles , under the assumption that the substructure alignment on galaxy scale is a consequence of the tidal fields of the host halo gravitational potential .	We investigate the intrinsic alignments of dark halo substructures with their host halo major-axis orientations both analytically and numerically .	Numerically , we use a sample of four cluster-scale halos and their galaxy-scale substructures from recent high-resolution N-body simulations to measure the probability density distribution .	We compare the numerical distribution with the analytic prediction , and find that the two results agree with each other very well .	We conclude that our analytic model provides a quantitative physical explanation for the intrinsic alignment of dark halo substructures .
3	In order to do that , we employed the machinery of symplectic formalism to generalize and expand the ideas presented in [ 1 ] , where the specific case of an isolated ( no thermal baths ) chain is treated .	In this work , we perform a careful study of an special arrangement of coupled systems that consists of two external harmonic oscillators weakly coupled to an arbitrary network ( data bus ) of strongly interacting oscillators .	Our aim is to establish simple effective Hamiltonians and Liouvillians allowing an accurate description of the dynamics of the external oscillators regardless the topology of the network .	By simple we mean an effective description using just a few degrees of freedom .	With the methodology developed here , we are able to treat general topologies and , under certain structural conditions , to also include the interaction with external environments .
3	In addition , we obtain an upper bound of $ 3n $ for the maximum sum of exponents $ \sigma ( n ) $ of runs in a string of length $ n $ , improving on the best known bound of $ 4.1n $ by Crochemore et al .	We give a new characterization of maximal repetitions ( or runs ) in strings based on Lyndon words .	The characterization leads to a proof of what was known as the `` runs '' conjecture ( Kolpakov \ & amp ; Kucherov ( FOCS '99 ) ) , which states that the maximum number of runs $ \rho ( n ) $ in a string of length $ n $ is less than $ n $ .	The proof is remarkably simple , considering the numerous endeavors to tackle this problem in the last 15 years , and significantly improves our understanding of how runs can occur in strings .	( JDA 2012 ) , as well as other improved bounds on related problems .
1	We determine the hydrogen column densities ( n_H ) towards the ULXs from XMM-Newton archival spectra of 14 ULX sources .	We determined oxygen and iron abundances of the interstellar medium ( ISM ) using K-shell ( O ) and L-shell ( Fe ) X-ray photo-ionization edges towards Ultra luminous X-ray sources ( ULXs ) .	We compare our X-ray values with those obtained from radio HI observations for 8 of the sources .	The X-ray model n_H values are in good agreement with the HI n_H values , implying that the hydrogen absorption towards the ULX is not local to the source , with the exception of M81 X-1 .	Oxygen abundances and iron abundances are roughly solar for the host galaxies .
3	Using time-dependent response to a sudden local quench as a diagnostic , we find that the long-time wave function overlap changes from a power-law to an anomalous form at strong coupling , lending additional support to this idea .	It is long known that the best single-site coherent potential approximation ( CPA ) falls short of describing Anderson localization ( AL ) .	Here , we study a binary alloy disorder ( or equivalently , a spinless Falicov-Kimball ( FK ) ) model and construct a dominantly analytic cluster extension that treats intra-cluster ( $ 1/d $ , $ d $ =spatial dimension ) correlations exactly .	We find that , in general , the irreducible two-particle vertex exhibits clear non-analyticities before the band-splitting transition of the Hubbard type occurs , signaling onset of a novel type of localization at strong coupling .	Our results also imply such novel `` strong '' localization in the equivalent FK model , the simplest interacting fermion system .
1	We prove the existence of local bases , called normal , in which the components of the derivations vanish along arbitrary paths .	We investigate the validity of the equivalence principle along paths in gravitational theories based on derivations of the tensor algebra over a differentiable manifold .	All such bases are explicitly described .	The holonomicity of the normal bases is considered .	The results obtained are applied to the important case of linear connections and their relationship with the equivalence principle is described .
2	The channel includes liquid-hydrogen absorbers providing transverse and longitudinal momentum loss and high-gradient radiofrequency ( RF ) cavities for longitudinal reacceleration , all packed into a solenoidal magnetic channel .	MICE is an experiment with a section of an ionization cooling channel and a muon beam .	The muons will be produced by the decay of pions from a target dipping into the ISIS proton beam at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ( RAL ) .	MICE will reduce the beam transverse emittance by about 10 % for muon momenta between 140 and 240 MeV/c .	Time-of-flight ( TOF ) counters , a threshold Cherenkov counter , and a calorimeter will identify background electrons and pions .
3	Special attention is given to understanding the surface effect on Raman frequencies by using a force constants model based on first-principles calculations .	The layered dichalcogenide MoS2 has many unique physical properties in low dimensions .	Recent experimental Raman spectroscopies report an anomalous blue shift of the in-plane E2g1 mode with decreasing thickness , a trend that is not understood .	Here , we combine experimental Raman scattering and theoretical studies to clarify and explain this trend .	Surface effects refer to the larger Mo-S force constants at the surface of thin film MoS2 , which results from a loss of neighbours in adjacent MoS2 layers .
3	Grain size increased with HT time at both 600C and 700C .	Monocore powder-in-tube MgB2 strands were cold-drawn and heat-treated at 600C and 700C for times of up to 71 hours and structure-property relationships examined .	Drawing-induced elongation of the Mg particles led , after HT , to a textured macrostructure consisting of elongated polycrystalline MgB2 fibers separated by elongated pores .	The superconducting Tc , Jc and Fp were correlated with the macrostructure and grain size .	Jc and hence Fp decreased monotonically but not linearly with grain size .
0	Upcoming and ongoing large area weak lensing surveys will also discover large samples of galaxy clusters .	Accurate and precise masses of galaxy clusters are of major importance for cosmology , for example , in establishing well calibrated observational halo mass functions for comparison with cosmological predictions .	We investigate the level of statistical uncertainties and sources of systematic errors expected for weak lensing mass estimates .	Future surveys that will cover large areas on the sky , such as Euclid or LSST and to lesser extent DES , will provide the largest weak lensing cluster samples with the lowest level of statistical noise regarding ensembles of galaxy clusters .	However , the expected low level of statistical uncertainties requires us to scrutinize various sources of systematic errors .
1	It is known that bounding the spectral radius of a random matrix consisting of PC samples , yields a bound on the number of samples necessary to identify coefficients in the PC expansion via solution to a least-squares regression problem .	Independent sampling of orthogonal polynomial bases via Monte Carlo is of interest for uncertainty quantification of models , using Polynomial Chaos ( PC ) expansions .	We present a related analysis which guarantees a mean square convergence using a coherence parameter of the sampled PC basis that may be both analytically bounded and computationally estimated .	Utilizing asymptotic results for orthogonal polynomials , we bound the coherence parameter for polynomials of Hermite and Legendre type under each respective natural sampling distribution .	In both polynomial bases we identify an importance sampling distribution which yields a bound with weaker dependence on the order of the PC basis .
3	We measure the relationship between strong-lensing mass M_lens within one-half effective radius ( R_e/2 ) and the dimensional mass variable M_dim = G^-1 sigma_e2^2 R_e/2 to be log_10 [ M_lens/10^11 M_Sun ] = ( 1.03 +/- 0.04 ) log_10 [ M_dim/10^11 M_Sun ] + ( 0.54 +/- 0.02 ) ( where sigma_e2 is the projected stellar velocity dispersion within R_e/2 ) .	We use a sample of 53 massive early-type strong gravitational lens galaxies with well-measured redshifts ( ranging from z=0.06 to 0.36 ) and stellar velocity dispersions ( between 175 and 400 km/s ) from the Sloan Lens ACS ( SLACS ) Survey to derive numerous empirical scaling relations .	The ratio between central stellar velocity dispersion and isothermal lens-model velocity dispersion is nearly unity within errors .	The SLACS lenses define a fundamental plane ( FP ) that is consistent with the FP of the general population of early-type galaxies .	The near-unity slope indicates that the mass-dynamical structure of massive elliptical galaxies is independent of mass , and that the `` tilt '' of the SLACS FP is due entirely to variation in total ( luminous plus dark ) mass-to-light ratio with mass .
0	We have identified a complex galaxy cluster system in the COSMOS field via a wide angle tail ( WAT ) radio galaxy consistent with the idea that WAT galaxies can be used as tracers of clusters .	The WAT galaxy , CWAT-01 , is coincident with an elliptical galaxy resolved in the HST-ACS image .	Using the COSMOS multiwavelength data set , we derive the radio properties of CWAT-01 and use the optical and X-ray data to investigate its host environment .	The cluster hosting CWAT-01 is part of a larger assembly consisting of a minimum of four X-ray luminous clusters within ~2 Mpc distance .	We apply hydrodynamical models that combine ram pressure and buoyancy forces on CWAT-01 .
4	We show that by pushing to smaller scales and probing a considerably larger volume 21 cm experiments can provide stronger constraints on neutrino masses than even very large galaxy surveys .	Observations of neutrino oscillations show that neutrinos have mass .	However , the best constraints on this mass currently come from cosmology , via measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure .	In this paper , we explore the prospects for using low-frequency radio observations of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization to further constrain neutrino masses .	We use the Fisher matrix formalism to compare future galaxy surveys and 21 cm experiments .
4	For the unitary correlator model potential , we find a slow convergence with respect to increasing the size of the model space .	We perform coupled-cluster calculations for the doubly magic nuclei 4He , 16O , 40Ca and 48Ca , for neutron-rich isotopes of oxygen and fluorine , and employ `` bare '' and secondary renormalized nucleon-nucleon interactions .	For the nucleon-nucleon interaction from chiral effective field theory at order next-to-next-to-next-to leading order , we find that the coupled-cluster approximation including triples corrections binds nuclei within 0.4 MeV per nucleon compared to data .	We employ interactions from a resolution-scale dependent similarity renormalization group transformations and assess the validity of power counting estimates in medium-mass nuclei .	We find that the missing contributions due to three-nucleon forces are consistent with these estimates .
2	As in the DGP model , the covariant galileon theory yields two branches of solutions , depending on the sign of the galileon velocity .	We study the cosmology of a galileon scalar-tensor theory , obtained by covariantizing the decoupling lagrangian of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Poratti ( DGP ) model .	Despite being local in 3+1 dimensions , the resulting cosmological evolution is remarkably similar to that of the full 4+1-dimensional DGP framework , both for the expansion history and the evolution of density perturbations .	Perturbations are stable on one branch and ghost-like on the other .	An interesting effect uncovered in our analysis is a cosmological version of the Vainshtein screening mechanism : at early times , the galileon dynamics are dominated by self-interaction terms , resulting in its energy density being suppressed compared to matter or radiation ; once the matter density has redshifted sufficiently , the galileon becomes an important component of the energy density and contributes to dark energy .
2	In this paper we describe a detailed case study we undertook to match a model to an open-source business application .	A number of companies are trying to migrate large monolithic software systems to Service Oriented Architectures .	A common approach to do this is to first identify and describe desired services ( i.e. , create a model ) , and then to locate portions of code within the existing system that implement the described services .	We describe the systematic methodology we used , the results of the exercise , as well as several observations that throw light on the nature of this problem .	We also suggest and validate heuristics that are likely to be useful in partially automating the process of matching service descriptions to implementations .
2	Recent developments in low-coherence enhanced backscattering ( LEBS ) overcome these difficulties and enable probing photons that travel very short distances and undergo only a few scattering events .	The mechanisms of photon propagation in random media in the diffusive multiple scattering regime have been previously studied using diffusion approximation .	However , similar understanding in the low-order ( sub-diffusion ) scattering regime is not complete due to difficulties in tracking photons that undergo very few scatterings events .	In LEBS , enhanced backscattering is observed under illumination with spatial coherence length L_sc less than the scattering mean free path l_s .	In order to understand the mechanisms of photon propagation in LEBS in the subdiffusion regime , it is imperative to develop analytical and numerical models that describe the statistical properties of photon trajectories .
2	It was shown that using l_1-minimization one might stably recover a cosparse signal from a small set of random linear measurements if the operator is a frame .	Many image processing applications benefited remarkably from the theory of sparsity .	One model of sparsity is the cosparse analysis one .	Another effort has provided guarantees for dictionaries that have a near optimal projection procedure using greedy-like algorithms .	However , no claims have been given for frames .
2	The second argument is a naive estimate of dangerous fluctuations , and also suggests that $ d_ { max } =4 $ .	I give three different arguments for an upper critical dimension $ d_ { max } & gt ; 3 $ above which the 1941 Kolmogorov mean field theory becomes essentially exact , and anomalous scaling vanishes .	The first argument concerns the number of degrees of freedom in a turbulent flow and indicates that $ d_ { max } =4 $ .	The third argument is related to a known critical point of the GOY shell model when the amplitude of back energy transfer becomes small .	This third argument does not give a numerical value for $ d_ { max } $ .
0	We define a very general `` parametric connect sum '' construction which can be used to eliminate isolated conical singularities of Riemannian manifolds .	We then show that various important analytic and elliptic estimates , formulated in terms of weighted Sobolev spaces , can be obtained independently of the parameters used in the construction .	Specifically , we prove uniform estimates related to ( i ) Sobolev Embedding Theorems , ( ii ) the invertibility of the Laplace operator and ( iii ) Poincare ' and Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev type inequalities .	Our main tools are the well-known theories of weighted Sobolev spaces and elliptic operators on `` conifolds '' .	We provide an overview of both , together with an extension of the former to general Riemannian manifolds .
1	A notch in the stripe efficiently traps an injected wall stopping the domain propagation .	The propagation of a domain wall in a submicron ferromagnetic spin-valve stripe is investigated using giant magnetoresistance .	The authors show that the magnetic field at which the wall is depinned displays a stochastic nature .	Moreover , the depinning statistics are significantly different for head to head and tail-to-tail domain walls .	This is attributed to the dipolar field generated in the vicinity of the notch by the pinned layer of the spin-valve .
4	The properties of the building blocks of such resummation schemes , the multi-point propagators , are then investigated .	We show here how Renormalized Perturbation Theory ( RPT ) calculations applied to the quasi-linear growth of the large-scale structure can be carried on in presence of primordial non-Gaussian ( PNG ) initial conditions .	It is explicitly demonstrated that the series reordering scheme proposed in Bernardeau , Crocce and Scoccimarro ( 2008 ) is preserved for non-Gaussian initial conditions .	This scheme applies to the power spectrum and higher order spectra and is based on a reorganization of the contributing terms into sum of products of multi-point propagators .	In case of PNG new contributing terms appear , the importance of which is discussed in the context of current PNG models .
1	Its implications for the origination of explosive events ( small -- scale jets ) are discussed .	Magnetic reconnection in the low atmosphere , e.g.chromosphere , is investigated in various physical environments .	A 2.5-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD ) model in Cartesian coordinates is used .	It is found that the temperature and velocity of the outflow jets as a result of magnetic reconnection are strongly dependent on the physical environments , e.g.the magnitude of the magnetic field strength and the plasma density .	If the magnetic field strength is weak and the density is high , the temperature of the jets is very low ( ~10,000 K ) as well as its velocity ( ~40 km/s ) .
3	Our model allows us to study the influence of surfaces and finite size effects on the statistics of avalanches .	Crystalline plasticity is strongly interlinked with dislocation mechanics and nowadays is relatively well understood .	Concepts and physical models of plastic deformation in amorphous materials on the other hand - where the concept of linear lattice defects is not applicable - still are lagging behind .	We introduce an eigenstrain-based finite element lattice model for simulations of shear band formation and strain avalanches .	We find that even with relatively complex loading conditions and open boundary conditions , critical exponents describing avalanche statistics are unchanged , which validates the use of simpler scalar lattice-based models to study these phenomena .
0	High-resolution X-ray spectra of O-type stars revealed less wind absorption than expected from smooth winds with conventional mass-loss rates .	Various solutions have been proposed , including porous winds , optically thick clumps or an overall reduction of the mass-loss rates .	The latter has a strong impact on the evolution of the star .	Our final goal is to analyse high resolution X-ray spectra of O-type stars with a multi temperature plasma model in order to determine crucial wind parameters such as the mass loss rate , the CNO abundances and the X-ray temperature plasma distribution in the wind .	In this context we are developing a modelling tool to calculate synthetic X-ray spectra .
3	Here we use a triple QD with three addressable spin qubits to demonstrate phase control of locally entangled two or three electron spins and two non-locally entangled uncoupled spins .	Entanglement is at the heart of quantum mechanics and an essential ingredient of spin correlations in superconductivity and the Kondo effect and quantum non-locality of non-interacting particles .	Non-local entanglement is also key to quantum computation outperforming classical computers and has now begun to be applied to various atom and photon-based quantum information technologies .	Despite many technical advances in manipulating electron spins in solids , entanglement control has only been realized for two coupled qubits in quantum dots ( QDs ) , mainly by local SWAP operations .	Singlet-triplet oscillation of two locally entangled spins in adjacent dots is induced by a built-in local Zeeman field , and phase-modulated using the exchange-coupled third spin as a control bit .
3	To overcome this restriction , we propose an implicit-explicit asymptotic-preserving finite volume method .	The Navier-Stokes-Korteweg ( NSK ) equations are a classical diffuse-interface model for compressible two-phase flow .	As direct numerical simulations based on the NSK system are quite expensive and in some cases even impossible , we consider a relaxation of the NSK system , for which robust numerical methods can be designed .	However , time steps for explicit numerical schemes depend on the relaxation parameter and therefore numerical simulations in the relaxation limit are very inefficient .	We prove that the new scheme provides a consistent discretization of the NSK system in the relaxation limit and demonstrate that it is capable of accurately and efficiently computing numerical solutions of problems with realistic density ratios and small interfacial widths .
4	This paper shows that the third approach reduces to the second for a particular form of the effectiveness ratio , and illustrates all three approaches with the problem of selecting the number of components in a mixture of Gaussian distributions .	This paper compares three approaches to the problem of selecting among probability models to fit data ( 1 ) use of statistical criteria such as Akaike 's information criterion and Schwarz 's `` Bayesian information criterion , '' ( 2 ) maximization of the posterior probability of the model , and ( 3 ) maximization of an ? effectiveness ratio ?	trading off accuracy and computational cost .	The unifying characteristic of the approaches is that all can be viewed as maximizing a penalized likelihood function .	The second approach with suitable prior distributions has been shown to reduce to the first .
0	In this report we discuss static and time dependent electric fields in detector geometries with an arbitrary number of parallel layers of a given permittivity and weak conductivity .	We derive the Green 's functions i.e.the field of a point charge , as well as the weighting fields for readout pads and readout strips in these geometries .	The effect of 'bulk ' resistivity on electric fields and signals is investigated .	The spreading of charge on thin resistive layers is also discussed in detail , and the conditions for allowing the effect to be described by the diffusion equation is discussed .	We apply the results to derive fields and induced signals in Resistive Plate Chambers , Micromega detectors including resistive layers for charge spreading and discharge protection as well as detectors using resistive charge division readout like the MicroCAT detector .
0	In small volumes , the kinetics of filamentous protein self-assembly is expected to show significant variability , arising from intrinsic molecular noise .	This is not accounted for in existing deterministic models .	We introduce a simple stochastic model including nucleation and autocatalytic growth via elongation and fragmentation , which allows us to predict the effects of molecular noise on the kinetics of autocatalytic self-assembly .	We derive an analytic expression for the lag-time distribution , which agrees well with experimental results for the fibrillation of bovine insulin .	Our expression decomposes the lag time variability into contributions from primary nucleation and autocatalytic growth and reveals how each of these scales with the key kinetic parameters .
2	Most importantly for the numerical implementation , all the physical eigenvalues u_k are extreme eigenvalues of U , which allows one to extract these eigenvalues very efficiently by harmonic inversion of a pseudo-time autocorrelation function using the filter diagonalization method .	We review and further develop the recently introduced numerical approach for scattering calculations based on a so called pseudo-time Schroedinger equation , which is in turn a modification of the damped Chebyshev polynomial expansion scheme .	The method utilizes a special energy-dependent form for the absorbing potential in the time-independent Schroedinger equation , in which the complex energy spectrum E_k is mapped to u_k inside the unit disk , where u_k are the eigenvalues of some explicitly known sparse matrix U .	The computation of 2T steps of the autocorrelation function requires only T sparse real matrix-vector multiplications .	We describe and compare different schemes , effectively corresponding to different choices of the energy-dependent absorbing potential , and test them numerically by calculating resonances of the HCO molecule .
3	However it is not reasonable to think that individual sentiment categorization can encompass the new affective phenomena in digital social networks .	A persistent challenge in Complex Systems ( CS ) research is the phenomenological reconstruction of systems from raw data .	In order to face the problem , the use of sound features to reason on the system from data processing is a key step .	In the specific case of complex societal systems , sentiment analysis allows to mirror ( part of ) the affective dimension .	The present papers addresses the problem of isolating sentiment concepts which emerge in social networks .
3	Moreover , there is a probability measure $ \PP $ on $ \Omega $ modeling the distribution of the individual configurations $ \omega \in \Omega $ .	We consider a family of self-adjoint operators [ H_\omega = - \Delta + \lambda V_\omega , \quad \omega \in \Omega = \bigtimes_ { k \in \ZZ^d } \RR , ] on the Hilbert space $ \ell^2 ( \ZZ^d ) $ or $ L^2 ( \RR^d ) $ .	Here $ \Delta $ denotes the Laplace operator ( discrete or continuous ) , $ V_\omega $ is a multiplication operator given by the function $ $ V_\omega ( x ) = \sum_ { k \in \ZZ^d } \omega_k u ( x-k ) on $ \ZZ^d $ , or \quad V_\omega ( x ) = \sum_ { k \in \ZZ^d } \omega_k U ( x-k ) on $ \RR^d $ , $ $ and $ \lambda & gt ; 0 $ is a real parameter modeling the strength of the disorder present in the model .	The functions $ u : \ZZ^d \to \RR $ and $ U : \RR^d \to \RR $ are called single-site potential .	The measure $ \PP = \prod_ { k \in \ZZ^d } \mu $ is a product measure where $ \mu $ is some probability measure on $ \RR $ satisfying certain regularity assumptions .
0	We study systems which are close to or within the many-body localized ( MBL ) regime and are driven by strong electric field .	In the ergodic regime , the disorder extends applicability of the equilibrium linear -- response theory to stronger drivings , whereas the response of the MBL systems is very distinctive , revealing currents with damped oscillations .	The oscillation frequency is independent of driving and the damping is not due to heating but rather due to dephasing .	The details of damping depend on the system 's history reflecting nonergodicity of the MBL phase , while the frequency of the oscillations remains a robust hallmark of localization .	We show that the distinctive characteristic of the driven MBL phase is also a logarithmic increase of the energy and the polarization with time .
4	Our main purpose is to show that adding these new data in our analysis how much improve the fragmentation functions of $ \pi^\pm $ and $ K^\pm $ at NLO .	Recently , the { \it Belle } and { \it BABAR } Collaborations published the single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data at the center of mass energies ( $ \sqrt { s } $ ) of $ 10.52 $ GeV and $ 10.54 $ GeV , respectively .	These new data offer one the possibility to determine the nonperturbative initial conditions of fragmentation functions much more accurately .	In our previous work \cite { Soleymaninia:2013cxa } , we extracted the fragmentation functions for $ \pi^\pm $ and $ K^\pm $ particles at next-to-leading order ( NLO ) including these new data , for the first time .	These new data are in the regions of larger scaled-energy $ z $ and lower $ \sqrt { s } $ .
1	Through particular differential operators which reduce the loop order by one , we present explicit equations for the two-loop eight-point finite diagrams which relate them to massive hexagons .	In this paper we consider multi-loop integrals appearing in MHV scattering amplitudes of planar N=4 SYM .	After the reduction to two-dimensional kinematics , we solve them using symbol technology .	The terms invisible to the symbols are found through boundary conditions coming from double soft limits .	These equations are valid at all-loop order for double pentaladders and allow to solve iteratively loop integrals given lower-loop information .
3	It is also free from a dynamical sign problem .	Electron-phonon coupling plays a central role for time-dependent phenomena in condensed matter , for example in photo-excitation experiments .	We use the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method to study the real-time evolution of charge and spin correlation functions of a Peierls insulator after a quench to a noninteracting Hamiltonian .	This approach gives exact results , and fully takes into account quantum phonon effects without relying on a Hilbert space truncation .	The observed time dependence is compared to free-fermion time evolution starting from a dimerized state .
1	To measure learning in physics by high school students , either qualitatively or quantitatively , is a process in which it should be possible to identify not only the concepts and contents students failed to achieve but also the reasons of the failure .	Learning assessments are subject of discussions that envolve theoretical and practical approaches .	We propose that students ' video production offers a very effective formative assessment to teachers : as a formative assessment , it produces information that allows the understanding of where and when the learning process succeeded or failed , of identifying , as a subject or as a group , the defficiencies or misunderstandings related to the theme under analysis and their interpretation by students , and it provides also a different kind of assessment , related to some other life skills , like the ability to carry a project to its conclusion and to work cooperatively .	In this paper , we describe the use of videos produced by high school students as an assessment resource .	The students were asked to prepare a short video , which was then presented to the whole group and discussed .
4	The space $ \mathbb { GS } $ can be regarded as the operator system analog of the Gurarij operator space $ \mathbb { NG } $ introduced by Oikhberg , which is in turn a canonical operator space structure on the Gurarij Banach space .	By means of Fra\ '' { i } ss\ ' { e } theory for metric structures developed by Ben Yaacov , we show that there exists a separable $ 1 $ -exact operator system $ \mathbb { GS } $ -- -which we call the Gurarij operator system -- -of almost universal disposition .	This means that whenever $ E\subset F $ are finite-dimensional $ 1 $ -exact operator systems , $ \phi : E\rightarrow \mathbb { GS } $ is a unital complete isometry , and $ \varepsilon & gt ; 0 $ , there is a linear extension $ \widehat { \phi } : F\rightarrow \mathbb { GS } $ of $ \phi $ such that $ ||\widehat { \phi } ||_ { cb } { } ||\widehat { \phi } ^ { -1 } ||_ { cb } \leq 1+\varepsilon $ .	Such an operator system is unique up to complete order isomorphism .	Furthermore it is nuclear , homogeneous , and any separable $ 1 $ -exact operator system admits a complete order embedding into $ \mathbb { GS } $ .
2	Bump conjecture was recently solved independently and simultaneously by A. Lerner ( arXiv:1202.1860 ) and Nazarov -- Reznikov-Treil-Volberg ( arXiv:1202.2406 ) .	We give again ( see also arXiv:1112.0676 ) a proof of weighted estimate of any Calder\'on-Zygmund operator .	This is under a universal sharp sufficient condition that is weaker than the so-called bump condition .	The latter paper uses the Bellman approach .	Immediately a very natural and seemingly simple question arises how to strengthen the bump conjecture result by weakening its assumptions in a natural symmetric way .
0	We analyze the correlation structure of bipartite arbitrary-dimensional Bell inequalities via novel conditions of correlations in terms of differences of joint probabilities called correlators .	The conditions of correlations are shown to be necessary for the multi-level Bell state .	In particular , we find that the bipartite arbitrary-dimensional Bell-type inequalities introduced by Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	88 , 040404 ( 2002 ) ] and Son-Lee-Kim [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	96 , 060406 ( 2006 ) ] are composed of correlators , and we reveal that the maximal violations by the Bell state just fit the conditions of quantum correlations .
4	The bound is shown to be generally much tighter than those of other methods of comparable complexity .	MAP is the problem of finding a most probable instantiation of a set of variables in a Bayesian network given some evidence .	Unlike computing posterior probabilities , or MPE ( a special case of MAP ) , the time and space complexity of structural solutions for MAP are not only exponential in the network treewidth , but in a larger parameter known as the `` constrained '' treewidth .	In practice , this means that computing MAP can be orders of magnitude more expensive than computing posterior probabilities or MPE .	This paper introduces a new , simple upper bound on the probability of a MAP solution , which admits a tradeoff between the bound quality and the time needed to compute it .
1	Protein folding is a case in point .	Processes that proceed reliably from a variety of initial conditions to a unique final form , regardless of moderately changing conditions , are of obvious importance in biophysics .	We show that the action principle can be applied directly to study the stability of biological processes .	The action principle in classical physics starts with the first variation of the action and leads immediately to the equations of motion .	The second variation of the action leads in a natural way to powerful theorems that provide quantitative treatment of stability and focusing and also explain how some very complex processes can behave as though some seemingly important forces drop out .
3	The zero field electronic transport of all samples on LAO shows thermally activated behavior , while the thermally activated behavior is suppressed and a metal-like transport is appearing for the samples on STO as the LCMO layer thickness increases above 10 unit cell .	Epitaxial trilayer structures consisting of two antifferomagnetic charge/orbital order insulators Pr0.5Ca0.5MnO3 ( PCMO ) and La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 ( LCMO ) are grown on ( 001 ) -oriented SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates .	In this trilayer series , a thin film of LCMO with various thicknesses is sandwiched between the two fixed thicknesses of PCMO .	These samples show a Curie temperature with a hysteretic field dependent magnetization at 10 K , although the individual compounds are antiferromagnetic .	We have discussed these magnetic and transport properties of the trilayer structures on STO and LAO by the interfacial effect due to the stabilized CO state and the vibration mode of Jahn-Teller distortion .
4	This , self-adjusted layer has just a thickness appropriate for NC charging by direct electron tunneling .	Binary collision simulations of high-fluence 1 keV Si ion implantation into 8 nm thick SiO2 films on ( 001 ) Si were combined with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of Si nanocrystal ( NC ) formation by phase separation during annealing .	For nonvolatile memory applications , these simulations help to control size and location of NCs .	For low concentrations of implanted Si , NCs form via nucleation , growth and Ostwald ripening , whereas for high concentrations Si separates by spinodal decomposition .	In both regimes , NCs form above a thin NC free oxide layer at the SiO2/Si interface .
4	The NZRPs follow trajectories , and are finally trapped in circles of minimum radii $ \sim 0.03a - 0.005a $ with rotation velocities reaching $ \sim 6544-8445 $ km sec $ ^ { -1 } $ .	Spiral galaxies are considered as static , spherically symmetric Dark Matter Configurations ( DMC ) in which non-zero rest-mass particles ( NZRPs ) move along appropriate trajectories .	Using general relativity ( GR ) , we show that a mass of dark matter about 127 - 212 $ \times 10^ { 11 } M_ { \odot } $ is required inside the sphere of size $ a \sim 10 $ kpc for agreement with the observed typical orbital velocity ranging from 150 to 250 km sec $ ^ { -1 } $ .	In our model , it is possible to obtain flat , slightly rising , and even declining rotation curves .	The model self-evidently explains the reason why most of the spirals show almost flat or slightly rising rotation curves and very few show declining curves .
1	Characterizations of Wakamatsu-silting complexes are given .	We introduce Wakamatsu-silting complexes ( resp. , Wakamatsu-tilting complexes ) as a common generalization of both silting complexes ( resp. , tilting complexes ) and Wakamatsu-tilting modules .	In particular , we show that a complex $ T $ is Wakamatsu-silting if and only if its dual $ DT $ is Wakamatsu-silting .	It is conjectured that all compact Wakamatsu-silting complexes are just silting complexes .	We prove that the conjecture lies under the finitistic dimension conjecture .
3	However , we show that measurements of b to s gamma together with naturalness arguments lead to an upper bound on tan beta , strengthening the naturalness case for heavy Higgs states near the TeV scale .	We explore naturalness constraints on the masses of the heavy Higgs bosons H^0 , H^+/- , and A^0 in supersymmetric theories .	We show that , in any extension of MSSM which accommodates the 125 GeV Higgs at the tree level , one can derive an upper bound on the SUSY Higgs masses from naturalness considerations .	As is well-known for the MSSM , these bounds become weak at large tan beta .	The precise bound depends somewhat on the SUSY mediation scale : allowing a factor of 10 tuning in the stop sector , the measured rate of b to s gamma implies tan beta & lt ; 30 for running down from 10 TeV but tan beta & lt ; 4 for mediation at or above 100 TeV , placing m_A near the TeV scale for natural EWSB .
3	The peculiar nature of the dynamics is encoded in the correlations developing out of equilibrium .	We investigate the dissipative dynamics of a quantum critical system in contact with a thermal bath .	In analogy with the standard protocol employed to analyze aging , we study the response of a system to a sudden change of the bath temperature .	The specific example of the XY model in a transverse magnetic field whose spins are locally coupled to a set of bosonic baths is considered .	By means of a kinetic equation we analyze the spin-spin correlations and block correlations .
4	A biometric measure as a means of enhancing the security has emerged from the discourse .	Security measures at banks can play a critical , contributory role in preventing attacks on customers .	These measures are of paramount importance when considering vulnerabilities and causation in civil litigation .	Banks must meet certain standards in order to ensure a safe and secure banking environment for their customers .	This paper focuses on vulnerabilities and the increasing wave of criminal activities occurring at Automated Teller Machines ( ATMs ) where quick cash is the prime target for criminals rather than at banks themselves .
3	We found that while the physically non-interacting identical protein domains ( WW ) show nearly symmetric mechanical properties at low tension , reflected , e.g. , in the similarity of their distributions of unfolding times , these properties become distinctly different when tension is increased .	Cooperativity is a hallmark of proteins , many of which show a modular architecture comprising discrete structural domains .	Detecting and describing dynamic couplings between structural regions is difficult in view of the many-body nature of protein-protein interactions .	By utilizing the GPU-based computational acceleration , we carried out simulations of the protein forced unfolding for the dimer WW-WW of the all-beta-sheet WW domains used as a model multidomain protein .	Moreover , the uncorrelated unfolding transitions at a low pulling force become increasingly more correlated ( dependent ) at higher forces .
3	Our sample contains twice as many objects with R & gt ; 50 kpc as previous surveys .	We present a spectroscopic sample of 910 distant halo stars from the Hypervelocity Star survey from which we derive the velocity dispersion profile of the Milky Way halo .	The sample is a mix of 74 % evolved horizontal branch stars and 26 % blue stragglers .	We estimate distances to the stars using observed colors , metallicities , and stellar evolution tracks .	We compute the velocity dispersion profile in two ways : with a parametric method based on a Milky Way potential model , and with a non-parametric method based on the caustic technique originally developed to measure galaxy cluster mass profiles .
4	The abundances of such species are useful tracers of physical conditions such as the radiation field and the electron fraction .	The H3+ ion plays a key role in the chemistry of dense interstellar gas clouds where stars and planets are forming .	The low temperatures and high extinctions of such clouds make direct observations of H3+ impossible , but lead to large abundances of H2D+ and D2H+ which are very useful probes of the early stages of star and planet formation .	Maps of H2D+ and D2H+ pure rotational line emission toward star-forming regions show that the strong deuteration of H3+ is the result of near-complete molecular depletion of CNO-bearing molecules onto grain surfaces , which quickly disappears as cores warm up after stars have formed .	In the warmer parts of interstellar gas clouds , H3+ transfers its proton to other neutrals such as CO and N2 , leading to a rich ionic chemistry .
2	Once it receives the packet from other nodes , it drops all the packets causing loss of critical information .	Wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to several attacks , one of them being the black hole attack .	A black hole is a malicious node that attracts all the traffic in the network by advertising that it has the shortest path in the network .	In this paper we propose a reliability analysis mechanism .	The proposed reliability analysis scheme overcomes the shortcomings of existing cooperative black hole attack using AODV routing protocol .
4	The equivalence of absorption probabilities for various modes has implications for the correlation functions on the field , including subleading contributions on the field-theory side .	The absorption in the extremal D3-brane background is studied for a class of massless fields whose linear perturbations leave the ten-dimensional background metric unperturbed , as well as the minimally-coupled massive scalar .	We find that various fields have the same absorption probability as that of the dilaton-axion system , which is given exactly via the Mathieu equation .	We analyze the features of the absorption cross-sections in terms of effective Schr\ '' odinger potentials , conjecture a general form of the dual effective potentials , and provide explicit numerical results for the whole energy range .	As expected , all partial-wave absorption probabilities tend to zero ( one ) at low ( large ) energies , and exhibit an oscillatory pattern as a function of energy .
1	We review the available techniques for accurate , fast , and reliable computation of these two hypergeometric functions in different parameter and variable regimes .	The two most commonly used hypergeometric functions are the confluent hypergeometric function and the Gauss hypergeometric function .	The methods that we investigate include Taylor and asymptotic series computations , Gauss-Jacobi quadrature , numerical solution of differential equations , recurrence relations , and others .	We discuss the results of numerical experiments used to determine the best methods , in practice , for each parameter and variable regime considered .	We provide 'roadmaps ' with our recommendation for which methods should be used in each situation .
3	Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariate approaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual imaging measurement in isolation .	This volume is a collection of contributions from the 5th Workshop on Machine Learning and Interpretation in Neuroimaging ( MLINI ) at the Neural Information Processing Systems ( NIPS 2015 ) conference .	Modern multivariate statistical methods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being increasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging , from cognitive state detection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis .	Multivariate pattern analysis methods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional signals , such as brain images , and outcomes of interest , such as the category of a stimulus , a type of a mental state of a subject , or a specific mental disorder .	We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how questions in neuroscience are framed , and that the machine-learning mind set is now entering modern psychology and behavioral studies .
2	The $ p_ { T } $ and rapidity acceptance dependence study for the moments of net-proton distribution show that the larger the acceptance is , the greater the deviation from unity .	We present the energy dependence of moments of net-proton and net-charge multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions measured by the STAR experiment in the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan ( BES ) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) .	By using the time of flight detector for particle identification , the upper transverse momentum ( $ p_ { T } $ ) limit for proton and anti-proton is extended from 0.8 GeV/c up to 2 GeV/c .	The most pronounced structure is found in the energy dependence of { \KV } of net-proton distributions from the $ 0\sim5 % $ most central collisions within $ 0.4 & lt ; p_ { T } & lt ; 2 $ GeV/c and at mid-rapidity $ |y| & lt ; 0.5 $ .	At energies above 39 GeV , the values of { \KV } are close to unity and for energies below 39 GeV , it shows significant deviation below unity around 19.6 and 27 GeV , then a large increase above unity is observed at 7.7 GeV .
1	In locusts , the corresponding escape behavior correlates with the activity of the lobula giant movement detector ( LGMD ) neuron .	Many species show avoidance reactions in response to looming object approaches .	During an object approach , its firing rate was reported to gradually increase until a peak is reached , and then it declines quickly .	The ETA-function predicts that the LGMD activity is a product between an exponential function of angular size and angular velocity , and that peak activity is reached before time-to-contact ( ttc ) .	The ETA-function has become the prevailing LGMD model because it reproduces many experimental observations , and even experimental evidence for the multiplicative operation was reported .
0	A new fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS accelerator is proposed that will use decays of charm mesons to search for Heavy Neutral Leptons ( HNLs ) , which are right-handed partners of the Standard Model neutrinos .	The existence of such particles is strongly motivated by theory , as they can simultaneously explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe , account for the pattern of neutrino masses and oscillations and provide a Dark Matter candidate .	Cosmological constraints on the properties of HNLs now indicate that the majority of the interesting parameter space for such particles was beyond the reach of the previous searches at the PS191 , BEBC , CHARM , CCFR and NuTeV experiments .	For HNLs with mass below 2 GeV , the proposed experiment will improve on the sensitivity of previous searches by four orders of magnitude and will cover a major fraction of the parameter space favoured by theoretical models .	The experiment requires a 400 GeV proton beam from the SPS with a total of 2x10^20 protons on target , achievable within five years of data taking .
2	Let $ q_1 , \ldots , q_r $ be distinct primes which are congruent to $ 1 $ modulo $ 4 $ and inert in the field $ F = \mathbb Q ( \sqrt { -7 } ) $ , and let $ E^ { ( R ) } $ be the twist of $ E $ by the quadratic extension $ \mathbb Q ( \sqrt { R } ) /\mathbb Q $ , where $ R=q_1\ldots q_r $ .	In this paper , we show that Tian 's induction method can be generalised to study the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for the quadratic twists , both with global root number $ +1 $ and with global root number $ -1 $ , of certain elliptic curves $ E $ defined over $ \mathbb Q $ .	In particular , for the curve $ E = X_0 ( 49 ) $ we prove the following results .	Then we show that the complex L-series of $ E^ { ( R ) } $ does not vanish at $ s=1 $ , and the full Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is true for $ E^ { ( R ) } $ .	Let $ l_0 $ be a prime number which is congruent to $ 3 $ modulo $ 4 $ , and is such that $ 7 $ splits in the field $ K = \mathbb Q ( \sqrt { -l_0 } ) $ .
0	Let C be small category and A an arbitrary category .	Consider the category C ( A ) whose objects are functors from C to A , and whose morphisms are natural transformations .	Given a functor F : A -- & gt ; B one obtains an induced functor F_C : C ( A ) -- & gt ; C ( B ) .	If A and B are abelian categories , we have that C ( A ) and C ( B ) are also abelian , and one has two functors R ( F_C ) : D ( C ( A ) ) -- & gt ; D ( C ( B ) ) and ( RF ) _ C : C ( D ( A ) ) -- & gt ; C ( D ( B ) ) .	The goals of this paper are : 1 ) to find a relationship between D ( C ( A ) ) and C ( D ( A ) ) ; 2 ) to relate the functors R ( F_C ) and ( RF ) _C .
3	On this model , we introduce the lattice effects , which induce the periodic potential and break the translational invariance of the boundary field theory .	We study the lattice effects on the simple holographic toy model ; massive U ( 1 ) gauge theory for the bulk action .	The mass term is for the U ( 1 ) gauge symmetry breaking in the bulk .	Without the lattice , the AC conductivity of this model shows similar results to the holographic superconductor with the energy gap .	Without the lattice , due to the translational invariance and the mass term , there is a delta function peak at zero frequency on the AC conductivity .
1	Here we discuss two such relations : the lag-luminosity relation and the newly discovered duration-luminosity relation of GRB pulses .	Relations linking the temporal or/and spectral properties of the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts ( hereafter GRBs ) to the absolute luminosity are of great importance as they both constrain the radiation mechanisms and represent potential distance indicators .	We aim to extend our previous work on the origin of spectral lags , using the duration-luminosity relation recently discovered by Hakkila et al .	to connect lags and luminosity .	We also present a way to test this relation which has originally been established with a limited sample of only 12 pulses .
2	MPI ( Message Passing Interface ) which remains the dominant model used in high-performance computing today faces this challenge .	The current trend of multicore architectures on shared memory systems underscores the need of parallelism .	While there are some programming model to express parallelism , thread programming model has become a standard to support these system such as OpenMP , and POSIX threads .	Previous version of MPI which is MPI-1 has no shared memory concept , and Current MPI version 2 which is MPI-2 has a limited support for shared memory systems .	In this research , MPI-2 version of MPI will be compared with OpenMP to see how well does MPI perform on multicore / SMP ( Symmetric Multiprocessor ) machines .
4	Finally we give an application of the results in the theory of constrained Hamiltonian systems , related to the motion of charged particles in the quantisation limit in an electromagnetic field , which in turn leads to a list of normal forms of generic singular Lagrangians ( of first order in the velocities ) on the plane .	We consider here the analytic classification of pairs $ ( \omega , f ) $ where $ \omega $ is a germ of a 2-form on the plane and $ f $ is a quasihomogeneous function germ with isolated singularities .	We consider only the case where $ \omega $ is singular , i.e.it vanishes non-degenerately along a smooth line $ H ( \omega ) $ ( Martinet case ) and the function $ f $ is such that the pair $ ( f , H ( \omega ) ) $ defines an isolated boundary singularity .	In analogy with the ordinary case ( for symplectic forms on the plane ) we show that the moduli in the classification problem are analytic functions of 1-variable and that their number is exactly equal to the Milnor number of the corresponding boundary singularity .	Moreover we derive a normal form for the pair $ ( \omega , f ) $ involving exactly these functional invariants .
2	We prove that all direct sum decompositions of Krull-Schmidt artinian modules refine into finite indecomposable direct sum decompositions and we prove that this condition is strictly stronger than the condition of a module admitting finite indecomposable direct sum decompositions .	We study direct sum decompositions of modules satisfying the descending chain condition on direct summands .	We call modules satisfying this condition Krull-Schmidt artinian .	We also study the problem of existence and uniqueness of direct sum decompositions of Krull-Schmidt artinian modules in terms of given classes of modules .	We present also brief studies of direct sum decompositions of modules with deviation on direct summands and of modules with finite Krull-Schmidt length .
4	We compute a lower limit on the expelled mass of $ 3.5 \times 10^ { -3 } M_ { \odot } $ , large enough to be relevant for heavy element nucleosynthesis .	We present a detailed , 3D hydrodynamics study of the neutrino-driven winds that emerge from the remnant of a NS merger .	Our simulations are performed with the Newtonian , Eulerian code FISH , augmented by a detailed , spectral neutrino leakage scheme that accounts for heating due to neutrino absorption in optically thin conditions .	Consistent with the 2D study of Dessart et al .	( 2009 ) , we find that a strong baryonic wind is blown out along the original binary rotation axis within $ 100 $ ms after the merger .
1	This may have been observed not only in the gamma-ray spectrum of young supernova remnants ( SNRs ) such as RX J1713.7-3946 , but also in the spectrum of CRs showering on the Earth .	The spectrum of cosmic rays ( CRs ) is affected by their escape from an acceleration site .	The escape-limited model of cosmic-ray acceleration is studied in general .	We discuss the spectrum of CRs running away from the acceleration site .	The model may also constrain the spectral index at the acceleration site and the ansatz with respect to the unknown injection process into the particle acceleration .
0	We present a systematic derivation of a model based on the central moment lattice Boltzmann equation that rigorously maintains Galilean invariance of forces to simulate inertial frame independent flow fields .	In this regard , the central moments , i.e.moments shifted by the local fluid velocity , of the discrete source terms of the lattice Boltzmann equation are obtained by matching those of the continuous full Boltzmann equation of various orders .	This results in an exact hierarchical identity between the central moments of the source terms of a given order and the components of the central moments of the distribution functions and sources of lower orders .	The corresponding source terms in velocity space are then obtained from an exact inverse transformation due to a suitable choice of orthogonal basis for moments .	Furthermore , such a central moment based kinetic model is further extended by incorporating reduced compressibility effects to represent incompressible flow .
4	They are also satisfied when S is arbitrary , M has a finite projective resolution as an S-module , and $ \Ext^n_S ( M , S ) =0 $ for all $ n & gt ; 0 $ .	A triangular matrix ring A is defined by a triplet ( R , S , M ) where R and S are rings and M is an S-R-bimodule .	In the main theorem of this paper we show that if T is a tilting S-module , then under certain homological conditions on M as an S-module , one can extend T to a tilting complex over A inducing a derived equivalence between A and another triangular matrix ring specified by ( S ' , R , M ' ) , where the ring S ' and the R-S'-bimodule M ' depend only on T and M , and S ' is derived equivalent to S. Note that no conditions on the ring R are needed .	These conditions are satisfied when S is an Artin algebra of finite global dimension and M is finitely generated as an S-module .	In this case , $ ( S ' , R , M ' ) = ( S , R , DM ) $ where D is the duality on the category of finitely generated S-modules .
1	Following the approach introduced by Erez and Zamir , we show that lattice codes are optimal for the family of Gaussian broadcast channels where the source transmits a set of common messages to all receivers and each receiver has 'coded side information ' , i.e. , prior information in the form of linear combinations of the messages .	Lattices possess elegant mathematical properties which have been previously used in the literature to show that structured codes can be efficient in a variety of communication scenarios , including coding for the additive white Gaussian noise ( AWGN ) channel , dirty-paper channel , Wyner-Ziv coding , coding for relay networks and so forth .	This channel model , which is an instance of the Gaussian version of index coding , is motivated by applications to multi-terminal networks where the nodes may have access to coded versions of the messages from previous signal hops or through orthogonal channels .	The known results on the capacity of this channel are based on random Gaussian codebooks .	The structured coding scheme proposed in this paper utilizes Construction A lattices designed over prime finite fields , and 'algebraic binning ' at the decoders to expurgate the channel code and obtain good lattice subcodes , for every possible set of linear combinations available as side information .
4	The resulting deeply supervised structure makes the training much easier and also produces better classification results on ImageNet and the recently released , larger MIT Places dataset	One of the most promising ways of improving the performance of deep convolutional neural networks is by increasing the number of convolutional layers .	However , adding layers makes training more difficult and computationally expensive .	In order to train deeper networks , we propose to add auxiliary supervision branches after certain intermediate layers during training .	We formulate a simple rule of thumb to determine where these branches should be added .
3	As a side-result we give an elementary non-heuristic purely combinatoric derivation of Turing 's famous estimator .	We consider the problem of converting offline estimators into an online predictor or estimator with small extra regret .	Formally this is the problem of merging a collection of probability measures over strings of length 1,2,3 , ... into a single probability measure over infinite sequences .	We describe various approaches and their pros and cons on various examples .	Our main technical contribution is to determine the computational complexity of online estimators with good guarantees in general .
2	( The previous one was also from 4U 1636-53 , and was observed with EXOSAT . )	We have discovered a triple-peaked X-ray burst from the low-mass X-ray binary ( LMXB ) 4U 1636-53 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) .	This is the first triple-peaked burst reported from any LMXB using RXTE , and it is only the second burst of this kind observed from any source .	From fits to time-resolved spectra , we find that this is not a radius-expansion burst , and that the same triple-peaked pattern seen in the X-ray light curve is also present in the bolometric light curve of the burst .	Similar to what was previously observed in double-peaked bursts from this source , the radius of the emitting area increases steadily during the burst , with short periods in between during which the radius remains more or less constant .
4	These findings provide evidence on how endothelial cell-cell junctions impact the vascular network , and change our perception about normal and aberrant angiogenesis .	Exchanges between the blood compartment and the surrounding tissues require a tight regulation by the endothelial barrier .	Recent reports inferred that VE-cadherin , an endothelial specific cell-cell adhesion molecule , plays a pivotal role in the formation , maturation and remodeling of the vascular wall .	Indeed , a growing number of permeability inducing factors ( PIFs ) was shown to elicit signaling mechanisms culminating in VE-cadherin destabilization and global alteration of the junctional architecture .	Conversely , anti-PIFs protect from VE-cadherin disruption and enhance cell cohesion .
4	In this report , we review several techniques to manage power consumption of PCM .	In recent years , the energy consumption of computing systems has increased and a large fraction of this energy is consumed in main memory .	Towards this , researchers have proposed use of non-volatile memory , such as phase change memory ( PCM ) , which has low read latency and power ; and nearly zero leakage power .	However , the write latency and power of PCM are very high and this , along with limited write endurance of PCM present significant challenges in enabling wide-spread adoption of PCM .	To address this , several architecture-level techniques have been proposed .
3	We analyze the critical points of this potential and present an analytic as well as several numerical finite-action solutions .	We present solutions of the Yang-Mills equation on cylinders $ \mathbb R\times G/H $ over coset spaces with Sasakian structure and odd dimension $ 2m+1 $ .	The gauge potential is assumed to be $ SU ( m ) $ -equivariant , parametrized by two real , scalar-valued functions .	Yang-Mills theory with torsion in this setup reduces to the Newtonian mechanics of a point particle moving in $ \mathbb R^2 $ under the influence of an inverted potential .	Apart from the Yang-Mills solutions that constitute $ SU ( m ) $ -equivariant instanton configurations , we construct periodic sphaleron solutions on $ S^1\times G/H $ and dyon solutions on $ i\mathbb R\times G/H $ .
2	Renormalization is carried out using the heat kernel expansion and zeta functional regularization .	We calculate the vacuum energy of a spinor field in the background of a Nielsen-Olesen vortex .	We use the method of representing the vacuum energy in terms of the Jost function on the imaginary momentum axis .	With this method well convergent sums and integrals emerge which allow for an efficient numerical calculation of the vacuum energy in the given case where the background is not known analytically but only numerically .	The vacuum energy is calculated for several choices of the parameters and it turns out to give small corrections to the classical energy .
1	The principal target for dark matter searches with CTA is the centre of the Galactic Halo .	The Cherenkov Telescope Array ( CTA ) will have a unique chance of discovery for a large range of masses in Weakly Interacting Massive Particles models of dark matter .	The best strategy is to perform CTA observations within a few degrees of the Galactic Centre , with the Galactic Centre itself and the most intense diffuse emission regions removed from the analysis .	Assuming a cuspy dark matter density profile for the Milky Way , 500 hours of observations in this region provide sensitivities to and below the thermal cross-section of dark matter annihilations , for masses between a few hundred GeV and a few tens of TeV ; therefore CTA will have a significant chance of discovery in some models .	Since the dark matter density in the Milky Way is far from certain in the inner kpc region , other targets are also proposed for observation , like ultra-faint dwarf galaxies such as Segue 1 with 100 hours per year proposed .
3	Distribution-function dynamics of noncondensate polaritons have been investigated .	Time evolution of a nonequilibrium polariton condensate has been studied in the framework of a microscopic approach .	It has been shown that due to polariton-polariton scattering a significant condensate depletion takes place in a comparatively short time interval .	The condensate decay occurs in the form of multiple echo signals .	It has been shown that at the initial stage of evolution the distribution function has the form of a bell .
4	We comment on this study and consider an alternative in which the link to low-energy quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) and its pattern of chiral symmetry-breaking is more readily discernible .	It has been customary to use data from the Oklo natural nuclear reactor to place bounds on the change that has occurred in the electromagnetic fine structure constant $ \alpha $ over the last 2 billion years .	Alternatively , an analysis could be based on a recently proposed expression for shifts in resonance energies which relates them to changes in both $ \alpha $ and the average $ m_q $ of the $ u $ and $ d $ current quark masses , and which makes explicit the dependence on mass number $ A $ and atomic number $ Z $ .	( Recent model independent results on hadronic $ \sigma $ -terms suggest sensitivity to the strange quark mass is negligible . )	The most sophisticated analysis , to date , of the quark mass term invokes a calculation of the nuclear mean-field within the Walecka model of quantum hadrodynamics .
0	Analysis of experimental data shows that the metal -- insulator transition is possible in materials composed of atoms of only metallic elements .	Such a transition may occur in spite of the high concentration of valence electrons .	It requires stable atomic configurations to act as deep potential traps absorbing dozens of valence electrons .	This means in essence that bulk metallic space transforms into an assembly of identical quantum dots .	Depending on the parameters , such a material either does contain delocalized electrons ( metal ) or does not contain such electrons ( insulator ) .
2	At the free interface , driven by the plasma velocity , the total pressure is continuous and the magnetic field on both sides is tangent to the boundary .	We consider the free boundary problem for the plasma-vacuum interface in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics ( MHD ) .	In the plasma region , the flow is governed by the usual compressible MHD equations , while in the vacuum region we consider the Maxwell system for the electric and the magnetic fields , in order to investigate the well-posedness of the problem , in particular in relation with the electric field in vacuum .	Under suitable stability conditions satisfied at each point of the plasma-vacuum interface , we derive a basic a priori estimate for solutions to the linearized problem .	The proof follows by a suitable secondary symmetrization of the Maxwell equations in vacuum and the energy method .
0	The interaction of two types of vesicle systems was investigated : micrometer-sized , giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) formed from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( POPC ) and submicrometer-sized , large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) formed from oleic acid and oleate , both in a buffered aqueous solution ( pH=8.8 ) .	Individual POPC GUVs were transferred with a micropipette into a suspension of oleic acid/oleate LUVs , and the shape changes of the GUVs were monitored using optical microscopy .	The behavior of POPC GUVs upon transfer into a 0.8 mM suspension of oleic acid , in which oleic acid/oleate forms vesicular bilayer structures , was qualitatively different from the behavior upon transfer into a 0.3 mM suspension of oleic acid/oleate , in which oleic acid/oleate is predominantly present in the form of monomers and possibly non-vesicular aggregates .	In both cases , changes in vesicle morphology were observed within tens of seconds after the transfer .	Vesicle initially started to evaginate .
4	For galaxies with higher mass-replenishment rates and a denser interstellar medium ( ISM ) , the dominant feature is a dense ram-pressure stripped tail .	The dynamical signatures of the interaction between galaxies in clusters and the intracluster medium ( ICM ) can potentially yield significant information about the structure and dynamical history of clusters .	To develop our understanding of this phenomenon we present results from numerical modelling of the galaxy/ICM interaction , as the galaxy moves through the cluster .	The simulations have been performed for a broad range , of ICM temperatures ( kT = 1,4 and 8 keV ) , representative of poor clusters or groups through to rich clusters .	There are several dynamical features that can be identified in these simulations ; for supersonic galaxy motion , a leading bow-shock is present , and also a weak gravitationally focussed wake or tail behind the galaxy ( analogous to Bondi-Hoyle accretion ) .
2	Furthermore , we focus our attention on the large invariant mass and large transverse momentum kinematic regions , characteristic of boosted top quarks .	We review a Soft Collinear Effective Theory approach to the study of factorization and resummation of QCD effects in top-quark pair production .	In particular , we consider differential cross sections such as the top-quark pair invariant mass distribution and the top-quark transverse momentum and rapidity distributions .	We discuss the factorization of the differential cross section in the double soft gluon emission and small top-quark mass limit , both in Pair Invariant Mass ( PIM ) and One Particle Inclusive ( 1PI ) kinematics .	The factorization formulas can be employed in order to implement the simultaneous resummation of soft emission and small mass effects up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy .
1	Failure of a fraction of nodes in one network may lead to a failure in another network .	Many systems , ranging from engineering to medical to societal , can only be properly characterized by multiple interdependent networks whose normal functioning depends on one another .	This in turn may cause further malfunction of additional nodes in the first network and so on .	Such a cascade of failures , triggered by a failure of a small faction of nodes in only one network , may lead to the complete fragmentation of all networks .	We introduce a model and an analytical framework for studying interdependent networks .
0	We consider Hanany-Witten setups of 3- and 5-branes in type IIB string theory that realize N= ( 1,0 ) , ( 2,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) gauged WZW models in 1+1 dimensions .	The gauged WZW models arise as theories residing on the boundary of D3 branes ending on D5 branes .	From the point of view of low energy dynamics the D5 branes play the role of half-BPS co-dimension-1 defects ( domain walls ) in 3d N=1 or N=2 Chern-Simons theories .	Extending the analysis of previous works on the subject of boundary conditions in ( supersymmetric ) Chern-Simons theory , we discuss in detail the field theory construction of a large class of Chern-Simons domain wall theories and its embedding in open string dynamics .	Finally , we exhibit how standard brane moves that result to 3d Seiberg duality , translate in our setup to a generalized level-rank duality in gauged-WZW models .
0	The protein p53 has a well established role in protecting genomic integrity in human cells .	When DNA is damaged p53 induces the cell cycle arrest to prevent the transmission of the damage to cell progeny , triggers the production of proteins for DNA repair and ultimately calls for apoptosis .	In particular , the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop seems to be the key circuit in this response of cells to damage .	For many years , based on measurements over populations of cells it was believed that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop was the responsible for the existence of damped oscillations in the levels of p53 and Mdm2 after DNA damage .	However , recent measurements in individual human cells have shown that p53 and its regulator Mdm2 develop sustained oscillations over long periods of time even in the absence of stress .
2	Due to the interaction between the two particle species optical nonlinearities appear , leading to a quantum phase transition from Mott to superfluid phase .	The enormous progress in controlling quantum optical and atomic systems has prompted ideas for new experimental realizations of strongly correlated many-body systems operating with light .	These systems consist of photons confined in optical cavities , which interact strongly with atoms or atomiclike structures .	Here , we address the Tavis-Cummings lattice model , which describes light-matter systems containing multiple atomiclike structures in each cavity .	In particular , we investigate the phase boundary delimiting Mott from superfluid phase and the elementary excitations of the two-dimensional Tavis-Cummings lattice model in dependence of the number of atomiclike structures per cavity .
3	While all finite Markov chains are trivially decisive ( for every set F ) , this also holds for many classes of infinite Markov chains .	We consider qualitative and quantitative verification problems for infinite-state Markov chains .	We call a Markov chain decisive w.r.t .	a given set of target states F if it almost certainly eventually reaches either F or a state from which F can no longer be reached .	Infinite Markov chains which contain a finite attractor are decisive w.r.t .
4	Therefore , sun-like stars , upper main sequence stars and red giants will spiral inward and then outward with respect to the hole in this stable mass transfer process , while lower main sequence stars , brown dwarfs and white dwarfs will always spiral outward .	We have calculated the equilibrium properties of a star in a circular , equatorial orbit about a Super-Massive Black Hole ( SMBH ) , when the star fills and overflows its Roche lobe .	The mass transfer time scale is anticipated to be long compared with the dynamical time and short compared with the thermal time of the star , so that the entropy as a function of the interior mass is conserved .	We have studied how the stellar entropy , pressure , radius , mean density , and orbital angular momentum vary when the star is evolved adiabatically , for a representative set of stars .	We have shown that the stellar orbits change with the stellar mean density .
0	We revisit a non-perturbative space-time curvature theory , underlying a two form U ( 1 ) gauge dynamics , on a D4-brane .	In particular , two different gauge choices for a two form are explored underlying the dynamics of a geometric torsion in a second order formalism .	We obtain two non-extremal quantum Kerr geometries in five dimensions on a pair of $ ( D { \bar D } ) _4 $ -brane in a type IIA superstring theory .	The quantum vacua are described by a vanishing torsion in a gauge choice , underlying a geometric realization , on a non-BPS brane .	It is argued that the quantum Kerr vacua undergo tunneling and lead to a five dimensional Kerr black hole in Einstein vacuum .
2	A plastic scintillator telescope system has been set up to measure the cosmic ray flux .	China JinPing underground Laboratory ( CJPL ) is the deepest underground laboratory presently running in the world .	In such a deep underground laboratory , the cosmic ray flux is a very important and necessary parameter for rare event experiments .	The performance of the telescope system has been studied using the cosmic ray on the ground laboratory near CJPL .	Based on the underground experimental data taken from November 2010 to December 2011 in CJPL , which has effective live time of 171 days , the cosmic ray muon flux in CJPL is measured to be ( 2.0+-0.4 ) *10^ ( -10 ) / ( cm^2 ) / ( s ) .
1	We deduce general conditions under which gamma-ray spectra from such sources would be significantly affected by axion-photon mixing .	Astrophysical gamma-ray sources come in a variety of sizes and magnetizations .	We show that , depending on strength and coherence of the magnetic field , axion couplings down to ~ 1/ ( 10**13 GeV ) can give rise to significant axion-photon conversions in the environment of accreting massive black holes .	Resonances can occur between the axion mass term and the plasma frequency term as well as between the plasma frequency term and the vacuum Cotton-Mouton shift .	Both resonances and non-resonant transitions could induce detectable features or even strong suppressions in finite energy intervals of gamma-ray spectra from active galactic nuclei .
1	Written in Python , it is designed to be simple and efficient , accessible to non-experts , and reusable in various contexts .	Scikit-learn is an increasingly popular machine learning li- brary .	In this paper , we present and discuss our design choices for the application programming interface ( API ) of the project .	In particular , we describe the simple and elegant interface shared by all learning and processing units in the library and then discuss its advantages in terms of composition and reusability .	The paper also comments on implementation details specific to the Python ecosystem and analyzes obstacles faced by users and developers of the library .
2	This is because the waves are in fact , exponentially small , and thus beyond-all-orders of regular asymptotics ; their formation is a consequence of the divergence of the asymptotic series and the associated Stokes Phenomenon .	When traditional linearised theory is used to study gravity-capillary waves produced by flow past an obstruction , the geometry of the object is assumed to be small in one or several of its dimensions .	In order to preserve the nonlinear nature of the obstruction , asymptotic expansions in the low-Froude or low-Bond number limits can be derived , but here , the solutions invariably predict a waveless surface at every order .	By applying techniques in exponential asymptotics to this problem , we have discovered the existence of new classes of gravity-capillary waves , from which the usual linear solutions form but a special case .	In this paper , we present the initial theory for deriving these waves through a study of gravity-capillary flow over a linearised step ; this will be done using two approaches : in the first , we derive the surface waves using the the standard method of Fourier transforms ; in the second , we derive the same result using exponential asymptotics .
2	This research presents an Ontology based theoretical framework in the context of medical intelligence and country/region .	Disease Intelligence ( DI ) is based on the acquisition and aggregation of fragmented knowledge of diseases at multiple sources all over the world to provide valuable information to doctors , researchers and information seeking community .	Some diseases have their own characteristics changed rapidly at different places of the world and are reported on documents as unrelated and heterogeneous information which may be going unnoticed and may not be quickly available .	Ontology is designed for storing information about rapidly spreading and changing diseases with incorporating existing disease taxonomies to genetic information of both humans and infectious organisms .	It further maps disease symptoms to diseases and drug effects to disease symptoms .
0	Considerable efforts are currently devoted to the preparation of ultracold neutral atoms in the emblematic strongly correlated quantum Hall regime .	The routes followed so far essentially rely on thermodynamics , i.e.imposing the proper Hamiltonian and cooling the system towards its ground state .	In rapidly rotating 2D harmonic traps the role of the transverse magnetic field is played by the angular velocity .	For particle numbers significantly larger than unity , the required angular momentum is very large and it can be obtained only for spinning frequencies extremely near to the deconfinement limit ; consequently , the required control on experimental parameters turns out to be far too stringent .	Here we propose to follow instead a dynamic path starting from the gas confined in a rotating ring .
3	Despite its potential relevance for the development of a thermodynamics of small systems , an experimental study of microscopic Carnot engines is still lacking .	The Carnot cycle imposes a fundamental upper limit to the efficiency of a macroscopic motor operating between two thermal baths .	However , this bound needs to be reinterpreted at microscopic scales , where molecular bio-motors and some artificial micro-engines operate .	As described by stochastic thermodynamics , energy transfers in microscopic systems are random and thermal fluctuations induce transient decreases of entropy , allowing for possible violations of the Carnot limit .	Here we report on an experimental realization of a Carnot engine with a single optically trapped Brownian particle as working substance .
4	This approach is particularly important for experiments where it is operationally difficult to prepare several copies of an unknown quantum state and in this sense the introduced scheme in this work is superior to the generally used entanglement witnesses that require a number of experiments and preparation of copies of quantum state .	In this paper we provide an operational method to detect multipartite entanglement in ensemble-based quantum computing .	This method is based on the concept of entanglement witness .	We decompose the entanglement witness for each class of multipartite entanglement into nonlocal operations in addition to local measurements .	Individual single qubit measurements are performed simultaneously , hence complete detection of entanglement is performed in a single run experiment .
4	Achieving comparable levels of spin polarization by external magnetic fields would require laboratory equipment whose physical dimensions and operating electrical currents are million times larger than those of our spin Hall effect devices .	The controlled generation of localized spin densities is a key enabler of semiconductor spintronics In this work , we study spin Hall effect induced edge spin accumulation in a two-dimensional hole gas with strong spin orbit interactions .	We argue that it is an intrinsic property , in the sense that it is independent of the strength of disorder scattering .	We show numerically that the spin polarization near the edge induced by this mechanism can be large , and that it becomes larger and more strongly localized as the spin-orbit coupling strength increases , and is independent of the width of the conducting strip once this exceeds the elastic scattering mean-free-path .	Our experiments in two-dimensional hole gas microdevices confirm this remarkable spin Hall effect phenomenology .
1	In this note we study this discrepancy and explain its origin .	At finite N the number of restricted Schur polynomials is greater than or equal to the number of generalized restricted Schur polynomials .	We conclude that , for quiver gauge theories , in general , the generalized restricted Schur polynomials correctly account for the complete set of finite N constraints and they provide a basis , while the restricted Schur polynomials only account for a subset of the finite N constraints and are thus overcomplete .	We identify several situations in which the restricted Schur polynomials do in fact account for the complete set of finite N constraints .	In these situations the restricted Schur polynomials and the generalized restricted Schur polynomials both provide good bases for the quiver gauge theory .
3	Optimum operation orientations are obtained for various experimental configurations , with detectors that are space- or Earth-fixed , have head-tail capability or not , and use energy information or not .	We report a systematic study on the directional sensitivity of a direct dark matter detector that detects the polar angle of a recoiling nucleus .	A weakly interacting massive particle ( WIMP ) -mass independent method is used to obtain the sensitivity of a general detector in an isothermal galactic dark matter halo .	By using two-dimensional distributions of energy and polar angle , a detector without head-tail information with 6.3 times the statistics is found to achieve the same performance level as a full three-dimensional tracking dark matter detector .	Earth-fixed detectors are found to have best sensitivity when the polar axis is oriented at a 45 degree angle from the Earth 's pole .
3	We discuss the difference between the \textbf { k } -integrated and \textbf { k } -resolved analytical continuations , as well as describing the use of random numbers and pole residues to analyze the approximant .	We investigate one of the most common analytic continuation techniques in condensed matter physics , namely the Pad\ ' { e } approximant .	Aspects concerning its implementation in the exact muffin-tin orbitals ( EMTO ) method are scrutinized with special regard towards making it stable and free of artificial defects .	The electronic structure calculations are performed for solid hydrogen , and the performance of the analytical continuation is assessed by monitoring the density of states constructed directly and via the Pad\ ' { e } approximation .	It is found that the analytic properties of the approximant can be controlled by appropriate modifications , making it a robust and reliable tool for electronic structure calculations .
0	Using the Parkes radio telescope , we study the 21cm neutral hydrogen ( HI ) properties of a sample of galaxies with redshifts z & lt ; 0.13 extracted from the optical 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey ( 2dFGRS ) .	Galaxies at 0.04 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.13 are studied using new Parkes observations of a 42deg^2 field near the South Galactic Pole ( SGP ) .	A spectral stacking analysis of the 3,277 2dFGRS objects within this field results in a convincing 12sigma detection .	For the low-redshift sample at 0 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.04 , we use the 15,093 2dFGRS galaxies observed by the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey ( HIPASS ) and find a 31sigma stacked detection .	We measure average HI masses of ( 6.93 +/- 0.17 ) *10^9 h^ { -2 } Msun and ( 1.48 +/- 0.03 ) *10^9 h^ { -2 } Msun for the SGP and HIPASS samples , respectively .
3	Furthermore , we generalize the exact ( non-perturbative ) form of the steady state for just two Lindblad channels ( spin-up flipping on the left , and spin-down flipping on the right ) to an arbitrary ( asymmetric ) ratio of the spin flipping rates [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	In this short note we provide two extensions on the recent explicit results on the matrix-product ansatz for the non-equilibrium steady state of a markovianly boundary-driven anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin 1/2 chain .	We write a perturbative solution for the steady state density matrix in the system-batyh coupling for an arbitrary ( asymmetric ) set of four spin-flip rates at the two chain ends , generalizing the symmetric-driving ansatz of [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	106 , 217206 ( 2011 ) ] .	107 , 137201 ( 2011 ) ] .
2	The di-muon resonances from J/psi and Y decays are presented and their total and differential cross-sections measured .	The CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider collected in the first months of operation a luminosity of about 300/nb .	The first results in the context of the B physics obtained with these data are presented .	The inclusive B production have also being investigated and two independent measurements are reported .	Muons in jets are used as a way to identify events with B content , the kinematic properties ( ptRel ) of the muons are used to separate the B production from other processes producing muons in jets .
1	We mostly consider the 3D potentials consisting of two cylindrical wells separated a distance 2a along the z-axis .	We discuss Bose-Einstein condensation in harmonic traps where the confinement has undergone a splitting along one direction .	For ideal gases , the thermodynamics of the confined bosons has been investigated performing exact numerical summations to describe the major details of the transition and comparing the results with the semiclassical density-of-states approximation .	We find that for large particle number and increasing well separation , the condensation temperature evolves from the thermodynamic limit value T_c^ { ( 0 ) } ( N ) to T_c^ { ( 0 ) } ( N/2 ) .	The effects of adding a repulsive interaction between atoms has been examined resorting to the Gross-Pitaevskii-Popov procedure and it is found that the shift of the condensation temperature exhibits different signs according to the separation between wells .
4	The method is applied to the simulated inversion of a double well system .	A novel algorithm was recently presented to utilize emerging time dependent probability density data to extract molecular potential energy surfaces .	This paper builds on the previous work and seeks to enhance the capabilities of the extraction algorithm : An improved method of removing the generally ill-posed nature of the inverse problem is introduced via an extended Tikhonov regularization and methods for choosing the optimal regularization parameters are discussed .	Several ways to incorporate multiple data sets are investigated , including the means to optimally combine data from many experiments exploring different portions of the potential .	Results are presented on the stability of the inversion procedure , including the optimal combination scheme , under the influence of data noise .
1	We resolve the structure of the RM in several knots along the jet for the first time .	We investigate the distribution of Faraday rotation measure ( RM ) in the M87 jet at arc-second scales by using archival polarimetric VLA data at 8 , 15 , 22 and 43 GHz .	We derive the power spectrum in the arcsecond scale jet and find indications that the RM can not be associated with a turbulent magnetic field with 3D Kolmogorov spectrum .	Our analysis indicates that the RM probed on jet scales has a significant contribution of a Faraday screen associated with the vicinity of the jet , in contrast with that on kiloparsec scales , typically assumed to be disconnected from the jet .	Comparison with previous RM analyses suggests that the magnetic fields giving rise to the RMs observed in jet scales have different properties and are well less turbulent than these observed in the lobes .
3	Uses jnl.tex and epsf.tex for figure 3 .	The quenched approximation for QCD is , at present and in the foreseeable future , unavoidable in lattice calculations with realistic choices of the lattice spacing , volume and quark masses .	In this talk , I review an analytic study of the effects of quenching based on chiral perturbation theory .	Quenched chiral perturbation theory leads to quantitative insight on the difference between quenched and unquenched QCD , and reveals clearly some of the diseases which are expected to plague quenched QCD .	Figures 1 and 2 not included , sorry .
2	We exploit a functional fit to the rotation curve to identify its center of symmetry ; this method minimizes the asymmetry in the final , folded rotation curve .	We present new long-slit Halpha spectroscopy for 403 non-interacting spiral galaxies , obtained at the Palomar Observatory 5 m Hale telescope , which is used to derive well-sampled optical rotation curves .	Because many of the galaxies show optical emission features which are significantly extended along the spectrograph slit , a technique was devised to separate and subtract the night sky lines from the galaxy emission .	We derive rotational widths using both velocity histograms and the Polyex model fit .	The final rotational width is measured at a radius containing 83 % of the total light as derived from I-band images .
0	Motivation : While the majority of gene histories found in a clade of organisms are expected to be generated by a common process ( e.g.the coalescent process ) , it is well-known that numerous other coexisting processes ( e.g.horizontal gene transfers , gene duplication and subsequent neofunctionalization ) will cause some genes to exhibit a history quite distinct from those of the majority of genes .	Such `` outlying '' gene trees are considered to be biologically interesting and identifying these genes has become an important problem in phylogenetics .	Results : We propose and implement KDETREES , a nonparametric method of estimating distributions of phylogenetic trees , with the goal of identifying trees which are significantly different from the rest of the trees in the sample .	Our method compares favorably with a similar recently-published method , featuring an improvement of one polynomial order of computational complexity ( to quadratic in the number of trees analyzed ) , with simulation studies suggesting only a small penalty to classification accuracy .	Application of KDETREES to a set of Apicomplexa genes identified several unreliable sequence alignments which had escaped previous detection , as well as a gene independently reported as a possible case of horizontal gene transfer .
4	It is demonstrated that only the latter possibility is actually realized , thus in such a system there is no redistribution of initial perturbation over all N degrees of freedom .	Time evolution of a perturbed thermal state is studied in a quantum-mechanical system with O ( N ) symmetry .	In the limit of large N , time dependence of O ( N ) -singlet expectation values can be described by classical equations of motion in a one-dimensional potential well .	Time dependence of the perturbation is then described by a linear differential equation with time-dependent periodic coefficient .	This equation , depending on the parameters , admits either exponentially growing/decaying or periodically oscillating solutions .
3	The main one is the multinucleon component of the neutrino interaction which in the case of Cherenkov detectors enters as a quasielastic cross section , increasing the mean neutrino energy which can differ appreciably from the reconstructed value .	We discuss the accuracy of the usual procedure for neutrino energy reconstruction which is based on the quasielastic kinematics .	Our results are described in terms of a probability distribution for a real neutrino energy value .	Several factors are responsible of the deviations from the reconstructed value .	As an application we derive , for excess electron events attributed to the conversion of muon neutrinos , the true neutrino energy distribution based on the experimental one which is given in terms of the reconstructed value .
4	Surprisingly , very similar dependence has been discovered for the first-order transition below the SkL phase , i.e.where the system enters the helical and conical state ( s ) , indicating similar processes across the order-disorder transition .	We present a detailed study of the phase diagram surrounding the skyrmion lattice ( SkL ) phase of Cu2OSe2O3 using high-precision magnetic ac susceptibility measurements .	An extensive investigation of transition dynamics around the SkL phase using the imaginary component of the susceptibility revealed that at the conical-to-SkL transition a broad dissipation region exists with a complex frequency dependence .	The analysis of the observed behavior within the SkL phase indicates a distribution of relaxation times intrinsically related to SkL .	At the SkL-to-paramagnet transition a narrow first-order peak is found that exhibits a strong frequency and magnetic field dependence .
4	The effect of different hyperonic potentials , namely $ \Sigma $ and $ \Xi $ potentials , on the EoS and hence the maximum mass of neutron stars has been studied .	The recent discoveries of massive neutron stars , such as PSR J $ 0348+0432 $ and PSR J $ 1614-2230 $ , have raised questions about the existence of exotic matter such as hyperons in the neutron star core .	The validity of many established equations of states ( EoS 's ) like the GM1 and FSUGold are also questioned .	We investigate the existence of hyperonic matter in the central regions of massive neutron stars using Relativistic Mean Field ( RMF ) theory with the recently proposed IUFSU model .	The IUFSU model is extended by including hyperons to study the neutron star in $ \beta $ equilibrium .
3	The remarkable result is obtained , that anti-evaporation can occur there only in the SUSY version of the theory .	Evidence for the possible existence of a quantum process opposite to the famous Hawking radiation ( evaporation ) of black holes is presented .	This new phenomenon could be very relevant in the case of exotic multiple horizon Nariai black holes and in the context of common grand unified theories .	This is clearly manifested in the case of the SO ( 10 ) GUT , that is here investigated in detail .	It is thus concluded that the existence of primordial black holes in the present Universe might be considered as an evidence for supersymmetry .
2	Sum of all the detected point source fluxes accounts for only ~ 10 % of the total X-ray flux in the field of view .	Using the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer Imaging array ( ACIS-I ) , we have carried out a deep hard X-ray observation of the Galactic plane region at ( l , b ) ~ ( 28.5 , 0.0 ) , where no discrete X-ray source had been reported previously .	We have detected 274 new point X-ray sources ( 4 sigma confidence ) as well as strong Galactic diffuse emission within two partially overlapping ACIS-I fields ( ~250 arcmin^2in total ) .	Even hypothesizing a new population of much dimmer and numerous Galactic point sources , the total observed X-ray flux can not be explained .	Therefore , we conclude that X-ray emission from the Galactic plane has truly diffuse origin .
4	Our specific motivation is the modeling of platelets in hemodynamic flows .	The Immersed Boundary ( IB ) method is a widely-used numerical methodology for the simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems .	The IB method utilizes an Eulerian discretization for the fluid equations of motion while maintaining a Lagrangian representation of structural objects .	Operators are defined for transmitting information ( forces and velocities ) between these two representations .	Most IB simulations represent their structures with piecewise-linear approximations and utilize Hookean spring models to approximate structural forces .
1	Experimentally , many new signals have been discovered that could be pointing towards the existence of tetraquarks , pentaquarks , and other exotic configurations of quarks and gluons .	The last few years have been witness to a proliferation of new results concerning heavy exotic hadrons .	Theoretically , advances in lattice field theory techniques place us at the cusp of understanding complex coupled-channel phenomena , modelling grows more sophisticated , and effective field theories are being applied to an ever greater range of situations .	It is thus an opportune time to evaluate the status of the field .	In the following , a series of high priority experimental and theoretical issues concerning heavy exotic hadrons is presented .
1	The total exposure was 433 hours .	The multi-site photometric observations of MN Dra were made over 77 nights in August-November , 2009 .	During this time the binary underwent two superoutbursts and five normal outbursts .	During the course of first superoutburst period of positive superhumps decreased with extremely large $ \dot P = -1.5 \times 1.0^ { -4 } $ for SU UMa-like dwarf novae , confirming known behavior of MN Dra [ 1 ] .	Between the superoutbursts MN Dra displayed negative superhumps .
0	We consider a Riemannian spin manifold ( M , g ) with a fixed spin structure .	The zero sets of solutions of generalized Dirac equations on M play an important role in some questions arising in conformal spin geometry and in mathematical physics .	In this setting the mass endomorphism has been defined as the constant term in an expansion of Green 's function for the Dirac operator .	One is interested in obtaining metrics , for which it is not zero .	In this thesis we study the dependence of the zero sets of eigenspinors of the Dirac operator on the Riemannian metric .
0	Let $ F $ be a non-Archimedean local field and let $ p $ be the residual characteristic of $ F $ .	Let $ G=GL_2 ( F ) $ and let $ P $ be a Borel subgroup of $ G $ .	In this paper we study the restriction of irreducible representations of $ G $ on $ E $ -vector spaces to $ P $ , where $ E $ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $ p $ .	We show that in a certain sense $ P $ controls the representation theory of $ G $ .	We then extend our results to smooth $ \oK [ G ] $ - modules of finite length and unitary $ K $ -Banach space representations of $ G $ , where $ \oK $ is the ring of integers of a complete discretely valued field $ K $ , with residue field $ E $ .
0	We present results from the first 2D and 3D simulations of the collapse of rotating stellar iron cores in general relativity employing a finite-temperature equation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during collapse .	We compare fully nonlinear and conformally flat spacetime evolution methods and find that the conformally flat treatment is sufficiently accurate for the core-collapse supernova problem .	We focus on the gravitational wave ( GW ) emission from rotating collapse , core bounce , and early postbounce phases .	Our results indicate that the GW signature of these phases is much more generic than previously estimated .	In addition , we track the growth of a nonaxisymmetric instability of dominant m = 1 character in one of our models that leads to prolonged narrow-band GW emission at ~930 Hz over several tens of milliseconds .
3	These processes can be background to the Higgs boson production and a number of beyond the standard model scenarios .	We study the production of two electro-weak vector bosons in association with a jet via gluon fusion .	In particular we consider the production of $ \gamma Zg $ , $ ZZg $ and $ W^ { + } W^ { - } g $ at hadron colliders and compute their cross-sections .	Such processes have already produced large number of events at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) by now .	Therefore it is important to know the values of their contribution .
0	We establish explicit socially optimal rules for an irreversible investment deci- sion with time-to-build and uncertainty .	Assuming a price sensitive demand function with a random intercept , we provide comparative statics and economic interpreta- tions for three models of demand ( arithmetic Brownian , geometric Brownian , and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross ) .	Committed capacity , that is , the installed capacity plus the in- vestment in the pipeline , must never drop below the best predictor of future demand , minus two biases .	The discounting bias takes into account the fact that investment is paid upfront for future use ; the precautionary bias multiplies a type of risk aversion index by the local volatility .	Relying on the analytical forms , we discuss in detail the economic effects .
1	Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and electrical measurements of top-contact pentacene thin-film transistors have been employed to directly correlate initial structure and final film structures , with the device mobility as a function of added impurity content .	Pentacenequinone ( PnQ ) impurities have been introduced into a pentacene source material at number densities from 0.001 to 0.474 to quantify the relative effects of impurity content and grain boundary structure on transport in pentacene thin-film transistors .	The results reveal a factor four decrease in mobility without significant changes in film morphology for source PnQ number fractions below ~0.008 .	For these low concentrations , the impurity thus directly influences transport , either as homogeneously distributed defects or by concentration at the otherwise-unchanged grain boundaries .	For larger impurity concentrations , the continuing strong decrease in mobility is correlated with decreasing grain size , indicating an impurity-induced increase in the nucleation of grains during early stages of film growth .
1	In general these are rare events with displaced vertices .	Heavy sterile-like neutrinos may be produced resonantly from the decay of pseudoscalar mesons and may decay into several different channels in a cascade $ \Phi \rightarrow L^\alpha \nu_h ; \nu_h\rightarrow \ { X\ } $ .	We provide a non-perturbative and manifestly unitary framework that describes the cascade decay and yields the space-time evolution of the probabilities for sterile neutrinos , final states and the total number of events at a far detector .	The results are general , valid for Dirac or Majorana neutrinos and only input the total decay rates and branching ratios for the production and decay channels .	We apply the general results to two examples of `` visible '' decay : i ) $ K^+\rightarrow e^+ \nu_h\rightarrow ( e^+ ) e^+ e^- \nu_e $ via a standard model charged current vertex and ii ) the radiative decay $ K^+\rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_h \rightarrow ( \mu^+ ) \nu_a \gamma $ .
3	We also show infinitesimal rigidity of the action spectrum of $ \phi $ with respect to variations of $ \Omega $ .	Let $ M $ be a closed oriented surface and let $ \Omega $ be a non-exact 2-form .	Suppose that the magnetic flow $ \phi $ of the pair $ ( g , \Omega ) $ is Anosov .	We show that the longitudinal KAM-cocycle of $ \phi $ is a coboundary if and only the Gaussian curvature is constant and $ \Omega $ is a constant multiple of the area form thus extending the results in \cite { P2 } .	Both results are obtained by showing that if $ G : M\to\mathbb R $ is any smooth function and $ \omega $ is any smooth 1-form on $ M $ such that $ G ( x ) +\omega_ { x } ( v ) $ integrates to zero along any closed orbit of $ \phi $ , then $ G $ must be identically zero and $ \omega $ must be exact .
4	We argue that the quantum field theory dualities of these gauge theories arise from T-dualities of type IIB strings exchanging D7 and D3 charges .	Extending recent work on SU gauge theory , we engineer local string models for N=1 four-dimensional SO and USp gauge theories coupled to matter in the fundamental .	The local models are type IIB orientifolds with D7 branes on a curved orientifold 7-plane , and matter realized by adding D3 branes on the orientifold plane .	The Higgs branches of the SO and USp theories can be matched with the moduli spaces of SO and USp instantons on the compact four-dimensional part of the D7 branes worldvolume .	The R-charge of the gauge theories is identified with a U ( 1 ) symmetry on the worldvolume of an Euclidean D3 brane instanton .
3	We derive the appropriate formulas and we discuss the influence of different configurations on the observability of gravitomagnetic effects .	The aim of this paper is to study the time delay on electromagnetic signals propagating across a binary stellar system .	We focus on the antisymmetric gravitomagnetic contribution due to the angular momentum of one of the stars of the pair .	Considering a pulsar as the source of the signals , the effect would be manifest both in the arrival times of the pulses and in the frequency shift of their Fourier spectra .	We argue that the recently discovered PSR J0737-3039 binary system does not permit the detection of the effects because of the large size of the eclipsed region .
3	Proving that certain hom-functors are monoidal , and so take monoids to monoids , unifies classical convolution in algebra and Day convolution for categories .	Given a horizontal monoid M in a duoidal category F , we examine the relationship between bimonoid structures on M and monoidal structures on the category of right M-modules which lift the vertical monoidal structure of F. We obtain our result using a variant of the Tannaka adjunction .	The approach taken utilizes hom-enriched categories rather than categories on which a monoidal category acts ( `` actegories '' ) .	The requirement of enrichment in F itself demands the existence of some internal homs , leading to the consideration of convolution for duoidal categories .	Hopf bimonoids are defined leading to a lifting of closed structures .
3	The colors of the main sequence require a relatively large extinction of A_V = 0.47 mag .	The stellar population of the Pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy is investigated in images taken in the F439W ( B ) , F555W ( V ) , and F814W ( I ) bands with WFPC2 .	These and ground-based data are combined to produce color-magnitude diagrams which show the complex nature of the stellar population in this small galaxy .	A young ( & lt ; 0.5 Gyr ) main sequence stellar component is present and clustered in two centrally-located clumps , while older stars form a more extended disk or halo .	The mean color of the well-populated red giant branch is relatively blue , consistent with a moderate metallicity young , or older , metal-poor stellar population .
2	This discomfiture is due to the ( i ) shallow behavior of the Morse potential at the outer edge and ( ii ) inappropriate insertion of Coulomb tail used in that work .	The resonances in $ ^ { 12 } $ C+ $ ^ { 12 } $ C system described earlier using long range Morse potential determined from resonance data itself , are reexamined in the light of the recent development of the two new methods for identification of resonances in the scattering theory , namely Imaginary Test Potential and Imaginary Phase-shift methods .	The high lying resonances are found to be not genuine as pointed out by Kato and Abe , and as such are discarded .	These two deficiencies are now removed in the present study by finding a modified Morse potential with steep rise in the outer edge , and joining smoothly to it a term approximating the Coulomb tail .	Calculation of the resonances for this modified Morse potential using the above two methods of identification of resonances in our study , yields more than 25 states with angular momenta $ 0^ { + } $ - $ 12^ { + } $ in the relevant energy regions .
2	It has started with categoricity and number of non-isomorphic models .	Classification theory of elementary classes deals with first order ( elementary ) classes of structures ( i.e.fixing a set T of first order sentences , we investigate the class of models of T with the elementary submodel notion ) .	It tries to find dividing lines , prove their consequences , prove `` structure theorems , positive theorems '' on those in the `` low side '' ( in particular stable and superstable theories ) , and prove `` non-structure , complexity theorems '' on the `` high side '' .	It is probably recognized as the central part of model theory , however it will be even better to have such ( non-trivial ) theory for non-elementary classes .	Note also that many classes of structures considered in algebra are not first order ; some families of such classes are close to first order ( say have kind of compactness ) .
4	We show then that numerical integrations recover a wider region of stability that are not captured by the ( approximated ) analytical method .	In this paper , we explore the stability of an inverted pendulum under a generalized parametric excitation described by a superposition of $ N $ cosines with different amplitudes and frequencies , based on a simple stability condition that does not require any use of Lyapunov exponent , for example .	Our analysis is separated in 3 different cases : $ N=1 $ , $ N=2 $ , and $ N $ very large .	Our results were obtained via numerical simulations by fourth-order Runge Kutta integration of the non-linear equations .	We also calculate the effective potential also for $ N & gt ; 2 $ .
3	The arrangement contains a grid to separate the polarizations and two beam splitters to combine each resulting beam with a local oscillator signal .	We describe the design , construction , and characterization of the Band 9 heterodyne receivers ( 600-720 GHz ) for the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) .	The ALMA Band 9 receiver units ( `` cartridges '' ) , which are installed in the telescope 's front end , have been designed to detect and down-convert two orthogonal linear polarization components of the light collected by the ALMA antennas .	The light entering the front end is refocused with a compact arrangement of mirrors , which is fully contained within the cartridge .	The combined beams are fed into independent double-sideband mixers , each with a corrugated feedhorn coupling the radiation by way of a waveguide with backshort cavity into an impedance-tuned SIS junction that performs the heterodyne down-conversion .
3	Here we report an analysis of archival observations of the compact X-ray source in the centre of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant .	The surface of hot neutron stars is covered by a thin atmosphere .	If there is accretion after neutron star formation , the atmosphere could be composed of light elements ( H or He ) ; if no accretion takes place or if thermonuclear reactions occur after accretion , heavy elements ( for example , Fe ) are expected .	Despite detailed searches , observations have been unable to confirm the atmospheric composition of isolated neutron stars .	We show that a carbon atmosphere neutron star ( with low magnetic field ) produces a good fit to the spectrum .
2	In the standard model , the polarizations are vanishingly small .	We study the CP violating effects in the decay of $ \eta\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma $ .	We show that to have CP violation in the decay , one has to consider both linear and circular photon polarizations .	However , model-independently , i.e.using only experimental constraint imposed by the limit on $ Br ( \eta\to\pi^+\pi^- ) $ it can be up to $ O ( 10 % ) $ .	We also explore various possible operators and we find that the tensor type operator , possibly arising from a nonzero CP violating electric dipole moment of the strange quark , can induce a sizable linear photon polarization .
3	This shows that the so-called attractor behaviour extends beyond the static spherically symmetric case .	The Geroch-Wald-Jang-Huisken-Ilmanen approach to the positive energy problem to may be extended to give a negative lower bound for the mass of asymptotically Anti-de-Sitter spacetimes containing horizons with exotic topologies having ends or infinities of the form $ \Sigma_g \times { \Bbb R } $ , in terms of the cosmological constant .	We also show how the method gives a lower bound for for the mass of time-symmetric initial data sets for black holes with vectors and scalars in terms of the mass , $ |Z ( Q , P ) | $ of the double extreme black hole with the same charges .	I also give a lower bound for the area of an apparent horizon , and hence a lower bound for the entropy in terms of the same function $ |Z ( Q , P ) | $ .	and underscores the general importance of the function $ |Z ( Q , P ) | $ .
0	( Abridged : ) We present the identification of optical counterparts to 23 Galactic Bulge Survey X-ray sources .	We report their accurate coordinates and optical spectra acquired at the VLT and Magellan .	All sources are classified as accreting binaries according to their emission line characteristics .	To distinguish accreting binaries from chromospherically active objects we develop and explain criteria based on Halpha and HeI 5786,6678 emission line properties available in the literature .	The spectroscopic properties and photometric variability of all the objects are discussed and a classification of the source is given where possible .
1	In the first case , if the initial state is not the equilibrium state , the intensity may switch periodically from fiber to fiber , while in the second case the a-symmetrical state remains forever , with most of its energy in either fiber .	The intensity of classical bright solitons propagating in linearly coupled identical fibers can be distributed either in a stable symmetric state at strong coupling or in a stable asymmetric state if the coupling is small enough .	The latter situation makes a state of propagation with two exactly reciprocal realizations .	In the quantum case , such a situation does not exist as an eigenstate because of the quantum tunneling between the two fibers .	Such a tunneling is a purely quantum phenomenon which does not not exist in the classical theory .
4	One is a real data fluid-dynamics computer experiment which benefits from the local nature of our approximation ; the second is a synthetic data example designed to find the largest design for which ( accurate ) GP emulation can performed on a commensurate predictive set under an hour .	We explore how the big-three computing paradigms -- symmetric multi-processor ( SMC ) , graphical processing units ( GPUs ) , and cluster computing -- can together be brought to bare on large-data Gaussian processes ( GP ) regression problems via a careful implementation of a newly developed local approximation scheme .	Our methodological contribution focuses primarily on GPU computation , as this requires the most care and also provides the largest performance boost .	However , in our empirical work we study the relative merits of all three paradigms to determine how best to combine them .	The paper concludes with two case studies .
1	We include an imposed pitch-angle scattering rate , which is meant to approximate the effects of high frequency plasma waves and/or velocity space instabilities .	We investigate the effects of pitch-angle scattering on the efficiency of particle heating and acceleration by MHD turbulence using phenomenological estimates and simulations of non-relativistic test particles interacting with strong , subsonic MHD turbulence .	We focus on plasma parameters similar to those found in the near-Earth solar wind , though most of our results are more broadly applicable .	An important control parameter is the size of the particle mean free path lambda_ { mfp } relative to the scale of the turbulent fluctuations L. For small scattering rates , particles interact quasi-resonantly with turbulent fluctuations in magnetic field strength .	Scattering increases the long-term efficiency of this resonant heating by factors of a few-10 , but the distribution function does not develop a significant non-thermal power-law tail .
2	Proton decay and especially its gauge mediated decay is sensitive also to those mixing angles which are non-relevant in the SM .	The large freedom in the SM fermionic mass matrices allows for large LH and LH quark rotations .	This is a natural possibility in view of the observed large leptonic mixing .	A model with realistic mass matrices and large rotations is presented..	It is shown that the large leptonic mixing leads to enhancement of the proton decay branching ratios involving muons .
3	The measurement protocol is used to observe quantum tunneling jumps of the S=10 molecular magnet , Mn12-tBuAc .	We report a low temperature measurement technique and magnetization data of a quantum molecular spin , by implementing an on-chip SQUID technique .	This technique enables the SQUID magnetometery in high magnetic fields , up to 7 Tesla .	The main challenges and the calibration process are detailed .	The effect of transverse field on the tunneling splitting for this molecular system is addressed as well .
3	The distribution of waiting time $ { \cal T } $ till the completion of the target task has the power law tail $ \sim 1/t^ { 1/2 } $ , resulting from a first-passage solution of an equivalent Wiener process .	Empirical analysis show that , after the update of a browser , the publication of the vulnerability of a software , or the discovery of a cyber worm , the fraction of computers still using the older version , or being not yet patched , or exhibiting worm activity decays as power laws $ \sim 1/t^ { \alpha } $ with $ 0 & lt ; \alpha \leq 1 $ over time scales of years .	We present a simple model for this persistence phenomenon framed within the standard priority queuing theory , of a target task which has the lowest priority compared with all other tasks that flow on the computer of an individual .	We identify a `` time deficit '' control parameter $ \beta $ and a bifurcation to a regime where there is a non-zero probability for the target task to never be completed .	Taking into account a diversity of time deficit parameters in a population of individuals , the power law tail is changed into $ 1/t^\alpha $ with $ \alpha\in ( 0.5 , \infty ) $ , including the well-known case $ 1/t $ .
0	In the framework of the relativistic independent quark model the parameters of the QCD-motivated static potential and the quark masses are calculated on the basis of the $ 1^ { -- } $ meson mass spectra .	The value of the confining potential coefficient is found to be ( $ 0.197\pm 0.005 ) GeV $ { } ^2 $ .	for quark- antiquark interaction independently on their flavours .	The dependence of the quasi-Coulombic potential strength on the interaction distance are consistent with the QCD-motivated behaviour .	The $ q\bar q $ -separations are evaluated and the $ e^+e^- $ decay widths are estimated with the help of relativistic modification of the Van Royen-Weisskopf formula .
1	In this article , we take a model-independent approach , and discuss a number of possibilities for dark matter candidates which could potentially generate such a feature .	Recent reports of a gamma-ray line feature at ~130 GeV in data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope have generated a great deal of interest in models in which dark matter particles annihilate with a sizable cross section to final states including photons .	While we identify several scenarios which could lead to such a gamma-ray line , these models are each fairly constrained .	In particular , viable models require large couplings ( g & gt ; 1-3 ) , and additional charged particles with masses in the range of approximately ~130-200 GeV .	Furthermore , lower energy gamma-ray constraints from the Galactic Center force us to consider scenarios in which the dark matter annihilates in the early universe through velocity-suppressed processes , or to final states which yield relatively few gamma-rays ( such as electrons , muons or neutrinos ) .
1	This statement is supported by recent experimental confirmation of photon guiding properties of a single neuron .	In this paper we argue that , in addition to electrical and chemical signals propagating in the neurons of the brain , signal propagation takes place in the form of biophoton production .	We have investigated the interaction of mitochondrial biophotons with microtubules from a quantum mechanical point of view .	Our theoretical analysis indicates that the interaction of biophotons and microtubules causes transitions/fluctuations of microtubules between coherent and incoherent states .	A significant relationship between the fluctuation function of microtubules and alpha-EEG diagrams is elaborated on in this paper .
0	While kinetic Monte Carlo simulations can provide long-time simulations of the dynamics of physical and chemical systems , it is not yet possible in general to identify the inverse Monte Carlo attempt frequency with a physical timescale .	Here we demonstrate such an identification by comparing simulations with experimental data .	Using a dynamic lattice-gas model for the electrosorption of Br on Ag ( 100 ) , we measure the scan-rate dependence of the separation between positive-and negative-going peaks in cyclic-voltammetry ( CV ) and compare simulated and experimental peak separations .	By adjusting the Monte Carlo attempt frequency , good agreement between simulated and experimental peak separations is achieved .	It is also found that the uniqueness of such a determination is dependent on the relative values of the adsorption/desorption and diffusion free-energy barriers .
3	Our scanning probes consisting of a scanning nanopillar ( 200 nm diameter , $ 1-2\ , \mu $ m length ) on a thin ( $ & lt ; 1\mu $ m ) cantilever structure , enable efficient light extraction from diamond in combination with a high magnetic field sensitivity ( $ \mathrm { \eta_ { AC } } \approx50\pm20\ , \mathrm { nT } /\sqrt { \mathrm { Hz } } $ ) .	The electronic spin of the nitrogen vacancy ( NV ) center in diamond forms an atomically sized , highly sensitive sensor for magnetic fields .	To harness the full potential of individual NV centers for sensing with high sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution , NV centers have to be incorporated into scanning probe structures enabling controlled scanning in close proximity to the sample surface .	Here , we present an optimized procedure to fabricate single-crystal , all-diamond scanning probes starting from commercially available diamond and show a highly efficient and robust approach for integrating these devices in a generic atomic force microscope .	As a first application of our scanning probes , we image the magnetic stray field of a single Ni nanorod .
3	It is well known that the quotient M/K is a complex space in a natural way .	Let G be a complex reductive group and K a maximal compact subgroup .	If X is a smooth projective G-variety , with a fixed ( not necessarily integral ) K-invariant Kaehler form , then the K-action is Hamiltonian .	Let M be the zero fiber of the corresponding moment map .	We prove that M/K is a projective variety .
0	We have used the CLEO II detector to study the multiplicity of charged particles in the decays of B mesons produced at the $ \Upsilon ( 4S ) $ resonance .	Using a sample of 1.5 x 10^6 B meson pairs , we find the mean inclusive charged particle multiplicity to be 10.71 +- 0.02 +0.21/-0.15 for the decay of the pair .	This corresponds to a mean multiplicity of 5.36 +- 0.01 +0.11/-0.08 for a single B meson .	Using the same data sample , we have also extracted the mean multiplicities in semileptonic and nonleptonic decays .	We measure a mean of 7.82 +- 0.05 +0.21/-0.19 charged particles per $ B\bar { B } $ decay when both mesons decay semileptonically .
1	Recently the LHCb collaboration announced a $ 2.6 \sigma $ deviation in the measurement of $ R_K= { \cal { B } } ( \bar B \to \bar K \mu \mu ) / { \cal { B } } ( \bar B \to \bar K ee ) $ from the standard model 's prediction of lepton universality .	Flavor changing neutral current $ |\Delta B|=|\Delta S|=1 $ processes are sensitive to possible new physics at the electroweak scale and beyond , providing detailed information about flavor , chirality and Lorentz structure .	We identify dimension six operators which could explain this deviation and study constraints from other measurements .	Vector and axial-vector four-fermion operators with flavor structure $ \bar s b \bar \ell \ell $ can provide a good description of the data .	Tensor operators can not describe the data .
2	The first part is a systematic overview of the theory pertaining to propagation , plasma self-generation , energy/current-losses , and stability of such pulses .	This report is a self-contained and comprehensive review of the physics of propagating pulses of high-intensity high-energy particle beams in pre-existing or self-generated plasmas .	Consideration is given to beams of electrons , protons , muons , and their antiparticles , as well as to neutral-hydrogen , positronium , and electron-positron-plasmoid beams .	The second part reviews the major full-scale propagation experiments which have been carried out , in atmospheric and outer-space plasmas , to assess the validity of theoretical models .	It is found that the data available on these experiments demonstrate that range and stability are in agreement with theory .
1	We have taken proper account of reciprocity and radiation damping for electric and magnetic scatterers with any general polarizability tensor .	We present a new , fully analytical point scattering model which can be applied to arbitrary anisotropic magneto-electric dipole scatterers , including split ring resonators ( SRRs ) , chiral and anisotropic plasmonic scatterers .	Specifically , we show how reciprocity and energy balance puts constraints on the electrodynamic responses arbitrary scatterers can have to light .	Our theory sheds new light on the magnitude of cross sections for scattering and extinction , and for instance on the emergence of structural chirality in the optical response of geometrically non-chiral scatterers like SRRs .	We apply the model to SRRs and discuss how to extract individual components of the polarizability matrix and extinction cross sections .
0	In this paper , we extend our earlier work to provide additional evidence for an alternative scenario to explain the nature of so-called `explosive events ' .	The bi-directed , fast Doppler motion of explosive events observed spectroscopically in the transition region emission is classically interpreted as a pair of bidirectional jets moving upward and downward from a reconnection site .	We discuss the problems of such a model .	In our previous work , we focused basically on the discrepancy of fast Doppler motion without detectable motion in the image plane .	We now suggest an alternative scenario for the explosive events , based on our observations of spectral line tilts and bifurcated structure in some events .
0	Stochastic modeling of reaction networks is a framework used to describe the time evolution of many natural and artificial systems , including , biochemical reactive systems at the molecular level , viral kinetics , the spread of epidemic diseases , and wireless communication networks , among many other examples .	In this work , we present a novel multilevel Monte Carlo method for kinetic simulation of stochastic reaction networks that is specifically designed for systems in which the set of reaction channels can be adaptively partitioned into two subsets characterized by either `` high '' or `` low '' activity .	Adaptive in this context means that the partition evolves in time according to the states visited by the stochastic paths of the system .	To estimate expected values of observables of the system at a prescribed final time , our method bounds the global computational error to be below a prescribed tolerance , $ TOL $ , within a given confidence level .	This is achieved with a computational complexity of order $ O ( TOL^ { -2 } ) $ , the same as with an exact method , but with a smaller constant .
3	We compare these models with the corresponding C^2/Z_3 orbifold models , and find that all of these gauge backgrounds can be related to configurations of vacuum expectation values ( VEV 's ) of twisted and sometimes untwisted states .	Instantons on Eguchi-Hanson spaces provide explicit examples of stable bundles on non-compact four dimensional C^2/Z_n orbifold resolutions with non-Abelian structure groups .	With this at hand , we can consider compactifications of ten dimensional SO ( 32 ) supergravity ( arising as the low energy limit of the heterotic string ) on the resolved spaces in the presence of non-Abelian bundles .	We provide explicit examples in the resolved C^2/Z_3 case , and give a complete classification of all possible effective six dimensional models where the instantons are combined with Abelian gauge fluxes in order to fulfil the local Bianchi identity constraint .	Gauge groups and spectra are identical from both the orbifold and the smooth bundle perspectives .
1	Understanding how this is possible is key to unraveling one of the most pressing mysteries at the interface of cosmology and particle physics : the fundamental nature of dark matter .	Can we learn about New Physics with astronomical and astro-particle data ?	I will discuss some of the recent puzzling findings in cosmic-ray electron-positron data and in gamma-ray observations that might be related to dark matter .	I will argue that recent cosmic-ray data , most notably from the Pamela and Fermi satellites , indicate that previously unaccounted-for powerful sources in the Galaxy inject high-energy electrons and positrons .	Interestingly , this new source class might be related to new fundamental particle physics , and specifically to pair-annihilation or decay of galactic dark matter .
3	At level ( b ) , there are Hamiltonian systems on these spaces which are integrable for each Poisson structure in the family , and which are such that the Lagrangian leaves are the intersections of the symplective leaves over the Poisson structures in the family .	For the rational , elliptic and trigonometric r-matrices , we exhibit the links between three `` levels '' of Poisson spaces : ( a ) Some finite-dimensional spaces of matrix-valued holomorphic functions on the complex line ; ( b ) Spaces of spectral curves and sheaves supported on them ; ( c ) Symmetric products of a surface .	We have , at each level , a linear space of compatible Poisson structures , and the maps relating the levels are Poisson .	This leads in a natural way to Nijenhuis coordinates for these spaces .	Specific examples include many of the well-known integrable systems .
0	This thesis can be divided into several parts .	The first one consists in a detailed historical review of quarkonium physics , centered on the different production models successively introduced .	Then comes a review of the currently available data on high-energy hadronic production of J/psi , psi ' and Upsilon 's .	In a third part , we concentrate on the extension of the Colour-Singlet Model beyond the static approximation .	In this extension , we emphasise that a simple generalisation of the static case is not sufficient and new 4-point vertices are to be introduced to restore gauge invariance .
3	Its side surface hosts metallic surface states , forming two anisotropic Dirac cones .	We report the discovery of weak topological insulators by ab initio calculations in a honeycomb lattice .	We propose a structure with an odd number of layers in the primitive unit-cell as a prerequisite for forming weak topological insulators .	Here , the single-layered KHgSb is the most suitable candidate for its large bulk energy gap of 0.24 eV .	Though the stacking of even-layered structures leads to trivial insulators , the structures can host a quantum spin Hall layer with a large bulk gap , if an additional single layer exists as a stacking fault in the crystal .
3	In this model , the lighter chargino and the lightest neutralino are highly degenerate .	In R-parity violating supersymmetric models both leptogenesis and the correct neutrino masses are hard to achieve together .	The presence of certain soft nonholomorphic R-parity violating terms helps to resolve this problem .	We consider a scenario where the lightest and the second-lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate in mass and enough CP-asymmetry can be produced through resonant leptogenesis .	We have relatively lighter gauginos which can be produced at the LHC leading to heavily ionizing charged tracks .
2	Mid-infrared observations presented in this paper show a monopolar jet-like morphology as well , and it is argued that the mid-infrared emission observed is dominated by thermal continuum emission from dust .	The young massive stellar object G35.20-0.74 was observed in the mid-infrared using T-ReCS on Gemini South .	Previous observations have shown that the near infrared emission has a fan-like morphology that is consistent with emission from the northern lobe of a bipolar radio jet known to be associated with this source .	The mid-infrared emission nearest the central stellar source is believed to be directly heated dust on the walls of the outflow cavity .	The hydroxyl , water , and methanol masers associated with G35.20-0.74 are spatially located along these mid-infrared cavity walls .
1	Electric pulses applied to a horseshoe-shaped metallic mesa , deposited on top of the microcavity , generate a non-cylindrically symmetric solitonic wave in the system .	We have theoretically demonstrated the on demand electric generation of vortices in an exciton-polariton superfluid .	Breakdown of its wavefront at focal points leads to the formation of vortex-antivortex pairs which subsequently propagate in the superfluid .	The trajectory of these vortex dipoles can be controlled by applying a voltage to additional electrodes .	They can be confined within channels formed by metallic stripes and unbound by a wedged mesa giving birth to grey solitons .
3	Spatially resolved spectroscopy shows that the data are consistent with intragroup gas being pressurized at the leading western edge of NGC 2276 due to the galaxy moving supersonically through the intragroup medium at a velocity ~850 km/s .	Ram pressure stripping of galactic gas is generally assumed to be inefficient in galaxy groups due to the relatively low density of the intragroup medium and the small velocity dispersions of groups .	To test this assumption , we obtained Chandra X-ray data of the starbursting spiral NGC 2276 in the NGC 2300 group of galaxies , a candidate for a strong galaxy interaction with hot intragroup gas .	The data reveal a shock-like feature along the western edge of the galaxy and a low-surface-brightness tail extending to the east , similar to the morphology seen in other wavebands .	Detailed modelling of the gravitational potential of NGC 2276 shows that the resulting ram-pressure could significantly affect the morphology of the outer gas disc but is probably insufficient to strip large amounts of cold gas from the disc .
1	They are solutions of a min-max problem .	We study the ground state solutions of the Dirac-Fock model in the case of weak electronic repulsion , using bifurcation theory .	Then we investigate a max-min problem coming from the electron-positron field theory of Bach-Barbaroux-Helffer-Siedentop .	We show that given a radially symmetric nuclear charge , the ground state of Dirac-Fock solves this max-min problem for certain numbers of electrons .	But we also exhibit a situation in which the max-min level does not correspond to a solution of the Dirac-Fock equations together with its associated self-consistent projector .
2	Individual transits produce an effect that would either be too rare or too weak to be detected in 30-year pulsar observations .	Small-scale dark matter structure within the Milky Way is expected to affect pulsar timing .	The change in gravitational potential induced by a dark matter halo passing near the line of sight to a pulsar would produce a varying delay in the light travel time of photons from the pulsar .	However , a population of dark matter subhalos would be expected to produce a detectable effect on the measured properties of pulsars if the subhalos constitute a significant fraction of the total halo mass .	The effect is to increase the dispersion of measured period derivatives across the pulsar population .
1	Absolute distance was determined by counting the interference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency .	In this paper , we report high-precision absolute distance and vibration measurements performed with frequency scanned interferometry using a pair of single-mode optical fibers .	A high-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer ( F-P ) was used to determine frequency changes during scanning .	Two multiple-distance-measurement analysis techniques were developed to improve distance precision and to extract the amplitude and frequency of vibrations .	Under laboratory conditions , measurement precision of $ \sim $ 50 nm was achieved for absolute distances ranging from 0.1 meters to 0.7 meters by using the first multiple-distance-measurement technique .
3	Using lattice sum theory , we take into account all possible retarded dipole-dipole interactions of scatterers in the metasurface amongst each other , and through the mirror .	We consider the response of etalons created by a combination of a conventional mirror and a metasurface , composed of a periodic lattice of metal scatterers with a resonant response .	This geometry has been used previously for perfect absorption , in so-called Salisbury screens , and for hybridization of localized plasmons with Fabry-Perot resonances .	The particular aspect we address is if one can assume an environment-independent reflectivity for the metasurface when calculating the reflectivity of the composite system , as in a standard Fabry-Perot analysis , or whether the fact that the metasurface interacts with its own mirror image renormalizes its response .	We show that while a layer-by-layer Fabry-Perot formalism captures the main qualitative features of metasurface etalons , in fact the mirror modifies both the polarizability and reflectivity of the metasurface in a fashion that is akin to Drexhage 's modification of the radiative properties of a single dipole .
2	In this paper , certain identities involving products of two and three general solutions of Bessel 's equation have been derived .	Spectral decomposition of dynamical equations using curl-eigenfunctions has been extensively used in fluid and plasma dynamics problems using their orthogonality and completeness properties for both linear and non-linear cases .	Coefficients of such expansions are integrals over products of Bessel functions in problems involving cylindrical geometry .	Some of these identities have been useful in the study of Turner relaxation of annular magnetized plasma [ S.K.H.Auluck , Phys .	Plasmas , 16 , 122504 , 2009 ] , where quadratic integral quantities such as helicity and total energy were expressed as algebraic functions of the arbitrary constants of the general solution of Bessel 's equation , allowing their determination by a minimization procedure .
2	The large SEP events are separated into two groups , one associated with CMEs running into other CMEs , and the other with CMEs running into the ambient solar wind .	This paper updates the influence of environmental and source factors of shocks driven by coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) that are likely to influence the solar energetic particle ( SEP ) events .	The intensity variation due to CME interaction reported in [ 1 ] is confirmed by expanding the investigation to all the large SEP events of solar cycle 23 .	SEP events with CME interaction generally have a higher intensity .	New possibilities such as the influence of coronal holes on the SEP intensity are also discussed .
0	Multiple kernel learning ( MKL ) , structured sparsity , and multi-task learning have recently received considerable attention .	In this paper , we show how different MKL algorithms can be understood as applications of either regularization on the kernel weights or block-norm-based regularization , which is more common in structured sparsity and multi-task learning .	We show that these two regularization strategies can be systematically mapped to each other through a concave conjugate operation .	When the kernel-weight-based regularizer is separable into components , we can naturally consider a generative probabilistic model behind MKL .	Based on this model , we propose learning algorithms for the kernel weights through the maximization of marginal likelihood .
3	With it we find we are able to explain the few clusters that lie off the $ N_X $ -- $ \Gamma $ correlation , and resolve the discrepancy between observed GC core radii and the values predicted by theory .	It has been known for over 30 years that Galactic globular clusters ( GCs ) are overabundant by orders of magnitude in bright X-ray sources per unit mass relative to the disk population .	Recently a quantitative understanding of this phenomenon has developed , with a clear correlation between the number of X-ray sources in a cluster , $ N_X $ , and the cluster 's encounter frequency , $ \Gamma $ , becoming apparent .	We derive a refined version of $ \Gamma $ that incorporates the finite lifetime of X-ray sources and the dynamical evolution of clusters .	Our results suggest that most GCs are still in the process of core contraction and have not yet reached the thermal equilibrium phase driven by binary scattering interactions .
3	Here we extend previous studies , which considered both the quintessence and the cubic terms , by focussing on the role of the last two terms .	In this paper we study the evolution of a spherical matter overdensity in the context of the recently introduced Galileon field theory .	Our analysis considers the complete covariant Lagrangian in four dimensions .	This theory is composed by a potential and a standard kinetic term , a cubic kinetic term and two additional terms that include the coupling between the Galileon and the metric , to preserve the original properties of Galileons also in curved space-times .	The background evolution we consider is driven by a tracker solution .
1	In particular , we study Non-Sequential Recursive Pair Substitution ( NSRPS ) , a lossless compression algorithm first proposed by W. Ebeling et al . [ Math.Biosc .	We investigate the complexity of short symbolic sequences of chaotic dynamical systems by using lossless compression algorithms .	52 , 1980 ] and Jim\ ' { e } nez-Monta\~ { n } o et al .	[ arXiv : cond-mat/0204134 , 2002 ] ) which was subsequently shown to be optimal .	NSPRS has also been used to estimate Entropy of written English ( P. Grassberger [ arXiv : physics/0207023 , 2002 ] ) .
3	Subsets of DGSS galaxies binned by redshift also exhibit L-Z correlations but with different zero points .	Using spectroscopic data from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe ( DEEP ) Groth Strip survey ( DGSS ) , we analyze the gas-phase oxygen abundances for 56 emission-line field galaxies in the redshift range 0.26 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.82 .	Oxygen abundances relative to hydrogen range between 8.4 & lt ; 12+log ( O/H ) & lt ; 9.0 with typical uncertainties of 0.17 dex .	The 56 DGSS galaxies collectively exhibit a correlation between B-band luminosity and metallicity , i.e. , an L-Z relation .	Galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( z=0.6-0.82 ) are brighter by ~1 mag compared to the lowest redshift bin ( z=0.26-0.40 ) and brighter by ~1-2 mag compared to local ( z & lt ; 0.1 ) field galaxies .
1	We measured a $ ^ { 153 } $ Gd photon source and achieved an energy resolution of 63 eV full-width-at-half-maximum at 97 keV and an equivalent readout system noise of 86 pA/ $ \sqrt { \text { Hz } } $ at the TES .	We demonstrate very high resolution photon spectroscopy with a microwave-multiplexed two-pixel transition-edge sensor ( TES ) array .	The readout circuit consists of superconducting microwave resonators coupled to radio-frequency superconducting-quantum-interference-devices ( SQUID ) and transduces changes in input current to changes in phase of a microwave signal .	We use flux-ramp modulation to linearize the response and evade low-frequency noise .	This demonstration establishes one path for the readout of cryogenic X-ray and gamma-ray sensor arrays with more than $ 10^3 $ elements and spectral resolving powers $ R=\lambda/\Delta\lambda & gt ; 10^3 $ .
4	The oxidation of graphene , caused by water dissociation , is triggered by photon and/or photoelectron induced dissociation of water .	We study extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) radiation induced defects in single-layer graphene .	Two mechanisms for inducing defects in graphene were separately investigated : photon induced chemical reactions between graphene and background residual gases , and disrupting the network of sp2 bonds , due to photon and/or photoelectrons induced bond cleaving .	Raman spectroscopy shows that D peak intensities grow after EUV irradiation with increasing water partial pressure in the exposure chamber .	Temperature-programmed desorption ( TPD ) experiments prove that EUV radiation results in water dissociation on the graphene surface .
4	We characterize the $ M $ -smoothings obtained by this method by the local data .	We introduce a new method for the construction of smoothings of a real plane branch $ ( C , 0 ) $ by using Viro Patchworking method .	Since real plane branches are Newton degenerated in general , we can not apply Viro Patchworking method directly .	Instead we apply the Patchworking method for certain Newton non degenerate curve singularities with several branches .	These singularities appear as a result of iterating deformations of the strict transforms of the branch at certain infinitely near points of the toric embedded resolution of singularities of $ ( C,0 ) $ .
0	The present work pursues the investigation of the role of spatial asymmetry and irreversibility on the dynamical properties of spin systems .	We consider the ferromagnetic spherical model with asymmetric linear Langevin dynamics .	Such an asymmetric dynamics is irreversible , i.e. , breaks detailed balance , because the principle of action and reaction is violated .	The fluctuation-dissipation theorem therefore no longer holds .	The stationary state is however still Gibbsian , i.e. , the weights of configurations are given by the Boltzmann factor corresponding to the ferromagnetic Hamiltonian .
2	For algorithm programming , NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation .	We describe NIMBLE , a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges : flexible model specification , a language for programming algorithms that can use different models , and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency .	For model specification , NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects , which can manipulate variables , calculate log probability values , generate simulations , and query the relationships among variables .	The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes , such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes .	The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage .
0	We present a level ( 10,30 ) numerical computation of the spectrum of quadratic fluctuations of Open String Field Theory around the tachyonic vacuum , both in the scalar and in the vector sector .	Our results are consistent with Sen 's conjecture about gauge-triviality of the small excitations .	The computation is sufficiently accurate to provide robust evidence for the absence of the photon from the open string spectrum .	We also observe that ghost string field propagators develop double poles .	We show that this requires non-empty BRST cohomologies at non-standard ghost numbers .
3	We have derived BVI integrated photometry of these star clusters from the CCD images taken with CFH12k mosaic camera at CFHT .	We present the result of a survey for star clusters in M33 using the HST/WFPC2 archive images .	We have found 104 star clusters , including 32 new ones , in the images of 24 fields that were not included in the previous studies .	Combining these with previous data in the literature , we increase the number of M33 star clusters found in the HST images to 242 .	Integrated color-magnitude diagrams of the M33 star clusters are found to be similar in general to those of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud , except that M33 has a much lower fraction of blue star clusters .
3	As a result , in addition to the known supersolid above half-filling , we find supersolid even below and at half-filling for large hopping parameters .	We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the soft-core Bose-Hubbard model with the nearest-neighbor repulsion on a square lattice by using an unbiased quantum Monte Carlo method .	In contrast to the previous study [ P. Sengupta { \it et.al . } , Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 94 } , 207202 ( 2005 ) ] , we present the ground-state phase diagrams up to large hopping parameters .	Furthermore , for the strong nearest-neighbor repulsion , we show that the supersolid phase occupies a remarkably broad region in the phase diagram .
4	Our work provides an important guide for the design and optimization of integrated graphene optoelectronic devices .	To fully utilize graphene 's remarkable optical properties for optoelectronic applications , it needs to be integrated in planar photonic systems .	Here , we demonstrate integration of graphene on silicon photonic circuits and precise measurement of the optical absorption coefficient in a graphene/waveguide hybrid structure .	A method based on Mach-Zehnder interferometry is employed to achieve high measurement precision and consistency , yielding a maximal value of absorption coefficient of 0.2 dB/ { \mu } m when graphene is located directly on top of the waveguide .	The results agree with theoretical model utilizing the universal ac conductivity in graphene .
0	We compare two approaches to the predictive modeling of dynamical systems from partial observations at discrete times .	The first is continuous in time , where one uses data to infer a model in the form of stochastic differential equations , which are then discretized for numerical solution .	The second is discrete in time : the model one infers is a parametric representation of a time series that can be directly used for computation .	The comparison is performed in a special case where the observations are known to have been obtained from a hypoelliptic stochastic differential equation .	We show that the discrete-time approach has better predictive skills , especially when the data are relatively sparse in time .
3	Once the relay gets the traffic , it may have a sequence of probings of the second-hop channel ( from the relay to the destination ) .	This letter studies distributed opportunistic channel access in a wireless network with decode-and-forward relays .	All the sources use channel contention to get transmission opportunity .	If a source wins the contention , the channel state information in the first-hop channel ( from the source to its relay ) is estimated , and a decision is made for the winner source to either give up the transmission opportunity and let all sources start a new contention , or transmit to the relay .	After each probing , if the second-hop channel is good enough , the relay transmits to the destination and completes the transmission process of the source ; otherwise , the relay decides either to give up and let all sources start a new contention , or to continue to probe the second-hop channel .
4	Numerical examples show that the new algorithm is computationally attractive and that is consistent with previously reported results .	In this article a new algorithm for the design of stationary input sequences for system identification is presented .	The stationary input signal is generated by optimizing an approximation of a scalar function of the information matrix , based on stationary input sequences generated from prime cycles , which describe the set of finite Markov chains of a given order .	This method can be used for solving input design problems for nonlinear systems .	In particular it can handle amplitude constraints on the input .
2	Here , we propose to exploit the semigroup of a Schr\ '' { o } dinger operator in order to deal with texture data , while maintaining the desirable properties of the heat kernel .	In recent years , quantities derived from the heat equation have become popular in shape processing and analysis of triangulated surfaces .	Such measures are often robust with respect to different kinds of perturbations , including near-isometries , topological noise and partialities .	We define a family of Schr\ '' { o } dinger diffusion distances analogous to the ones associated to the heat kernels , and show that they are continuous under perturbations of the data .	As an application , we introduce a method for retrieval of textured shapes through comparison of Schr\ '' { o } dinger diffusion distance histograms with the earth 's mover distance , and present some numerical experiments showing superior performance compared to an analogous method that ignores the texture .
0	We propose use of the thickness of the ionisation front as a discriminant between alternative modes of reionisation in the early universe , by stars or by miniquasars .	Assuming a photoionisation-recombination balance , we find that for miniquasar sources the transition from neutral to ionised intergalactic medium is extended and has two features .	The first is a sudden steep increase in the neutral fraction with a typical width of 5-10 comoving megaparsecs , depending on the miniquasar power .	The second feature is a long wing that represents a much slower transition from neutral fraction of $ \approx 0.8 $ to 1 .	The angular resolution of LOFAR is expected to resolve these scales and will , therefore , play an important role in discriminating the hard sources of ionising photons from the stellar ones .
3	Chain lengths are up to $ N=80,000 $ , slab widths up to D=120 .	Single three dimensional polymers confined to a slab , i.e.to the region between two parallel plane walls , are studied by Monte Carlo simulations .	They are described by $ N $ -step walks on a simple cubic lattice confined to the region $ 1 \le z \le D $ .	The simulations cover both regions $ D & lt ; & lt ; R_F $ and $ D & gt ; & gt ; R_F $ ( where $ R_F \sim N^\nu $ is the Flory radius , with $ \nu \approx 0.587 $ ) , as well as the cross-over region in between .	In order to test the analysis program and to check for finite size corrections , we actually studied three different models : ( a ) Ordinary random walks ( mimicking $ \Theta $ -polymers ) ; ( b ) Self-avoiding walks ( SAW ) ; and ( c ) Domb-Joyce walks with the self-repulsion tuned to the point where finite size corrections for free ( unrestricted ) chains are minimal .
4	The underlying mechanism seems to be associated to a `` noise-induced chaos reduction '' .	We investigate the effects of a time-correlated noise on an extended chaotic system .	The chosen model is the Lorenz'96 , a kind of `` toy '' model used for climate studies .	Through the analysis of the system 's time evolution and its time and space correlations , we have obtained numerical evidence for two stochastic resonance-like behavior .	Such behavior is seen when both , the usual and a generalized signal-to-noise ratio function are depicted as a function of the external noise intensity or the system size .
2	In particular , the approach of Sachs can serve as a unified theory of general relativity and electroweak interactions .	Majorana 's arbitrary spin theory is considered in a hyperbolic complex representation .	The underlying differential equation is embedded into the gauge field theories of Sachs and Carmeli .	The method is extended to conformal space with the intention to introduce the strong interaction .	It is then possible to use the wave equation , operating on representation functions of the conformal group , to describe the dynamics of matter fields .
0	We review recent progress in studying mesons within gauge/gravity duality , in the context of adding flavour degrees of freedom to generalizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence .	Our main focus is on the `top-down approach ' of considering models constructed within string theory .	We explain the string-theoretical constructions in detail , aiming at non-specialists .	These give rise to a new way of describing strongly coupled confining large N gauge gauge theories similar to large N QCD .	In particular , we consider gravity dual descriptions of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , and compare with lattice results .
0	We apply quantum mechanical sum rules to pairs of one-dimensional systems defined by potential energy functions related by parity .	Specifically , we consider symmetric potentials , $ V ( x ) = V ( -x ) $ , and their parity-restricted partners , ones with $ V ( x ) $ , but defined only on the positive half-line .	We extend recent discussions of sum rules for the quantum bouncer by considering the parity-extended version of this problem , defined by the symmetric linear potential , $ V ( z ) = F|z| $ and find new classes of constraints on the zeros of the Airy function , $ Ai ( z ) $ , and its derivative $ Ai ' ( z ) $ .	We also consider the parity-restricted version of the harmonic oscillator and find completely new classes of mathematical relations , unrleated to those of the ordinary oscillator problem .	These two soluble quantum-mechanical systems defined by power-law potentials provide examples of how the form of the potential ( both parity and continuity properties ) affects the convergence of quantum-mechanical sum rules .
4	It is shown , that at low temperatures there is a correction proportional to the seventh power of temperature to the cubic law of specific heat dependence on temperature .	Self-consistent approach for interacting phonons description in lattice , which generalized Debye model , is proposed .	Notion of `` self-consistent '' phonons is introduced , speed of which depends on temperature and is determined from non-linear equation .	Debye energy is also a function of temperature in this approach .	Thermodynamics of `` self-consistent '' phonon gas is constructed .
3	This condition implies the existence of the derivative operator $ $ dE_t ( a ) : H\to H , \ dE_t ( a ) v=\frac { d } { dt } E_t ( a ) v. $ $ If this operator verifies the additional boundedness condition , $ $ \int_J \|dE_t ( a ) \|_2^2 d t\le C_J\|a\|_2^2 , $ $ for any closed bounded sub-interval $ J\subset I $ , and $ C_J & gt ; 0 $ a constant depending only on $ J $ , then the algebras $ B_t $ are *-isomorphic .	Let A be a von Neumann algebra with a finite trace $ \tau $ , represented in $ H=L^2 ( A , \tau ) $ , and let $ B_t\subset A $ be sub-algebras , for $ t $ in an interval $ I $ .	Let $ E_t : A\to B_t $ be the unique $ \tau $ -preserving conditional expectation .	We say that the path $ t\mapsto E_t $ is smooth if for every $ a\in A $ and $ v \in H $ , the map $ $ I\ni t\mapsto E_t ( a ) v\in H $ $ is continuously differentiable .	More precisely , there exists a curve $ G_t : A\to A $ , $ t\in I $ of unital , *-preserving linear isomorphisms which intertwine the expectations , $ $ G_t\circ E_0=E_t\circ G_t .
3	We consider uniform X-ray illumination of the disc , but the X-ray fluxes required to heat the disc significantly are much greater than those seen by recent observations .	We present the results of a theoretical study investigating the effects of photoionization and heating by X-rays on discs around low-mass stars .	In particular we address the question of whether or not X-rays can drive a disc wind .	First , we construct a 1-dimensional `` quasi-hydrostatic '' model , which solves for the vertical structure introduced by X-ray heating .	When the model is extended to consider heating from a central X-ray source we find that the 1-dimensional model is only valid very close to the star .
4	This allows us to uniquely define the bias voltage across the system while maintaining a proper thermal electronic distribution within the finite lead models .	We propose a new method for simulating electron dynamics in open quantum systems out of equilibrium , using a finite atomistic model .	The proposed method is motivated by the intuitive and practical nature of the driven Liouville von-Neumann equation approach of S\'anchez et al. [ J . Chem .	Phys. , 124 , 214708 ( 2006 ) ] .	A key ingredient of our approach is a transformation of the Hamiltonian matrix from an atomistic to a state representation of the molecular junction .
2	This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism .	We introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that is capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP search problems , on average .	This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices .	Furthermore , empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior , and at the same location , as seen in many previously studied classical search methods .	Specifically , difficult problem instances are concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained problems .
3	We hope to show that the study of algorithms not only increases our understanding of algebraic number fields but also stimulates our curiosity about them .	In this paper we discuss the basic problems of algorithmic algebraic number theory .	The emphasis is on aspects that are of interest from a purely mathematical point of view , and practical issues are largely disregarded .	We describe what has been done and , more importantly , what remains to be done in the area .	The discussion is concentrated of three topics : the determination of Galois groups , the determination of the ring of integers of an algebraic number field , and the computation of the group of units and the class group of that ring of integers .
1	The field content of these actions are : an induced metric , gauge fields , an auxiliary metric and an auxiliary scalar field that implements the Weyl invariance .	Conformal invariant new forms of $ p $ -brane and D $ p $ -brane actions are proposed .	This scalar field transforms with a conformal weight that depends on the brane dimension .	The proposed actions are Weyl invariant in any dimension and the elimination of the auxiliary metric and the scalar field reproduces the Nambu-Goto action for $ p $ -branes and the Born-Infeld action for D $ p $ -branes .	As a consequence of the fact that in the $ p $ -brane case , the action is quadratic in $ \partial_0 X $ , we develop a complete construction for the associated canonical formalism , solving the problem in previous formulations of conformal $ p $ -brane actions where the Hamiltonian can not be constructed .
2	We argue that binary and multiple star systems need to be taken into account when discussing exoplanet habitability .	We review the latest findings on extra-solar planets and their potential to support Earth-like life .	Focusing on planets orbiting Red Dwarf ( RD ) stars , the most abundant stellar type , we show that including RDs as potential host stars could increase the probability of finding biotic planets by a factor of up to a thousand , and reduce the estimate of the distance to our nearest biotic neighbor by up to 10 .	Early considerations indicated that conditions on RD planets would be inimical to life , as their Habitable Zones ( where liquid water could exist ) would be so close as to make planets tidally locked to their star .	This was thought to cause an erratic climate and expose life forms to flares of ionizing radiation .
1	The sample is selected from galaxies in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey ( AEGIS ) .	We present quantitative morphologies of ~300 galaxies in the optically-defined green valley at 0.4 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.2 , in order to constrain the mechanism ( s ) responsible for quenching star formation in the bulk of this population .	While the green valley is defined using optical U-B colors , we find that using a green valley sample defined using NUV-R colors does not change the results .	Using HST/ACS imaging , we study several quantitative morphological parameters including CAS , B/T from GIM2D , and Gini/M_20 .	We find that the green galaxy population is intermediate between the red and blue galaxy populations in terms of concentration , asymmetry , and morphological type and merger fraction estimated using Gini/M_20 .
4	We use the Herschel observations where the zero point of the surface brightness scale is set with the help of the Planck satellite data .	Within the project Galactic Cold Cores we are carrying out Herschel photometric observations of cold interstellar clouds detected with the Planck satellite .	The three fields observed as part of the Herschel science demonstration phase ( SDP ) provided the first glimpse into the nature of these sources .	We examine the properties of the dust emission within the fields .	We determine the dust sub-millimetre opacity , look for signs of spatial variations in the dust spectral index , and estimate how the apparent variations of the parameters could be affected by different sources of uncertainty .
0	For a rotating dust with a 3-dimensional symmetry group all possible metric forms can be classified and , within each class , explicitly written out .	This is made possible by the formalism of Pleba\'nski based on the Darboux theorem .	In the resulting coordinates , the Killing vector fields ( if any exist ) assume a special form .	Each Killing vector field may be either spanned on the fields of velocity and rotation or linearly independent of them .	By considering all such cases one arrives at the classification .
3	Moreover , the possible radii in both cases agree up to numerical factors with the corresponding solutions of the D6-brane worldvolume theory .	We comment on the recent papers by Costa et al and Emparan , which show how one might generate supergravity solutions describing certain dielectric branes in ten dimensions .	The `` basic '' such solutions describe either N fundamental strings or N D4-branes expanding into a D6-brane , with topology M^2 x S^5 or M^5 x S^2 respectively .	Treating these solutions in a unified way , we note that they allow for precisely two values of the radius of the relevant sphere , and that the solution with the smaller value of the radius has the lower energy .	We thus argue that these supergravity solutions are the correct gravitational description of the dielectric branes of Emparan and Myers .
0	In our solar system , Mars-sized protoplanets frequently collided with each other during the last stage of terrestrial planet formation called the giant impact stage .	Giant impacts eject a large amount of material from the colliding protoplanets into the terrestrial planet region , which may form debris disks with observable infrared excesses .	Indeed , tens of warm debris disks around young solar-type stars have been observed .	Here , we quantitatively estimate the total mass of ejected materials during the giant impact stages .	We found that $ \sim $ 0.4 times the Earth 's mass is ejected in total throughout the giant impact stage .
4	We completely resolve this by showing that the order of the Borel subgroup is bounded by the permutation type $ [ L_1 , ... , L_k ] $ only in the trivial case where each of $ L_1 , ... , L_k $ is regular .	A permutation group is called semiprimitive if each of its normal subgroups is either transitive or semiregular .	Given nontrivial finite transitive permutation groups $ L_1 $ and $ L_2 $ with $ L_1 $ not semiprimitive , we construct an infinite family of rank two amalgams of permutation type $ [ L_1 , L_2 ] $ and Borel subgroups of strictly increasing order .	As an application , we show that there is no bound on the order of edge-stabilisers in locally $ [ L_1 , L_2 ] $ graphs .	We also consider the corresponding question for amalgams of rank $ k\geq 3 $ .
2	Then we explicitly display the forms of the remaining terms in the EOS , commenting on the use of experiment and electronic structure theory to evaluate them .	We propose a means for constructing highly accurate equations of state ( EOS ) for elemental solids and liquids essentially from first principles , based upon a particular decomposition of the underlying condensed matter Hamiltonian for the nuclei and electrons .	We also point out that at low pressures the neglect of anharmonic and electron-phonon terms , both contained in this formalism , results in errors of less than 5 % in the thermal parts of the thermodynamic functions .	We also construct an EOS for Aluminum and compare the resulting Hugoniot with data up to 5 Mbar , both to illustrate our method and to see whether the approximation of neglecting anharmonicity et al .	remains viable to such high pressures .
2	Our argument can be extended to prove a lower bound of Omega ( \sqrt { nD } ) rounds for broadcasting in radio networks of radius D. This resolves one of the open problems posed in [ 29 ] , where in the authors proved a lower bound of $ \Omega ( n^ { 1/4 } ) rounds for broadcasting in constant diameter networks .	We consider the problem of deterministic broadcasting in radio networks when the nodes have limited knowledge about the topology of the network .	We show that for every deterministic broadcasting protocol there exists a network , of radius 2 , for which the protocol takes at least $ \Omega ( \sqrt { n } ) rounds for completing the broadcast .	We prove the new lower $ \Omega ( \sqrt { n } ) $ bound for a special family of radius 2 networks .	Each network of this family consists of O ( \sqrt { n } ) components which are connected to each other via only the source node .
4	We do not find any GRB hosts harbouring R- and K-band properties similar to those characterizing the luminous infrared/submillimeter sources and the extremely red starbursts .	We present K-band imaging observations of ten Gamma-Ray Burst ( GRB ) host galaxies .	We compare their observed and absolute K magnitudes as well as their R-K colours with those of other distant sources detected in various optical , near-infrared , mid-infrared and submillimeter deep surveys .	We find that the GRB host galaxies , most of them lying at 0.5 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.5 , exhibit very blue colours , comparable to those of the faint blue star-forming sources at high redshift .	They are sub-luminous in the K-band , suggesting a low stellar mass content .
4	A number of results for the correlation length , critical amplitudes and the finite size shift , for different dimensionalities between the lower $ d_ & lt ; =\sigma/2 $ and the upper $ d_ & gt ; =3\sigma/2 $ critical dimensions , are calculated .	In this paper , we study in details the critical behavior of the $ { \cal O } ( n ) $ quantum $ \phi^4 $ model with long-range interaction decaying with the distances r by a power law as $ r^ { -d-\sigma } $ in the large n-limit .	The zero-temperature critical behavior is discussed .	Its alteration by the finite temperature and/or finite sizes in the space is studied .	The scaling behaviours are studied in different regimes depending upon whether the finite temperature or the finite sizes of the system is leading .
3	We find that Globular Clusters could have contributed at most a small fraction of the current vertical energy of the disk , as they could heat the whole disk to { $ \sigma $ } $ _ { z } $ = 5.5kms $ ^ { { \rm - } { \rm 1 } } $ ( c.f .	So far , six mechanisms have been proposed to account for the Galactic disk heating .	Of these , the most important appear to be a combination of scattering of stars by molecular clouds and by spiral arms .	We study a further mechanism , namely , the repeated disk impact of the original Galactic Globular Cluster population up to the present .	the observed 18 and 39 kms $ ^ { { \rm - } { \rm 1 } } $ for the thick and thin disks respectively ) .
2	The metallic states crossing the Fermi level ( E_F ) are observed in ARPES .	Electronic structures of a charge-density-wave CDW system CeTe_2-xSb_x ( x=0 , 0.05 ) have been investigated by employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( ARPES ) .	The observed Fermi surface ( FS ) agrees very well with the calculated FS for the undistorted CeTe_2 both in shapes and sizes .	The carriers near E_F have mainly the Te ( 1 ) 5p character , with the negligible contribution from Ce 4f states to the CDW formation .	The supercell ( shadow ) bands and the corresponding very weak FS 's are found to arise from band-folding due to the interaction with Ce-Te ( 2 ) layers .
2	In addition to the previous calculations we use a Coulomb potential derived from a realistic proton density distribution in nucleus , improve the precision of the numerical routines used to solve the Dirac equations and to integrate the PSF expressions , and use recently reported Q-values .	We give a complete , up-date list of the phase space factors ( PSF ) for beta-beta- , beta+beta+ , EC beta+ and ECEC double beta decay ( DBD ) modes , in all nuclei of interest and possible transitions to final states .	In calculation , the Coulomb distortion of the electron wave functions is treated by solving numerically the Dirac equation with inclusion of the finite nuclear size and electron screening effects .	These ingredients proved to be important , leading in many cases to significant differences as compared to the present available PSF values , which are discussed as well .	Accurate values of the PSF are necessary ingredients both for theorists , to improve the DBD lifetime predictions and constraint the neutrino parameters , and for experimentalists to plan their set-ups .
0	The abundance and structure of dark matter subhalos has been analyzed extensively in recent studies of dark matter-only simulations , but comparatively little is known about the impact of baryonic physics on halo substructures .	We here extend the SUBFIND algorithm for substructure identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation .	This allows , in particular , the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies , and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars , dark matter , and hot and cold gas .	Using a large set of cosmological cluster simulations , we present a detailed analysis of halo substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters , focusing in particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics , and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic outflows .	We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as artificial viscosity parameterizations .
0	A continuum model for the dynamics of a single step with the strongly anisotropic line energy is formulated and analyzed .	The step grows by attachment of adatoms from the lower terrace , onto which atoms adsorb from a vapor phase or from a molecular beam , and the desorption is non-negligible ( the `` one-sided '' model ) .	Via a multi-scale expansion , we derived a longwave , strongly nonlinear , and strongly anisotropic evolution PDE for the step profile .	Written in terms of the step slope , the PDE can be represented in the form similar to a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation .	We performed the linear stability analysis and computed the nonlinear dynamics .
1	By obfuscating the quantum information required by both the decrypting process and the location verification process , a communication channel is created in which the encrypted data can only be decrypted at a specific geographic locale .	In this work we introduce the concept of quantum geo-encryption - a protocol that invokes direct quantum encryption of messages coupled to quantum location monitoring of the intended receiver .	Classical wireless communications can be invoked to unlock the quantum encryption process thereby allowing for any deployment scenario regardless of the channel conditions .	Quantum geo-encryption can also be used to realize quantum-computing instructions that can only be implemented at a specific location , and allow for a specified geographical data-route through a distributed network .	Here we consider the operational aspects of quantum geo-encryption in generic Rician channels , demonstrating that the likelihood of a successful spoofing attack approaches zero as the adversary moves away from the allowed decrypting location .
4	The resulting algorithms are nearly optimal .	In this paper , we show that efficient separated sum-of-exponentials approximations can be constructed for the heat kernel in any dimension .	In one space dimension , the heat kernel admits an approximation involving a number of terms that is of the order $ O ( \log ( \frac { T } { \delta } ) ( \log ( \frac { 1 } { \epsilon } ) +\log\log ( \frac { T } { \delta } ) ) ) $ for any $ x\in\bbR $ and $ \delta \leq t \leq T $ , where $ \epsilon $ is the desired precision .	In all higher dimensions , the corresponding heat kernel admits an approximation involving only $ O ( \log^2 ( \frac { T } { \delta } ) ) $ terms for fixed accuracy $ \epsilon $ .	These approximations can be used to accelerate integral equation-based methods for boundary value problems governed by the heat equation in complex geometry .
3	We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use .	We propose a new prior distribution for classical ( nonhierarchical ) logistic regression models , constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5 , and then placing independent Student- $ t $ prior distributions on the coefficients .	As a default choice , we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5 , which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression .	Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors .	It has the advantage of always giving answers , even when there is complete separation in logistic regression ( a common problem , even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small ) , and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions .
0	The origin of intergalactic magnetic fields is still a mystery and several scenarios have been proposed so far : among them , primordial phase transitions , structure formation shocks and galactic outflows .	In this work we investigate how efficiently galactic winds can provide an intense and widespread `` seed '' magnetisation .	This may be used to explain the magnetic fields observed today in clusters of galaxies and in the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) .	We use semi-analytic simulations of magnetised galactic winds coupled to high resolution N-body simulations of structure formation to estimate lower and upper limits for the fraction of the IGM which can be magnetised up to a specified level .	We find that galactic winds are able to seed a substantial fraction of the cosmic volume with magnetic fields .
1	I discuss the methods of analysis , their relative advantages and disadvantages , and their reliabilities .	I review our current knowledge of the mass distribution in clusters , as obtained from the analysis of the projected phase-space distribution of cluster galaxies .	I summarize the most recent and important results on the mass distributions of galaxy systems , from nearby to medium-distant systems , and from groups to clusters .	In particular I consider how well different proposed models fit the observed cluster mass distribution , and which are the relative distributions of galaxies , baryons , and dark or total mass in clusters .	I also discuss the current observational evidence for mass accretion onto galaxy systems , coming mostly from the analysis of the velocity anisotropy profiles .
3	For multi-period cases , we derive generalized strong valid inequalities ( including one , two , and three continuous variables , respectively ) and further prove that these inequalities are facet-defining under mild conditions .	In this paper , we study the polyhedral structure of an integrated minimum-up/-down time and ramping polytope , which has broad applications in variant industries .	The polytope we studied includes minimum-up/-down time , generation ramp-up/-down rate , logical , and generation upper/lower bound constraints .	By exploring its specialized structures , we derive strong valid inequalities and explore a new proof technique to prove these inequalities are sufficient to provide convex hull descriptions for variant two-period and three-period polytopes , under different parameter settings .	Moreover , we discover efficient polynomial time separation algorithms for these inequalities to improve the computational efficiency .
2	Numerical simulations with the coupled-NLS model with $ 2 \le N \le 4 $ show stable oscillatory dynamics of soliton amplitudes at short-to-intermediate distances , in agreement with predictions of the predator-prey model .	We study stabilization and destabilization of propagating soliton sequences in broadband fiber optics systems with $ N $ frequency channels , taking into account second-order dispersion , Kerr nonlinearity , delayed Raman response , and linear gain-loss .	We employ a propagation model consisting of a system of $ N $ coupled nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger ( NLS ) equations and a reduced $ N $ -dimensional predator-prey model for amplitude dynamics .	Furthermore , the main destabilizing mechanism at long distances is due to generation of radiative sidebands , where the sidebands for a given channel form at the frequencies of solitons in the neighboring channels .	This destabilizing process can be partially mitigated by employing frequency dependent linear gain-loss .
1	We consider the case where the structure of the graph to be reconstructed is known to be scale-free .	A key problem in statistics and machine learning is the determination of network structure from data .	We show that in such cases it is natural to formulate structured sparsity inducing priors using submodular functions , and we use their Lov\'asz extension to obtain a convex relaxation .	For tractable classes such as Gaussian graphical models , this leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved .	We show that our method results in an improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed networks for synthetic data .
2	We find that the outburst behaviour of a fictitious dwarf nova with the same system parameters as AM Her is strongly influenced by these variations of the mass loss rate .	We present simulations of dwarf nova outbursts taking into account realistic variations of the mass loss rate from the secondary .	The mass transfer variation has been derived from 20 years of visual monitoring and from X-ray observations covering various accretion states of the discless cataclysmic variable AM Herculis .	Depending on the mass loss rate , the disc produces either long outbursts , a cycle of one long outburst followed by two short outbursts , or only short outbursts .	The course of the transfer rate dominates the shape of the outbursts because the mass accreted during an outburst cycle roughly equals the mass transferred from the secondary over the outburst interval .
3	We discuss here how the presence of an SMB will affect the BLRs of AGNs and what the observational consequences might be .	The broad emission spectral lines emitted from AGNs are our main probe of the geometry and physics of the broad line region ( BLR ) close to the SMBH .	There is a group of AGNs that emits very broad and complex line profiles , showing two displaced peaks , one blueshifted and one redshifted from the systemic velocity defined by the narrow lines , or a single such peak .	It has been proposed that such line shapes could indicate a supermassive binary black hole ( SMB ) system .	We review previous claims of SMBs based on broad line profiles and find that they may have non-SMB explanations as a consequence of a complex BLR structure .
2	A similarly good fit is given by a $ \tau\propto r^ { 0.72\pm0.01 } $ ratio between cooling and free-fall times .	Large scale structures such as groups and clusters of galaxies show a universal , nearly linear entropy radial profile $ K ( r ) $ .	Using deprojected 16 clusters and 12 groups from the literature , we find that $ K\propto r^ { 0.96\pm0.01 } $ , consistent with the mean power-law index $ ( 0.9\mbox { -- } 1.1 ) $ of previous studies .	Both profiles slightly flatten at small radii , as $ \tau $ becomes of order unity .	The entropy profile is usually attributed to self-similar shock accretion ( shown to be inconsistent with the data ) , to non-standard heat conduction , or to turbulent heating .
3	We report upper limits on the astrophysical coalescence rates of IMBHs with total binary mass $ 50 \le M/\mathrm { M } _\odot \le 450 $ and component mass ratios of either 1:1 or 4:1 .	We report results from a search for gravitational waves produced by perturbed intermediate mass black holes ( IMBH ) in data collected by LIGO and Virgo between 2005 and 2010 .	The search was sensitive to astrophysical sources that produced damped sinusoid gravitational wave signals , also known as ringdowns , with frequency $ 50\le f_ { 0 } /\mathrm { Hz } \le 2000 $ and decay timescale $ 0.0001\lesssim \tau/\mathrm { s } \lesssim 0.1 $ characteristic of those produced in mergers of IMBH pairs .	No significant gravitational wave candidate was detected .	For systems with total mass $ 100 \le M/\mathrm { M } _\odot \le 150 $ , we report a 90 % -confidence upper limit on the rate of binary IMBH mergers with non-spinning and equal mass components of $ 6.9\times10^ { -8 } \ , $ Mpc $ ^ { -3 } $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ .
2	It is established that there exists a subclass in 1-D space admitting an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of invariance so that it is linearisable .	Complete descriptions of the Lie symmetries of a class of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with gradient-dependent diffusivity in one and two space dimensions are obtained .	A surprisingly rich set of Lie symmetry algebras depending on the form of diffusivity and source ( sink ) in the equations is derived .	A special power-law diffusivity with a fixed exponent , which leads to wider Lie invariance of the equations in question in 2-D space , is also derived .	However , it is shown that the diffusion equation without a source term ( which often arises in applications and is sometimes called the Perona-Malik equation ) possesses no rich variety of Lie symmetries depending on the form of gradient-dependent diffusivity .
2	We find that the tunnelling rates depend on the number of electrons in each dynamic QD because of Coulomb energy .	We measure the electron escape-rate from surface-acoustic-wave dynamic quantum dots ( QDs ) through a tunnel barrier .	Rate-equations are used to extract the tunnelling rates , which change by an order of magnitude with tunnel-barrier gate voltage .	By comparing this dependence to a saddle-point-potential model , the addition energies of the second and third electron in each dynamic QD are estimated .	The scale ( a few meV ) is comparable to those in static QDs as expected .
0	The cutoff version of the AdS/CFT correspondence states that the Randall Sundrum scenario is dual to a Conformal Field Theory ( CFT ) coupled to gravity in four dimensions .	The gravitational field produced by relativistic domain walls can be exactly solved in both sides of the correspondence , and thus provides one further check of it .	We show in the two sides that for the most symmetric case , the wall motion does not lead to particle production of the CFT fields .	Still , there are nontrivial effects .	Due to the trace anomaly , the CFT effectively renormalizes the domain wall tension .
2	In this way we find for a generic ( D ) p-brane , potentials going like $ v^ { 4-n } /r^ { 7-p+n } $ corresponding to interactions between the different components of the D-brane supermultiplet .	We study the spin dependence of D-brane dynamics in the Green-Schwarz formalism of boundary states .	In particular we show how to interpret insertion of supercharges on the boundary state as sources of non-universal spin effects in D-brane potentials .	From the eleven dimensional point of view , these potentials arise from the exchange of field strengths corresponding to the graviton and the three form , coupled non-minimally to the branes .	We show how an annulus computation truncated to its massless contribution is enough to reproduce these next-to-leading effects , meaning in particular that the one-loop ( M ) atrix theory effective action should encode all the spin dependence of low-energy supergravity interactions .
1	Traditionally , RNA-seq experiments are mathematically averaged -- they sequence the mRNA of individuals from different treatment groups , hoping to correlate phenotype with differences in arithmetic read count averages at shared loci of interest .	RNA-seq has become a de facto standard for measuring gene expression .	Alternatively , the tissue from the same individuals may be pooled prior to sequencing in what we refer to as a biologically averaged design .	As mathematical averaging sequences all individuals it controls for both biological and technical variation ; however , is the statistical resolution gained always worth the additional cost ?	To compare biological and mathematical averaging , we examined theoretical and empirical estimates of statistical efficiency and relative cost efficiency .
1	With the LEP era over and the Tevatron Run II search via $ p\bar p \to WH+X $ arduous , we revisit a case where $ WH $ or $ ZH + $ jets could arise via strong $ b^\prime\bar b^\prime $ pair production .	Direct and indirect searches of the Higgs boson suggest that 113 GeV $ \lesssim m_H \lesssim $ 170 GeV is likely .	In contrast to 10 years ago , the tight electroweak constraint on $ t^\prime $ -- $ b^\prime $ ( hence $ t^\prime $ -- $ t $ ) splitting reduces FCNC $ b^\prime\to bZ $ , $ bH $ rates , making $ b^\prime\to cW $ naturally competitive .	Such a `` cocktail solution '' is precisely the mix that could evade the CDF search for $ b^\prime\to bZ $ , and the $ b^\prime $ may well be lurking below the top .	In light of the Higgs program , this two-in-one strategy should be pursued .
4	In the temperature range $ 2T_\mathrm { c } -10T_\mathrm { c } $ we find $ \kappa=0.36 ( 15 ) T^2 $ .	The quark gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions behaves like an almost ideal fluid described by viscous hydrodynamics with a number of transport coefficients .	The second order coefficient $ \kappa $ is related to a Euclidean correlator of the energy-momentum tensor at vanishing frequency and low momentum .	This allows for a lattice determination without maximum entropy methods or modelling , but the required lattice sizes represent a formidable challenge .	We calculate $ \kappa $ in leading order lattice perturbation theory and simulations on $ 120^3\times 6,8 $ lattices with $ a & lt ; 0.1 $ fm .
4	A dramatic improvement in the efficiency of ~40 -- 60 % is expected if follow-up observations on an 8m telescope are made possible by a real-time alert system .	The Angstrom Project is using a global network of 2m-class telescopes to conduct a high cadence pixel microlensing survey of the bulge of the Andromeda Galaxy ( M31 ) , with the primary aim of constraining its underlying bulge mass distribution and stellar mass function .	Here we investigate the feasibility of using such a survey to detect planets in M31 .	We estimate the efficiency of detecting signals for events induced by planetary systems as a function of planet/star mass ratio and separation , source type and background M31 surface brightness .	We find that for planets of a Jupiter-mass or above that are within the lensing zone ( ~1 -3 AU ) detection is possible above 3 $ \sigma $ , with detection efficiencies ~3 % for events associated with giant stars , which are the typical source stars of pixel-lensing surveys .
1	The results are UD functions $ \Phi^ { ( L ) } , $ where $ L $ is the number of loops .	UD integrals published by N. Usyukina and A. Davydychev in 1992-1993 are integrals corresponding to ladder-type Feynman diagrams .	They play an important role in N=4 supersymmetic Yang-Mills theory .	The integrals were defined and calculated in the momentum space .	In this paper the position space representation of UD functions is investigated .
1	The matrix is normalized so that the average spacing between consecutive eigenvalues is of order $ 1/N $ .	We consider $ N\times N $ Hermitian random matrices with i.i.d.entries .	We study the connection between eigenvalue statistics on microscopic energy scales $ \eta\ll1 $ and ( de ) localization properties of the eigenvectors .	Under suitable assumptions on the distribution of the single matrix elements , we first give an upper bound on the density of states on short energy scales of order $ \eta \sim\log N/N $ .	We then prove that the density of states concentrates around the Wigner semicircle law on energy scales $ \eta\gg N^ { -2/3 } $ .
1	The CERN-SPS accelerator has been operated from May 10th to May 24th 2012 , with a tightly bunched-beam structure to allow the velocity of neutrinos to be accurately measured on an event-by-event basis .	We report the measurement of the time-of-flight of ~17 GeV muon neutrinos on the CNGS baseline ( 732 km ) with the Large Volume Detector ( LVD ) at the Gran Sasso Laboratory .	LVD has detected 48 neutrino events , associated to the beam , with a high absolute time accuracy .	These events allow to establish the following limit on the difference between the neutrino speed and the light velocity : -3.8 x 10-6 & lt ; ( v-c ) /c & lt ; 3.1 x 10-6 ( at 99 % C.L . ) .	This value is an order of magnitude lower than previous direct measurements .
4	The presence of a black hole depresses the entropy of the cosmological horizon by an amount proportional to the geometric mean of the entropies of the black hole and cosmological horizons .	In this paper we focus on the gravitational thermodynamics of the far future .	Cosmological observations suggest that most matter will be diluted away by the cosmological expansion , with the rest collapsing into supermassive black holes .	The likely future state of our local universe is a supermassive black hole slowly evaporating in an empty universe dominated by a positive cosmological constant .	We describe some overlooked features of how the cosmological horizon responds to the black hole evaporation .
3	The fraction of obscured AGN at low redshift can be derived from the observed CXB spectrum assuming AGN spectral templates and luminosity functions .	The diffuse cosmic X-ray background ( CXB ) is the sum of the emission of discrete sources , mostly massive black-holes accreting matter in active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) .	The CXB spectrum differs from the integration of the spectra of individual sources , calling for a large population , undetected so far , of strongly obscured Compton thick AGN .	Such objects are predicted by unified models , which attribute most of the AGN diversity to their inclination on the line of sight , and play an important role for the understanding of the growth of black holes in the early Universe .	We show that high signal-to-noise average hard X-ray spectra , derived from more than a billion seconds of effective exposure time with the Swift/BAT instrument , imply that mildly obscured Compton thin AGN feature a strong reflection and contribute massively to the CXB .
3	Its coherence length is about 22 times longer than that of the input laser pulses .	We observed two-photon phase super-resolution in an unbalanced Michelson interferometer with classical Gaussian laser pulses .	Our work is a time-reversed version of a two-photon interference experiment using an unbalanced Michelson interferometer .	A measured interferogram exhibits two-photon phase super-resolution with a high visibility of 97.9 % \pm 0.4 % .	It is a classical analogue to the large difference between the one- and two-photon coherence lengths of entangled photon pairs .
4	Finally , a particular example containing all classical discrete symmetric orthogonal polynomials is studied in detail .	By using a generalization of Sturm-Liouville problems in discrete spaces , a basic class of symmetric orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable with four free parameters , which generalizes all classical discrete symmetric orthogonal polynomials , is introduced .	The standard properties of these polynomials , such as a second order difference equation , an explicit form for the polynomials , a three term recurrence relation and an orthogonality relation are presented .	It is shown that two hypergeometric orthogonal sequences with 20 different weight functions can be extracted from this class .	Moreover , moments corresponding to these weight functions can be explicitly computed .
3	The use of relative distances destroys the symmetry property of the original C-S model , which was the key for the various recent studies of C-S flocking behavior .	We introduce a model for self-organized dynamics which , we argue , addresses several drawbacks of the celebrated Cucker-Smale ( C-S ) model .	The proposed model does not only take into account the distance between agents , but instead , the influence between agents is scaled in term of their relative distance .	Consequently , our model does not involve any explicit dependence on the number of agents ; only their geometry in phase space is taken into account .	To this end , we introduce here a new framework to analyze the phenomenon of flocking for a rather general class of dynamical systems , which covers systems with non-symmetric influence matrices .
0	We study a discrete stochastic model of a molecular motor .	This discrete model can be viewed as a \emph { minimal } ratchet model .	We extend our previous work on this model , by further investigating the constraints imposed by the Fluctuation Theorem on the operation of a molecular motor far from equilibrium .	In this work , we show the connections between different formulations of the Fluctuation Theorem .	One formulation concerns the generating function of the currents while another one concerns the corresponding large deviation function , which we have calculated exactly for this model .
4	Neutral systems of two charged constituents are shown to obey the lore that the heavier one is generally closer to the transverse origin than the lighter one .	A simple exact covariant model in which a scalar particle is modeled as a bound state of two different particles is used to elucidate relativistic aspects of electromagnetic form factors .	The model form factor is computed using an exact covariant calculation of the lowest-order triangle diagram and shown to be the same as that obtained using light-front techniques .	The meaning of transverse density is explained using coordinate space variables , allowing us to identify a true mean-square transverse size directly related to the form factor .	We show that the rest-frame charge distribution is generally not observable because of the failure to uphold current conservation .
1	The data sample of e+ p - & gt ; e+ + jet + X events in the kinematic range of photon virtualities Q^2 & lt ; 1 GeV^2 and photon-proton centre-of-mass energies 95 & lt ; W_gammap & lt ; 285 GeV represents an integrated luminosity of 24.1 pb^-1 .	Inclusive jet cross sections are measured in photoproduction at HERA using the H1 detector .	Jets are defined using the inclusive k_T algorithm .	Single- and multi-differential cross sections are measured as functions of jet transverse energy E_T^jet and pseudorapidity \eta^jet in the domain 5 & lt ; E_T^jet & lt ; 75 GeV and -1 & lt ; \eta^jet & lt ; 2.5 .	The cross sections are found to be in good agreement with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations corrected for fragmentation and underlying event effects .
0	It is argued that the observation of anisotropic azimuthal distribution of final state particles alone is insufficient to show whether the formed matter at RHIC behaves like hydrodynamic flow .	Examining the intrinsic interaction ( or correlation ) of the formed matter should provide more definite judgement .	To the end , a spatial-dependent azimuthal multiplicity-correlation pattern is suggested .	It shows clearly in the pattern that there are two kinds of interactions at the early stage of Au + Au collisions at $ \sqnn=200 $ GeV generated by RQMD with hadron re-scattering and AMPT with string melting .	This is out of the expectation from the elliptic flow driven by anisotropic expansion .
3	Under solar conditions , this is generally pointed upwards in the chromosphere , and enhances the abundance of chromospheric ions in the corona .	We revisit in more detail a model for element abundance fractionation in the solar chromosphere , that gives rise to the `` FIP Effect '' in the solar corona and wind .	Elements with first ionization potential below about 10 eV , i.e.those that are predominantly ionized in the chromosphere , are enriched in the corona by a factor 3-4 .	We model the propagation of Alfven waves through the chromosphere using a non-WKB treatment , and evaluate the ponderomotive force associated with these waves .	Our new approach captures the essentials of the solar coronal abundance anomalies , including the depletion of He relative to H , and also the putative depletion of Ne , recently discussed in the literature .
2	In an initial characterization step , substructuring approach is applied to the healthy structure in order to isolate the substructures of interest and later , each substructure is identified by a Vector Auto Regressive with eXogenous inputs ( VARX ) model measuring all DOFs .	A SHM method is proposed that minimises the required number of sensors for detecting damage .	The damage detection method consists of two steps .	Then , pairwise conditional Granger causality analysis is carried out with data measured from substructural DOFs to evaluate the information loss when measurements from all DOFs are not available .	This analysis allows selecting those accelerometers that can be suppressed minimising the information loss .
0	We present a search for galaxies at 7.6 & lt ; z & lt ; 9.8 using the latest HST WFC3 near-infrared data , based on the Lyman-break technique .	We search for galaxies which have large ( Y-J ) colours ( the `` Y-drops '' ) on account of the Lyman-alpha forest absorption , and with ( J-H ) colours inconsistent with being low-redshift contaminants .	We identify 24 candidates at redshift z~8-9 ( 15 are robust and a further 9 more marginal but consistent with being high redshift ) over an area of ~50 square arcminutes .	Previous searches for Y-drops with WFC3 have focussed only on the Hubble Ultra Deep Field ( HUDF ) , and our larger survey ( involving two other nearby deep fields and a wider area survey ) has trebelled the number of robust Y-drop candidates .	For the first time , we have sufficient z~8-9 galaxies to fit both phi^* and M^* of the UV Schechter luminosity function .
3	We discuss the creation of the ALESS submillimeter galaxy ( SMG ) catalog , including the main sample of 99 SMGs and a supplementary sample of 32 SMGs .	We present an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) Cycle 0 survey of 126 submillimeter sources from the LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter Survey ( LESS ) .	Our 870 micron survey with ALMA ( ALESS ) has produced maps ~3X deeper and with a beam area ~200X smaller than the original LESS observations , doubling the current number of interferometrically-observed submillimeter sources .	The high resolution of these maps allows us to resolve sources that were previously blended and accurately identify the origin of the submillimeter emission .	We find that at least 35 % ( possibly up to 50 % ) of the detected LABOCA sources have been resolved into multiple SMGs , and that the average number of SMGs per LESS source increases with LESS flux density .
1	The global symmetries of the model include SL ( 4 ) transformations and translations .	A model of random triangulations of a domain in $ R^ { ( 4 ) } $ is presented .	If a stable microscopic scale exists for some range of parameters , the model should be in a translation invariant phase where SL ( 4 ) is spontaneously broken to O ( 4 ) .	In that phase , SL ( 4 ) Ward identities imply that the correlation length in the spin two channel of a symmetric tensor field is infinite .	Consequently , it may be possible to identify the continuum limit of four dimensional Quantum Gravity with points inside that phase .
4	Here we present a numerical model that includes the effects of axial conduction and variable properties for a plate fin heat exchanger .	Future superconducting radio frequency ( SRF ) cavities , as part of Project X at Fermilab , will be cooled to superfluid helium temperatures by a cryogenic distribution system supplying cold supercritical helium .	To reduce vapor fraction during the final Joule-Thomson ( J-T ) expansion into the superfluid helium cooling bath , counter-flow , plate-fin heat exchangers will be utilized .	Due to their compact size and ease of fabrication , plate-fin heat exchangers are an effective option .	However , the design of compact and high-effectiveness cryogenic heat exchangers operating at liquid helium temperatures requires consideration of axial heat conduction along the direction of flow , in addition to variable fluid properties .
4	Here , we undertake a first step in this direction by focussing on the pressure-driven insulator-metal transition using a combination of first-principles density-functional and many-body calculations .	Unusual metallic states involving breakdown of the standard Fermi-liquid picture of long-lived quasiparticles in well-defined band states emerge at low temperatures near correlation-driven Mott transitions .	Prominent examples are ill-understood metallic states in $ d $ - and $ f $ -band compounds near Mott-like transitions .	Finding of superconductivity in solid O $ _ { 2 } $ on the border of an insulator-metal transition at high pressures close to 96~GPa is thus truly remarkable .	Neither the insulator-metal transition nor superconductivity are understood satisfactorily .
0	We present solution generating techniques which permit to construct exact inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmological solutions to a four-dimensional low energy limit of string theory containing non-minimally interacting electromagnetic and dilaton fields .	Some explicit homogeneous and inhomogeneous cosmological solutions are constructed .	For example , inhomogeneous exact solutions presenting Gowdy - type EMD universe are obtained .	The asymptotic behaviour of the solutions is investigated .	The asymptotic form of the metric near the initial singularity has a spatially varying Kasner form .
0	We construct a class of closed timelike curves ( CTCs ) using a compactified extra dimension $ u $ .	A nonzero metric element $ g_ { tu } ( u ) $ enables particles to travel backwards in global time $ t $ .	The compactified dimension guarantees that the geodesic curve closes in $ u $ .	The effective 2D ( $ t $ and $ u $ ) nature of the metric ensures that spacetime is flat , therein satisfying all the classical stability conditions as expressed by the energy conditions .	Finally , stationarity of the metric guarantees that a particle 's energy is conserved .
4	We discuss the possible nature of the newly detected star based on near-infrared photometry and its proper motion relative to FU Ori .	By using the ALFA adaptive optics system at the 3.6m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory we detected a faint red star in the apparent vicinity of FU Ori , the prototype of the FUor outburst stars .	Independent confirmation of the detection is obtained from archival PUEO/CFHT images .	The separation between the companion candidate and FU Ori is 0 .	`` 50 and their brightness contrast is around 4 magnitudes .
1	Although powerful computer methods exist for the solution of this problem for a given ( fixed ) dimension of the matrices g { ij } and especially for numerical elements of g { ij } , the structure of the obtained linear algebraic system in the general N-dimensional case and for arbitrary elements of g { ij } ( functions ) has not been known .	In this paper a new block-structure method is presented for the solution of the well-known from gravity theory matrix system of equations g { ij } g { jk } =delta { i } { k } ( with respect to the unknown covariant components g { ij } and by known contravariant ones g { jk } ) by transforming this matrix system into a linear algebraic system of equations in the general N-dimensional case .	The proposed new analytical block-structure method for the case of symmetrical matrices g { ij } and g { jk } ( the standard case in gravity theory ) is based on the construction of a block-structure matrix , whose `` elements '' are again matrices .	The method allows to obtain the structure of this linear system in the general N-dimensional case , after multiplication ( to the left ) with the transponed matrix .	Some arguments are given why the proposed method may be applied , after some refinement and generalization for the case of non-symmetrical matrices g { ij } and g { jk } , for finding the graviton modes in the Kaluza-Klein expansion in theories with extra dimensions .
0	In this paper , we explore the possibility that the radiative properties of the most compact region in NGC 6251* may be understood in the same sense as Sgr A* , though with some telling differences that may hint at the nature of jet formation .	We show that observations of this object with ASCA , ROSAT , HST and VLBI together may be hinting at a picture in which Bondi-Hoyle accretion from an ambient ionized medium feeds a standard disk accreting at ~ 4.0*10^ { 22 } g s^ { -1 } .	Somewhere near the event horizon , this plasma is heated to & gt ; 10^ { 11 } K , where it radiates via thermal synchrotron ( producing a radio component ) and self-Comptonization ( accounting for a nonthermal X-ray flux ) .	This temperature is much greater than its virial value and the hot cloud expands at roughly the sound speed ( ~0.1c ) , after which it begins to accelerate on a parsec scale to relativistic velocities .	In earlier work , the emission from the extended jet has been modeled successfully using nonthermal synchrotron self-Compton processes , with a self-absorbed inner core .
0	We identify a recursive structure among factorizations of polynomial values into two integer factors .	Polynomials for which this recursive structure characterizes all non-trivial representations of integer factorizations of the polynomial values into two parts are here called recursively-factorable polynomials .	In particular , we prove that $ n^2+1 $ and the prime-producing polynomials $ n^2+n+41 $ and $ 2n^2+ 29 $ are recursively-factorable .	For quadratics , the we prove that this recursive structure is equivalent to a Diophantine identity involving the product of two binary quadratic forms .	We show that this identity may be transformed into geometric terms , relating each integer factorization $ an^2+bn+c=pq $ to a lattice point of the conic section $ aX^2+bXY+cY^2+X-nY=0 $ , and vice versa .
0	In this paper , we present a simple stock market model ( the market game ) which incorporates , as ab initio dynamics delayed majority dynamics , according to which agents ( with heterogeneous strategies and price expectations ) are rewarded if their actions at time t are the actions of the majority of agents at time t+1 .	We observe that for a range of parameter settings , minority dynamics are dynamically induced in this game , despite the fact that they are not introduced ab initio .	Central to the emergence of minority dynamics is the introduction of the notion of price expectations for the agents .	This leads to the possibility of an agent not participating in the market for some time steps .	One consequence of the induced minority dynamics is an effective reduction in market volatility .
4	The absence of superconductivity in three-dimensional Li-doped graphite underlines that superconductivity in Li-FLG arises from the novel electronic properties of the two-dimensional graphene layer .	Superconductivity in graphene has been highly sought after for its promise in various device applications and for general scientific interest .	Ironically , the simple electronic structure of graphene , which is responsible for novel quantum phenomena , hinders the emergence of superconductivity .	Theory predicts that doping the surface of the graphene effectively alters the electronic structure , thus promoting propensity towards Cooper pair instability .	Here we report the emergence of superconductivity at 7.4 K in Li-intercalated few-layer-graphene ( FLG ) .
3	It is found that these solutions are well approximated by a truncated series of hyperbolic secants .	In the present work , we revisit the so-called regularized short pulse equation ( RSPE ) and , in particular , explore the traveling wave solutions of this model .	We theoretically analyze and numerically evolve two sets of such solutions .	First , using a fixed point iteration scheme , we numerically integrate the equation to find solitary waves .	The dependence of the soliton 's parameters ( height , width , etc ) to the parameters of the equation is also investigated .
0	Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring of dimension n & gt ; 2 and let A=R [ T , T^ { -1 } ] .	Assume that the height of the Jacobson radical of R is atleast 2 .	Let P be a projective A-module of rank n=dim A - 1 with trivial determinant .	We define an abelian group called the `` Euler class group of A '' , denoted by E ( A ) .	Let \chi be an isomorphism from A to det ( P ) .
2	It is known that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be achieved by a redefinition involving another star-product .	We study the properties of the energy-momentum tensor of gauge fields coupled to matter in non-commutative ( Moyal ) space .	In general , the non-commutativity affects the usual conservation law of the tensor as well as its transformation properties ( gauge covariance instead of gauge invariance ) .	Furthermore , for a pure gauge theory it is always possible to define a gauge invariant energy-momentum tensor by means of a Wilson line .	We show that the latter two procedures are incompatible with each other if couplings of gauge fields to matter fields ( scalars or fermions ) are considered : The gauge invariant tensor ( constructed via Wilson line ) does not allow for a redefinition assuring its conservation , and vice-versa the introduction of another star-product does not allow for gauge invariance by means of a Wilson line .
1	There might also be a small number of normal thick disk stars at the same location .	We confirm that there are at least three separate low-latitude over-densities of blue F turnoff stars near the Milky Way anti-center : the Monoceros Ring , the Anti-Center Stream ( ACS ) , and the Eastern Banded Structure ( EBS ) .	The ACS is a tilted component that extends to higher Galactic latitude at lower Galactic longitude , 10 kpc from the Sun towards the anti-center .	It has a sharp cutoff on the high latitude side .	Distance , velocity , and proper motion measurements are consistent with previous orbit fits .
3	The analytic setup is chosen such that the developed code is capable of following the evolution even inside the black hole region .	The relativistic time evolution of multi-layer spherically symmetric shell systems -- -consisting of infinitely thin shells separated by vacuum regions -- -is examined .	Whenever two shells collide the evolution is continued with the assumption that the collision is totally transparent .	The time evolution of various multi-layer shell systems -- -comprised by large number of shells thereby mimicking the behavior of a thick shell making it possible to study the formation of acoustic singularities -- -is analyzed numerically and compared in certain cases to the corresponding Newtonian time evolution .	This , in particular , allowed us to investigate the mass inflation phenomenon in the chosen framework .
3	The morphotropic phase boundary region consists of coexisting tetragonal and monoclinic structures with space group P4mm and Pm respectively , stable in composition ranges 0.41 to 0.49 as confirmed by Rietveld analysis .	We present here the results of structural studies on multiferroic ( 1-x ) Bi ( Ni1/2Ti1/2 ) O3-xPbTiO3 solid solution using Rietveld analysis on powder x-ray diffraction data in the composition range 0.35 to 0.55 .	We have determined precisely the stability region of various crystallographic phases at room temperature for ( 1-x ) Bi ( Ni1/2Ti1/2 ) O3-xPbTiO3 .	Structural transformation from pseudo-cubic to tetragonal phase is observed via phase coexistence region demarcating the morphotropic phase boundary region .	The results of Rietveld analysis completely rules out the coexistence of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases in the morphotropic phase boundary region reported by earlier workers .
1	While the nine year old Wilkinson Mass Anisotropy Probe experiment suggests the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom to be $ N_ { \text { eff } } = 3.84 \pm 0.40 $ , recently reported Planck collaboration results show more preference towards the standard three light neutrino scenario $ N_ { \text { eff } } = 3.30^ { +0.54 } _ { -0.51 } $ .	Sterile neutrinos with sub-electron volt ( eV ) masses have recently received serious attention due to the tantalizing hints from reactor neutrino experiments as well as cosmology .	Keeping in mind that the issue of existence or non-existence of sub-eV scale sterile neutrinos is not yet settled , here we outline a mechanism to generate sub-eV scale masses for three active and one sterile neutrinos simultaneously .	The model is based on an abelian extension of standard model where the fermion and scalar fields are charged under the additional $ U ( 1 ) $ gauge group in such an anomaly free way that it allows one eV scale neutrino and three massless neutrinos at tree level .	However , at one loop level , this model naturally allows three active and one sterile neutrino with mass at the sub-eV scale .
2	As the temperature is raised under such a weak field , however , the currents in the bulk region are immediately reduced and finally there only remains the diamagnetic current flowing along the edge .	The spatial distribution of electric current under magnetic field and the resultant orbital magnetism have been studied for two-dimensional electrons under a harmonic confining potential $ V ( \vecvar { r } ) =m \omega_0^2 r^2/2 $ in various regimes of temperature and magnetic field , and the microscopic conditions for the validity of Landau diamagnetism are clarified .	Under a weak magnetic field $ ( \omega_c\lsim\omega_0 , \omega_c $ being a cyclotron frequency ) and at low temperature $ ( T\lsim\hbar\omega_0 ) $ , where the orbital magnetic moment fluctuates as a function of the field , the currents are irregularly distributed paramagnetically or diamagnetically inside the bulk region .	At the same time , the usual Landau diamagnetism results for the total magnetic moment .	The origin of this dramatic temperature dependence is seen to be in the multiple reflection of electron waves by the boundary confining potential , which becomes important once the coherence length of electrons gets longer than the system length .
2	One of these is a new Regge-Wheeler ( RW ) equation generalized for LRS space-times , whereas the remaining two are new generalizations of the Bardeen-Press ( BP ) equations .	We use the , covariant and gauge-invariant , 1+1+2 formalism developed by Clarkson and Barrett , and develop new techniques , to decouple electromagnetic ( EM ) perturbations on arbitrary locally rotationally symmetric ( LRS ) space-times .	Ultimately , we derive 3 decoupled complex equations governing 3 complex scalars .	This is achieved by first using linear algebra techniques to rewrite the first-order Maxwell equations in a new complex 1+1+2 form which is conducive to decoupling .	This new complex system immediately yields the generalized RW equation , and furthermore , we also derive a decoupled equation governing a newly defined complex EM 2-vector .
2	In a previous paper , we proved an existence theorem for the asymptotics of the standard evaluation of an arbitrary classical spin network when the coloring of its edges are scaled by a large natural number .	A classical spin network consists of a ribbon graph ( i.e. , an abstract graph with a cyclic ordering of the vertices around each edge ) and an admissible coloring of its edges by natural numbers .	The standard evaluation of a spin network is an integer number .	In the present paper , we extend the results to the case of an evaluation of quantum spin networks of arbitrary valency at a fixed root of unity .	As in the classical case , our proofs use the theory of $ G $ -functions of Andr\'e , together with some new results concerning holonomic and $ q $ -holonomic sequences of Wilf-Zeilberger .
3	We propose a rational metareasoning approach to decide when to deploy heuristics , using CSP backtracking search as a case study .	Heuristics are crucial tools in decreasing search effort in varied fields of AI .	In order to be effective , a heuristic must be efficient to compute , as well as provide useful information to the search algorithm .	However , some well-known heuristics which do well in reducing backtracking are so heavy that the gain of deploying them in a search algorithm might be outweighed by their overhead .	In particular , a value of information approach is taken to adaptive deployment of solution-count estimation heuristics for value ordering .
4	Second , we provide ( on manifolds with or without boundary ) with an explicit dependence of the observability constant with respect to the addition of a bounded potential to the equation .	In this article , we give a completely constructive proof of the observability/controllability of the wave equation on a compact manifold under optimal geometric conditions .	This contrasts with the original proof of Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch , which contains two non-constructive arguments .	Our method is based on the Dehman-Lebeau Egorov approach to treat the high-frequencies , and the optimal unique continuation stability result of the authors for the low-frequencies .	As an application , we first give estimates of the blowup of the observability constant when the time tends to the limit geometric control time ( for wave equations with possibly lower order terms ) .
3	Also , we will study some types of subgroups in configuration equivalent groups .	Giving a condition for the the amenability of groups , Rosenblatt and Willis , first introduced the concept of configuration .	From the beginning of the theory , the question whether the concept of configuration equivalence coincides with the concept of group isomorphism was posed .	We negatively answer this open question by introducing two non-isomorphic , solvable and hence amenable groups which are configuration equivalent .	In particular , we will prove this conjecture , due to Rosenblatt and Willis , that configuration equivalent groups , both include the free non-Abelian group of same rank or not .
4	From this we derive that P_ { n,2,2 } ( x ) may be obtain in terms of trigonometric functions , from which we obtain some of its important properties .	A class P_ { n , m , p } ( x ) of polynomials is defined .	The combinatorial meaning of its coefficients is given .	Chebyshev polynomials are the special cases of P_ { n , m , p } ( x ) .	It is first shown that P_ { n , m , p } ( x ) may be expressed in terms of P_ { n,0 , p } ( x ) .
3	The difference between the radial velocity of the optical absorption spectrum and that of the Ha emission is unusually small for a carbon Mira .	We carried out a VRI photometric monitoring of StHa 55 , and in addition we obtained low resolution absolute spectro-photometry and high resolution Echelle spectroscopy .	Our data show that StHa 55 is a carbon Mira , pulsating with a 395 day period , with & lt ; V & gt ; =13.1 mean brightness and 2.8 mag amplitude in V band .	It suffers from a low reddening ( E ( B-V ) =0.15 ) , lies at a distance of 5 kpc from the Sun and 1 kpc from the galactic plane , and its heliocentric systemic velocity is close to +22 km/sec .	The spectrum of StHa 55 can be classified as C-N5 C2 6- .
1	This formulation accounts for full wave diffraction , nonlinearity , and thermoviscous dissipative effects .	A form of the conservation equations for fluid dynamics is presented , deduced using slightly less restrictive hypothesis than those necessary to obtain the Westervelt equation .	A two-dimensional finite volume method using the Roe linearization was implemented to obtain numerically the solution of the proposed equations .	In order to validate the code , two different tests have been performed : one against a special Taylor shock-like analytic solution , the other against published results on a High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) system , both with satisfactory results .	The code , available under an open source license , is written for parallel execution on a Graphics Processing Unit ( GPU ) , thus improving performance by a factor of over 60 when compared to the standard serial execution finite volume code CLAWPACK 4.6.1 , which has been used as reference for the implementation logic as well .
1	The advantage of this method is an applicability to situations with non-linear behavior in time of effective external source of vapor .	A simple method to get all main characteristics of nucleation process is proposed .	It is important because already existed objects of a new phase comsume vapor in non-linear manner and form an effective non-linear behavior of external conditions .	To describe kinetics in this situatrion one can use a method proposed here .	As the result some exact expressions for all main characteristics of nucleation kinetics are obtained .
3	We construct new examples of non-Kahler complex manifolds with torsion in lower dimensions , that have non-zero Euler characteristics .	We continue our study of heterotic compactifications on non-Kahler complex manifolds with torsion .	We give further evidence of the consistency of the six-dimensional manifold presented earlier and discuss the anomaly cancellation and possible supergravity description for a generic non-Kahler complex manifold using the newly proposed superpotential .	The manifolds studied in our earlier papers had zero Euler characteristics .	Some of these examples are constructed from consistent backgrounds in F-theory and therefore are solutions to the string equations of motion .
1	Ways to stimulate interdisciplinary research collaborations are therefore an increasing point of attention for science policy .	Innovative ideas are often situated where disciplines meet , and socio-economic problems generally require contributions from several disciplines .	There is concern that 'regular ' funding programs , involving advice from disciplinary experts and discipline-bound viewpoints , may not adequately stimulate , select or evaluate this kind of research .	This has led to specific policies aimed at interdisciplinary research in many countries .	There is however at this moment no generally accepted method to adequately select and evaluate interdisciplinary research .
1	For a binary outcome and an arbitrary number of binary causes any set of potential outcomes can be replicated by positing a set of sufficient causes ; typically this representation is not unique .	The sufficient-component cause framework assumes the existence of sets of sufficient causes that bring about an event .	A sufficient cause interaction is said to be present if within all representations there exists a sufficient cause in which two or more particular causes are all present .	A singular interaction is said to be present if for some subset of individuals there is a unique minimal sufficient cause .	Empirical and counterfactual conditions are given for sufficient cause interactions and singular interactions between an arbitrary number of causes .
0	The dynamics of a 2D site percolation model on a square lattice is studied using the hierarchical approach introduced by Gabrielov et al. , Phys.Rev .	E , 60 , 5293-5300 , 1999 .	The key elements of the approach are the tree representation of clusters and their coalescence , and the Horton-Strahler scheme for cluster ranking .	Accordingly , the evolution of percolation model is considered as a hierarchical inverse cascade of cluster aggregation .	A three-exponent time-dependent scaling for the cluster rank distribution is derived using the Tokunaga branching constraint and classical results on percolation in terms of cluster masses .
1	Special attention is paid to the control of rotation induced systematic effects .	We report on a test of Lorentz invariance performed by comparing the resonance frequencies of one stationary optical resonator and one continuously rotating on a precision air bearing turntable .	Within the photon sector of the Standard Model Extension , we obtain improved limits on combinations of 8 parameters at a level of a few parts in $ 10^ { -16 } $ .	For the previously least well known parameter we find $ \tilde \kappa_ { e- } ^ { ZZ } = ( -1.9 \pm 5.2 ) \times 10^ { -15 } $ .	Within the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory , our measurement restricts the isotropy violation parameter $ \beta -\delta -\frac 12 $ to $ ( -2.1\pm 1.9 ) \times 10^ { -10 } $ , corresponding to an eightfold improvement with respect to previous non-rotating measurements .
1	The equivalent widths range from about 0 to 30 \AA in absorption for early-O to mid-B stars .	We have compiled a library of stellar Lyman-alpha equivalent widths in O and B stars using the model atmosphere codes CMFGEN and TLUSTY , respectively .	The purpose of this library is the prediction of the underlying stellar Lyman-alpha absorption in stellar populations of star-forming galaxies with nebular Lyman-alpha emission .	We implemented the grid of individual equivalent widths into the Starburst99 population synthesis code to generate synthetic Lyman-alpha equivalent widths for representative star-formation histories .	A starburst observed after 10 Myr will produce a stellar Lyman-alpha line with an equivalent width of $ \sim $ -10 $ \pm $ 4 \AA in absorption for a Salpeter initial mass function .
3	In contrast to several recent works on the analysis of standard nodal finite element discretisations , we consider here mass-conservative lowest order Raviart-Thomas mixed finite elements .	This work is motivated by the need to develop efficient tools for uncertainty quantification in subsurface flows associated with radioactive waste disposal studies .	We consider single phase flow problems in random porous media described by correlated lognormal distributions .	We are interested in the error introduced by a finite element discretisation of these problems .	This is very important since local mass conservation is highly desirable in realistic groundwater flow problems .
4	We propose that this unified theory , which requires no additional experimental input , may be extended to other eukaryotic species with annotated genomes to infer their constrained self-organized spatial arrangement of chromosomes .	We investigate a densely packed , non-random arrangement of forty-six chromosomes ( 46 , XY ) in human nuclei .	Here , we model systems-level chromosomal crosstalk by unifying intrinsic parameters ( chromosomal length and number of genes ) across all pairs of chromosomes in the genome to derive an extrinsic parameter called effective gene density .	The hierarchical clustering and underlying degeneracy in the effective gene density space reveal systems-level constraints for spatial arrangement of clusters of chromosomes that were previously unknown .	Our findings corroborate experimental data on spatial chromosomal arrangement in human nuclei , from fibroblast and lymphocyte cell lines , thereby establishing that human genome constrains chromosomal arrangement .
2	Efficient inference is feasible under this model with an EM algorithm .	We present a probabilistic model of events in continuous time in which each event triggers a Poisson process of successor events .	The ensemble of observed events is thereby modeled as a superposition of Poisson processes .	Moreover , the EM algorithm can be implemented as a distributed algorithm , permitting the model to be applied to very large datasets .	We apply these techniques to the modeling of Twitter messages and the revision history of Wikipedia .
1	We prove the existence of a critical temperature $ \b_p $ characterized as the first time quenched and annealed free energy differ .	We study the Hopfield model with pure $ p $ -spin interactions with even $ p\geq 4 $ , and a number of patterns , M ( N ) growing with the system size , $ N $ , as $ M ( N ) = \a N^ { p-1 } $ .	We prove that as $ p\uparrow\infty $ , $ \b_p\to\sqrt { \a 2\ln 2 } $ .	Moreover , we show that for any $ \a & gt ; 0 $ and for all inverse temperatures $ \b $ , the free energy converges to that of the REM at inverse temperature $ \b/\sqrt\a $ .	Moreover , above the critical temperature the distribution of the replica overlap is concentrated at zero .
2	Especially , the quantized anomalous Hall effect ( QAHE ) without an external magnetic field is realized in the two-dimensional ferromagnet on a three-dimensional TI which supports the dissipationless edge current .	Topological insulators ( TIs ) show rich phenomena and functions which can never be realized in ordinary insulators .	Most of them come from the peculiar surface or edge states .	Here we demonstrate theoretically that the domain wall of this ferromagnet , which carries edge current , is charged and can be controlled by the external electric field .	The chirality and relative stability of the Neel wall and Bloch wall depend on the position of the Fermi energy as well as the form of the coupling between the magnetic moments and orbital of the host TI .
3	To tackle these two challenges , we propose a novel thresholded multivariate principal component analysis ( PCA ) method for multi-channel profile monitoring .	Monitoring multichannel profiles has important applications in manufacturing systems improvement , but it is non-trivial to develop efficient statistical methods due to two main challenges .	First , profiles are high-dimensional functional data with intrinsic inner- and inter-channel correlations , and one needs to develop a dimension reduction method that can deal with such intricate correlations for the purpose of effective monitoring .	The second , and probably more fundamental , challenge is that the functional structure of multi-channel profiles might change over time , and thus the dimension reduction method should be able to automatically take into account the potential unknown change .	Our proposed method consists of two steps of dimension reduction : It first applies the functional PCA to extract a reasonable large number of features under the normal operational ( in-control ) state , and then use the soft-thresholding techniques to further select significant features capturing profile information in the out-of-control state .
2	A catalogue of structural parameters , photometry and comments based on visual inspection of the clusters is compiled and used to investigate correlations between cluster structure , environment , age and mass .	A search for stellar clusters has been carried out in 18 nearby spiral galaxies , using HST/WFPC2 archive images .	All of the galaxies have previously been imaged from the ground in UBVI .	Least-squares fits to the data suggest correlations between both the FWHM and half-light radius ( Reff ) of the clusters and their masses ( M ) at about the 3-sigma level .	Although both relations show a large scatter , the fits have substantially shallower slopes than for a constant-density relation .
2	A Lagrangian description is moreover the natural setting to study decoupling of high-energy physics .	We provide a prescription for parametrizing the vacuum choice ambiguity in cosmological settings .	We introduce an arbitrary boundary action representing the initial conditions .	RG flow affects the boundary interactions .	As a consequence the boundary conditions are sensitive to high-energy physics through irrelevant terms in the boundary action .
2	For instance , the rate of power stroke ( or conformational change ) , that leads to the undocked-to-docked transition of neck-linker , is not known , and the existence of a substep during the 8-nm step still remains a controversial issue in the kinesin community .	Among the multiple steps constituting the kinesin 's mechanochemical cycle , one of the most interesting events is observed when kinesins move an 8-nm step from one microtubule ( MT ) -binding site to another .	The stepping motion that occurs within a relatively short time scale ( ~100 microsec ) is , however , beyond the resolution of current experiments , therefore a basic understanding to the real-time dynamics within the 8-nm step is still lacking .	By using explicit structures of the kinesin dimer and the MT consisting of 13 protofilaments ( PFs ) , we study the stepping dynamics with varying rates of power stroke ( kp ) .	We estimate that 1/kp & lt ; ~ 20 microsec to avoid a substep in an averaged time trace .
4	At every iteration , it attempts to find the distance from the centroid of each cluster to each and every data point .	The number of accidents and health diseases which are increasing at an alarming rate are resulting in a huge increase in the demand for blood .	There is a necessity for the organized analysis of the blood donor database or blood banks repositories .	Clustering analysis is one of the data mining applications and K-means clustering algorithm is the fundamental algorithm for modern clustering techniques .	K-means clustering algorithm is traditional approach and iterative algorithm .
0	This paper presents novel analytic expressions for the Rice $ Ie { - } $ function , $ Ie ( k , x ) $ , and the incomplete Lipschitz-Hankel Integrals ( ILHIs ) of the modified Bessel function of the first kind , $ Ie_ { m , n } ( a , z ) $ .	Firstly , an exact infinite series and an accurate polynomial approximation are derived for the $ Ie ( k , x ) $ function which are valid for all values of $ k $ .	Secondly , an exact closed-form expression is derived for the $ Ie_ { m , n } ( a , z ) $ integrals for the case that $ n $ is an odd multiple of $ 1/2 $ and subsequently an infinite series and a tight polynomial approximation which are valid for all values of $ m $ and $ n $ .	Analytic upper bounds are also derived for the corresponding truncation errors of the derived series ' .	Importantly , these bounds are expressed in closed-form and are particularly tight while they straightforwardly indicate that a remarkable accuracy is obtained by truncating each series after a small number of terms .
0	We present an X-ray study of the high metallicity young open cluster Blanco 1 based on XMM -- Newton data .	X-ray spectroscopy of cluster members is presented for the first time as well as new X-ray distribution functions of late-type stars .	We detected all known dF and dG stars in the EPIC field and 80 % and 90 % of dK and dM stars , respectively .	The X-ray spectral analysis of the X-ray brightest cluster stars and X-ray color analysis of a larger sample show that a model with two temperatures ( at about 0.3 and 1 keV ) explains the quiescent activity phase spectra .	We discuss also the nature of unidentified X-ray sources in the observed region and their X-ray spectral properties .
1	In this second paper utilizing the U.S .	We present 474 new proper motion stellar systems in the southern sky having no previously known components , with 0.40 '' yr^-1 & gt ; mu & gt ; = 0.18 '' yr^-1 between declinations -47 deg and 00 deg .	Naval Observatory third CCD Astrograph Catalog ( UCAC3 ) we complete our sweep of the southern sky for objects in the proper motion range targeted by this survey with R magnitudes ranging from 9.80 to 19.61 .	The new systems contribute a ~16 % increase in the number of new stellar systems for the same region of sky reported in previous SuperCOSMOS RECONS ( SCR ) surveys .	Among the newly discovered stellar systems are 16 multiples , plus an additional 10 components that are new common proper motion companions to previously known objects .
3	We also review some aspects of the $ D=1 $ version of the model where the partition function can be obtained analytically .	We review some of the basic features of the Kazakov-Migdal model of induced QCD .	We emphasize the role of $ Z_N $ symmetry in determining the observable properties of the model and also argue that it can be broken explicitly without ruining the solvability of induced QCD in the infinite $ N $ limit .	We outline the sort of critical behavior which the master field must have in order that the model is still solvable .

1	In this Letter , we use \HST/WFC3 UVIS optical photometry to measure accretion rates onto three accreting objects , GSC06214-00210 b , GQ Lup b , and DH Tau b , that are at the planet/brown dwarf boundary and are companions to solar mass stars .	Measurements of accretion rates onto planetary mass objects may distinguish between different planet formation mechanisms , which predict different accretion histories .	The excess optical emission in the excess accretion continuum yields mass accretion rates of $ 10^ { -9 } $ to $ 10^ { -11 } $ \Msol/yr for these three objects .	Their accretion rates are an order of magnitude higher than expected from the correlation between mass and accretion rates measured from the UV excess , which is applicable if these wide planetary mass companions formed by protostellar core fragmentation .	The high accretion rates and large separation from the central star demonstrate the presence of massive disks around these objects .
0	In previous work we have found a regime in ballistic quantum dots where interelectron interactions can be treated asymptotically exactly as the Thouless number $ g $ of the dot becomes very large .	However , this work depends on some assumptions concerning the renormalization group and various properties of the dot obeying Random Matrix Theory predictions at scales of the order of the Thouless energy .	In this work we test the validity of those assumptions by considering a particular ballistic dot , the Robnik-Berry billiard , numerically .	We find that almost all of our predictions based on the earlier work are borne out , with the exception of fluctuations of certain matrix elements of interaction operators .	We conclude that , at least in the Robnik-Berry billiard , one can trust the results of our previous work at a qualitative and semi-quantitative level .
3	A strong correlation between the relaxation time of the network and average number of hydrogen bonds per water molecules was found .	The effect of glycerol , water and glycerol-water binary mixtures on the structure and dynamics of biomolecules has been well studied .	However , a lot remains to be learned about the effect of varying glycerol concentration and temperature on the dynamics of water .	We have studied the effect of concentration and temperature on the hydrogen bonded network formed by water molecules .	The radial distribution function of water oxygen and hydrogen atoms clarifies the effect of concentration on the structure and clustering of water .
1	Particle production during inflation leads to observables in the cosmological fluctuations , such as features in the primordial power spectrum and also nongaussianities .	In a variety of inflation models the motion of the inflaton may trigger the production of some non-inflaton particles during inflation , for example via parametric resonance or a phase transition .	Here we focus on a prototype scenario with inflaton , \phi , and iso-inflaton , \chi , fields interacting during inflation via the coupling g^2 ( \phi-\phi_0 ) ^2\chi^2 .	Since several previous investigations have hinted at the presence of localized `` glitches '' in the observed primordial power spectrum , which are inconsistent with the simplest power-law model , it is interesting to determine the extent to which such anomalies can be explained by this simple and well-motivated model .	Our prototype scenario predicts a bump-like feature in the primordial power spectrum , rather than an oscillatory `` ringing '' pattern as has previously been assumed .
4	We offer two proofs for these results : one is based on the paving by affine spaces of the fibers of certain convolution morphisms , the other involves a new schematic theory of `` big cells '' adapted to partial affine flag varieties , and combines Deligne 's theory of weights with a suitable contracting $ \mathbb G_m $ -action on those big cells .	This article concerns properties of mixed $ \ell $ -adic complexes on varieties over finite fields , related to the action of the Frobenius automorphism .	We establish a fiberwise criterion for the semisimplicity and Frobenius semisimplicity of the direct image complex under a proper morphism of varieties over a finite field .	We conjecture that the direct image of the intersection complex on the domain is always semisimple and Frobenius semisimple ; this conjecture would imply that a strong form of the decomposition theorem of Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne-Gabber is valid over finite fields .	We prove our conjecture for ( generalized ) convolution morphisms associated with partial affine flag varieties for split connected reductive groups over finite fields , and we prove allied Frobenius semisimplicity results for the intersection cohomology groups of twisted products of Schubert varieties .
3	When vortices of different types pass one through another they behave like charged particles in magnetic field .	We apply the adiabatic approximation to investigate the low energy dynamics of vortices in the parity invariant double self-dual Higgs model with only mutual Chern-Simons interaction .	When distances between solitons are large they are particles subject to the mutual interaction .	The dual formulation of the model is derived to explain the sign of the statistical interaction .	They can form a bound state due to the mutual magnetic trapping .
0	We study spin $ \frac12 $ hadronic states in quenched lattice QCD to search for a possible $ S=+1 $ pentaquark resonance .	Simulations are carried out on $ 8^3\times 24 $ , $ 10^3\times 24 $ , $ 12^3\times 24 $ and $ 16^3\times 24 $ lattices at $ \beta $ =5.7 at the quenched level with the standard plaquette gauge action and the Wilson quark action .	We adopt a Dirichlet boundary condition in the time direction for the quark to circumvent the possible contaminations due to the ( anti ) periodic boundary condition for the quark field , which are peculiar to the pentaquark .	By diagonalizing the $ 2\times 2 $ correlation matrices constructed from two independent operators with the quantum numbers $ ( I , J ) = ( 0 , \frac12 ) $ , we successfully obtain the energies of the lowest state and the 2nd-lowest state in this channel .	The analysis of the volume dependence of the energies and spectral weight factors indicates that a resonance state is likely to exist slightly above the NK threshold in $ ( I , J^P ) = ( 0 , \frac12^- ) $ channel .
2	The kinematics of the tau from the signal B decay are inferred from the K+ , mu , and other B in the event , which is fully reconstructed in one of a variety of hadronic decay modes , allowing the signal B candidate to be fully reconstructed .	We present a search for the lepton flavor violating decay B+ -- & gt ; K+ tau-/+ mu+/- using 383 million B Bbar events collected by the BABAR experiment .	The branching fraction for this decay can be substantially enhanced in new physics models .	We observe no excess of events over the expected background and set a limit of B ( B+ -- & gt ; K+ tau mu ) & lt ; 7.7 x 10^-5 at 90 % confidence level , where the branching fraction is for the sum of the K+ tau- mu+ and K+ tau+ mu- final states .	We use this result to improve a model-independent bound on the energy scale of flavor-changing new physics .
4	We find that the data pose substantial challenges for this theory , as well as all other currently discussed models .	With the advent of RXTE , which is capable of broad spectral coverage and fast timing , as well as other instruments which are increasingly being used in multi-wavelength campaigns ( via both space-based and ground-based observations ) , we must demand more of our theoretical models .	No current model mimics all facets of a system as complex as an x-ray binary .	However , a modern theory should qualitatively reproduce -- or at the very least not fundamentally disagree with - all of Cygnus X-1 's most basic average properties : energy spectrum ( viewed within a broader framework of black hole candidate spectral behavior ) , power spectrum ( PSD ) , and time delays and coherence between variability in different energy bands .	Below we discuss each of these basic properties in turn , and we assess the health of one of the currently popular theories : Comptonization of photons from a cold disk .
4	We survey well known structures that are finitely presented .	We study countable embedding-universal and homomorphism-universal structures and unify results related to both of these notions .	We show that many universal and ultrahomogeneous structures allow a concise description ( called here a finite presentation ) .	Extending classical work of Rado ( for the random graph ) , we find a finite presentation for each of the following classes : homogeneous undirected graphs , homogeneous tournaments and homogeneous partially ordered sets .	We also give a finite presentation of the rational Urysohn metric space and some homogeneous directed graphs .
1	Few theoretical studies have been concerned with this problem , with the small number using either highly idealized models or assuming a magnetic field orders of magnitude beyond what is supported by observations .	Are giant flares in magnetars viable sources of gravitational radiation ?	We perform nonlinear general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of large-scale hydromagnetic instabilities in magnetar models .	We utilise these models to find gravitational wave emissions over a wide range of energies , from 10^40 to 10^47 erg .	This allows us to derive a systematic relationship between the surface field strength and the gravitational wave strain , which we find to be highly nonlinear .
0	New observational facilities are becoming increasingly capable of observing reflected light from transiting and directly imaged extrasolar planets .	In this study , we provide an analytic framework to interpret observed phase curves , geometric albedos , and polarization of giant planet atmospheres .	We compute the observables for non-conservative Rayleigh scattering in homogeneous semi-infinite atmospheres using both scalar and vector formalisms .	In addition , we compute phase curves and albedos for Lambertian , isotropic , and anisotropic scattering phase functions .	We provide analytic expressions for geometric albedos and spherical albedos as a function of the scattering albedo for Rayleigh scattering in semi-infinite atmospheres .
1	Single-particle states with mixed isospin and broken parity build up an intrinsic Slater determinant which is then charge and parity projected .	Within the framework of Fermionic Molecular Dynamics a method is developed to better account for long range tensor correlations in nuclei when working with a single Slater determinant .	By minimizing the energy of this many-body state with respect to the parameters of the single-particle states and projecting afterwards on angular momentum ground state energies are obtained that are systematically lower than corresponding Hartree-Fock results .	The realistic Argonne V18 potential is used and short range correlations are treated with the Unitary Correlation Operator Method .	Comparison with exact few-body calculations shows that in $ ^4 $ He about one fifth of the correlation energy due to long-range correlations are accounted for .
3	Using the Metropolis method in statistical physics , which in this model can been regarded as a kind of uncertainty in decision making , we constructed a Master equation model to describe the evolution of the agents distribution .	The emergence of labor division in multi-agent system is analyzed by the method of statistical physics .	Considering a system consists of N homogeneous agents .	Their behaviors are determined by the returns from their production .	When we introduce the mechanism of learning by doing to describe the effect of technical progress and a formula for the competitive cooperation , the model gives us the following interesting results : ( 1 ) As the results of long term evolution , the system can reach a steady state .
4	This , in turn , gives access to the $ \lambda $ -dependent universal values of the critical exponents and critical amplitudes ratios .	We analyze the partition function of the Ising model on graphs of two different types : complete graphs , wherein all nodes are mutually linked and annealed scale-free networks for which the degree distribution decays as $ P ( k ) \sim k^ { -\lambda } $ .	We are interested in zeros of the partition function in the cases of complex temperature or complex external field ( Fisher and Lee-Yang zeros respectively ) .	For the model on an annealed scale-free network , we find an integral representation for the partition function which , in the case $ \lambda & gt ; 5 $ , reproduces the zeros for the Ising model on a complete graph .	For $ 3 & lt ; \lambda & lt ; 5 $ we derive the $ \lambda $ -dependent angle at which the Fisher zeros impact onto the real temperature axis .
1	The problem is formulated and solved in the semiclassical mean-field approximation for a homogeneous , time-dependent electric field .	We review recent achievements in the solution of the initial-value problem for quantum back-reaction in scalar and spinor QED .	Our primary motivation in examining back-reaction has to do with applications to theoretical models of production of the quark-gluon plasma , though we here address practicable solutions for back-reaction in general .	We review the application of the method of adiabatic regularization to the Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields in order to renormalize the expectation value of the current and derive a finite coupled set of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the system .	Three time scales are involved in the problem and therefore caution is needed to achieve numerical stability for this system .
3	The short-range term is calculated directly and integrated with the high-order Hermite scheme .	In this paper , we present a new hybrid algorithm for the time integration of collisional N-body systems .	In this algorithm , gravitational force between two particles is divided into short-range and long-range terms , using a distance-dependent cutoff function .	The long-range interaction is calculated using the tree algorithm and integrated with the constant-timestep leapfrog integrator .	We can reduce the calculation cost per orbital period from O ( N^2 ) to O ( N log N ) , without significantly increasing the long-term integration error .
2	In this article , we first develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when two SDEs are compared , assuming the time domain expands .	The problem of model selection in the context of a system of stochastic differential equations ( SDEs ) has not been touched upon in the literature .	Indeed , properties of Bayes factors have not been studied even in single SDE based model comparison problems .	Using this we then develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when systems of SDEs are compared , assuming that the number of equations in each system , as well as the time domain , increase indefinitely .	Our asymptotic theory covers situations when the observed processes associated with the SDEs are independently and identically distributed ( iid ) , as well as when they are independently but not identically distributed ( non-iid ) .
2	As the carrier density is tuned with the gate voltage , the critical current in the these junctions spans a range from a few nA up to more than $ 5\mu $ A , while the Thouless energy , ETh , covers almost two orders of magnitude .	We present transport measurements on long diffusive graphene-based Josephson junctions .	Several junctions are made on a single-domain crystal of CVD graphene and feature the same contact width of ~9 $ \mu $ m but vary in length from 400 to 1000 nm .	Over much of this range , the product of the critical current and the normal resistance IcRn is found to scale linearly with ETh , as expected from theory .	However , the ratio IcRn /ETh is found to be 0.1-0.2 : much smaller than the predicted ~10 for long diffusive SNS junctions .
0	The kinematic and morphological properties of a string of [ Ar III ] bright knots in the Crab Nebula are examined using 1994 - 1999 HST WFPC-2 images of the remnant .	We find that five southern [ Ar III ] bright knots exhibit ordinary radial motions away from the nebula 's center of expansion with magnitudes consistent with their projected radial displacements .	These results do not support the suggestion by MacAlpine et al .	( 1994 ) that these knots might be moving rapidly away from the Crab pulsar due to a collimated wind .	The HST images also do not show that the [ Ar III ] knots have unusual morphologies relative to other features in the remnant .
3	We prove their conjecture rigorously , giving asymptotics , as well as a pattern of inequalities satisfied by the determinants .	We study the dimensional asymptotics of the effective actions , or functional determinants , for the Dirac operator D and Laplacians \Delta +\beta R on round S^n .	For Laplacians the behavior depends on `` the coupling strength '' \beta , and one can not in general expect a finite limit of \zeta ' ( 0 ) , and for the ordinary Laplacian , \beta=0 , we prove it to be +\infty , for odd dimensions .	For the Dirac operator , B\ '' ar and Schopka conjectured a limit of unity for the determinant ( [ BS ] ) , i.e.\lim_ { n\to\infty } \det ( D , S^n_ { \mathrm { can } } ) =1 .	The limiting value of unity is a virtue of having `` enough scalar curvature '' and no kernel .
0	In the presence of strong disorder and weak interactions , closed quantum systems can enter a many-body localized phase where the system does not conduct , does not equilibrate even for arbitrarily long times , and robustly violates quantum statistical mechanics .	The starting point for such a many-body localized phase is usually taken to be an Anderson insulator where , in the limit of vanishing interactions , all degrees of freedom of the system are localized .	Here , we instead consider a model where in the non-interacting limit , some degrees of freedom are localized while others remain delocalized .	Such a system can be viewed as a model for a many-body localized system brought into contact with a small bath of a comparable number of degrees of freedom .	We numerically and analytically study the effect of interactions on this system and find that generically , the entire system delocalizes .
4	We consider two scenarios for the collisions that must be resupplying the dust population : ( 1 ) continuous `` steady state '' grinding of planetesimals , and ( 2 ) an isolated cataclysmic collision .	We present subarcsecond-resolution mid-infrared images of the debris disk surrounding the 230 Myr- old A star Zeta Lep .	Our data obtained with T-ReCS at Gemini South show the source to be unresolved at 10.4 microns but clearly extended at 18.3 microns .	Quadratic subtraction of the PSF profile from that of Zeta Lep implies a characteristic radius for the dust disk of 3 AU , which is comparable in size to our solar system 's asteroid belt .	Simple models suggest that the 18 micron flux is well approximated by two contiguous annuli of mid-infrared-emitting dust from 2-4 and 4-8 AU with a 3:1 flux ratio for the annuli , respectively .
2	What is the microscopic origin of such a strange behavior ?	Everybody knows that when a liquid is heated , its temperature increases until the moment when it starts to boil .	The increase in temperature then stops , all heat being used to transform the liquid into vapor .	Does a liquid drop containing only few molecules behave the same ?	Recent experimental and theoretical developments seem to indicate that at the elementary level of very small systems , this anomaly appears in an even more astonishing way : during the change of state - for example from liquid to gas - the system cools whereas it is heated , i.e.its temperature decreases while its energy increases .
0	We present a population synthesis study of the observed properties of the magnetars , which allows for X-ray selection effects , investigating the hypothesis that they are drawn from a population of progenitors that are more massive than those of the normal radio pulsars .	We assume that the anomalous X-ray emission is caused by the decay of a toroidal or tangled up field that does not partake in the spin down of the star .	We find that we can explain the observed properties , such as the period and field distributions and the Period - Period derivative diagram , if we suitably parametrise the time evolution of the anomalous X-ray luminosity as an exponentially decaying function of time .	The magnetic flux of the neutron stars is required to be a strong function of the progenitor mass with the magnetars arising from the mass range 20-45 solar masses .	Unlike with the radio pulsars , the magnetars only weakly constrain the birth spin period , due to their rapid spin-down .
0	The double vector meson production in two photon collisions is addressed assuming that the color singlet $ t $ -channel exchange carries large momentum transfer .	We consider the non-forward solution of the BFKL equation at high energy and large momentum transfer and estimate the total and differential cross section for the process $ \gamma \gamma \to V_1 V_2 $ , where $ V_1 $ and $ V_2 $ can be any two vector mesons ( $ V_i = \rho , \omega , \phi , J/\Psi , \Upsilon $ ) .	A comparison between our predictions and previous theoretical results obtained at Born level or assuming the Pomeron-exchange factorization relations is presented .	Our results demonstrate that the BFKL dynamics implies an enhancement of the cross sections .	Predictions for the future linear colliders ( TESLA , CLIC and ILC ) are given .
2	The values of the Pan/PaB , Brn/BrG , and BrG/Pan H I line ratios for all observations exhibit a scatter of & lt ; 20 % about the weighted mean , not only from source to source , but also for epoch-to-epoch variations in the same source .	We present results from a low resolution ( R~300 ) near-infrared spectroscopic variability survey of actively accreting T Tauri stars ( TTS ) in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region .	Paschen and Brackett series H I recombination lines were detected in 73 spectra of 15 classical T Tauri systems .	A representative or `global ' value was determined for each ratio in both the Paschen and Brackett series as well as the BrG/Pan line ratios .	A comparison of observed line ratio values was made to those predicted by the temperature and electron density dependent models of Case B hydrogen recombination line theory .
0	Concrete , a mixture formed by mixing cement , water , and fine and coarse mineral aggregates is used in the construction of nuclear power plants ( NPPs ) , e.g. , to construct the reactor cavity concrete that encases the reactor pressure vessel , etc .	In such environments , concrete may be exposed to radiation ( e.g. , neutrons ) emanating from the reactor core .	Until recently , concrete has been assumed relatively immune to radiation exposure .	Direct evidence acquired on Ar $ ^+ $ -ion irradiated calcite and quartz indicates , on the contrary , that , such minerals , which constitute aggregates in concrete , may be significantly altered by irradiation .	Specifically , while quartz undergoes disordering of its atomic structure resulting in a near complete lack of periodicity , i.e. , similar to glassy silica , calcite only experiences random rotations , and distortions of its carbonate groups .
1	Fields are unable to reach the horizon because the length of the black hole throat blows up in the extremal limit .	Extremal black holes tend to expel magnetic and electric fields .	The length of the throat is related to the amount of entanglement between modes on either side of the horizon .	So it is natural to try to relate the black hole Meissner effect to entanglement .	We derive the black hole Meissner effect directly from the low temperature limit of two-point functions in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum .
1	We investigated the absorption spectra of Gafchromic EBT2 film with various rotational angles in a visible wavelength band .	It is important to study absorption spectrum in film dosimetry because the spectral absorbance of the film relates to the film 's total absorption dose .	The film was irradiated with 6 MV photon beams and a total dose of 300 cGy .	Absorption spectra were taken under different rotational angles after 24 h after irradiation and we fitted the spectra using Lorentzian functions .	There were two dominant absorption peaks at approximately 586 nm ( green ) and 634 nm ( red ) .
1	Automatic synonym extractor is highly preferred for large scale applications .	Synonym extraction is an important task in natural language processing and often used as a submodule in query expansion , question answering and other applications .	Previous studies in synonym extraction are most limited to small scale datasets .	In this paper , we build a large dataset with 3.4 million synonym/non-synonym pairs to capture the challenges in real world scenarios .	We proposed ( 1 ) a new cost function to accommodate the unbalanced learning problem , and ( 2 ) a feature learning based deep neural network to model the complicated relationships in synonym pairs .
1	The catalogue contains 246 members identified from 5042 sq.deg .	We present an Ultra-Cool Dwarf ( UCD ) catalogue compiled from low southern Galactic latitudes and mid-plane , from a cross-correlation of the 2MASS and SuperCOSMOS surveys .	within 220 deg .	& lt ; = l & lt ; = 360 deg.and 0 deg .	& lt ; l & lt ; = 30 deg. , for |b| & lt ; = 15 deg .
0	The distance from a given position toward one or more destinations , exits , and way points is a more or less important input variable in most models of pedestrian dynamics .	Except for the special case when there are no obstacles in a concave scenario -- i.e.each position is visible from any other -- the calculation of these distances is a non-trivial task .	This is n't that big a problem , as long as the model only demands the distances to be stored in a Static Floor Field also called Potential Field , which never changes throughout the whole simulation .	In this case a pre-calculation once before the simulation starts is sufficient .	But if one wants to allow changes of the geometry during a simulation run -- imagine doors or the blocking of a corridor due to some hazard -- in the Distance Potential Field , calculation time matters strongly .
2	These points form the so-called zero field curve in the $ ( \eta , T , \phi ) $ space .	Geometrical approach to the phenomenological theory of phase transitions of the second kind at constant pressure $ P $ and variable temperature $ T $ is proposed .	Equilibrium states of a system at zero external field and fixed $ P $ and $ T $ are described by points in three-dimensional space with coordinates $ \eta $ , the order parameter , $ T $ , the temperature and $ \phi $ , the thermodynamic potential .	Its branch point coincides with the critical point of the system .	The small parameter of the theory is the distance from the critical point along the zero-field curve .
1	We detect an over-all amplitude for the SZ signal at the ~ 8-sigma level , yielding a combined constraint of f_ { gas } h = 0.08 +/- 0.01 ( ran ) +/- 0.01 ( sys ) on the gas mass fraction of the Intra-Cluster Medium .	We devise a Monte-Carlo based , optimized filter match method to extract the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ( SZ ) signature of a catalog of 116 low-redshift X-ray clusters from the first year data release of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) .	We also compile X-ray estimated gas fractions from the literature for our sample , and find that they are consistent with the SZ estimates at the 2-sigma level , while both show an increasing trend with X-ray temperature .	Nevertheless , our SZ estimated gas fraction is 30-40 % smaller than the concordance LCDM cosmic average .	We also express our observations in terms of the SZ flux-temperature relation , and compare it with other observations , as well as numerical studies .
0	We study systematically the impact of the time-even tensor terms of the Skyrme energy density functional , i.e.terms bilinear in the spin-current tensor density , on deformation properties of closed shell nuclei corresponding to 20 , 28 , 40 , 50 , 82 , and 126 neutron or proton shell closures .	We compare results obtained with three different families of Skyrme parameterizations whose tensor terms have been adjusted on properties of spherical nuclei : ( i ) TIJ interactions proposed in the first paper of this series [ T. Lesinski et al. , Phys.Rev .	C 76 , 014312 ( 2007 ) ] which were constructed through a complete readjustment of the rest of the functional ( ii ) parameterizations whose tensor terms have been added perturbatively to existing Skyrme interactions , with or without readjusting the spin-orbit coupling constant .	We analyse in detail the mechanisms at play behind the impact of tensor terms on deformation properties and how studying the latter can help screen out unrealistic parameterizations .	It is expected that findings of the present paper are to a large extent independent of remaining deficiencies of the central and spin-orbit interactions , and will be of great value for the construction of future , improved energy functionals .
0	Recently the Yang-Mills gradient flow of pure SU ( 3 ) lattice gauge theory has been calculated in the range from $ \beta=6/g_0^2=6.3 $ to~7.5 ( Asakawa et al .	) , where $ g_0^2 $ is the bare coupling constant of the SU ( 3 ) Wilson action .	Estimates of the deconfining phase transition are available from $ \beta =5.7 $ to~6.8 ( Francis et al . ) .	Here it is shown that the entire range from 5.7 to 7.5 is well described by a power series of the lattice spacing $ a $ times the lambda lattice mass scale $ \Lambda_L $ , using asymptotic scaling in the 2-loop and 3-loop approximations for $ a\Lambda_L $ .	In both cases identical ratios for gradient flows versus deconfinement observables are obtained .
3	In recent years advanced technologies such as SOA and Cloud computing have been evolved to address integration problems .	The global economic recession and the shrinking budget of IT projects have led to the need of development of integrated information systems at a lower cost .	Today , the emerging phenomenon of cloud computing aims at transforming the traditional way of computing by providing both software applications and hardware resources as a service .	With the rapid evolution of Information Communication Technology ( ICT ) governments , organizations and businesses are looking for solutions to improve their services and integrate their IT infrastructures .	The Clouds enormous capacity with comparable low cost makes it an ideal platform for SOA deployment .
4	We compare the ground-state properties calculated in these two descriptions of pairing correlations and deduce the importance of the particle-number conservation in weak pairing regimes .	We calculate the ground-state properties of well deformed , even-even N=Z nuclei in the region between Ni-56 and Sn-100 within two different approaches , focusing on the binding energy and deformation and pairing properties .	First , we employ the Hartree-Fock-BCS ( HFBCS ) approximation with the Skyrme effective nucleon-nucleon interaction and discuss how the results depend on the parameterization of the interaction and on the pairing force parameters adjusted in various schemes to reproduce the experimental odd-even mass differences .	Then , within the Higher Tamm-Dancoff Approximation ( HTDA ) , which explicitly conserves the particle number , we calculate the same properties starting from the HFBCS solutions .	The HTDA treatment of the ground-state correlations is converged within a n-particle-n-hole expansion using up to n=4 particle-hole excitations of the pair type ( in the sense of Cooper pairs ) .
2	This limit falls into a general class of two-dimensional systems of driven linear SDEs which have stationary measures on gradients .	We determine a $ q\to 1 $ limit of the two-dimensional $ q $ -Whittaker driven particle system on the torus studied previously in [ Corwin-Toninelli , arXiv:1509.01605 ] .	This has an interpretation as a $ ( 2+1 ) $ -dimensional stochastic interface growth model , that is believed to belong to the so-called anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang ( KPZ ) class .	Taking the number of particles to infinity we demonstrate Gaussian free field type fluctuations for the stationary measure .	Considering the temporal evolution of the stationary measure , we determine that along characteristics , correlations are asymptotically given by those of the $ ( 2+1 ) $ -dimensional additive stochastic heat equation .
0	This article provides the complete description of results from the Phase I data set of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory ( SNO ) .	The Phase I data set is based on a 0.65 kt-year exposure of heavy water to the solar $ ^8 $ B neutrino flux .	Included here are details of the SNO physics and detector model , evaluations of systematic uncertainties , and estimates of backgrounds .	Also discussed are SNO 's approach to statistical extraction of the signals from the three neutrino reactions ( charged current , neutral current , and elastic scattering ) and the results of a search for a day-night asymmetry in the $ \nu_e $ flux .	Under the assumption that the $ ^8 $ B spectrum is undistorted , the measurements from this phase yield a solar $ \nu_e $ flux of $ \phi ( \nu_e ) = 1.76^ { +0.05 } _ { -0.05 } { ( stat .
3	Nevertheless , the optical I-band light curve of IGR J00291+5934 shows evidence for strong flaring .	We report on optical and X-ray observations of the accretion powered ms pulsar IGR J00291+5934 in quiescence .	Time resolved I-band photometry has been obtained with the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope , while a 3 ks Chandra observation provided contemporaneous X-ray coverage .	We found an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux of 1x10^-13 erg cm-2 s-1 which implies that the source was in quiescence at the time of the optical observations .	After removal of the strongest flares , we find evidence for an orbital modulation in the phase folded I-band light curve .
3	when l divides ( n+2 ) - given by the faithful representations of minimal degree of the symmetric groups .	In 1878 , Jordan showed that a finite subgroup of GL ( n , C ) contains an abelian normal subgroup whose index is bounded by a function of n alone .	Previously , the author has given precise bounds .	Here , we consider analogues for finite linear groups over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic l. A larger normal subgroup must be taken , to eliminate unipotent subgroups and groups of Lie type and characteristic l , and we show that generically the bound is similar to that in characteristic 0 - being ( n+1 ) ! , or ( n+2 ) !	A complete answer for the optimal bounds is given for all degrees n and every characteristic l .
2	The plasmon dispersion contains a logarithmic correction due to the ultraviolet-logarithmic renormalization of the electron charge , manifesting a fundamental many-body interaction effect as in quantum electrodynamics .	We consider theoretically as a function of temperature the plasmon mode arising in three-dimensional Dirac liquids , i.e. , systems with linear chiral relativistic single-particle dispersion , within the random phase approximation .	We find that whereas no plasmon mode exists in the intrinsic ( undoped ) system at zero temperature , there is a well-defined finite-temperature plasmon with superlinear temperature dependence , rendering the plasmon dispersion widely tunable with temperature .	The plasmon dispersion of the extrinsic ( doped ) system displays a minimum at finite temperature before it crosses over to the superlinear intrinsic behavior at higher temperature , implying that the high-temperature plasmon is a universal feature of Dirac liquids irrespective of doping .	This striking characteristic temperature dependence of intrinsic Dirac plasmons along with the logarithmic renormalization is a unique manifestation of the three-dimensional relativistic Dirac nature of quasiparticle excitations and serves as an experimentally observable signature of three-dimensional Dirac materials .
0	We compare threshold resummation in QCD , as performed using soft-collinear effective theory ( SCET ) , to the standard perturbative QCD formalism based on factorization and resummation of Mellin moments of partonic cross-sections .	We consider various forms of the SCET result , which correspond to different choices of the soft scale mu_s that characterizes this approach .	We derive a master formula that relates the SCET resummation to the QCD result for any choice of mu_s .	We then use it first , to show that if SCET resummation is performed in N-Mellin moment space by suitable choice of mu_s it is equivalent to the standard perturbative approach .	Next , we show that if SCET resummation is performed by choosing for mu_s a partonic momentum variable , the perturbative result for partonic resummed cross-sections is again reproduced , but like its standard perturbative counterpart it is beset by divergent behaviour at the endpoint .
2	We find that it is an isolated dwarf irregular galaxy with an old stellar population .	We present deep BVRI band images and HI line observations of the nearby , low surface brightness galaxy ESO215-G ? 009 which were obtained with the ANU 2.3-m Telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array , respectively .	ESO215-G ? 009 was selected from the HIPASS Bright Galaxy Catalog because it has the second highest HI mass-to-light ratio of the galaxies with measured B band apparent magnitudes .	We place an upper limit on the current star formation rate of ~2.5 x 10^-3 M_sun/yr .	The extended HI disk shows regular rotation ( v_rot = 51 +/- 8 km/s ) , and at a column density of ~5.0 x 10^19 atoms/cm^2 can be traced out to over six times the Holmberg radius of the stellar component ( radius at mu_B = 26.6 mag/arcsec^2 ) .
1	Here we study effects of one-dimensional tilt grain boundaries on structures and electronic spectra of graphene multilayers by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy .	Despite the structures and properties of tilt grain boundaries of graphite surface and graphene have been extensively studied , their effect on the structures and electronic spectra of graphene layers has not been fully addressed .	A tilt grain boundary of a top graphene sheet in graphene multilayers leads to a twist between consecutive layers and generates superstructures ( Moir\'e patterns ) on one side of the boundary .	Our results demonstrate that the twisting changes the electronic spectra of Bernal graphene bilayer and graphene trilayers dramatically .	We also study quantum-confined twisted graphene bilayer generated between two adjacent tilt grain boundaries and find that the band structure of such a system is still valid even when the number of superstructures is reduced to two in one direction .
2	To develop diagnostics and control schemes , a better understanding of linear and nonlinear features of resonant interactions between plasma waves and high-energy particles , is required .	The achievement of sustained nuclear fusion in magnetically confined plasma relies on efficient confinement of high-energy ions produced by the fusion reaction .	Such particles can excite Alfven Eigenmodes ( AEs ) , which significantly degrade their confinement and threatens the vacuum vessel of future reactors .	In the case of an isolated single resonance , the problem is homothetic to the so-called Berk-Breizman ( BB ) problem , which is an extension of the classic bump-on-tail electrostatic problem , including external damping to a thermal plasma , and collisions .	A semi-Lagrangian simulation code , COBBLES , is developed to solve the initial-value BB problem .
3	Here we give the first results of a laboratory programme to provide such data .	Water ( H2O ) ice is an important solid constituent of many astrophysical environments .	To comprehend the role of such ices in the chemistry and evolution of dense molecular clouds and comets , it is necessary to understand the freeze-out , potential surface reactivity , and desorption mechanisms of such molecular systems .	Consequently , there is a real need from within the astronomical modelling community for accurate empirical molecular data pertaining to these processes .	Measurements of the thermal desorption of H2O ice , under interstellar conditions , are presented .
2	The existence of a 70-MeV quantum was postulated by Mac Gregor and was shown to fit the Nambu empirical mass formula mn = ( n/2 ) 137me , n a positive integer .	Mac Gregor 's constituent-quark model is reviewed with currently published data from light meson spectroscopy .	It was previously shown that magnetic sources were responsible for the quantization of several mass-splittings in Mac Gregor 's model .	It is shown in this paper that the light meson spectra also fit into the constituent-quark model and are in agreement with the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme .	The existence of magnetic fields is suggested by the successful accounting of these meson spectra .
1	The paper is primarily aimed at the outburst of J004457+4123 ( Sharov 21 ) , with the first part focussed on the optical spectroscopy and the improvement in the photometric database .	We announce the discovery of a quasar behind the disk of M31 , which was previously classified as a remarkable nova in our neighbour galaxy .	Both the optical spectrum and the broad band spectral energy distribution of Sharov 21 are shown to be very similar to that of normal , radio-quiet type 1 quasars .	We present photometric data covering more than a century and resulting in a long-term light curve that is densely sampled over the past five decades .	The variability of the quasar is characterized by a ground state with typical fluctuation amplitudes of ~0.2 mag around B~20.5 , superimposed by a singular flare of ~2 yr duration ( observer frame ) with the maximum at 1992.81 where the UV flux has increased by a factor of ~20 .
1	Two different scenarios have been invoked to explain its X-ray properties : wind-wind interaction and magnetic wind confinement .	As the brightest O-type X-ray source in the Carina nebula , HD 93250 ( O4 III ( fc ) ) is X-ray overluminous for its spectral type and has an unusually hard X-ray spectrum .	Yet , HD 93250 shows absolutely constant radial velocities over time scales of years suggesting either a single star , a binary system seen pole-one or a very long period and/or highly eccentric system .	Using the ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer , we resolved HD 93250 as a close pair with similar components .	We measured a near-infrared flux ratio of 0.8+/-0.1 and a separation of 1.5+/-0.2 x 10E-03 arcsec .
2	With this goal in mind , here for the first time we obtain fully explicit bounds for the number of rational points near planar curves .	The primary goal of this paper is to complete the theory of metric Diophantine approximation initially developed in [ Ann.of Math .	( 2 ) 166 ( 2007 ) , p.367-426 ] for $ C^3 $ non-degenerate planar curves .	Further , introducing a perturbational approach we bring the smoothness condition imposed on the curves down to $ C^1 $ ( lowest possible ) .	This way we broaden the notion of non-degeneracy in a natural direction and introduce a new topologically complete class of planar curves to the theory of Diophantine approximation .
1	The gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters hosting active galaxies is a complex combination of diffuse and point-like emission with different spectral and spatial properties .	( Abridged ) .	We discuss the case of the Perseus cluster containing the radio-galaxy NGC 1275 that has been detected as a bright gamma-ray source by the Fermi-LAT experiment .	We provide a detailed study of the gamma-ray emission coming from the core of Perseus by modeling the central AGN emission with a multiple plasma blob model , and the emission from the cluster atmosphere with both a Warming Ray ( WR ) model and Dark Matter ( DM ) neutralino annihilation models .	We set constraints on both the central galaxy and cluster SED models by using multi-frequency data including the observations obtained by Fermi and MAGIC .
1	Afterwards a term in the action that softly violates the detailed balance condition has been considered with the attempt of obtaining a more realistic theory in its IR-limit .	In 2009 Ho\v { r } ava proposed a power-counting renormalizable quantum gravity theory .	This term is proportional to $ \omega R^ { ( 3 ) } $ , where $ \omega $ is a constant parameter and $ R^ { ( 3 ) } $ is the spatial Ricci scalar .	In this paper we derive constraints on this IR-modified Ho\v { r } ava theory using the late-time cosmic accelerating expansion observations .	We obtain a lower bound of $ |\omega| $ that is nontrivial and depends on $ \Lambda_W $ , the cosmological constant of the three dimensional spatial action in the Ho\v { r } ava gravity .
2	The tessellation is used to construct a bipartite network from which a quiver can be read straightforwardly .	Combinatorial methods are developed to find the cluster coordinates for moduli space of flat connections which is describing the Coulomb branch of higher rank N=2 theories derived by compactifying six dimensional ( 2,0 ) theory on a punctured Riemann surface .	The construction starts with a triangulation of the punctured Riemann surface and a further tessellation of all the triangles .	We prove that the quivers for different triangulations are related by quiver mutations and justify that these are really the cluster coordinates .	These coordinates are important in studying BPS wall crossing , line operators , and surface operators of these theories ; and they are also useful in exploring three dimensional Chern-Simons theory and the corresponding N=2 gauge theory , two dimensional integrable system , etc . }
1	G-deformation transfers every normal vector of surface in parallel along the path of the translation for each point of surface .	Author reduces the Minkowski problem to the problem of construction the G-deformations preserving the product of principal curvatures for every point of surface in Riemannian space .	The continuous G-deformations preserving the product of principal curvatures of surface with boundary are considered in this article .	The equations of deformations which are obtained in this paper reduce to the nonlinear boundary-value problem .	The method of construction continuous G-deformations preserving the product of principal curvatures of surface with boundary and its qualitative analysis are presented in this article
4	This target is reached by a suitable extension of the formula governing the correspondence between space-time and spatial differential forms in electrodynamics to take relative motions in due account .	The Faraday and Ampere-Maxwell laws of electrodynamics in space-time manifold are formulated in terms of differential forms and exterior and Lie derivatives .	Due to their natural behavior with respect to push-pull operations , these geometric objects are the suitable tools to deal with the space-time observer split of the events manifold and with frame-invariance properties .	Frame-invariance is investigated in complete generality , referring to any automorphic transformation in space-time , in accord with the spirit of general relativity .	A main result of the new geometric theory is the assessment of frame-invariance of space-time electromagnetic differential forms and induction laws and of their spatial counterparts under any change of frame .
3	All such configurations can be dealt with exactly within the context of non-abelian Born-Infeld theory since , given the relevant BPS-like condition , the action reduces to that of Yang-Mills theory .	We argue that the trace structure of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action can be fixed by demanding that the action be linearised by certain energy-minimising BPS-like configurations .	It is shown how instantons in D4-branes , SU ( 2 ) monopoles and dyons in D3-branes , and vortices in D2-branes are all BPS states of the action recently proposed by Tseytlin .	The T-dual worldvolume theories of D-strings and D0-branes are also considered .	The worldvolume energy of such configurations is an absolute minimum .
1	The LRBMS is a combination of numerical multi-scale methods and model reduction using reduced basis methods to efficiently reduce the computational complexity of parametric multi-scale problems with respect to the multi-scale parameter $ \varepsilon $ and the online parameter $ \mu $ simultaneously .	We present a localized a-posteriori error estimate for the localized reduced basis multi-scale ( LRBMS ) method [ Albrecht , Haasdonk , Kaulmann , Ohlberger ( 2012 ) : The localized reduced basis multiscale method ] .	We formulate the LRBMS based on a generalization of the SWIPDG discretization presented in [ Ern , Stephansen , Vohralik ( 2010 ) : Guaranteed and robust discontinuous Galerkin a posteriori error estimates for convection-diffusion-reaction problems ] on a coarse partition of the domain that allows for any suitable discretization on the fine triangulation inside each coarse grid element .	The estimator is based on the idea of a conforming reconstruction of the discrete diffusive flux , that can be computed using local information only .	It is offline/online decomposable and can thus be efficiently used in the context of model reduction .
0	The origin of the g-factor of the two-dimensional ( 2D ) electrons and holes moving in the periodic crystal lattice potential with the perpendicular magnetic and electric fields is discussed .	The Pauli equation describing the Landau quantization accompanied by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling ( RSOC ) and Zeeman splitting ( ZS ) for 2D heavy holes with nonparabolic dispersion law is solved exactly .	The solutions have the form of the pairs of the Landau quantization levels due to the spinor-type wave functions .	The energy levels depend on amplitudes of the magnetic and electric fields , on the g-factor { g-h } , and on the parameter of nonparabolicity C. The dependences of two energy levels in any pair on the Zeeman parameter { Z_h } = { g_h } { m_h } /4 { m_0 } , where { m_h } is the hole effective mass , are nonmonotonous and without intersections .	The smallest distance between them at C=0 takes place at the value { Z_h } =n/2 , where n is the order of the chirality terms determined by the RSOC and is the same for any quantum number of the Landau quantization .
1	Suitable celestial calibration sources that could be used to measure the polarimeter orientation angle are limited , so current experiments commonly `self-calibrate . '	Precise polarisation measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) require accurate knowledge of the instrument orientation relative to the sky frame used to define the cosmological Stokes parameters .	The self-calibration method exploits the theoretical fact that the $ EB $ and $ TB $ cross-spectra of the CMB vanish in the standard cosmological model , so any detected $ EB $ and $ TB $ signals must be due to systematic errors .	However , this assumption neglects the fact that polarized Galactic foregrounds in a given portion of the sky may have non-zero $ EB $ and $ TB $ cross-spectra .	If these foreground signals remain in the observations , then they will bias the self-calibrated telescope polarisation angle and produce a spurious $ B $ -mode signal .
0	We numerically investigate the two-dimensional q-state quantum Potts model on the infinite square lattice by using the infinite projected entangled-pair state ( iPEPS ) algorithm .	We show that the quantum fidelity , defined as an overlap measurement between an arbitrary reference state and the iPEPS groundstate of the system , can detect q-fold degenerate groundstates for the Zq broken-symmetry phase .	Accordingly , a multiple-bifurcation of the quantum groundstate fidelity is shown to occur as the transverse magnetic field varies from the symmetry phase to the broken-symmetry phase , which means that a multiple-bifurcation point corresponds to a critical point .	A ( dis- ) continuous behavior of quantum fidelity at phase transition points characterizes a ( dis- ) continuous phase transition .	Similar to the characteristic behavior of the quantum fidelity , the magnetizations , as order parameters , obtained from the degenerate groundstates exhibit multiple bifurcation at critical points .
3	Parameterizations of the medium in each scheme are discussed in terms of the transport coefficient $ \hat { q } $ .	The four major approximation schemes devised to study the modification of jets in dense matter are outlined .	The comparisons are restricted to basic assumptions and approximations made in each case and the calculation methodology used .	Emergent underlying similarities between apparently disparate methods brought about by the approximation schemes are exposed .	Discrepancies between the estimates obtained from the four schemes are discussed .
2	Kinematic signatures of the outflow are visible in both the CO and HI emission : both tracers show a minor axis velocity gradient and together they show double peaked profiles , consistent with a hot outflow bounded by a cone made of a mix of atomic and molecular gas .	We present a wide area ( ~ 8 x 8 kpc ) , sensitive map of CO ( 2-1 ) emission around the nearby starburst galaxy M82 .	Molecular gas extends far beyond the stellar disk , including emission associated with the well-known outflow as far as 3 kpc from M82 's midplane .	Combining our CO and HI data with observations of the dust continuum , we study the changing properties of the cold outflow as it leaves the disk .	While H_2 dominates the ISM near the disk , the dominant phase of the cool medium changes as it leaves the galaxy and becomes mostly atomic after about a kpc .
2	Mel'nikov and Steinberg [ L. S. Mel'nikov , R. Steinberg , One counterexample for two conjectures on three coloring , Discrete Math .	A graph $ G $ is \emph { uniquely k-colorable } if the chromatic number of $ G $ is $ k $ and $ G $ has only one $ k $ -coloring up to permutation of the colors .	A uniquely $ k $ -colorable graph $ G $ is edge-critical if $ G-e $ is not a uniquely $ k $ -colorable graph for any edge $ e\in E ( G ) $ .	20 ( 1977 ) 203-206 ] asked to find an exact upper bound for the number of edges in a edge-critical 3-colorable planar graph with $ n $ vertices .	In this paper , we give some properties of edge-critical uniquely 3-colorable planar graphs and prove that if $ G $ is such a graph with $ n ( \geq6 ) $ vertices , then $ |E ( G ) |\leq \frac { 5 } { 2 } n-6 $ , which improves the upper bound $ \frac { 8 } { 3 } n-\frac { 17 } { 3 } $ given by Matsumoto [ N. Matsumoto , The size of edge-critical uniquely 3-colorable planar graphs , Electron.J . Combin .
2	These two conditions makes our model more restrictive and predictive .	We investigated thermal leptogenesis scenarios in the left-right symmetric extension of the standard model .	In the SO ( 10 ) GUT framework , we impose the D-parity realization below GUT scale .	In such a case , a D-parity odd singlet in the 4-index antisymmetric tensor representation of SO ( 10 ) have a critical role .	This singlet have prospects of causing a very large mass hierarchy between SU ( 2 ) L and SU ( 2 ) R triplet scalars .
3	It turns out that the tiling has overlap coincidence .	Recently Taylor and Socolar introduced an aperiodic mono-tile .	The associated tiling can be viewed as a substitution tiling .	We use the substitution rule for this tiling and apply the algorithm of \cite { AL } to check overlap coincidence .	So the tiling dynamics has pure point spectrum and we can conclude that this tiling has a quasicrystalline structure .
1	Such a superconductor is expected to be topological , thereby supporting topologically protected gapless Majorana-Weyl edge modes .	We discuss the Josephson effect and the appearance of dissipationless edge currents in a holographic Josephson junction configuration involving a chiral , time-reversal breaking , superconductor in 2+1 dimensions .	Such modes manifest themselves in chiral dissipationless edge currents , which we exhibit and investigate in the context of our construction .	The physics of the Josephson current itself , though expected to be unconventional in some non-equilibrium settings , is shown to be conventional in our setup which takes place in thermal equilibrium .	We comment on various ways in which the expected Majorana nature of the edge excitations , and relatedly the unconventional nature of topological Josephson junctions , can be verified in the holographic context .
2	An attempt to fit this $ \kappa ( 900 ) $ together with a similarly obtained $ \sigma ( 560 ) $ and the well known $ a_0 ( 980 ) $ and $ f_0 ( 980 ) $ into a nonet pattern suggests that the underlying structure is closer to a dual quark-dual antiquark than to a quark-antiquark .	We first review the work of the Syracuse group , which uses an effective chiral Lagrangian approach , on meson-meson scattering .	An illustration providing evidence for the existence of a strange scalar resonance of mass around 900 MeV is given .	A possible mechanism to explain a next higher-in mass scalar meson nonet is also discussed .	This involves mixing between $ q { \bar q } $ and $ qq { \bar q } { \bar q } $ states .
2	The level structure clearly displays `` inversion '' , i.e. , intruder states with mainly 2p2h configurations displacing the normal states to higher excitation energies .	The beta decay of the exotic 30Ne ( N=20 ) is reported .	For the first time , the low-energy level structure of the N=19 , 30Na ( Tz = 4 ) , is obtained from beta-delayed gamma spectroscopy using fragment-beta-gamma-gamma coincidences .	The good agreement in excitation energies and the weak and electromagnetic decay patterns with Monte Carlo Shell Model calculations with the SDPF-M interaction in the sdpf valence space illustrates the small d3/2 - f7/2 shell gap .	The relative position of the `` normal dominant '' and `` intruder dominant '' excited states provides valuable information to understand better the N=20 shell gap .
1	We consider associative ( resp .	Let X be a smooth affine algebraic variety over a field K of characteristic 0 , and let R be a complete parameter K-algebra ( e.g.R = K [ [ h ] ] ) .	Poisson ) R-deformations of the structure sheaf O_X .	The set of R-deformations has a crossed groupoid ( i.e.strict 2-groupoid ) structure .	Our main result is that there is a canonical equivalence of crossed groupoids from the Deligne crossed groupoid of normalized polydifferential operators ( resp .
1	Taking into account redshift space distortions , nonlinear evolution , the survey selection function , and discreteness and finite volume effects , all three catalogs show evidence for the dependence of the bispectrum on configuration shape predicted by gravitational instability .	We compute the bispectrum for the galaxy distribution in the IRAS QDOT , 2Jy , and 1.2Jy redshift catalogs for wavenumbers 0.05 & lt ; k & lt ; 0.2 h/Mpc and compare the results with predictions from gravitational instability in perturbation theory .	Assuming Gaussian initial conditions and local biasing parametrized by linear and non-linear bias parameters b_1 and b_2 , a likelihood analysis yields 1/b_1 = 1.32^ { +0.36 } _ { -0.58 } , 1.15^ { +0.39 } _ { -0.39 } and b_2/b_1^2=-0.57^ { +0.45 } _ { -0.30 } , -0.50^ { +0.31 } _ { -0.51 } , for the for the 2Jy and 1.2Jy samples , respectively .	This implies that IRAS galaxies trace dark matter increasingly weakly as the density contrast increases , consistent with their being under-represented in clusters .	In a model with chi^2 non-Gaussian initial conditions , the bispectrum displays an amplitude and scale dependence different than that found in the Gaussian case ; if IRAS galaxies do not have bias b_1 & gt ; 1 at large scales , \chi^2 non-Gaussian initial conditions are ruled out at the 95 % confidence level .
0	The canonical formalism of general relativity affords a particularly interesting characterisation of the infamous hole argument .	It also provides a natural formalism in which to relate the hole argument to the problem of time in classical and quantum gravity .	In this paper , we examine the connection between these two much discussed problems in the foundations of spacetime theory along two interrelated lines .	First , from a formal perspective , we consider the extent to which the two problems can and can not be precisely and distinctly characterised .	Second , from a philosophical perspective , we consider the implications of various responses to the problems , with a particular focus upon the viability of a `deflationary ' attitude to the relationalist/substantivalist debate regarding the ontology of spacetime .
2	Moreover we show that there are 'finite type ' completions with the latter property , determined by the maximum of a finite number of 'semidegrees ' , i.e.maps of the ring of regular functions excluding zero , into integers , which send products into sums and sums into maximas ( with a possible exception when the summands have the same semidegree ) .	We study projective completions of affine algebraic varieties which are given by filtrations , or equivalently , 'degree like functions ' on their rings of regular functions .	For a quasifinite polynomial map P ( i.e.with all fibers finite ) of affine varieties , we prove that there are completions of the source that do not add points at infinity for P ( i.e.in the intersection of completions of the hypersurfaces corresponding to a generic fiber and determined by the component functions of P ) .	We characterize the latter type completions as the ones for which the ideal of the 'hypersurface at infinity ' is radical .	Moreover , we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the collection of minimal associated primes of the latter ideal and the unique minimal collection of semidegrees needed to define the corresponding degree like function .
3	The objective of this paper is to quantify the uncertainties that makes the decision more realistic , generic and extendable to application domain .	Robot reliability has become an increasingly important issue in the last few years due to increased application of robots in many industries ( like automobile industry ) under hazardous and unstructured environment .	As the component failure behavior is dependent on configuration and environment , the available information about the constituent component of robots is most of the time imprecise , incomplete , vague and conflicting and so it is very difficult to analyze their behavior and to predict their failure pattern .	The reliability analysis of any system provides an understanding about the likelihood of failures occurring in the system/component and the increased insight about its inherent weakness .	In this paper various reliability parameters ( such as mean time between failures , expected number of failures , reliability , availability etc . )
2	Four clear { \nu } e events have been visually identified over the full sample , compared with an expectation of 6.4 +- 0.9 events from conventional sources .	We report an updated result from the ICARUS experiment on the search for { \nu } { \mu } - & gt ; { \nu } e anomalies with the CNGS beam , produced at CERN with an average energy of 20 GeV and travelling 730 km to the Gran Sasso Laboratory .	The present analysis is based on a total sample of 1995 events of CNGS neutrino interactions , which corresponds to an almost doubled sample with respect to the previously published result .	The result is compatible with the absence of additional anomalous contributions .	At 90 % and 99 % confidence levels the limits to possible oscillated events are 3.7 and 8.3 respectively .
1	Global conformal invariance leads to very strong constraints on both the general form and the singularity structure of the correlation functions of conserved currents .	We report some recent progress in the computation of the n-point correlation functions of conserved currents in a class of four dimensional conformal field theories with higher spin symmetry .	Namely , all these functions have to be rational functions with at most double pole singularities .	We show that this implies that the 4- , 5- and 6-point correlation functions of the ( symmetric , conserved and traceless ) stress-energy tensor are linear combinations of the three free field expressions .	Hence , in four dimensions , any globally conformal invariant theory is free .
4	In chapter one basic properties of codes and super matrices are given .	The new classes of super special codes are constructed in this book using the specially constructed super special vector spaces .	These codes mainly use the super matrices .	These codes can be realized as a special type of concatenated codes .	This book has four chapters .
3	It is shown that the best fit axial mass value becomes smaller as the momentum transfer cut is more restrictive .	MiniBooNE charge current quasi-elastic double differential cross section data are analyzed and confronted with predictions of two theoretical nucleus models : Fermi gas and spectral function .	The fitting procedure includes the overall flux uncertainty multiplicative factor .	In order to obtain a reliable value of the axial mass , bins with large contribution from small momentum transfer are eliminated from the analysis .	For $ q_ { cut } =500 $ ~MeV/c the obtained values of axial mass are $ M_A=1350\pm 66 $ ~MeV for the Fermi gas and $ M_A=1343\pm 60 $ ~MeV for the spectral function .
4	In particular , we obtain a generalized symmetrical identity for these restricted $ q $ -Eulerian polynomials with a combinatorial proof .	The $ ( q , r ) $ -Eulerian polynomials are the $ ( \maj- $ $ \exc , \fix , \exc ) $ enumerative polynomials of permutations .	Using Shareshian and Wachs ' exponential generating function of these Eulerian polynomials , Chung and Graham proved two symmetrical $ q $ -Eulerian identities and asked for bijective proofs .	We provide such proofs using Foata and Han 's three-variable statistic $ ( \inv- $ $ \lec , \pix , \lec ) $ .	We also prove a new recurrence formula for the $ ( q , r ) $ -Eulerian polynomials and study a $ q $ -analogue of Chung and Graham 's restricted descent polynomials .
4	This nonthermal component may be due to turbulence stirred by residual bulk motions of extragalactic gas infalling into the cluster .	The total mass derived from X-ray emission is biased low in a large number of clusters when compared with the mass estimated via strong and weak lensing .	Suzaku and Chandra observations out to the virial radius report in several relaxed clusters steep temperature gradients that on assuming pure thermal hydrostatic equilibrium imply an unphysically decreasing mass profile .	Moreover , the gas mass fraction appears to be inconsistent with the cosmic value measured from the CMB .	Such findings can be interpreted as an evidence for an additional nonthermal pressure in the outskirts of these clusters .
3	The approximate parity-independence of the deuteron optical potentials is shown to arise from the nontrivial interference between antisymmetrization and channel coupling to the deuteron breakup channels .	Improved potential solutions are presented for the inverse scattering problem for $ d $ + $ ^4 $ He data .	The input for the inversions includes both the data of recent phase shift analyses and phase shifts from RGM coupled-channel calculations based on the NN Minnesota force .	The combined calculations provide a more reliable estimate of the odd-even splitting of the potentials than previously found , suggesting a rather moderate role for this splitting in deuteron-nucleus scattering generally .	A further comparison of the empirical potentials established here and the double folding potential derived from the M3Y effective NN force ( with the appropriate normalisation factor ) reveals strong similarities .
0	Since Parikh and Wilczek 's tunneling method was proposed , there have been many generalizations , such as its application to massive charged particles ' tunneling and other spacetimes .	Moreover , a variant tunneling method was also recently proposed by Angheben et al that it was independent of coordinates .	However , there are some subtleties in the calculation of Hawking radiation , and particularly is the so-called factor of 2 problem during calculating the Hawking temperature .	The most popular opinion on this problem is that it is just a problem of the choice of coordinates .	However , following other treatments we show that we can also consider this problem as a problem that we do not consider the contribution from P ( absorption ) .
2	In particular , the latter includes the case of surface waves propagating along the boundary .	We investigate the transition radiation on a periodically deformed interface between two dielectric media .	Under the assumption that the dielectric permittivities of the media are close , a formula is derived for the spectral-angular distribution of the radiated energy in the general case of non-static profile function for the separating boundary .	The numerical examples are given for triangular grating and for sinusoidal profile .	We show that instead of a single peak in the backward transition radiation on a flat interface , for periodic interface one has a set of peaks .
4	Within an adequate interval q & lt ; qo & lt ; q ' , in which the function reaches its maximum value at qo , this invariant function accurately approximates the investigated q-measure , nitidly evidencing the duality phenomenon .	Within the framework on non-extensive thermostatistics we revisit the recently advanced q-duality concept .	We focus our attention here on a modified q-entropic measure of the spatial inhomogeneity for binary patterns .	At a fixed length-scale this measure exhibits a generalised duality that links appropriate pairs of q and q ' values .	The simplest q & lt ; - & gt ; q ' invariant function , without any free parameters , is deduced here .
3	These dominant processes are related to exact selection rules for the values of the number of holons and spinons generated or annihilated by application onto a ground state of rotated-electron operators .	In the first paper of this series it was found that the $ \eta $ -spin 1/2 holons , spin 1/2 spinons , and $ c $ pseudoparticles whose occupancy configurations describe the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Hubbard model emerge from the electron - rotated-electron unitary transformation .	In this second paper we discuss and clarify how the relation of the electrons to the above objects can be used in a program for evaluation of finite-energy few-electron spectral functions .	As a first step , here we characterize the dominant holon and spinon microscopic physical processes that originate more than 99 % of the few-electron spectral weight .	We also generalize the concepts of a lower Hubbard band and upper Hubbard bands to all values of on-site Coulombian repulsion .
4	The wave function of the nucleon quarks are determined using the variation method and relevant boundary conditions are applied to calculate the deep inelastic cross sections of the virtual diagram .	The multi-particle production at high energy neutrino- nucleon collisions are investigated through the analysis of the data of the experiment CERN-WA-025 at neutrino energy less than 260GeV and the experiments FNAL-616 and FNAL-701 at energy range 120-250 GeV .	The general features of these experiments are used as base to build a hypothetical model that views the reaction by a Feynman diagram of two vertices .	The first of which concerns the weak interaction between the neutrino and the quark constituents of the nucleon .	At the second vertex , a strong color field is assumed to play the role of particle production , which depend on the momentum transferred from the first vertex .
4	Second , for crystals associated to Kac-Moody algebras it is shown for lower intervals that the Mobius function is always 0 , 1 , or -1 , and in finite type this is also proven for upper intervals , with a precise formula given in each case .	We investigate the ways in which fundamental properties of the weak Bruhat order on a Weyl group can be lifted ( or not ) to a corresponding highest weight crystal graph , viewed as a partially ordered set ; the latter projects to the weak order via the key map .	First , a crystal theoretic analogue of the statement that any two reduced expressions for the same Coxeter group element are related by Coxeter moves is proven for all lower intervals in a simply or doubly laced crystal .	On the other hand , it is shown that no finite set of moves exists , even in type A , for arbitrary crystal graph intervals .	In fact , it is shown that there are relations of arbitrarily high degree amongst crystal operators that are not implied by lower degree relations .
0	A new type of quasi-two-dimensional complex plasma system was observed which consisted of monodisperse microspheres and their binary agglomerations ( dimers ) .	The particles and their dimers levitated in a plasma sheath at slightly different heights and formed two distinct sublayers .	The sys- tem did not crystallize and may be characterized as disordered solid .	The dimers were identified based on their characteristic appearance in defocused images , i.e. , rotating interference fringe pat- terns .	The in-plane and inter-plane particle separations exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on the discharge pressure which agrees well with theoretical predictions .
3	We also prove that if $ X $ is a smooth Banach space with the Radon-Nikod\'ym property , then the set of all numerical strong peak functions is dense in $ A_b ( B_X : X ) $ .	We introduce the notion of numerical ( strong ) peak function and investigate the denseness of the norm and numerical peak functions on complex Banach spaces .	Let $ A_b ( B_X : X ) $ be the Banach space of all bounded continuous functions $ f $ on the unit ball $ B_X $ of a Banach space $ X $ and their restrictions $ f|_ { B_X^\circ } $ to the open unit ball are holomorphic .	In finite dimensional spaces , we show that the intersection of the set of all norm peak functions and the set of all numerical peak functions is a dense $ G_\delta $ subset of $ A_b ( B_X : X ) $ .	In particular , when $ X=L_p ( \mu ) $ $ ( 1 & lt ; p & lt ; \infty ) $ or $ X=\ell_1 $ , it is shown that the intersection of the set of all norm strong peak functions and the set of all numerical strong peak functions is a dense $ G_\delta $ subset of $ A_b ( B_X : X ) $ .
2	This provides a classification of a family of unitary representations of a basic quantized quiver variety , one of the first such classifications for any quantized quiver variety .	We study multiplicity space signatures in tensor products of representations of $ \mathfrak { sl } _2 $ and $ U_q ( \mathfrak { sl } _2 ) $ , and give some applications .	We completely classify definite multiplicity spaces for generic tensor products of $ \mathfrak { sl } _2 $ Verma modules .	We use multiplicity space signatures to provide the first real critical point lower bound for generic $ \mathfrak { sl } _2 $ master functions .	As a corollary of this bound , we obtain a simple and asymptotically correct approximation for the number of real critical points of a generic $ \mathfrak { sl } _2 $ master function .
1	We give a deterministic algorithm for Sperner problems over pseudo-manifolds of arbitrary dimension .	We present several results on the complexity of various forms of Sperner 's Lemma in the black-box model of computing .	The query complexity of our algorithm is linear in the separation number of the skeleton graph of the manifold and the size of its boundary .	As a corollary we get an $ O ( \sqrt { n } ) $ deterministic query algorithm for the black-box version of the problem { \bf 2D-SPERNER } , a well studied member of Papadimitriou 's complexity class PPAD .	This upper bound matches the $ \Omega ( \sqrt { n } ) $ deterministic lower bound of Crescenzi and Silvestri .
0	We consider the complexity of Delaunay triangulations of sets of points in R^3 under certain practical geometric constraints .	The spread of a set of points is the ratio between the longest and shortest pairwise distances .	We show that in the worst case , the Delaunay triangulation of n points in R^3 with spread D has complexity Omega ( min { D^3 , nD , n^2 } ) and O ( min { D^4 , n^2 } ) .	For the case D = Theta ( sqrt { n } ) , our lower bound construction consists of a uniform sample of a smooth convex surface with bounded curvature .	We also construct a family of smooth connected surfaces such that the Delaunay triangulation of any good point sample has near-quadratic complexity .
1	Using observations from our LMC PN morphological survey , and including images available in the HST Data Archive , and published chemical abundances , we find that asymmetry in PNe is strongly correlated with a younger stellar Population , as indicated by the abundance of elements that are unaltered by stellar evolution ( Ne , Ar , S ) .	Planetary Nebulae ( PNe ) in the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) offer the unique opportunity to study both the Population and evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars , by means of the morphological type of the nebula .	While similar results have been obtained for Galactic PNe , this is the first demonstration of the relationship for extra-galactic PNe .	We also examine the relation between morphology and abundance of the products of stellar evolution .	We found that asymmetric PNe have higher nitrogen and lower carbon abundances than symmetric PNe .
4	Coakley , Dopico , and Johnson [ Linear Algebra Appl .	Docovic and Szechtman , [ Proc.Amer.Math.Soc .	133 ( 2005 ) 2853-2863 ] considered a vector space V endowed with a bilinear form .	They proved that all isometries of V over a field F of characteristic not 2 have determinant 1 if and only if V has no orthogonal summands of odd dimension ( the case of characteristic 2 was also considered ) .	Their proof is based on Riehm 's classification of bilinear forms .
3	We adopted a parametrized disc geometry and a central point-like source of ionizing radiation to capture the main characteristics of the emission line profile from such discs .	Double peaked broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei are generally considered to be formed in an accretion disc .	In this paper , we compute the profiles of reprocessing emission lines from a relativistic , warped accretion disc around a black hole in order to explore the possibility that certain asymmetries in the double-peaked emission line profile which can not be explained by a circular Keplerian disc may be induced by disc warping .	The disc warping also provides a solution for the energy budget in the emission line region because it increases the solid angle of the outer disc portion subtended to the inner portion of the disc .	We find that the ratio between the blue and red peaks of the line profiles becoming less than unity can be naturally predicted by a twisted warped disc , and a third peak can be produced in some cases .
3	This means that tetrad components of $ R , \nabla R , \nabla^ { ( 2 ) } R $ are constant , and that essential coordinates first appear as components of $ \nabla^ { ( 3 ) } R $ .	We present a family of four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds whose invariant classification requires the seventh covariant derivative of the curvature tensor .	The spacetimes in questions are null radiation , type N solutions on an anti-de Sitter background .	The large order of the bound is due to the fact that these spacetimes are properly $ CH_2 $ , i.e. , curvature homogeneous of order 2 but non-homogeneous .	Covariant derivatives of orders 4,5,6 yield one additional invariant each , and $ \nabla^ { ( 7 ) } R $ is needed for invariant classification .
3	The Fermi surface undergoes a large reconstruction across the QCP and the coherence scale of the Kondo lattice vanishes at the QCP .	The identification of magnetic quantum critical points in heavy fermion metals has provided an ideal setting for experimentally studying quantum criticality .	Motivated by these experiments , considerable theoretical efforts have recently been devoted to reexamine the interplay between Kondo screening and magnetic interactions in Kondo lattice systems .	A local quantum critical picture has emerged , in which magnetic interactions suppress Kondo screening precisely at the magnetic quantum critical point ( QCP ) .	The dynamical spin susceptibility exhibits $ \omega/T $ scaling and non-trivial exponents describe the temperature and frequency dependence of various physical quantities .
3	The second author has recently introduced the Sylvester coloring conjecture , which states that for any cubic graph $ G $ one has : $ S\prec G $ .	If $ G $ and $ H $ are two cubic graphs , then an $ H $ -coloring of $ G $ is a proper edge-coloring $ f $ with edges of $ H $ , such that for each vertex $ x $ of $ G $ , there is a vertex $ y $ of $ H $ with $ f ( \partial_G ( x ) ) =\partial_H ( y ) $ .	If $ G $ admits an $ H $ -coloring , then we will write $ H\prec G $ .	The Petersen coloring conjecture of Jaeger states that for any bridgeless cubic graph $ G $ , one has : $ P\prec G $ .	Here $ S $ is the Sylvester graph on ten vertices .
4	The observed similarity of low-energy electronic excitations between iron-chalcogenide and iron-arsenide superconductors strongly suggests that common interactions which involve Q~ ( pi , pi ) scattering are responsible for the superconducting pairing .	We have performed high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of iron-chalcogenide superconductor Fe1.03Te0.7Se0.3 ( Tc = 13 K ) to investigate the electronic structure relevant to superconductivity .	We observed a hole- and an electron-like Fermi surfaces at the Brillouin zone center and corner , respectively , which are nearly nested by the Q~ ( pi , pi ) wave vector .	We do not find evidence for the nesting instability with Q~ ( pi+delta , 0 ) reminiscent of the antiferromagnetic order in the parent compound Fe1+yTe .	We have observed an isotropic superconducting gap along the hole-like Fermi surface with the gap size Delta of ~4 meV ( 2Delta/kBTc~7 ) , demonstrating the strong-coupling nature of the superconductivity .
0	Ternary and quaternary cubic c-AlxIn1-xN/GaN and c-AlxGayIn1-x-y/GaN heterostructures lattice-matched to c-GaN on freestanding 3C-SiC substrates were grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy .	The c-AlxGayIn1-x-y alloy permits the independent control of band gap and lattice parameter .	The ternary and quaternary films were grown at 620 C. Different alloy compositions were obtained by varying the Al and Ga fluxes .	The alloy composition was measured by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy ( EDX ) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry ( RBS ) .	X-ray reciprocal space map of asymmetric ( -1-13 ) reflex were used to measure the lattice parameters and to verify the lattice match between the alloy and the c-GaN buffer .
0	We discuss a new family of metrics of 7-manifolds with G_2 holonomy , which are R^3 bundles over a quaternionic space .	The metrics depend on five parameters and have two Abelian isometries .	Certain singularities of the G_2 manifolds are related to fixed points of these isometries ; there are two combinations of Killing vectors that possess co-dimension four fixed points which yield upon compactification only intersecting D6-branes if one also identifies two parameters .	Two of the remaining parameters are quantized and we argue that they are related to the number of D6-branes , which appear in three stacks .	We perform explicitly the reduction to the type IIA model .
4	This paper gives an overview of recent progress in the field of 3D NLTE synthesis of polarized spectral lines resulting from investigations with the radiative transfer code PORTA .	Scattering line polarization and the Hanle effect are among the most important mechanisms for diagnostics of the solar and stellar atmospheres .	The fact that real stellar atmospheres are horizontally inhomogeneous makes the spectral synthesis and interpretation very challenging because the effect of thermodynamic fluctuations on spectral line polarization is entangled with the action of magnetic fields .	This applies to the spatially resolved as well as to the averaged spectra .	The necessary step towards the interpretation of such spectra is to study the line formation in sufficiently realistic 3D MHD models and comparison of the synthetic spectra with observations .
3	In this architecture , the model generates spatial highlights of each category presented in an image using an attention model , and subsequently generates foreground segmentation for each highlighted region using decoder .	We propose a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation algorithm based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network ( DCNN ) .	Contrary to existing weakly-supervised approaches , our algorithm exploits auxiliary segmentation annotations available for different categories to guide segmentations on images with only image-level class labels .	To make the segmentation knowledge transferrable across categories , we design a decoupled encoder-decoder architecture with attention model .	Combining attention model , we show that the decoder trained with segmentation annotations in different categories can boost the performance of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation .
1	Our low redshift results allow us to probe low $ \sigma $ density fluctuations significantly beyond the range of previous cosmological simulations .	We use a high resolution $ \Lambda $ CDM numerical simulation to calculate the mass function of dark matter haloes down to the scale of dwarf galaxies , back to a redshift of fifteen , in a 50 $ h^ { -1 } $ Mpc volume containing 80 million particles .	The Sheth and Tormen mass function provides an excellent match to all of our data except for redshifts of ten and higher , where it overpredicts halo numbers increasingly with redshift , reaching roughly 50 percent for the $ 10^ { 10 } -10^ { 11 } \msun $ haloes sampled at redshift 15 .	Our results confirm previous findings that the simulated halo mass function can be described solely by the variance of the mass distribution , and thus has no explicit redshift dependence .	We provide an empirical fit to our data that corrects for the overprediction of extremely rare objects by the Sheth and Tormen mass function .
3	The emission in the X-ray band decreased by three orders of magnitude within 700 seconds , following the prompt emission .	The Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer performed its first autonomous , X-ray follow-up to a newly detected GRB on 2005 January 17 , within 193 seconds of the burst trigger by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope .	While the burst was still in progress , the X-ray Telescope obtained a position and an image for an un-catalogued X-ray source ; simultaneous with the gamma-ray observation .	The XRT observed flux during the prompt emission was 1.1 x 10^ { -8 } ergs cm^ { -2 } s^ { -1 } in the 0.5-10 keV energy band .	This is found to be consistent with the gamma-ray decay when extrapolated into the XRT energy band .
4	We perform an explicit calculation of the D5 fluctuations in the D3 geometry and determine the spectrum of defect operators .	We study the maximally supersymmetric Kondo model obtained by adding a fermionic impurity to N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory .	While the original Kondo problem describes a defect interacting with a free Fermi liquid of itinerant electrons , here the ambient theory is an interacting CFT , and this introduces qualitatively new features into the system .	The model arises in string theory by considering the intersection of a stack of M D5-branes with a stack of N D3-branes , at a point in the D3 worldvolume .	We analyze the theory holographically , and propose a dictionary between the Kondo problem and antisymmetric Wilson loops in N=4 SYM .
2	It is also crucial for controlling material properties .	Attractive colloidal gels display a solid-to-fluid transition as shear stresses above the yield stress are applied .	This shear-induced transition is involved in virtually any application of colloidal gels .	Still , in spite of its ubiquity , the yielding transition is far from understood , mainly because rheological measurements are spatially averaged over the whole sample .	Here , the instrumentation of creep and oscillatory shear experiments with high-frequency ultrasound opens new routes to observing the local dynamics of opaque attractive colloidal gels .
4	Here we review achievements on the growth and characterization of magnetic and ferroelectric properties of hexagonal and orthorhombic RMnO3 epitaxial thin films , discuss some challenging issues and we suggest some guidelines for future research and developments .	Multiferroic materials have received an astonishing attention in the last decades due to expectations that potential coupling between distinct ferroic orders could inspire new applications and new device concepts .	As a result , a new knowledge on coupling mechanisms and materials science has dramatically emerged .	Multiferroic RMnO3 perovskites are central to this progress providing a suitable platform to tailor spin-spin and spin-lattice interactions .	With views towards applications , development of thin films of multiferroic materials have also progressed enormously and nowadays thin film manganites are available with properties mimicking those of bulk compounds .
1	We observe a gate independent gap , as previously observed only by low temperature STM [ Y. Zhang et al. , Nat.Phys .	We present tunneling measurements of sub-micron metal/insulator/graphene planar tunnel junctions up to room temperature .	4 , 627 ( 2008 ) ] .	No gap appears at temperatures above 150K , which is four times smaller than the theoretically expected $ T_ { c } $ , from the accepted mean field model [ T. O. Wehling et al.Phys.Rev.Lett .	101 , 216803 ( 2008 ) ] .
3	We discuss the construction of our lattice theory , which allows us to study systems of up to ( but by no means limited to ) 38 fermions with high accuracy and modest computational resources , and offer an overview of several applications of the technique .	A novel lattice approach is presented for studying systems comprising a large number of interacting nonrelativistic fermions .	The construction is ideally suited for numerical study of fermions near unitarity -- a strongly coupled regime corresponding to the two-particle s-wave scattering phase shift delta_0 = pi/2 .	Such systems may be achieved experimentally with trapped atoms , and provide a starting point for an effective field theory description of nuclear physics .	A more detailed discussion of applications and simulation results will be described in companion proceedings by A. N. N. and J-W. L .
4	On the other hand , the detailed analysis of the electronic excitations detected in the optical conductivity , provides direct evidence for a charge disproportionated electronic ground-state , at least on a locale scale : A consistent interpretation of both structural and optical conductivity data requires an asymmetrical charge distribution on each rung , without any long range order .	We investigate the temperature dependent optical properties of NaV2O5 , in the energy range 4meV-4eV .	The symmetry of the system is discussed on the basis of infrared phonon spectra .	By analyzing the optically allowed phonons at temperatures below and above the phase transition , we conclude that a second-order change to a larger unit cell takes place below 34 K , with a fluctuation regime extending over a broad temperature range .	In the high temperature undistorted phase , we find good agreement with the recently proposed centrosymmetric space group Pmmn .
4	450 ( 1994 ) ) , where examples are given to show that divisor classes are not characterized by either one of the above conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) , taken by itself , unlike in the case of non-singular varieties .	We prove an analogue of the Lefschetz ( 1,1 ) Theorem characterizing cohomology classes of Cartier divisors ( or equivalently first Chern classes of line bundles ) in the second integral cohomology .	Let $ X $ be a normal complex projective variety .	We show that the classes of Cartier divisors in $ H^2 ( X , Z ) $ are precisely the classes $ x $ such that ( i ) the image of $ x $ in $ H^2 ( X , C ) $ ( cohomology with complex coefficients ) lies in $ F^1 H^2 ( X , C ) $ ( first level of the Hodge filtration for Deligne 's mixed Hodge structure ) , and ( ii ) $ x $ is Zariski-locally trivial , i.e. , there is a covering of $ X $ by Zariski open sets $ U $ such that $ x $ has zero image in $ H^2 ( U , Z ) $ .	For normal quasi-projective varieties , this positively answers a question of Barbieri-Viale and Srinivas ( J. Reine Ang.Math .
3	In particular , it predicts a phase transition between species coexistence and biodiversity loss in the infinite-size limit and , in finite populations , a nonmonotonic dependence of the mean fixation time on the migration rate .	In subdivided populations , migration acts together with selection and genetic drift and determines their evolution .	Building up on a recently proposed method , which hinges on the emergence of a time scale separation between local and global dynamics , we study the fixation properties of subdivided populations in the presence of balancing selection .	The approximation implied by the method is accurate when the effective selection strength is small and the number of subpopulations is large .	In order to investigate the fixation properties of the subdivided population for stronger selection , we introduce an effective coarser description of the dynamics in terms of a voter model with intermediate states , which highlights the basic mechanisms driving the evolutionary process .
1	We give an explicit construction of a fiber $ F_a $ and its monodromy $ : F_a \rightarrow F_a $ of the fibration associated to each fibered class $ a $ of $ N $ .	We study the magic manifold $ N $ which is a hyperbolic and fibered $ 3 $ -manifold .	Let $ \delta_g $ ( resp .	$ \delta_g^+ $ ) be the minimal dilatation of pseudo-Anosovs ( resp .	pseudo-Anosovs with orientable invariant foliations ) defined on an orientable closed surface of genus $ g $ .
0	Here , we present a detailed study on low bias current-voltage ( I-V ) characteristic of graphene superlattice ( GSL ) resonant tunneling diode ( RTD ) with heterostructured substrate and series of grounded metallic planes placed over graphene sheet which induce periodically modulated Dirac gap and Fermi velocity barrier .	We investigate the effect of GSL parameters on I-V characteristics within the Landauer-Buttiker formalism .	We show how the engineering these parameters results in multipeak NDR in proposed device .	Moreover we provide a novel venue to control the NDR in GSL with Fermi velocity engineering .	From this viewpoint we obtain multipeak NDR through miniband align in GSL .
4	We also present a boundary analog of KPZ ( for subsets of the boundary of D ) .	Consider a bounded planar domain D , an instance h of the Gaussian free field on D ( with Dirichlet energy normalized by 1/ ( 2\pi ) ) , and a constant 0 & lt ; gamma & lt ; 2 .	The Liouville quantum gravity measure on D is the weak limit as epsilon tends to 0 of the measures \epsilon^ { \gamma^2/2 } e^ { \gamma h_\epsilon ( z ) } dz , where dz is Lebesgue measure on D and h_\epsilon ( z ) denotes the mean value of h on the circle of radius epsilon centered at z .	Given a random ( or deterministic ) subset X of D one can define the scaling dimension of X using either Lebesgue measure or this random measure .	We derive a general quadratic relation between these two dimensions , which we view as a probabilistic formulation of the KPZ relation from conformal field theory .
4	We find that it is in fact correct to make a Bayesian inference that the product with the higher market share has the better quality under few and unrestrictive assumptions on customer behavior .	Market share and quality , or customer satisfaction , go together .	Yet inferring one from the other appears difficult .	Indeed , such an inference would need detailed information about customer behavior , and might be clouded by modes of behavior such as herding ( following popularity ) or elitism , where customers avoid popular products .	We investigate a fixed-price model where customers are informed about their history with products and about market share data .
1	This problem is described by a boundary conformal field theory with D scalar fields on a disc perturbed by relevant boundary operators with O ( D ) symmetry .	We consider the problem of condensation of open string tachyon fields which have an O ( D ) symmetric profile .	The model is exactly solvable in the large D limit and we analyze its 1/D expansion .	We find that this expansion is only consistent for tachyon fields which are polynomials .	In that case , we show that the theory is renormalized by normal ordering the interaction .
4	We defend this proposal against alternatives .	In order to claim that one has experimentally tested whether a noncontextual ontological model could underlie certain measurement statistics in quantum theory , it is necessary to have a notion of noncontextuality that applies to unsharp measurements , i.e. , those that can only be represented by positive operator-valued measures rather than projection-valued measures .	This is because any realistic measurement necessarily has some nonvanishing amount of noise and therefore never achieves the ideal of sharpness .	Assuming a generalized notion of noncontextuality that applies to arbitrary experimental procedures , it is shown that the outcome of a measurement depends deterministically on the ontic state of the system being measured if and only if the measurement is sharp .	Hence for every unsharp measurement , its outcome necessarily has an indeterministic dependence on the ontic state .
4	Hence the upper bound on the spin-independent cross section is below the DAMA and CoGeNT regions , but could be compatible with the two events observed by CDMS-II .	In the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model , a bino-like LSP can be as light as a few GeV and satisfy WMAP constraints on the dark matter relic density in the presence of a light CP-odd Higgs scalar .	We study upper bounds on the direct detection cross sections for such a light LSP in the mass range 2-20 GeV in the NMSSM , respecting all constraints from B-physics and LEP .	The OPAL constraints on e^+ e^- - & gt ; \chi^0_1 \chi^0_i ( i & gt ; 1 ) play an important role and are discussed in some detail .	The resulting upper bounds on the spin-independent and spin-dependent nucleon cross sections are ~ 10^ { -42 } cm^ { -2 } and ~ 4\times 10^ { -40 } cm^ { -2 } , respectively .
4	We also analyze the probability distributions of the elements of $ [ T ] $ in this particular model for a better understanding of the characteristics of `` isotropic '' and `` anisotropic '' orientations distributions of the ensemble of TLSs .	We use an extended version of the standard tunneling model to explain the anisotropic sound absorption in decagonal quasicrystals .	The glassy properties are determined by an ensemble of two level systems ( TLS ) , arbitrarily oriented .	The TLS is characterized by a $ 3\times3 $ symmetric tensor , which couples to the strain field through a $ 3\times3\times3\times3 $ tensor of coupling constants , $ [ [ R ] ] $ .	The structure of $ [ [ R ] ] $ reflects the symmetry of the quasicrystal .
3	This result can be seen as a generalization of a similar result on three dimensional Bessel process in [ 3 ] .	Strict local martingales may admit arbitrage opportunities with respect to the class of simple trading strategies .	( Since there is no possibility of using doubling strategies in this framework , the losses are not assumed to be bounded from below . )	We show that for a class of non-negative strict local martingales , the strong Markov property implies the no arbitrage property with respect to the class of simple trading strategies .	We also pro- vide no arbitrage conditions for stochastic processes within the class of simple trading strategies with shortsale restriction .
1	First , we are now able to make use of present observations , such as the Planck and BICEP2 data , to examine theoretical predictions from the standard inflationary $ \Lambda $ CDM which were made decades of years ago .	In light of the recent observational data coming from the sky we have two significant directions in the field of theoretical cosmology recently .	Second , we can search for new cosmological signatures as a way to explore physics beyond the standard cosmic paradigm .	In particular , a subset of early universe models admit a nonsingular bouncing solution that attempts to address the issue of the big bang singularity .	These models have achieved a series of considerable developments in recent years , in particular in their perturbative frameworks , which made brand-new predictions of cosmological signatures that could be visible in current and forthcoming observations .
1	Here we give a short systematic overview of quantum plasmas .	Quantum plasmas is a rapidly expanding field of research , with applications ranging from nanoelectronics , nanoscale devices and ultracold plasmas , to inertial confinement fusion and astrophysics .	In particular , we analyze the collective effects due to spin using fluid models .	The introduction of an intrinsic magnetization due to the plasma electron ( or positron ) spin properties in the magnetohydrodynamic limit is discussed .	Finally , a discussion of the theory and examples of applications is given .
3	Here we investigate the effects of electron-phonon interactions on a QD-based cavity QED system .	Semiconductor quantum dots ( QDs ) in photonic nanocavities provide monolithic , robust platforms for both quantum information processing and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) .	An inherent feature of such solid-state cavity QED systems is the presence of electron-phonon interactions , which distinguishes these systems from conventional atomic cavity QED .	Understanding the effects of electron-phonon interactions on these systems is indispensable for controlling and exploiting the rich physics that they exhibit .	When the QD and the cavity are off-resonance , we observe phonon-assisted cavity mode emission that strongly depends on the temperature and cavity-detuning .
0	The efficiency of boundary element methods depends crucially on the time required for setting up the stiffness matrix .	The far-field part of the matrix can be approximated by compression schemes like the fast multipole method or $ \mathcal { H } $ -matrix techniques .	The near-field part is typically approximated by special quadrature rules like the Sauter-Schwab technique that can handle the singular integrals appearing in the diagonal and near-diagonal matrix elements .	Since computing one element of the matrix requires only a small amount of data but a fairly large number of operations , we propose to use GPUs to handle vectorizable portions of the computation : near-field computations are ideally suited for vectorization and can therefore be handled very well by GPUs .	Modern far-field compression schemes can be split into a small adaptive portion that exhibits divergent control flows and is handled by the CPU and a vectorizable portion that can again be sent to GPUs .
1	Since the MDDI couples the total spin angular momentum and the relative orbital angular momentum of two colliding atoms , it works as a spin-orbit coupling .	We theoretically show that the spin Hall effect arises in a Bose-Einstein condensate ( BEC ) of neutral atoms interacting via the magnetic dipole-dipole interactions ( MDDIs ) .	Thus , when we prepare a BEC in a magnetic sublevel $ m=0 $ , thermally and quantum-mechanically excited atoms in the $ m=1 $ and $ -1 $ states feel the Lorentz-like foces in the opposite directions .	This is the origin for the emergence of the the spin Hall effect .	We define the mass-current and spin-current operators from the equations of continuity and calculate the spin Hall conductivity from the off-diagonal current-current correlation function within the Bogoliubov approximation .
3	Methods : We assume that the searched systems can be well described by Keplerian orbits .	Context : Transit surveys , both ground- and space- based , have already accumulated a large number of light curves that span several years .	Aims : The search for transiting planets in these long time series is computationally intensive .	We wish to optimize the search for both detection and computational efficiencies .	We then propagate the effects of different system parameters to the detection parameters .
0	We investigate the use of the event topology as a tool in the search for the six-jet decay of top-pair production in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.8 TeV .	Modified Fox-Wolfram `` shape '' variables , H_i , are employed to help distinguish the top-pair signal from the ordinary QCD multi-jet background .	The H 's can be constructed directly from the calorimeter cells or from jets .	Events are required to lie in a region of H-space defined by L_i & lt ; H_i & lt ; R_i for i=1 , ... , ,6 , where the left , L_i , and right , R_i , cuts are determined by a genetic algorithm ( GA ) procedure to maximize the signal over the square root of the background .	We are able to reduce the background over the signal to less than a factor of 100 using purely topological methods without using jet multiplicity cuts and without the aid of b-quark tagging .
1	The multiplicity of magnetic states in these systems can be very rich , in that their properties depend on the atomic species , the cluster size , shape and symmetry or choice of the substrate .	How does magnetism behave when the physical dimension is reduced to the size of nanostructures ?	Small variations of the cluster parameters may change the properties dramatically .	Research in this field has gained much by the many novel experimental methods and techniques exhibiting atomic resolution .	Here I review the ab-initio approach , focusing on recent calculations on magnetic frustration and occurrence of non-collinear magnetism in antiferromagnetic nanostructures deposited on surfaces .
2	Inverse scattering of the Sturm-Liouville operator and evolution of its potential are the basic ingredients , similar to the existing methods developed by Gardner-Greene-Kruskal-Miura ( 1967 ) , Zacharov-Shabbath ( 1974 ) and Peter Lax ( 1977 ) .	In this work we present a new method for solving of the Korteweg-de Vries ( KdV ) equation q'_t = - \dfrac { 3 } { 2 } q q'_x + \dfrac { 1 } { 4 } q '' '_ { xxx } .	The proposed method is a particular case of the theory of evolutionary vessels , developed in this work .	Evolutionary KdV vessel may be considered as a generalization of these previous works .	The advantage of the new method is that it produces a unified approach to existing solutions of the KdV equation .
2	Many studies on semiflexible polymers and their assemblies have been motivated by their importance in biology .	Here , we provide an overview of theoretical approaches to semiflexible polymers and their networks .	Such semiflexible polymers have large bending rigidities that can compete with the entropic tendency of a chain to crumple up into a random coil .	Indeed , crosslinked networks of semiflexible polymers form a major structural component of tissue and living cells .	Reconstituted networks of such biopolymers have emerged as a new class of biological soft matter systems with remarkable material properties , which have spurred many of the theoretical developments discussed here .
1	The orders of decay of the amplitude are determined for operators to be bounded on $ L^p ( \Rn ) $ , $ 1 & lt ; p & lt ; \infty $ , as well as to be bounded from Hardy space $ H^1 ( \Rn ) $ to $ L^1 ( \Rn ) $ .	In this paper we establish global Lp regularity properties of Fourier integral operators .	The obtained results extend local $ L^p $ regularity properties of Fourier integral operators established by Seeger , Sogge and Stein ( 1991 ) as well as global $ L^2 ( \Rn ) $ results of Asada and Fujiwara ( 1978 ) and Ruzhansky and Sugimoto ( 2006 ) , to the global setting of $ L^p ( \Rn ) $ .	Global boundedness in weighted Sobolev spaces $ W^ { \sigma , p } _s ( \Rn ) $ is also established .	The techniques used in the proofs are the space dependent dyadic decomposition and the global calculi developed by Ruzhansky and Sugimoto ( 2006 ) and Coriasco ( 1999 ) .
4	Second , accepting slow-roll inflation , the excursion of the inflaton field is at least of order Planck scale .	The tensor fraction $ r\simeq 0.16 $ found by BICEP2 corresponds to a Hubble parameter $ H\simeq 1.0\times 10^ { 14 } \GeV $ during inflation .	This has two implications for the ( single-field ) slow-roll inflation hypothesis .	First , the inflaton perturbation must account for much more than $ 10\ % $ of the curvature perturbation $ \zeta $ , which barring fine-tuning means that it accounts for practically all of it .	It follows that a curvaton-like mechanism for generating $ \zeta $ requires an alternative to slow roll such as k-inflation .
0	We study the real-time evolution of a self-interacting O ( N ) scalar field initially prepared in a pure quantum state .	We present a complete solution of the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics from a 1/N-expansion of the two-particle-irreducible effective action at next-to-leading order , which includes scattering and memory effects .	Restricting one 's attention ( or ability to measure ) to a subset of the infinite hierarchy of correlation functions , the system is described by an effective ( reduced ) density matrix which , unlike the full density matrix , has a nontrivial time evolution .	In particular , starting from a pure quantum state , we observe the loss of putity/coherence and , on longer time scales , thermalization of the reduced density matrix .	We point out that the physics of decoherence is well described by classical statistical field theory .
0	In this work we study drawdowns and drawups of general diffusion processes .	The drawdown process is defined as the current drop of the process from its running maximum , while the drawup process is defined as the current increase over its running minimum .	The drawdown and the drawup are the first hitting times of the drawdown and the drawup processes respectively .	In particular , we derive a closed-form formula for the Laplace transform of the probability density of the drawdown of a units when it precedes the drawup of b units .	We then separately consider the special case of drifted Brownian motion , for which we derive a closed form formula for the above-mentioned density by inverting the Laplace transform .
2	This review summarizes the major nucleosynthesis results obtained with INTEGRAL so far .	Since its launch in October 2002 , ESA 's INTEGRAL observatory has enabled significant advances to be made in the study of Galactic nucleosynthesis .	In particular , the imaging Ge spectrometer SPI combines for the first time the diagnostic powers of high resolution gamma-ray line spectroscopy and moderate spatial resolution .	Positron annihilation in our Galaxy is being studied in unprecented detail .	SPI observations yield the first sky maps in both the 511 keV annihilation line and the positronium continuum emission , and the most accurate spectrum at 511 keV to date , thereby imposing new constraints on the source ( s ) of Galactic positrons which still remain ( s ) unidentified .
1	\textbf { 104 } , 062604 ( 2014 ) ] .	A superconducting qubit device suitable for interacting with a flying electron has recently been proposed [ H. Okamoto and Y. Nagatani , Appl.Phys.Lett .	Either a clockwise or counter clockwise directed loop of half magnetic flux quantum encodes a qubit , which naturally interacts with any single charged particle with arbitrary kinetic energy .	Here , the device 's properties , sources of errors and possible applications are studied in detail .	In particular , applications include detection of a charged particle without applying a force to it .
0	We analyze the asymptotic properties of a Euclidean optimization problem on the plane .	Specifically , we consider a network with three bins and $ n $ objects spatially uniformly distributed , each object being allocated to a bin at a cost depending on its position .	Two allocations are considered : the allocation minimizing the bin loads and the allocation allocating each object to its less costly bin .	We analyze the asymptotic properties of these allocations as the number of objects grows to infinity .	Using the symmetries of the problem , we derive a law of large numbers , a central limit theorem and a large deviation principle for both loads with explicit expressions .
1	To determine the accuracy of precision tracking programs in electric and magnetic rings , a variety of analytical estimates of particle and spin dynamics in the rings were developed and compared to the numerical results of tracking simulations .	A set of analytical benchmarks for tracking programs is required for precision storage ring experiments .	Initial discrepancies in the comparisons indicated the need for improvement of several of the analytical estimates .	As an example , we found that the fourth-order Runge-Kutta/Predictor-Corrector method was slow but accurate , and that it passed all the benchmarks it was tested against , often to the sub-part per billion level .	Thus , high precision analytical estimates and tracking programs based on fourth-order Runge-Kutta/Predictor-Corrector integration can be used to benchmark faster tracking programs for accuracy .
4	For the specific choice of a spatially fixed three -- phase contact line , the asymptotic behavior of the fluctuation -- induced force is determined analytically for both the close -- distance and the long -- distance regime and compared to numerical solutions .	For partially wetting , ellipsoidal colloids trapped at a fluid interface , their effective , interface -- mediated interactions of capillary and fluctuation -- induced type are analyzed .	For contact angles different from 90 $ ^o $ , static interface deformations arise which lead to anisotropic capillary forces that are substantial already for micrometer -- sized particles .	The capillary problem is solved using an efficient perturbative treatment which allows a fast determination of the capillary interaction for all distances between and orientations of two particles .	Besides static capillary forces , fluctuation -- induced forces caused by thermally excited capillary waves arise at fluid interfaces .
4	We then narrow down the vast parameter space by considering the pre-explosion survivability of such a clump as well as the cross-section necessary for sufficient enrichment .	We investigate the enrichment of the pre-solar cloud core with short lived radionuclides ( SLRs ) , especially 26Al .	The homogeneity and the surprisingly small spread in the ratio 26Al/27Al observed in the overwhelming majority of calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions ( CAIs ) in a vast variety of primitive chondritic meteorites places strong constraints on the formation of the the solar system .	Freshly synthesized radioactive 26Al has to be included and well mixed within 20kyr .	After discussing various scenarios including X-winds , AGB stars and Wolf-Rayet stars , we come to the conclusion that triggering the collapse of a cold cloud core by a nearby supernova is the most promising scenario .
4	Model fits to the O V , Si IV , and He II line profiles agree with this result , but fits to the N V lines suggest that the receding side of the disk is brighter .	The UV emission lines of Hercules X-1 , resolved with the HST GHRS and STIS , can be divided into broad ( FWHM 750 km/s ) and narrow ( FWHM 150 km/s ) components .	The broad lines can be unambiguously identified with emission from an accretion disk which rotates prograde with the orbit .	The narrow lines , previously identified with the X-ray illuminated atmosphere of the companion star , are blueshifted at both phi=0.2 and phi=0.8 and the line flux at phi=0.2 is 0.2 of the flux at phi=0.8 .	Line ratio diagnostics show that the density of the narrow line region is log n=13.4+/-0.2 and the temperature is T=1.0+/-0.2x10^5 K. The symmetry of the eclipse ingress suggests that the line emission on the surface of the disk is left-right symmetric relative to the orbit .
4	Two new detections are reported : a kilomaser with an isotropic luminosity L_H2O ~5 solar luminosities in NGC3620 and a maser with about twice this luminosity in the merger system NGC3256 .	Recently , a relationship between the water maser detection rate and far infrared ( FIR ) flux densities has been established as a result of two 22 GHz maser surveys in a complete sample of galaxies ( Dec & gt ; -30 degree ) with 100 micron flux densities of & gt ; 50 Jy and & gt ; 30 Jy .	This survey has been extended to the southern galaxies in order to discover new maser sources and to investigate the galaxies hosting the maser spots with particular emphasis on their nuclear regions .	A sample of 12 galaxies with Dec & lt ; -30 degree and S ( 100 micron ) & gt ; 50 Jy was observed with the 70-m telescope of the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex ( CDSCC ) at Tidbinbilla ( Australia ) in a search for water maser emission .	The average 3 sigma noise level of the survey is 15 mJy for a 0.42 km/s channel , corresponding to a detection threshold of ~0.1 solar luminosities for the isotropic maser luminosity at a distance of 25 Mpc .
3	If the correlation length diverges , so do the estimators .	We consider bipartitions of one-dimensional extended systems whose probability distribution functions describe stationary states of stochastic models .	We define estimators of the shared information between the two subsystems .	If the correlation length is finite , the estimators stay finite for large system sizes .	The definition of the estimators is inspired by information theory .
3	The method leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags .	Without requiring objects to carry any transceiver , device-free based object tracking provides a promising solution for many localization and tracking systems to monitor non-cooperative objects such as intruders .	However , existing device-free solutions mainly use sensors and active RFID tags , which are much more expensive compared to passive tags .	In this paper , we propose a novel motion detection and tracking method using passive RFID tags , named Twins .	We contribute to both theory and practice of such phenomenon by presenting a new interference model that perfectly explains this phenomenon and using extensive experiments to validate it .
4	We also explain why the GTR-model is needed if one wants to deal , in a fully consistent way , with response replicability and unpacking effects .	The research on human cognition has recently benefited from the use of the mathematical formalism of quantum theory in Hilbert space .	However , cognitive situations exist which indicate that the Hilbert space structure , and the associated Born rule , would be insufficient to provide a satisfactory modeling of the collected data , so that one needs to go beyond Hilbert space .	In Part I of this paper we follow this direction and present a general tension-reduction ( GTR ) model , in the ambit of an operational and realistic framework for human cognition .	In this Part II we apply this non-Hilbertian quantum-like model to faithfully reproduce the probabilities of the 'Clinton/Gore ' and 'Rose/Jackson ' experiments on question order effects .
1	The equations governing the orientation of spinning , precessing grains are derived ; H_2 formation torques and paramagnetic dissipation are included in the dynamics .	Radiative torques on irregular dust grains , in addition to producing superthermal rotation , play a direct dynamical role in the alignment of interstellar dust with the local magnetic field .	Stationary solutions ( constant alignment angle and spin rate ) are found ; these solutions may be stable ( `` attractors '' ) or unstable ( `` repellors '' ) .	The equations of motion are numerically integrated for three exemplary irregular grain geometries , exposed to anisotropic radiation with the spectrum of interstellar starlight .	The resulting `` trajectory maps '' are classified as `` noncyclic '' , `` semicyclic '' , or `` cyclic '' , with examples of each given .
2	For detection , the molecules are converted back into atoms , again using the Feshbach resonance .	Molecules are created from a Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic 87Rb using a Feshbach resonance .	A Stern-Gerlach field is applied , in order to spatially separate the molecules from the remaining atoms .	The measured position of the molecules yields their magnetic moment .	This quantity strongly depends on the magnetic field , thus revealing an avoided crossing of two bound states at a field value slightly below the Feshbach resonance .
1	Since new processes are constantly being discovered , biophysical neuron models increasingly become `` too complex to be useful '' yet `` too simple to be realistic '' .	Cortical neurons include many sub-cellular processes , operating at multiple timescales , which may affect their response to stimulation through non-linear and stochastic interaction with ion channels and ionic concentrations .	A fundamental open question in theoretical neuroscience pertains to how this deadlock may be resolved .	In order to tackle this problem , we first define the notion of a `` excitable neuron model '' .	Then we analytically derive the input-output relation of such neuronal models , relating input spike trains to output spikes based on known biophysical properties .
1	In this study , we focus on the Two Higgs Doublet Model with a low energy spectrum containing scalars $ H $ and a pseudoscalar $ A $ .	Models of electroweak symmetry breaking with extended Higgs sectors are theoretically well motivated .	We study the decays $ A\rightarrow HZ $ or $ H\rightarrow AZ $ , which could reach sizable branching fractions in certain parameter regions .	With detailed collider analysis , we obtain model independent exclusion bounds as well as discovery reach at the 14 TeV LHC for the process : $ gg\rightarrow A/H\rightarrow HZ/AZ $ , looking at final states bbll , \tau\tau ll and ZZZ ( 4l2j ) for l =e , \mu .	We further interpret these bounds in the context of the Type II Two Higgs Doublet Model , considering three different classes of processes : $ A\rightarrow h^0Z $ , $ A\rightarrow H^0Z $ , and $ H^0 \rightarrow AZ $ , in which $ h^0 $ and $ H^0 $ are the light and heavy CP-even Higgses respectively .
4	The components of the deviating eigenvectors are found to correspond to distinct groups of strategies that are applied by hedge fund managers .	The proprietary nature of Hedge Fund investing means that it is common practise for managers to release minimal information about their returns .	The construction of a Fund of Hedge Funds portfolio requires a correlation matrix which often has to be estimated using a relatively small sample of monthly returns data which induces noise .	In this paper random matrix theory ( RMT ) is applied to a cross-correlation matrix C , constructed using hedge fund returns data .	The analysis reveals a number of eigenvalues that deviate from the spectrum suggested by RMT .
4	So far this was only possible on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis using by-eye analysis of candidate photodissociation regions .	Using a simple model of photodissociated atomic hydrogen on a galactic scale , it is possible to derive total hydrogen volume densities .	These densities , obtained through a combination of atomic hydrogen , far-ultraviolet and metallicity data , provide an independent probe of the combined atomic and molecular hydrogen gas in galactic disks .	We present a new , flexible and fully automated procedure using this simple model .	This automated method will allow us to take full advantage of a host of available data on galaxies in order to calculate total hydrogen volume densities of giant molecular clouds surrounding sites of recent star formation .
0	We analyze the time-like processes gamma gamma - & gt ; B Bbar and p p-bar - & gt ; gamma M at large Mandelstam variables within the handbag approach for which the process amplitudes factorize in hard partonic subprocesses and annihilation form factor .	The latter represent moments of baryon-antibaryon generalized parton distributions .	Symmetry relations restrict the number of independent annihilation form factors for the ground state baryons drastically .	We determine these form factors from the present BELLE data on gamma gamma - & gt ; B Bbar with the help of simplifying assumptions .	The knowledge of these form factors allow for predictions of p pbar - & gt ; gamma M for various mesons which may be probed at FAIR .
1	Exchange of information among processes in such a multiprocessor necessitates costly memory accesses called \emph { remote memory references } ( RMRs ) , which generate communication on the interconnect joining processors and main memory .	We consider asynchronous multiprocessor systems where processes communicate by accessing shared memory .	In this paper we compare two popular shared memory architecture models , namely the \emph { cache-coherent } ( CC ) and \emph { distributed shared memory } ( DSM ) models , in terms of their power for solving synchronization problems efficiently with respect to RMRs .	The particular problem we consider entails one process sending a `` signal '' to a subset of other processes .	We show that a variant of this problem can be solved very efficiently with respect to RMRs in the CC model , but not so in the DSM model , even when we consider amortized RMR complexity .
0	Novel techniques are presented , which identify the chiral power-counting regime ( PCR ) , and realize the existence of an intrinsic energy scale embedded in lattice QCD results that extend outside the PCR .	The nucleon mass is considered as a benchmark for illustrating this new approach .	Using finite-range regularization , an optimal regularization scale can be extracted from lattice simulation results by analyzing the renormalization of the low energy coefficients .	The optimal scale allows a description of lattice simulation results that extend beyond the PCR by quantifying and thus handling any scheme-dependence .	Preliminary results for the nucleon magnetic moment are also examined , and a consistent optimal regularization scale is obtained .
3	We characterize two mesogranular-scale exploding granules where $ \sim $ 10 $ ^ { 18 } $ Mx of magnetic flux emerges .	We report on magnetic field emergences covering significant areas of exploding granules .	The balloon-borne mission SUNRISE provided high spatial and temporal resolution images of the solar photosphere .	Continuum images , longitudinal and transverse magnetic field maps and Dopplergrams obtained by IMaX onboard SUNRISE are analyzed by Local Correlation Traking ( LCT ) , divergence calculation and time slices , Stokes inversions and numerical simulations are also employed .	The emergence of weak unipolar longitudinal fields ( $ \sim $ 100 G ) start with a single visible magnetic polarity , occupying their respective granules ' top and following the granular splitting .
0	Atmospheric neutrino experiments can determine the neutrino mass hierarchy for any value of $ \delta_ { CP } $ .	The Iron Calorimeter ( ICAL ) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory can distinguish between the charged current interactions of $ \nu_\mu $ and $ \bar { \nu } _\mu $ by determining the charge of the produced muon .	Hence it is particularly well suited to determine the hierarchy .	The hierarchy signature is more prominent in neutrinos with energy of a few GeV and with pathlength of a few thousand kilometers , $ \textit { i.e . } $ neutrinos whose direction is not close to horizontal .	We use adaptive neural networks to identify such events with good efficiency and good purity .
0	We study the two-point function for the gauge boson in the axial-type gauges .	We use the exact treatment of the axial gauges recently proposed that is intrinsically compatible with the Lorentz type gauges in the path-integral formulation and has been arrived at from this connection and which is a `` one-vector '' treatment .	We find that in this treatment , we can evaluate the two-point functions without imposing any additional interpretation on the axial gauge 1/ ( n.q ) ^p-type poles .	The calculations are as easy as the other treatments based on other known prescriptions .	Unlike the `` uniform-prescription '' /L-M prescription , we note , here , the absence of any non-local divergences in the 2-point proper vertex .
0	Recently attention has been drawn to practical problems with the use of unbounded Pareto distributions , for instance when there are natural upper bounds that truncate the probability tail .	Aban , Meerschaert and Panorska ( 2006 ) derived the maximum likelihood estimator for the Pareto tail index of a truncated Pareto distribution with a right truncation point $ T $ .	The Hill ( 1975 ) estimator is then obtained by letting $ T \to \infty $ .	The problem of extreme value estimation under right truncation was also introduced in Nuyts ( 2010 ) who proposed a similar estimator for the tail index and considered trimming of the number of extreme order statistics .	Given that in practice one does not always know whether the distribution is truncated or not , we discuss estimators for the Pareto index and extreme quantiles both under truncated and non-truncated Pareto-type distributions .
3	If in addition a long range attraction between the particles is included , the usual liquid-gas coexistence curve with its critical point is obtained .	We study the phase diagram of a system of spherical particles interacting in three dimensions through a potential consisting of a strict hard core plus a linear repulsive shoulder at larger distances .	The phase diagram ( obtained numerically , and analytically in a limiting case ) shows anomalous properties that are similar to those observed in water .	Specifically , we find maxima of density and isothermal compressibility as a function of temperature , melting with volume contraction , and multiple stable crystalline structures .	But more interestingly , a first order line in the metastable fluid branch of the phase diagram appears , ending in a new critical point , as it was suggested to occur in water .
1	In order to fully exploit the computational power of the GPU , we choose a method of solution which combines a finite difference discretization of the free-streaming term with a Monte Carlo evaluation of the collision integral .	We show how to accelerate the direct solution of the Boltzmann equation using Graphics Processing Units ( GPUs ) .	The efficiency of the code is demonstrated by solving the two-dimensional driven cavity flow .	Computational results show that it is possible to cut down the computing time of the sequential code of two order of magnitudes .	This makes the proposed method of solution a viable alternative to particle simulations for studying unsteady low Mach number flows .
0	The idea of design domain specific Mother Model of IP block family as a base of modeling of system integration is presented here .	A common reconfigurable Mother Model for ten different standardized digital OFDM transmitters has been developed .	By means of a set of parameters , the mother model can be reconfigured to any of the ten selected standards .	So far the applicability of the proposed reconfiguration and analog-digital co-modeling methods have been proved by modeling the function of the digital parts of three , 802.11a , ADSL and DRM , transmitters in an RF system simulator .	The model is intended to be used as signal source template in RF system simulations .
0	We validate the application of our recent orbital-free density functional theory ( DFT ) approach , [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	113 , 155006 ( 2014 ) ] , for the calculation of ionic and electronic transport properties of dense plasmas .	To this end , we calculate the self-diffusion coefficient , the viscosity coefficient , the electrical and thermal conductivities , and the reflectivity coefficient of hydrogen and aluminum plasmas .	Very good agreement is found with orbital-based Kohn-Sham DFT calculations at lower temperatures .	Because the method does not scale with temperature , we can produce results at much higher temperatures than is accessible by the Kohn-Sham method .
0	Chromospheric flare ribbons observed in H-alpha appear well-organized when first examined : ribbons impulsively brighten , morphologically evolve , and exponentially decay back to pre-flare levels .	Upon closer inspection of H-alpha flares , there is often a significant number of compact areas brightening in concert with the flare eruption but are spatially separated from the evolving flare ribbon .	One class of these brightenings is known as sequential chromospheric brightenings ( SCBs ) .	SCBs are often observed in the intimidate vicinity of erupting flares and are associated with coronal mass ejections .	In the past decade there have been several previous investigations of SCBs .

0	We reconsider the role of pre-main sequence ( pre-MS ) Li depletion on the basis of new observational and theoretical evidence : i ) new observations of Halpha emissions in young clusters show that mass accretion could be continuing till the first stages of the MS , ii ) theoretical implications from helioseismology suggest large overshooting values below the bottom of the convective envelopes .	We argue here that a significant pre-MS 7Li destruction , caused by efficient overshoot mixing , could be followed by a matter accretion after 7Li depletion has ceased on MS thus restoring Li almost to the pristine value .	As a test case we show that a halo dwarf of 0.85 Msun with an extended overshooting envelope starting with an initial abundance of A ( Li ) = 2.74 would burn Li completely , but an accretion rate of the type 1e-8xe^ { -t/3e6 } Msun yr $ ^ { -1 } $ would restore Li to end with an A ( Li ) = 2.31 .	A self-regulating process is required to produce similar final values in a range of different stellar masses to explain the PopII Spite plateau .	However , this framework could explain why open cluster stars have lower Li abundances than the pre-solar nebula , the absence of Li in the most metal poor dwarfs and a number of other features which lack of a satisfactory explanation .
0	The gap in bilayer graphene ( BLG ) can directly be controlled by a perpendicular electric field .	By tuning the field through zero at a finite rate in neutral BLG , excited states are produced .	Due to screening , the resulting dynamics is determined by coupled non-linear Landau-Zener models .	The generated defect density agrees with Kibble-Zurek theory in the presence of subleading logarithmic corrections .	After the quench , population inversion occurs for wavevectors close to the Dirac point .
0	A Bethe ansatz equation associated with the Lie superalgebra osp ( 1|2s ) is studied .	A thermodynamic Bethe ansatz ( TBA ) equation is derived by the string hypothesis .	The high temperature limit of the entropy density is expressed in terms of the solution of the osp ( 1|2s ) version of the Q-system .	In particular for fundamental representation case , we also derive a TBA equation from the osp ( 1|2s ) version of the T-system and the quantum transfer matrix method .	This TBA equation is identical to the one from the string hypothesis .
3	In the broadband double power-law fits , for a typical Fermi spectrum of a bright \gamma-ray pulsar , most of the errors accumulate due to the arbitrary parametrization of the spectral roll-off .	We reanalyze the Fermi spectra of the Geminga and Vela pulsars .	We find that the spectrum of Geminga above the break is exceptionally well approximated by a simple power law without the exponential cut-off , making Geminga 's spectrum similar to that of Crab .	Vela 's broadband gamma-ray spectrum is equally well fit with both the exponential cut-off and the double power law shapes .	In addition , a power law with an exponential cut-off gives an acceptable fit for the underlying double power-law spectrum for a very broad range of parameters , making such fitting procedures insensitive to the underlying Fermi photon spectrum .
1	This paper describes the observations , reductions and measurements , and data products from the spectroscopic campaign .	In the Spring of 2011 we carried out a 2.5 month reverberation mapping campaign using the 3 m Shane telescope at Lick Observatory , monitoring 15 low-redshift Seyfert 1 galaxies .	The reduced spectra were fitted with a multicomponent model in order to isolate the contributions of various continuum and emission-line components .	We present light curves of broad emission lines and the AGN continuum , and measurements of the broad H-beta line widths in mean and root-mean square ( rms ) spectra .	For the most highly variable AGNs we also measured broad H-beta line widths and velocity centroids from the nightly spectra .
3	We present the construction , the convergence analysis , and the numerical implementation of the method .	In this paper , we present a three-point without memory iterative method based on Kung and Traub 's method for solving non-linear equations in one variable .	The proposed method has eighth-order convergence and costs only four function evaluations each iteration which supports the Kung-Traub conjecture on the optimal order of convergence .	Consequently , this method possesses very high computational efficiency .	Furthermore , comparisons with some other existing optimal eighth-order methods concerning accuracy and basins of attraction for several test problems will be given .
4	A Lindemann criterion shows that the reduction of dimensionality causes a finite periodic chain of these defects to readily melt as the temperature is raised .	We report Monte Carlo studies of a two-dimensional soft colloidal crystal confined in a strip geometry by parallel walls .	The wall-particle interaction has corrugations along the length of the strip .	Compressing the crystal by decreasing the distance between the walls induces a structural transition characterized by the sudden appearance of a one-dimensional array of extended defects each of which span several lattice parameters , a `` soliton staircase '' .	We obtain the effective interaction between these defects .
2	In order to solve this model we employ the optimized effective potential method and treat the correlation interactions in the random phase approximation .	In attempt to explore half-metallic properties of the double perovskites Sr2-xYxVMoO6 and Sr2-xYxVTcO6 , we construct an effective low-energy model , which describes the behavior of the t2g-states of these compounds .	All parameters of such model are derived rigorously on the basis of first-principles electronic structure calculations .	Although correlation interactions considerably reduce the intraatomic exchange splitting in comparison with the Hartree-Fock method , this splitting still substantially exceeds the typical values obtained in the local-spin-density approximation ( LSDA ) , which alters many predictions based on the LSDA .	Our main results are summarized as follows : ( i ) all ferromagnetic states are expected to be half-metallic .
3	However , we exhibit natural orthonormal bases for the matrices such that this map is an order isomorphism , but not a complete order isomorphism .	The dual of a matrix ordered space has a natural matrix ordering that makes the dual space matrix ordered as well .	The purpose of these notes is to give a condition that describes when the linear map taking a basis of the n by n matrices to its dual basis is a complete order isomorphism and complete co-order isomorphism .	In the case of the standard matrix units this map is a complete order isomorphism and this is a restatement of the correspondence between completely positive maps and the Choi matrix .	Some bases yield complete co-order isomorphisms .
1	However , conventional metals as plasmonic elements in the near-infrared ( NIR ) and visible spectral ranges suffer from problems such as large losses and incompatibility with semiconductor technology .	Plasmonics has conventionally been in the realm of metal-optics .	Replacing metals with semiconductors can alleviate these problems if only semiconductors could exhibit negative real permittivity .	Aluminum doped zinc oxide ( AZO ) is a low loss semiconductor that can show negative real permittivity in the NIR .	A comparative assessment of AZO-based plasmonic devices such as superlens and hyperlens with their metal-based counterparts shows that AZO-based devices significantly outperform at a wavelength of 1.55 um .
0	This paper is concerned with stochastic processes that model multiple ( or iterated ) scattering in classical mechanical systems of billiard type , defined below .	From a given ( deterministic ) system of billiard type , a random process with transition probabilities operator P is introduced by assuming that some of the dynamical variables are random with prescribed probability distributions .	Of particular interest are systems with weak scattering , which are associated to parametric families of operators P_h , depending on a geometric or mechanical parameter h , that approaches the identity as h goes to 0 .	It is shown that ( P_h -I ) /h converges for small h to a second order elliptic differential operator L on compactly supported functions and that the Markov chain process associated to P_h converges to a diffusion with infinitesimal generator L. Both P_h and L are selfadjoint ( densely ) defined on the space L2 ( H , { \eta } ) of square-integrable functions over the ( lower ) half-space H in R^m , where { \eta } is a stationary measure .	This measure 's density is either ( post-collision ) Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution or Knudsen cosine law , and the random processes with infinitesimal generator L respectively correspond to what we call MB diffusion and ( generalized ) Legendre diffusion .
1	We briefly discuss the issues of gauge fixing , BRS invariance and positivity .	Recent studies of QCD Green 's functions and their applications in hadronic physics are reviewed .	Evidence for the violation of positivity by quarks and transverse gluons in the covariant gauge is collected , and it is argued that this is one manifestation of confinement .	We summarise the derivation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations ( DSEs ) of QED and QCD .	The influence of instantons on DSEs in a 2-dimensional model is mentioned .
0	The interaction of a free-electron-laser pulse with a moderate or large size cluster is known to create a quasi-neutral nanoplasma , which then expands on hydrodynamic timescale , i.e. , $ & gt ; 1 $ ps .	To have a better understanding of ion and electron data from experiments derived from laser-irradiated clusters , one needs to simulate cluster dynamics on such long timescales for which the molecular dynamics approach becomes inefficient .	We therefore propose a two-step Molecular Dynamics-Hydrodynamic scheme .	In the first step we use molecular dynamics code to follow the dynamics of an irradiated cluster until all the photo-excitation and corresponding relaxation processes are finished and a nanoplasma , consisting of ground-state ions and thermalized electrons , is formed .	In the second step we perform long-timescale propagation of this nanoplasma with a computationally efficient hydrodynamic approach .
4	The corresponding reference state of this expansion corresponds to the solution derived in the ( pure ) shear flow problem .	The Boltzmann equation for inelastic Maxwell models is used to analyze nonlinear transport in a granular binary mixture in the steady simple shear flow .	Two different transport processes are studied .	First , the rheological properties ( shear and normal stresses ) are obtained by solving exactly the velocity moment equations .	Second , the diffusion tensor of impurities immersed in a sheared inelastic Maxwell gas is explicitly determined from a perturbation solution through first order in the concentration gradient .
4	A hybrid magnetic resonance mode due to plasmon-phonon coupling is also discussed .	In this work , we report the design of a wavelength-tunable infrared metamaterial by exciting magnetic resonance with phase transition of vanadium dioxide ( VO2 ) .	Numerical simulation shows a broad absorption peak at the wavelength of 10.9 um when VO2 is a metal , but it shifts to 15.1 um when VO2 changes to dielectric phase below its phase transition temperature of 68degC .	The large tunability of 38.5 % in the resonance wavelength stems from the different excitation conditions of magnetic resonance assisted by plasmon in metallic VO2 but optical phonons in dielectric VO2 .	The physical mechanism is elucidated with the aid of electromagnetic field distribution at the resonance wavelengths .
4	We also discuss the extension in higher dimension .	In this paper , we present a new solution of the vacuum Einstein equations in five dimensions which is a static black hole with hyperscaling violation and with a three-dimensional horizon modeled by one the eight Thurston geometries , namely the Nil geometry .	This homogeneous geometry is non-trivial in the sense that it is neither of constant curvature nor a product of constant curvature manifolds .	Using the Hamiltonian formalism , we identify the mass and entropy of the black hole solution .	Curiously enough , in spite of the fact that the entropy turns to be negative , the mass is positive and the first law of thermodynamics holds .
2	Second , any steady transonic shock solution with the supersonic background charge is proved to be dynamically and exponentially stable with respect to small perturbation of the initial data , provided the electric field is not too negative at the shock location .	In this paper , both structural and dynamical stabilities of steady transonic shock solutions for one-dimensional Euler-Poission system are investigated .	First , a steady transonic shock solution with supersonic backgroumd charge is shown to be structurally stable with respect to small perturbations of the background charge , provided that the electric field is positive at the shock location .	The proof of the first stability result relies on a monotonicity argument for the shock position and the downstream density , and a stability analysis for subsonic and supersonic solutions .	The dynamical stability of the steady transonic shock for the Euler-Poisson equations can be transformed to the global well-posedness of a free boundary problem for a quasilinear second order equation with nonlinear boundary conditions .
4	The semiempirical method of the description of the period of essential formation of new phase embryos on the heterogeneous centers of some sort is given .	A system of a metastable phase with several sorts of the heterogeneous centers is considered .	An analytical theory for the process of condensation in such a system is constructed in dynamic conditions .	The free energy of formation of the critical embryo is assumed to be known in the macroscopic approach as well as the energy of solvatation .	The recurrent procedure of the establishing of the characteristic times and lengths is presented .
3	Microinstabilities influence plasma confinement and will play a role in determining the evolution of the profiles in pellet fuelled plasmas .	Reactor grade plasmas are likely to be fuelled by pellet injection .	This technique transiently perturbs the profiles , driving the density profile hollow and flattening the edge temperature profile .	After the pellet perturbation , the density and temperature profiles relax towards their quasi-steady-state shape .	In this paper we present the microstability analysis of pellet fuelled H-mode MAST plasmas .
0	Weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) remain a prime candidate for the cosmological dark matter ( DM ) , even in the absence of current collider signals that would unambiguously point to new physics below the TeV scale .	The self-annihilation of these particles in astronomical targets may leave observable imprints in cosmic rays of various kinds .	In this review , we focus on gamma rays which we argue to play a pronounced role among the various possible messengers .	We discuss the most promising spectral and spatial signatures to look for , give an update on the current state of gamma-ray searches for DM and an outlook concerning future prospects .	We also assess in some detail the implications of a potential signal identification for particle DM models as well as for our understanding of structure formation .
1	Charge and lattice excitations are detected after a particle scatters in a Ge or Si crystal kept at ~30 mK , allowing to separate nuclear recoils from the dominating electromagnetic background .	The CDMS experiment aims to directly detect massive , cold dark matter particles originating from the Milky Way halo .	The operation of 12 detectors in the Soudan mine for 75 live days in 2004 delivered no evidence for a signal , yielding stringent limits on dark matter candidates from supersymmetry and universal extra dimensions .	Thirty Ge and Si detectors are presently installed in the Soudan cryostat , and operating at base temperature .	The run scheduled to start in 2006 is expected to yield a one order of magnitude increase in dark matter sensitivity .
4	Furthermore , we show numerically that all the results are universal for the d=3 conformal field theory , the non-relativistic scale-invariant theory and the dual theory of Gauss-Bonnet gravity .	We study the holographic entanglement entropy in a homogeneous falling shell background , which is dual to the strongly coupled field theory following a global quench .	For d=2 conformal field theories , it is known that the entropy has a linear growth regime if the scale of the entangling region is large .	In addition , the growth rate approaches a constant when the scale increases .	We demonstrate analytically that this behavior is directly related to the part of minimal area surface probing the interior of apparent horizons in the bulk , as well as the mutual information between two disjoint rectangular subsystems in the boundary .
2	The grain size ranges from 0.001 mm to 10 m for the low resolution ( ~25 000 SPH particles ) simulations and from 0.1 mm to 10 cm for the high resolution ( ~160 000 SPH particles ) simulations .	We present the results of a three dimensional , locally isothermal , non-self-gravitating SPH code which models protoplanetary disks with two fluids : gas and dust .	We ran simulations of a 1 Msun star surrounded by a 0.01 Msun disk comprising 99 % gas and 1 % dust in mass and extending from 0.5 to ~300 AU .	Dust grains are slowed down by the sub-Keplerian gas and lose angular momentum , forcing them to migrate towards the central star and settle to the midplane .	The gas drag efficiency varies according to the grain size , with the larger bodies being weakly influenced and following marginally perturbed Keplerian orbits , while smaller grains are strongly coupled to the gas .

Around the homoclinic tube , Bernoulli shift dynamics of submanifolds is established through shadowing lemma .	This work removes an uncheckable condition of Silnikov [ Equation ( 11 ) , page 625 of L. P. Silnikov , Soviet Math .
4	The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the snr value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated .	In this paper , the bit energy requirements of training-based transmission over block Rayleigh fading channels are studied .	Pilot signals are employed to obtain the minimum mean-square-error ( MMSE ) estimate of the channel fading coefficients .	Energy efficiency is analyzed in the worst case scenario where the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect and the error in the estimate is considered as another source of additive Gaussian noise .	It is shown that bit energy requirement grows without bound as the snr goes to zero , and the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero snr value below which one should not operate .
1	This model describes , in particular , a dynamics of a cold ion trapped in a linear ion trap and interacting with two lasers fields with close frequencies .	Classical and quantum dynamics of a harmonic oscillator in a monochromatic wave is studied in the exact resonance and near resonance cases .	Analytically and numerically a stability of the `` classical ground state '' ( CGS ) -- the vicinity of the point ( $ x=0 , p=0 $ ) -- is analyzed .	In the quantum case , the method for studying a stability of the quantum ground state ( QGS ) is suggested , based on the quasienergy representation .	The dynamics depends on four parameters : the detuning from the resonance , $ \delta=\ell-\Omega/\omega $ , where $ \Omega $ and $ \omega $ are , respectively , the wave and the oscillator 's frequencies ; the positive integer ( resonance ) number , $ \ell $ ; the dimensionless Planck constant , $ h $ , and the dimensionless wave amplitude , $ \epsilon $ .
3	This is our goal .	The majority of the approaches to the automatic recovery of a panoramic image from a set of partial views are suboptimal in the sense that the input images are aligned , or registered , pair by pair , e.g. , consecutive frames of a video clip .	These approaches lead to propagation errors that may be very severe , particularly when dealing with videos that show the same region at disjoint time intervals .	Although some authors have proposed a post-processing step to reduce the registration errors in these situations , there have not been attempts to compute the optimal solution , i.e. , the registrations leading to the panorama that best matches the entire set of partial views } .	In this paper , we use a generative model for the partial views of the panorama and develop an algorithm to compute in an efficient way the Maximum Likelihood estimate of all the unknowns involved : the parameters describing the alignment of all the images and the panorama itself .
2	This paper proposes two new test procedures based on standard OLS residuals .	Testing heteroscedasticity of the errors is a major challenge in high-dimensional regressions where the number of covariates is large compared to the sample size .	Traditional procedures such as the White and the Breusch-Pagan tests typically suffer from low sizes and powers .	Using the theory of random Haar orthogonal matrices , the asymptotic normality of both test statistics is obtained under the null when the degree of freedom tends to infinity .	This encompasses both the classical low-dimensional setting where the number of variables is fixed while the sample size tends to infinity , and the proportional high-dimensional setting where these dimensions grow to infinity proportionally .
4	The additional phonon peaks at multiples of the phonon frequency $ \w_0 $ correspond to additional maxima in the differential conductance .	We use the recently proposed scattering states numerical renormalization group ( SNRG ) approach to calculate $ I ( V ) $ and the differential conductance through a single molecular level coupled to a local molecular phonon .	We also discuss the equilibrium physics of the model and demonstrate that the low-energy Hamiltonian is given by an effective interacting resonant level model .	From the NRG level flow , we directly extract the effective charge transfer scale $ \Gamma_ { \rm eff } $ and the dynamically induced capacitive coupling $ U_ { \rm eff } $ between the molecular level and the lead electrons which turns out to be proportional to the polaronic energy shift $ E_p $ for the regimes investigated here .	The equilibrium spectral functions for the different parameter regimes are discussed .
1	Focusing mainly on the presence of CO2 , firstly we resolve the airflow equations for two typical validation cases , the Rao case and the IEA case .	The aim of this work is to simulate the pollutants transport in buildings .	These numerical results are compared to the most known software and they are used to evaluate of the evolution of CO2 concentration in the different rooms .	In order to obtain the different parameters and filters of the proposed model we use a statistical method based on Bayesian inference .	The final comparison of results is coherent but a complementary experimental procedure is necessary to calibrate and refine the model
3	We also identify cases in which the DMT region of the ICR corresponds to that of two parallel slow fading relay channels , implying that interference does not decrease the DMT for each pair , and that a single relay can be DMT-optimal for two pairs simultaneously .	We study the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff ( DMT ) for the slow fading interference channel with a relay ( ICR ) .	We derive four inner bounds on the DMT region : the first is based on the compress-and-forward ( CF ) relaying scheme , the second is based on the decode-and-forward ( DF ) relaying scheme , and the last two bounds are based on the half-duplex ( HD ) and full-duplex ( FD ) amplify-and-forward ( AF ) schemes .	For the CF and DF schemes , we find conditions on the channel parameters and the multiplexing gains , under which the corresponding inner bound achieves the optimal DMT region .	For the HD-AF scheme we derive conditions on the channel coefficients under which the proposed scheme achieves the optimal DMT for the AF-based relay channel .
4	For the memoryless binary erasure channel , we consider the decoding of spatially coupled codes through a windowed decoder that aims to retain many of the attractive features of belief propagation , while trying to reduce complexity further .	Spatially coupled codes have been of interest recently owing to their superior performance over memoryless binary-input channels .	The performance is good both asymptotically , since the belief propagation thresholds approach capacity , as well as for finite lengths , since degree-2 variables that result in high error floors can be completely avoided .	However , to realize the promised good performance , one needs large blocklengths .	This in turn implies a large latency and decoding complexity .
2	However , we show here that such tilt is not necessary .	The general methodology of binary switching requires tilting of potential landscape along the desired direction of switching .	The tilt generates a torque along the direction of switching and the degree of tilt should be sufficient enough to beat thermal agitations with a tolerable error probability .	Considering the full three-dimensional motion , we point out that the built-in dynamics can facilitate switching without requiring any asymmetry in potential landscape even in the presence of thermal noise .	With experimentally feasible parameters , we theoretically demonstrate such intriguing possibility in electric field-induced magnetization switching of a magnetostrictive nanomagnet .
0	We analyze the random fluctuations of several multi-scale algorithms such as the multi-scale finite element method ( MsFEM ) and the finite element heterogeneous multiscale method ( HMM ) , that have been developed to solve partial differential equations with highly heterogeneous coefficients .	Such multi-scale algorithms are often shown to correctly capture the homogenization limit when the highly oscillatory random medium is stationary and ergodic .	This paper is concerned with the random fluctuations of the solution about the deterministic homogenization limit .	We consider the simplified setting of the one dimensional elliptic equation , where the theory of random fluctuations is well understood .	We develop a fluctuation theory for the multi-scale algorithms in the presence of random environments with short-range and long-range correlations .
0	We present a detailed numerical study of the Hubbard-Holstein model in one dimension at half filling , including full finite-frequency quantum phonons .	At half filling , the effects of the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions compete , with the Holstein phonon coupling acting as an effective negative Hubbard onsite interaction U that promotes on-site electron pairs and a Peierls charge-density wave state .	Most previous work on this model has assumed that only Peierls or U & gt ; 0 Mott insulator phases are possible at half filling .	However , there has been speculation that a third metallic phase exists between the Peierls and Mott phases .	We present results confirming the intermediate metallic phase , and show that the Luttinger liquid correlation exponent K_rho & gt ; 1 in this region , indicating dominant superconducting pair correlations .
4	The jamming transition at large $ V_ { \text { max } } $ can be viewed as the nucleation of jams in a background of freely flowing vehicles .	We examine the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model for a variety of maximum speeds .	We show that the low density limit can be described as a dilute gas of vehicles with a repulsive core .	At the transition to jamming , we observe finite-size effects in a variety of quantities describing the flow and the density correlations , but only if the maximum speed $ V_ { \text { max } } $ is larger than a certain value .	A finite-size scaling analysis of several order parameters shows universal behavior , with scaling exponents that depend on $ V_ { \text { max } } $ .
1	Since our last report in 1992 , there have been 32 additional observations , in which both images have returned to their quiescent flux density levels and the A image has brightened again .	We report on 15 years of VLA monitoring of the gravitational lens B0957+561 at 6 cm .	We estimate the time delay from the light curves using three different techniques : the chi-squared analysis of Press , Rybicki , & amp ; Hewitt ( 1992a , b ) , the dispersion analysis of Pelt et al .	( 1994 , 1996 ) , and the locally normalized discrete correlation function of Leh\'ar et al . ( 1992 ) .	Confidence intervals for these time delay estimates are found using Monte Carlo techniques .
3	This project involved writing new algorithms to analyze Kepler data , finding planets , and conducting follow-up work using ground-based telescopes .	In this thesis , I explore two topics in exoplanet science .	The first is the prevalence of Earth-size planets in the Milky Way Galaxy .	To determine the occurrence of planets having different sizes , orbital periods , and other properties , I conducted a survey of extrasolar planets using data collected by NASA 's Kepler Space Telescope .	I found that most stars have at least one planet at or within Earth 's orbit and that 26 % of Sun-like stars have an Earth-size planet with an orbital period of 100 days or less .
2	It is further demonstrated that the performance of the inversion improves ( in terms of simultaneously better averaging kernel and lower noise level ) when the two approaches are combined together in one inversion .	The consistency of time -- distance inversions for horizontal components of the plasma flow on supergranular scales in the upper solar convection zone is checked by comparing the results derived using two k -- \omega filtering procedures -- ridge filtering and phase-speed filtering -- commonly used in time -- distance helioseismology .	It is shown that both approaches result in similar flow estimates when finite-frequency sensitivity kernels are used .	Using the combined inversion I invert for horizontal flows in the upper 10 Mm of the solar convection zone .	The flows connected with supergranulation seem to be coherent only in the upper ~5 Mm depth , deeper down there is a hint on change of convection scales towards structures larger than supergranules .
1	We show that a prolate cloud oriented perpendicular to its orbital plane naturally produces a spread in angular momenta in the gas which can translate into misaligned discs as is seen in the young stars orbiting Sagittarius A* .	We follow the near radial infall of a prolate cloud onto a 4 x 10^6 Msun supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( SPH ) .	A turbulent or otherwise highly structured cloud is necessary to avoid cancelling too much angular momentum through shocks at closest approach .	Our standard model of a 2 x 10^4 Msun gas cloud brought about the formation of a disc within 0.3 pc from the black hole and a larger , misaligned streamer at 0.5 pc .	A total of 1.5 x 10^4 Msun of gas formed these structures .
2	We show that fluctuations of the magnetic field downstream of the shock do not play an important role in the acceleration process .	We present the model of cosmic rays acceleration at ultrarelativistic subshocks and confront it with the observations of gamma-ray bursts and blazars .	We investigate cosmic rays acceleration in shocks with Lorentz factors in the range 3 - 40 .	Results of numerical simulations for shocks with considered Lorentz factors and perpendicular magnetic field inclinations are presented .	We fit the derived particle energy spectral index dependence on fluctuations of the magnetic field upstream and Lorentz factor of the shock with a function .
3	The dependence of the resonances on the geometrical parameters of the grating is studied , and results of far and near field are shown .	The diffraction problem of a plane wave impinging on a grating formed by nested cavities is solved by means of the modal method , for $ s $ and $ p $ polarization modes .	The cavities are formed by perfectly conducting sheets that describe rectangular profiles .	The electromagnetic response of the grating is analyzed , paying particular attention to the generation of resonances within the structure .	The results are checked and compared with those available in the literature for certain limit cases .
4	The mechanism of making higher generations is obtained by adding neutral scalar subquark composed of a preon-antipreon pair in the 3-state of SU ( 2 ) _ { L , R } .	A fermion-boson-type composite model for quarks and leptons is proposed .	Elementary fields are only one kind of spin-1/2 and spin-0 preon .	Both are in the global supersymmetric pair with the common electric charge of e/6 and belong to the fundamental representations of ( 3,2,2 ) under the spontaneously unbroken SU ( 3 ) _C*SU ( 2 ) _L*SU ( 2 ) _R gauge symmetry induced necessarily by the concept of `` Cartan connection '' equipped with `` Soldering Mechanism '' .	Preons are composed into subquarks which are `` intermediate clusters '' towards quarks and leptons .
0	We introduce a spectral density functional theory which can be used to compute energetics and spectra of real strongly -- correlated materials using methods , algorithms and computer programs of the electronic structure theory of solids .	The approach considers the total free energy of a system as a functional of a local electronic Green function which is probed in the region of interest .	Since we have a variety of notions of locality in our formulation , our method is manifestly basis -- set dependent .	However , it produces the exact total energy and local excitational spectrum provided that the exact functional is extremized .	The self -- energy of the theory appears as an auxiliary mass operator similar to the introduction of the ground -- state Kohn -- Sham potential in density functional theory .
4	Next , the first experiments detecting quantum gravitational states inoculate us a healthy dose of skepticism on some of the current ideologies .	I hesitated for a long time before giving shape to these notes , originally intended for preliminary reading by the attendees to the Summer School `` New paths towards quantum gravity '' ( Holbaek Bay , Denmark , May 2008 ) .	At the end , I decide against just selling my mathematical wares , and for a survey , necessarily very selective , but taking a global phenomenological approach to its subject matter .	After all , non-commutative geometry does not purport yet to solve the riddle of quantum gravity ; it is more of an insurance policy against the probable failure of the other approaches .	The plan is as follows : the introduction invites students to the fruitful doubts and conundrums besetting the application of even classical gravity .
2	A contribution of the ultrapower characterization was that it involved sorting out the global theory , and introducing nonforking , seminal for the development of stability theory .	In the first edition of Classification Theory , the second author characterized the stable theories in terms of saturation of ultrapowers .	Prior to this theorem , stability had already been defined in terms of counting types , and the unstable formula theorem was known .	Prior to the present paper , there had been no such characterization of an unstable class .	In the present paper , we first establish the existence of so-called optimal ultrafilters on Boolean algebras , which are to simple theories as Keisler 's good ultrafilters are to all theories .
2	Correlations are measured for charged particles produced in the kinematic range of transverse momentum pT & gt ; 100 MeV and pseudorapidity |eta| & lt ; 2.5 .	We present a measurement of two-particle angular correlations in proton-proton collisions at sqrt ( s ) = 900 GeV and 7 TeV .	The collision events were collected during 2009 and 2010 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using a single-arm minimum bias trigger .	A complex structure in pseudorapidity and azimuth is observed at both collision energies .	Results are compared to Pythia 8 and Herwig++ as well as to the AMBT2B , DW and Perugia 2011 tunes of Pythia 6 .
4	Employing such conditions , we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the metric close to and far from the axis .	We consider a family of cylindrical spacetimes endowed with angular momentum that are solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations outside the symmetry axis .	This family was recently obtained by performing a complete gauge fixing adapted to cylindrical symmetry .	In the present work , we find boundary conditions that ensure that the metric arising from this gauge fixing is well defined and that the resulting reduced system has a consistent Hamiltonian dynamics .	These boundary conditions must be imposed both on the symmetry axis and in the region far from the axis at spacelike infinity .
3	We show that our results for fixed points and related scaling exponents are stable .	We study quantum gravity in more than four dimensions with renormalisation group methods .	We find a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point in the Einstein-Hilbert action .	The fixed point connects with the perturbative infrared domain through finite renormalisation group trajectories .	If this picture persists at higher order , quantum gravity in the metric field is asymptotically safe .
3	In addition , the LFI instrument generates the so called housekeeping data by sampling regularly the on-board sensors and registers .	The Planck Low Frequency Instrument ( LFI ) will observe the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) by covering the frequency range 30-70 GHz in three bands .	The primary instrument data source are the temperature samples acquired by the 22 radiometers mounted on the Planck focal plane .	Such samples represent the scientific data of LFI .	The housekeeping data provides information on the overall health status of the instrument and on the scientific data quality .
4	As a practical demonstration , I apply such a formalism to bulk SrTiO $ _3 $ , where I find an unusually strong contribution of nonlocal elasticity , mediated by the interaction between the ferroelectric soft mode and the transverse acoustic branches .	The theories of flexoelectricity and that of nonlocal elasticity are closely related , and are often considered together when modeling strain-gradient effects in solids .	Here I show , based on a first-principles lattice-dynamical analysis , that their relationship is much more intimate than previously thought , and their consistent simultaneous treatment is crucial for obtaining correct physical answers .	In particular , I identify a gauge invariance in the theory , whereby the energies associated to strain-gradient elasticity and flexoelectrically induced electric fields are individually reference-dependent , and only when summed up they yield a well-defined result .	To illustrate this , I construct a minimal thermodynamic functional incorporating strain-gradient effects , and establish a formal link between the continuum description and ab initio phonon dispersion curves to calculate the relevant tensor quantities .
1	There are three ways to alleviate the problem : debris mitigation , debris removal and collision avoidance .	The density of orbital space debris constitutes an increasing environmental challenge .	This paper addresses collision avoidance , by describing a method that contributes to achieving a requisite increase in orbit prediction accuracy .	Batch least-squares differential correction is applied to the publicly available two-line element ( TLE ) catalog of space objects .	Using a high-precision numerical propagator , we fit an orbit to state vectors derived from successive TLEs .
1	The model embeds the multi-scale nature of turbulent temporal and spatial correlations , that are essential to reproduce multi-particle dispersion .	A computationally efficient model is introduced to account for the sub-grid scale velocities of tracer particles dispersed in statistically homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows .	It is capable to describe the Lagrangian diffusion and dispersion of temporally and spatially correlated clouds of particles .	Although the model neglects intermittent corrections , we show that pair and tetrad dispersion results nicely compare with Direct Numerical Simulations of statistically isotropic and homogeneous $ 3D $ turbulence .	This is in agreement with recent observations that deviations from self-similar pair dispersion statistics are rare events .
0	We report the discovery of 4 candidate intracluster globular clusters ( IGCs ) in a single deep HST ACS field of the Virgo Cluster .	We show that each cluster is roughly spherical , has a magnitude near the peak of the Virgo globular cluster luminosity function , has a radial profile that is best-fit by a King model , and is surrounded by an excess of point sources which have the colors and magnitudes of cluster red giant stars .	Despite the fact that two of our IGC candidates have integrated colors redder than the mean of the M87 globular cluster system , we propose that all of the objects are metal-poor with [ M/H ] & lt ; -1 .	We show that the tidal radii of our intracluster globulars are all larger than the mean for Milky Way clusters , and suggest that the clusters have undergone less tidal stress than their Galactic counterparts .	Finally , we normalize our globular cluster observations to the luminosity of intracluster stars , and derive a value of S_N ~ 6 for the specific frequency of Virgo intracluster globular clusters .
0	We have measured the electromagnetic response of micron-size isolated mesoscopic GaAs/GaAlAs square dots down to temperature T=16mK , by coupling them to an electromagnetic micro-resonator .	Both dissipative and non dissipative responses exhibit a large magnetic field dependent quantum correction , with a characteristic flux scale which corresponds to a flux quantum in a dot .	The real ( dissipative ) magnetoconductance changes sign as a function of frequency for low enough density of electrons .	The signal observed at frequency below the mean level spacing corresponds to a negative magnetoconductance , which is opposite to the weak localization seen in connected systems , and becomes positive at higher frequency .	We propose an interpretation of this phenomenon in relation to fundamental properties of energy level spacing statistics in the dots .
1	The study of the snow line is an important topic in several domains of astrophysics , and particularly for the evolution of proto-stellar environments and the formation of planets.Aims .	Context .	The formation of the first layer of ice on carbon grains requires low temperatures compared to the temperature of evaporation ( T & gt ; 100 K ) .	This asymmetry generates a zone in which bare and icy dust grains coexist.Methods .	We use Monte-Carlo simulations to describe the formation time scales of ice mantles on bare grains in protostellar disks and massive protostars environments .
0	The Compton amplitude is calculated in terms of expectation values of light-ray quark operators .	As a technical tool we apply the nonlocal light-cone expansion .	Thereby we express the expectation value of the vector light-ray operator with the help of the expectation value of the corresponding scalar operator of twist 2 .	This allows important simplifications .	In the limit of forward scattering the integral relations between the twist-2 contributions of the structure functions are implied directly .
3	We also propose a function called compactness , designed to assess the quality of a solution to this problem .	This article presents an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm that solves the problem of core community detection .	It is a variant of the standard community detection problem in which we are particularly interested in the connected core of communities .	To provide a solution to this problem , we question standard definitions on communities and provide alternatives .	Our algorithm is based on a graph traversal algorithm , the LexDFS .
0	Network Intrusion Detection Systems ( NDIS ) monitor a network with the aim of discerning malicious from benign activity on that network .	While a wide range of approaches have met varying levels of success , most IDS 's rely on having access to a database of known attack signatures which are written by security experts .	Nowadays , in order to solve problems with false positive alters , correlation algorithms are used to add additional structure to sequences of IDS alerts .	However , such techniques are of no help in discovering novel attacks or variations of known attacks , something the human immune system ( HIS ) is capable of doing in its own specialised domain .	This paper presents a novel immune algorithm for application to an intrusion detection problem .
2	We present new VLT Interferometer AMBER data which are combined with all other AMBER data in the literature .	IRC +10420 is one of the few known massive stars in rapid transition from the Red Supergiant phase to the Wolf-Rayet or Luminous Blue Variable phase .	The star has an ionised wind and using the Br gamma hydrogen recombination emission we assess the mass-loss on spatial scales of order 1 au .	The final dataset covers a position angle range of 180 degrees and baselines up to 110 meters .	The spectrally dispersed visibilities , differential phases and line flux are conjointly analyzed and modelled .
2	In this article we investigate the counting statistics of rare quantum trajectories of an undriven system undergoing a pure relaxation process , namely , Markovian exciton transport .	The large deviation theory has recently been applied to open quantum systems to uncover dynamical crossovers in the space of quantum trajectories associated to Markovian evolutions .	Such dynamical crossovers are characterized by qualitative changes in the fluctuations of rare quantum jump trajectories , and have been observed in the statistics of coherently driven quantum systems .	We find that dynamical crossovers occur in systems with a minimum of three interacting molecules , and are strongly activated by exciton delocalization and interference .	Our results illustrate how quantum features of the underlying system Hamiltonian can influence the statistical properties of energy transfer processes in a non-trivial manner .
2	The results show that the shock velocities range between 65 and 80 km/s , the pre-shock densities between 1 cm-3 in the ISM to 200 cm-3 in the filamentary structures .	We present consistent modelling of line and continuum IR spectra in the region close to the Galactic center .	The models account for the coupled effect of shocks and photoionization from an external source .	The pre-shock magnetic field increases from 5 .	10^ { -6 } gauss in the surrounding ISM to ~8 .
2	Of more direct physical interest is the commutator of finite mass fields , obtained by smearing the string fields with appropriate wave functions .	This paper examines the causal structure of the commutator of two string fields , in free light-cone string field theory .	By treating the commutator as a distribution on infinite dimensional loop space , it is shown that the commutator vanishes when $ \int d\ss ( \delta X ( \ss ) ) ^2 & lt ; 0 $ .	This is shown to vanish at spacelike separations , reproducing the usual point particle field theory result .	The implications of this for the information spreading mechanism proposed by Susskind to solve the black hole information problem are discussed .
4	As an application we give an equisingularity criterion for a family of plane curves to be equisingular to a plane branch and we express it algorithmically .	We analyze the expansions in terms of the approximate roots of a Weierstrass polynomial $ f $ defining a plane branch $ ( C,0 ) $ , in the light of the toric embedded resolution of the branch .	This leads to the definition of a class of ( non equisingular ) deformations of a plane branch $ ( C,0 ) $ supported on certain monomials in the approximate roots of $ f $ .	As a consequence we find out a Kouchnirenko type formula for the Milnor number $ ( C,0 ) $ .	Our results provide a geometrical approach to Abhyankar 's straight line conditions and its consequences .
3	We show a generic phase transition in the system : when hipsters are too slow in detecting the trends , they will keep making the same choices and therefore remain correlated as time goes by , while their trend evolves in time as a periodic function .	In such different domains as statistical physics and spin glasses , neurosciences , social science , economics and finance , large ensemble of interacting individuals taking their decisions either in accordance ( mainstream ) or against ( hipsters ) the majority are ubiquitous .	Yet , trying hard to be different often ends up in hipsters consistently taking the same decisions , in other words all looking alike .	We resolve this apparent paradox studying a canonical model of statistical physics , enriched by incorporating the delays necessary for information to be communicated .	This is true as long as the majority of the population is made of hipsters .
4	The pair process is included approximately in order to keep the system linear .	We develop a numerical code to calculate the neutrino transfer with multi-energy and multi-angle in three dimensions ( 3D ) for the study of core-collapse supernovae .	The numerical code solves the Boltzmann equations for neutrino distributions by the discrete-ordinate ( S_n ) method with a fully implicit differencing for time advance .	The Boltzmann equations are formulated in the inertial frame with collision terms being evaluated to the zeroth order of v/c .	A basic set of neutrino reactions for three neutrino species is implemented together with a realistic equation of state of dense matter .
3	The resulting action is shown to be well-defined and free of singularities on $ \sig $ .	An effective action is obtained for the $ N=1 $ , $ 2D- $ induced supergravity on a compact super Riemann surface ( without boundary ) $ \hat\Sigma $ of genus $ g & gt ; 1 $ , as the general solution of the corresponding superconformal Ward identity .	This is accomplished by defining a new super integration theory on $ \hat\Sigma $ which includes a new formulation of the super Stokes theorem and residue calculus in the superfield formalism .	Another crucial ingredient is the notion of polydromic fields .	As a by-product , we point out a morphism between the diffeomorphism symmetry and holomorphic properties .
4	The frozen mode regime is more robust and powerful , compared to any known slow-wave resonance .	Slow light in photonic crystals and other periodic structures is associated with stationary points of the photonic dispersion relation , where the group velocity of light vanishes .	We show that in certain cases , the vanishing group velocity is accompanied by the so-called frozen mode regime , when the incident light can be completely converted into the slow mode with huge diverging amplitude .	The frozen mode regime is a qualitatively new wave phenomenon -- it does not reduce to any known electromagnetic resonance .	Formally , the frozen mode regime is not a resonance , in a sense that it is not particularly sensitive to the size and shape of the photonic crystal .
1	Although interactions of the radion are similar to those of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model , a relatively light radion ( $ \lesssim 100 { \rm GeV } $ ) is not severely constrained from the Higgs search experiments at the LHC .	A warped extra dimension model predicts an extra scalar particle beyond the Standard Model which is called a radion .	In this paper we study discovery potential of the radion at a photon collider as an option of ILC .	Owing to the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor , both a production of radion in $ \gamma \gamma $ collision and its decay to gluon pair are enhanced sizably .	We find that the photon collider has a sensitivity for discovering the radion in low-mass region up to $ \Lambda_\phi\sim 3 { \rm TeV } $ , where $ \Lambda_\phi $ is a scale parameter which suppresses the interactions of radion to the Standard Model particles .
1	We perform JAM modelling on 1413 simulated galaxies with stellar mass M^* & gt ; 10^ { 10 } M_ { sun } , and construct an axisymmetric dynamical model for each galaxy .	We assess the effectiveness of the Jeans-Anisotropic-MGE ( JAM ) technique with a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulation , the Illustris project .	Combined with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) simulation , we recover the projected root-mean-square velocity ( V_rms ) field of the stellar component , and investigate constraints on the stellar mass-to-light ratio , M^*/L , and the fraction of dark matter f_ { DM } within 2.5 effective radii ( R_e ) .	We find that the enclosed total mass within 2.5 R_e is well constrained to within 10 % .	However , there is a degeneracy between the dark matter and stellar components with correspondingly larger individual errors .
2	They thus unify all known ad-hoc proofs in one single theorem .	In a recent paper , Amini et al .	introduce a general framework to prove duality theorems between special decompositions and their dual combinatorial object .	While this unification process is definitely good , their main theorem remains quite technical and does not give a real insight of why some decompositions admit dual objects and why others do not .	The goal of this paper is both to generalise a little this framework and to give an enlightening simple proof of its central theorem .
4	In particular we study the problem of quantum lifting .	This thesis is concerned with the application of operadic methods , particularly modular operads , to questions arising in the study of moduli spaces of surfaces as well as applications to the study of homotopy algebras and new constructions of 'quantum invariants ' of manifolds inspired by ideas originating from physics .	We consider the extension of classical 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories to Klein topological quantum field theories which allow unorientable surfaces .	We generalise open topological conformal field theories to open Klein topological conformal field theories and consider various related moduli spaces , in particular deducing a Mobius graph decomposition of the moduli spaces of Klein surfaces , analogous to the ribbon graph decomposition of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces .	We also begin a study , in generality , of quantum homotopy algebras , which arise as 'higher genus ' versions of classical homotopy algebras .
2	We explore this formulation further in this paper .	It is possible to formulate fluid dynamics in terms of group-valued variables .	This is particularly suited to the cases where the fluid has nonabelian charges and is coupled to nonabelian gauge fields .	An action for a fluid of relativistic particles ( with and without spin ) is given in terms of the Lorentz and Poincare ( or de Sitter ) groups .	Considering the case of particles with flavor symmetries , a general fluid action which also incorporates all flavor anomalies is given .
0	The list of textbook tunneling formulas is extended by deriving exact expressions for the transmission coefficient in graphene ribbons with armchair edges and the step-like and barrier-like profiles of site energies along the ribbon .	These expressions are obtained by matching wave functions at the interfaces between the regions , where quasiparticles have constant but different potential energies .	It is shown that for an $ U_0 $ high barrier and low-energy electrons and holes , the mode transmission of charge carriers in this type of ribbons is described by the textbook formula , where the constant barrier is replaced by an effective , energy-dependent barrier , $ U_0\to U ( E ) $ .	For the lowest/highest electron/hole mode , $ U ( E ) $ goes , respectively , to zero and nonzero value in metallic and semiconducting ribbons .	This and other peculiarities of through-barrier/step transmission in graphene are discussed and compared with related earlier results .
1	The HII region is beginning to blister out and break free from its envelope of molecular gas , but our line of sight to the central stars is largely obscured by intervening dust .	The W40 complex is a nearby site of recent massive star formation composed of a dense molecular cloud adjacent to an HII region that contains an embedded OB star cluster .	Several bright OB stars in W40 - visible at optical , infrared , or cm wavelengths - are providing the ionizing flux that heats the HII region .	The known stellar component of W40 is dominated by a small number of partly or fully embedded OB stars which have been studied at various wavelengths , but the lower mass stellar population remains largely unexamined .	Despite its modest optical appearance , at 600pc W40 is one of the nearest massive star forming regions , and with a UV flux of about 1/10th of the Orion Nebula Cluster , this neglected region deserves detailed investigation .
0	The divergence of the momentum density field of the large scale structure generates a secondary anisotropy contribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) .	While the effect is best described as a non-linear extension to the well-known integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect , due to mathematical coincidences , the anisotropy contribution is also described as the lensing of the dipole seen in the rest-frame of a moving mass .	Given the closeness , there is a remote possibility that local concentrations of mass in the form of the Great Attractor and the Shapley concentration generate large angular scale fluctuations in CMB and could potentially be responsible , at least partly , for some of the low-multipole anomalies in WMAP data .	While the local anisotropy contribution peaks at low multipoles , for reasonable models of the mass and velocity distributions associated with local super structures we find that the amplitude of temperature anisotropies is at most at a level of 10 $ ^ { -2 } $ $ \mu $ K and is substantially smaller than primordial fluctuations .	It is extremely unlikely that the momentum density of local mass concentrations is responsible for any of the large angular scale anomalies in WMAP data .
0	Recent years have seen several earnest initiatives from both academic researchers as well as open source communities to implement and deploy decentralized online social networks ( DOSNs ) .	The primary motivations for DOSNs are privacy and autonomy from big brotherly service providers .	The promise of decentralization is complete freedom for end-users from any service providers both in terms of keeping privacy about content and communication , and also from any form of censorship .	However decentralization introduces many challenges .	One of the principal problems is to guarantee availability of data even when the data owner is not online , so that others can access the said data even when a node is offline or down .
4	Lie-group integrators are based on general Lie group actions on a manifold , and classical Runge-Kutta integrators appear in this setting as the special case of R^n acting upon itself by translations .	B-series originated from the work of John Butcher in the 1960s as a tool to analyze numerical integration of differential equations , in particular Runge-Kutta methods .	Connections to renormalization theory in perturbative quantum field theory have been established in recent years .	The algebraic structure of classical Runge-Kutta methods is described by the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra .	Lie-Butcher theory is a generalization of B-series aimed at studying Lie-group integrators for differential equations evolving on manifolds .
0	Shadow observations are the only way to observe emission from the galactic halo ( GH ) and/or the circumgalactic medium ( CGM ) free of any foreground contamination from local hot bubble ( LHB ) and solar wind charge exchange ( SWCX ) .	We analyzed data from a shadow observation in the direction of the high latitude , neutral hydrogen cloud MBM 16 with \Suzaku .	We found that all emission can be accounted for by foreground emission from LHB and SWCX , plus power law emission associated with unresolved point sources .	The GH/CGM in the direction of MBM 16 is negligible or inexistent in our observation , with upper limits on the emission measure of 9.5x10^ { -4 } pc cm^ { -6 } ( 90 % C.L .	) , at the lowest end of current estimates .
2	Detailed SEM ( Scanning Electron Microscopy ) results show that the crystals are formed in slab like morphology with homogenous distribution of Bi and Pd .	We report synthesis of non-centrosymmetric BiPd single crystal by self flux method .	The BiPd single crystal is crystallized in monoclinic structure with the P21 space group .	The magnetic susceptibility measurement confirmed that the BiPd compound is superconducting below 4K .	Further , BiPd exhibits weak ferromagnetism near the superconducting transition temperature in isothermal magnetization ( MH ) measurements .
1	The global solution of the $ p $ -regularized subproblem for $ p=3 $ , also known as the cubic regularization , has been characterized in literature .	The $ p $ -regularized subproblem ( p-RS ) is a regularisation technique in computing a Newton-like step for unconstrained optimization , which globally minimizes a local quadratic approximation of the objective function while incorporating with a weighted regularisation term $ \frac { \sigma } { p } \|x\|^p $ .	In this paper , we resolve both the global and the local non-global minimizers of ( p-RS ) for $ p & gt ; 2 $ with necessary and sufficient optimality conditions .	Moreover , we prove a parallel result of Mart\ ' { \i } nez \cite { Mar } that the ( p-RS ) for $ p & gt ; 2 $ , analogous to the trust region subproblem , can have at most one local non-global minimizer .	When the ( p-RS ) is subject to a fixed number $ m $ additional linear inequality constraints , we show that the uniqueness of the local solution of the ( p-RS ) ( if exists at all ) , especially for $ p=4 $ , can be applied to solve such an extension in polynomial time .
2	In Prolog 's SLD , goals are nested very naturally .	When doing inference in ProbLog , a probabilistic extension of Prolog , we extend SLD resolution with some additional bookkeeping .	This additional information is used to compute the probabilistic results for a probabilistic query .	In ProbLog 's SLD , nesting probabilistic queries interferes with the probabilistic bookkeeping .	In order to support nested probabilistic inference we propose the notion of a parametrised ProbLog engine .
1	Numerical simulations and analytical calculations based on Markov chain theory show that when the external field is smaller than the exchange coupling constant $ J $ there is a non-monotonous dependence of the mean magnetization on the temperature in a finite system .	We introduce a growing one-dimensional quenched spin model that bases on asymmetrical one-side Ising interactions in the presence of external field .	The crossover temperature $ T_c $ corresponding to the maximal magnetization decays with system size , approximately as the inverse of the W Lambert function .	The observed phenomenon can be understood as an interplay between the thermal fluctuations and the presence of the first cluster determined by initial conditions .	The effect exists also when spins are not quenched but fully thermalized after the attachment to the chain .
1	We microscopically analyze the boundary problem for the continuous Bogoliubov-de Gennes-Dirac ( BdGD ) equations and derive the Green functions for normal and superconducting graphene layers .	This work presents a novel approach to describe spectral properties of graphene layers with well defined edges .	Importing the idea used in tight-binding ( TB ) models of a microscopic hopping that couples different regions , we are able to set up and solve an algebraic Dyson 's equation describing a graphene-superconductor junction .	For this coupled system we analytically derive the Green functions and use them to calculate the local density of states and the spatial variation of the induced pairing correlations in the normal region .	Signatures of specular Andreev reflections are identified .
2	For measuring the distribution width , an inexpensive modification of the commonly used charge dividing circuits that allows analogue and instantaneous computation of the 2nd moment has been developed and is presented in this work .	A novel design for an inexpensive depth of interaction capable detector for gamma rays , suitable for nuclear medical applications , especially Positron Emission Tomography , has been developed .	The design takes advantage of the strong correlation between the width of the scintillation light distribution in continuous crystals and the depth of interaction of the gamma-ray .	The method has been tested with a detector made of a continuous LSO-scintillator of dimensions 42x42x10 cubic mm and optically coupled to the compact large area position sensitive photomultiplier H8500 from Hamamatsu .	The mean resolution in all non-trivial moments was found to be smaller than 5 % but their direct use as estimates for the three-dimensional photoconversion position turned out to be unsuitable .
4	The effect of the regularization error is studied .	Several approaches are discussed how to understand the solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Poisson equation when the Dirichlet data are non-smooth such as if they are in $ L^2 $ only .	For the method of transposition ( sometimes called very weak formulation ) three spaces for the test functions are considered , and a regularity result is proved .	An approach of Berggren is recovered as the method of transposition with the second variant of test functions .	A further concept is the regularization of the boundary data combined with the weak solution of the regularized problem .
2	This has been demonstrated in terms of energetics and electronic properties of the clusters .	With a goal to produce giant magnetic moment in Mn $ _ { 13 } $ cluster which will be useful for practical applications , we have considered the structure and magnetic properties of pure Mn $ _ { 13 } $ cluster and substitutionally doped it with X = Ti , V , Cr , Fe , Co , Ni atom to produce Mn $ _ { 12 } $ X clusters .	We find that Ti and V substitutions in Mn $ _ { 13 } $ cluster are the most promising in terms of gaining substantial binding energy as well as achieving higher magnetic moment through ferromagnetic alignment of atom-centered magnetic moments .	For comparison , we have also studied the effect of N-capping of Mn $ _ { 13 } $ cluster , predicted in the earlier work [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 89 } , 185504 ( 2002 ) ] as a means to produce stable giant magnetic moment in Mn clusters upto cluster size of 5 Mn atoms .
1	In this limit the effective theory is entirely bosonic , and I consider both the artificial infinite-range limit , and the more realistic case of `` nearest neighbor '' hopping of bosons between localized states .	Qualitative features of the mean-field theory of superconductivity in a strongly disordered systems of fermions with short-range attraction are discussed .	In the infinite range case the mean-field theory is exact , and the superconducting gap is uniform in space .	There is a smooth BCS-BEC crossover with decrease in density , at weak enough disorder ; at moderate densities , or larger disorder , the mean-field ground state is the BCS-like localized superconductor .	In the latter case , the gap is highly non-uniform in space , but surprisingly stays everywhere finite below the mean-field transition temperature .
2	The exact consideration of thermodynamics is extended including a random Lorentzian transverse field .	Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation and the continued-fraction method we calculate exactly the density of states and thermodynamic quantities of the periodic nonuniform spin-1/2 isotropic XY chain in a transverse field .	We discuss in detail the changes in the behaviour of the thermodynamic quantities caused by regular nonuniformity .	The presented results are used to study the Peierls instability in a quantum spin chain .	In particular , we examine the influence of a non-random/random field on the spin-Peierls instability with respect to dimerization .
2	Such a task is BosonSampling : obtaining a distribution of n bosons scattered by some linear-optical unitary process .	Quantum computers are unnecessary for exponentially-efficient computation or simulation if the Extended Church-Turing thesis -- -a foundational tenet of computer science -- -is correct .	The thesis would be directly contradicted by a physical device that efficiently performs a task believed to be intractable for classical computers .	Here we test the central premise of BosonSampling , experimentally verifying that the amplitudes of 3-photon scattering processes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a 6-mode integrated optical circuit .	We find the protocol to be robust , working even with the unavoidable effects of photon loss , non-ideal sources , and imperfect detection .
0	The Edinburgh Logical Framework ( LF ) is a dependently type lambda calculus that can be used to encode formal systems .	The versatility of LF allows specifications to be constructed also about the encoded systems .	The Twelf system exploits the correspondence between formulas and types to give specifications in LF a logic programming interpretation .	By interpreting particular arguments as input and others as output , specifications can be seen as describing non-deterministic functions .	If particular such functions can be shown to be total , they represent constructive proofs of meta-theorems of the encoded systems .
0	Starting from a master equation in a quantum Hamiltonian form and a coupling to a heat bath we derive an evolution equation for a collective hopping process under the influence of a stochastic energy landscape .	There results different equations in case of an arbitrary occupation number per lattice site or in a system under exclusion .	Based on scaling arguments it will be demonstrated that both systems belong below the critical dimension $ d_c $ to the same universality class leading to anomalous diffusion in the long time limit .	The dynamical exponent $ z $ can be calculated by an $ \epsilon = d_c-d $ expansion .	Above the critical dimension we discuss the differences in the diffusion constant for sufficient high temperatures .

We present a combined experimental and numerical study of the primary and secondary bifurcations for a Kolmogorov-like flow .	The experimental system is a quasi-two-dimensional incompressible fluid flow consisting of two immiscible layers of fluid for which electromagnetic forces drive a shear flow that approximates Kolmogorov flow .	The two-dimensional ( 2D ) direct numerical simulations ( DNS ) integrate a depth-averaged version of the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations Suri $ { \it et } $ $ { \it al .	Specifically , we present three separate 2D DNS : one that is doubly-periodic , one that is singly-periodic , and one that is non-periodic ( i.e.no-slip is imposed at the lateral boundaries ) .
4	With a judicious choice of magnetic field gradients , the method further allows encoding of up to 2^N pseudo-pure states in independent spatial modes in an N+1 spin system .	Quantum information processing by liquid-state NMR spectroscopy uses pseudo-pure states to mimic the evolution and observations on true pure states .	A new method of preparing pseudo-pure states is described , which involves the selection of the spatially labeled states of an ancilla spin with which the spin system of interest is correlated .	This permits a general procedure to be given for the preparation of pseudo-pure states on any number of spins , subject to the limitations imposed by the loss of signal from the selected subensemble .	The preparation of a single pseudo-pure state is demonstrated by carbon and proton NMR on 13C-labeled alanine .
0	The physics potential of an intense source of low-energy muons is studied .	Such a source is a necessary stage towards building the neutrino factories and muon colliders which are being considered at present .	The CERN Neutrino Factory could deliver muon beams with intensities 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than available now , with large freedom in the choice of the time structure .	Low-energy muon physics contributes to many fields of basic research , including rare muon decays , i.e. , decays that do not conserve muon number , measurements of fundamental constants , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , determination of the Lorentz structure of the weak interaction , QED tests , CPT tests , proton and nuclear charge distributions ( even for short-lived isotopes ) , and condensed matter physics .	In studying the experimental programme , we analyse the present limitations , list the requirements on the new muon beams , and describe some ideas on how to implement these beam lines in a CERN neutrino factory complex .
3	By way of proving this decay , an estimate is obtained for the resolvent of the associated semigroup generator , an estimate which is uniform for frequency domain values along the imaginary axis .	In this work , we derive a result of exponential stability for a coupled system of partial differential equations ( PDEs ) which governs a certain fluid-structure interaction .	In particular , a three-dimensional Stokes flow interacts across a boundary interface with a two-dimensional mechanical plate equation .	In the case that the PDE plate component is rotational inertia-free , one will have that solutions of this fluid-structure PDE system exhibit an exponential rate of decay .	Subsequently , we proceed to discuss relevant point control and boundary control scenarios for this fluid-structure PDE model , with an ultimate view to optimal control studies on both finite and infinite horizon .
3	( 2005 ) , assumes two different IMFs : a normal solar neighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks , and a very top-heavy IMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers .	We use a model for the evolution of galaxies in the far-IR based on the LambdaCDM cosmology to make detailed predictions for upcoming cosmological surveys with the Herschel Space Observatory .	We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDs including the reprocessing of radiation by dust .	The model , which is the same as that in Baugh et al .	We have shown previously that the top-heavy IMF appears necessary to explain the number counts and redshifts of faint sub-mm galaxies .
2	We study the X-ray emission from the black holes with masses of ~10^7 M_sun recoiled from the galactic center with velocities of ~600 km s^-1 .	Recent studies have indicated that the emission of gravitational waves at the merger of two black holes gives a kick to the final black hole .	If the supermassive black hole at the center of a disk galaxy is kicked but the velocity is not large enough to escape from the host galaxy , it will fall back onto the the disk and accrete the interstellar medium in the disk .	We find that their luminosities can reach ~ & gt ; 10^39 erg s^-1 , when they pass the apastrons in the disk .	While the X-ray luminosities are comparable to those of ultra-luminous X-ray sources ( ULXs ) observed in disk galaxies , ULXs observed so far do not seem to be such supermassive black holes .
2	With its greatly improved sensitivity , better angular resolution , and larger energy reach than older instruments , GLAST LAT should detect dozens to hundreds of new gamma-ray pulsars and measure luminosities , light curves , and phase-resolved spectra with unprecedented resolution .	Some pulsars have their maximum observable energy output in the gamma-ray band , offering the possibility of using these high-energy photons as probes of the particle acceleration and interaction processes in pulsar magnetospheres .	After an extended hiatus between satellite missions , the recently-launched AGILE mission and the upcoming Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) will allow gamma-ray tests of the theoretical models developed based on past discoveries .	It will also have the potential to find radio-quiet pulsars like Geminga , using blind search techniques .	Cooperation with radio and X-ray pulsar astronomers is an important aspect of the LAT team 's planning for pulsar studies .
3	Tobias , J. Electrochem.Soc .	I have measured the early stages of the growth of branched metal aggregates formed by electrochemical deposition in very thin layers .	The growth rate of spatial Fourier modes is described qualitatively by the results of a linear stability analysis [ D.P .	Barkey , R.H. Muller , and C.W .	{ \bf 136 } , 2207 ( 1989 ) ] .
3	Consequently it appears that a new Cosmology , alternative to the classical Cosmology , is necessary , at least in the field of dark matter .	The astrophysicist S. Mc Gaugh recently published ( 3 ) a result raising questions concerning the existence of dark matter and the validity of General Relativity , conclusion of his observations of 47 galaxies .	He established the validity of Tully-Fisher 's law for all those galaxies , which is unexplained and in contradiction with classical Cosmology based on General Relativity .	Moreover , we remind that this classical Cosmology did not solve the enigma of the nature of dark matter , nor the enigma of its invisibility , nor the enigma of the constancy of the curve of velocities of stars in a galaxy .	In fact it exists already a new Cosmology , alternative to classical Cosmology and compatible with the Relativity Theory , which is the Cosmology of the Theory of Ether relative to dark matter .
1	After the expected completion at the end of 2016 , the LINAC4 will accelerate H- ions to 160 MeV .	Within the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade ( LIU ) , the new LINAC4 is currently being commissioned to replace the existing LINAC2 proton source at CERN .	To measure the transverse emittance of the H- beam , a method based on photo-detachment is proposed .	This system will operate using a pulsed laser with light delivered via an optical fibre and subsequently focused through a thin slice of the H- beam .	The laser photons have sufficient energy to detach the outer electron and create H0/e- pairs .
1	Here foundations are considered as a theory that provides means ( concepts , structures , methods etc . )	There are different meanings of foundation of mathematics : philosophical , logical , and mathematical .	for the development of whole mathematics .	Set theory has been for a long time the most popular foundation .	However , it was not been able to win completely over its rivals : logic , the theory of algorithms , and theory of categories .
4	Furthermore , the star formation gradient can not be solely the result of initial conditions , but must partly be due to subsequent evolution through a mechanism ( or mechanisms ) sensitive to environment .	We present a study of the spectroscopic and photometric properties of galaxies in six nearby clusters .	We perform a partial correlation analysis on our dataset to investigate whether the correlation between star formation rates in galaxies and their environment is merely another aspect of correlations of morphology , stellar mass , or mean stellar age with environment , or whether star formation rates vary independently of these other correlations .	We find a residual correlation of ongoing star formation with environment , indicating that even galaxies with similar morphologies , stellar masses , and mean stellar ages have lower star formation rates in denser environments .	Thus , the current star formation gradient in clusters is not just another aspect of the morphology-density , stellar mass-density , or mean stellar age-density relations .
0	Turbulent spectra of magnetic fluctuations in the free solar wind are studied from MHD to electron scales using Cluster observations .	We discuss the problem of the instrumental noise and its influence on the measurements at the electron scales .	We confirm the presence of a curvature of the spectrum $ \sim \exp { \sqrt { k\rho_e } } $ over the broad frequency range $ \sim [ 10,100 ] $ Hz , indicating the presence of a dissipation .	Analysis of seven spectra under different plasma conditions show clearly the presence of a quasi-universal power-law spectrum at MHD and ion scales .	However , the transition from the inertial range $ \sim k^ { -1.7 } $ to the spectrum at ion scales $ \sim k^ { -2.7 } $ is not universal .
0	We study heavy flavor evolution and hadronization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions .	The in-medium evolution of heavy quarks is described using our modified Langevin framework that incorporates both collisional and radiative energy loss mechanisms .	The subsequent hadronization process for heavy quarks is calculated with a fragmentation plus recombination model .	We find significant contribution from gluon radiation to heavy quark energy loss at high $ p_T $ ; the recombination mechanism can greatly enhance D meson production at medium $ p_T $ .	Our calculation provides a good description of D meson nuclear modification at the LHC .
4	Following an approach of [ GT ] we consider the next case $ n=5 $ and obtain the same result under the assumption that the set of zeros of $ X $ is not empty .	Let $ V^n $ be an open manifold of non-negative sectional curvature with a soul $ \Sigma $ of co-dimension two .	The universal cover $ \tilde N $ of the unit normal bundle $ N $ of the soul in such a manifold is isometric to the direct product $ M^ { n-2 } \times R $ .	In the study of the metric structure of $ V^n $ an important role plays the vector field $ X $ which belongs to the projection of the vertical planes distribution of the Riemannian submersion $ \pi : V\to\Sigma $ on the factor $ M $ in this metric splitting $ \tilde N=M\times R $ .	The case $ n=4 $ was considered in [ GT ] where the authors prove that $ X $ is a Killing vector field while the manifold $ V^4 $ is isometric to the quotient of $ M^2\times ( R^2 , g_F ) \times R $ by the flow along the corresponding Killing field .
1	OpenFlow/P4 falls short in implementing middlebox functionalities due to the fundamental limitation in its match-action abstraction .	The state-of-the-art OpenFlow technology only partially realized SDN vision of abstraction and centralization for packet forwarding in switches .	In this paper , we advocate the vision of Software-Defined Middleboxes ( SDM ) to realize abstraction and centralization for middleboxes .	We further propose OpenFunction , an SDM reference architecture and a network function abstraction layer .	Our SDM architecture and OpenFunction abstraction are complementary to existing SDN and Network Function Virtualization ( NFV ) technologies .
3	A Riemannian metric with holonomy contained in $ G_2 $ arises from our considerations and Hitchin 's flow equations , which seems to be new .	Necessary and sufficient conditions to the existence of a hermitian connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion and holonomy contained in SU ( 3 ) are given .	Non-compact solution to the supergravity-type I equations of motion with non-zero flux and non-constant dilaton is found in dimensions 6 .	Non-conformally flat non-compact solutions to the supergravity-type I equations of motion with non-zero flux and non-constant dilaton are found in dimensions 7 and 8 .	Compact examples of $ SU ( 3 ) , G_2 $ and $ Spin ( 7 ) $ instanton satisfying the anomaly cancellation conditions are presented .
2	The transition mechanism from point particle field to fluid field , and vice versa , is discussed .	A Lagrangian density for viscous quark-gluon plasma has been constructed within the fluid-like QCD framework .	Gauge symmetry is preserved for all terms inside the Lagrangian , except for the viscous term .	The energy momentum tensor that is relevant for the gluonic plasma having the nature of fluid bulk of gluon sea is derived within the model .	By imposing conservation law in the energy momentum tensor , shear viscosity appears as extractable from the equation .
2	How to determine in this case an effective coupling parameter has been a matter of intensive debate .	In a non-ideal classical Coulomb one-component plasma ( OCP ) all thermodynamic properties are known to depend only on a single parameter -- the coupling parameter $ \Gamma $ .	In contrast , if the pair interaction is screened by background charges ( Yukawa OCP ) the thermodynamic state depends , in addition , on the range of the interaction via the screening parameter $ \kappa $ .	Here we propose a consistent approach for defining and measuring the coupling strength in Coulomb and Yukawa OCPs based on a fundamental structural quantity , the radial pair distribution function ( RPDF ) .	The RPDF is often accessible in experiments by direct observation or indirectly through the static structure factor .
3	Then , we are looking for sufficient conditions that ensure the $ d\delta $ -lemma holds : we consider the cases when $ R $ is self adjoint with respect to a Riemannian metric or compatible with an almost symplectic structure .	One ( actually , almost the only effective ) way to prove formality of a differentiable manifold is to be able to produce a suitable derivation $ \delta $ such that $ d\delta $ -lemma holds .	We first show that such derivation $ \delta $ generates a ( 1,1 ) -tensor field ( we denote it by $ R $ ) .	Then , we show that the supercommutation of $ d $ and $ \delta $ ( which is a natural , essentially necessary condition to get a $ d\delta $ -lemma ) is equivalent to vanishing of the Nijenhujis torsion of $ R $ .	Finally , we show that if $ R $ is scew-symmetric with respect to a Riemannian metric , has constant determinant , and if its Nijenhujis torsion vanishes , then the orthogonal component of $ R $ in its polar decomposition is a complex structure compatible with the metric , which gives us a new characterization of K\ '' ahler structures
1	We use replica-symmetric transfer-matrix techniques to derive a set of fixed-point equations describing the relevant order parameters and free energy , and solve them employing population dynamics .	We study the thermodynamic properties of spin systems on small-world hypergraphs , obtained by superimposing sparse Poisson random graphs with p-spin interactions onto a one-dimensional Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions .	In the special case where the number of connections per site is of the order of the system size we are able to solve the model analytically .	In the more general case where the number of connections is finite we determine the static and dynamic ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions using population dynamics .	The results are tested against Monte-Carlo simulations .
2	The properties of the Cotton tensor : symmetry , conformal covariance , trace- and divergence-freedom , are recovered as corollaries of the Chern-Simons invariant .	Chern-Simons invariants of closed oriented Riemannian $ 3 $ -manifolds are introduced and studied from the basics .	Their first-order variation is the Cotton tensor .	We prove that the Cotton tensor is the obstruction to local conformal flatness in dimension $ 3 $ .	Finally we discuss the link between Chern-Simons invariants , the eta invariant , and the central value of the Selberg zeta function .
2	We compute this ratio of branching fractions using hadronic form factors computed in unquenched lattice QCD and obtain R ( D ) = 0.316 ( 12 ) ( 7 ) , where the errors are statistical and total systematic , respectively .	The semileptonic decay channel B - & gt ; D tau nu is sensitive to the presence of a scalar current , such as that mediated by a charged-Higgs boson .	Recently the BaBar experiment reported the first observation of the exclusive semileptonic decay B - & gt ; D tau nu , finding an approximately 2-sigma disagreement with the Standard-Model prediction for the ratio R ( D ) =BR ( B- & gt ; D tau nu ) /BR ( B- & gt ; D l nu ) , where l=e , mu .	This result is the first Standard-Model calculation of R ( D ) from ab initio full QCD .	Its error is smaller than that of previous estimates , primarily due to the reduced uncertainty in the scalar form factor f_0 ( q^2 ) .
4	Our data for C ( T , H ) and resistivity rho ( T , H ) can be interpreted in favor of the dominant orbital contribution to the pair-breaking mechanism at low fields , while Pauli limiting effect dominates at high fields , giving rise to a gapless superconducting state with only the leading non-zero gap .	We investigated the thermodynamic properties of the Fe-based lightly disordered superconductor Ba $ _ { 0.05 } $ K $ _ { 0.95 } $ Fe $ _2 $ As $ _2 $ in external magnetic field H applied along the FeAs layers ( H//ab planes ) .	The superconducting ( SC ) transition temperature for this doping level is T $ _c $ = 6.6 K. Our analysis of the specific heat C ( T , H ) measured for T & lt ; T $ _c $ implies a sign change of the superconducting order parameter across different Fermi pockets .	We provide experimental evidence for the three components superconducting order parameter .	We find that all three components have values which are comparable with the previously reported ones for the stochiometric compound KFe $ _2 $ As $ _2 $ .
0	The evolution of primordial black holes in a flat Friedmann universe with a massless scalar field is investigated in fully general relativistic numerical relativity .	A primordial black hole is expected to form with a scale comparable to the cosmological apparent horizon , in which case it may go through an initial phase with significant accretion .	However , if it is very close to the cosmological apparent horizon size , the accretion is suppressed due to general relativistic effects .	In any case , it soon gets smaller than the cosmological horizon and thereafter it can be approximated as an isolated vacuum solution with decaying mass accretion .	In this situation the dynamical and inhomogeneous scalar field is typically equivalent to a perfect fluid with a stiff equation of state $ p=\rho $ .
0	We present resolved-star VI photometry of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy IC1613 reaching I~23.5 , obtained with the wide-field camera at the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope .	A fit to the stellar density distribution shows an exponential profile of scale length 2.9 ' +/- 0.1 and gives a central surface brightness mu_V,0 = 22.7 +/- 0.6 .	The significant number of red giant branch ( RGB ) stars present in the outer part of our images ( r & gt ; 16.5 ' ) indicates that the galaxy is actually more extended than previously estimated .	A comparison of the color-magnitude diagrams ( CMDs ) as a function of galactocentric distance shows a clear gradient in the age of its population , the scale length increasing with age , while we find no evidence of a metallicity gradient from the width of the RGB .	We present quantitative results of the recent star formation history from a synthetic CMD analysis using IAC-STAR .
1	We first study X-ray point sources using the statistical measure of cumulative source counts , finding that the measured overdensities are consistent with previous results , but we recommend caution in overestimating the precision of the technique .	We use deep Chandra imaging and an extensive optical spectroscopy campaign on the Keck 10-m telescopes to study the properties of X-ray point sources in five large-scale structures at redshifts of z ~ 0.7-0.9 .	Optical spectroscopy of objects matched to X-ray point sources confirms a total of 27 AGN within the five structures , and we find that their host galaxies tend to be located away from dense cluster cores .	More than 36 % of host galaxies are located in the `green valley ' , which suggests they are a transitional population .	Based on analysis of OII and Hd line strengths , the average spectral properties of the AGN host galaxies in all structures indicate either on-going star formation or a starburst within ~ 1 Gyr , and the host galaxies are younger than the average galaxy in the parent population .
1	We analyze the family of underlying markets from the perspective of large financial markets .	We consider a family of mixed processes given as the sum of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $ H\in ( 3/4,1 ) $ and a multiple of an independent standard Brownian motion , the family being indexed by the scaling factor in front of the Brownian motion .	More precisely , we show the existence of a strong asymptotic arbitrage ( SAA ) when the scaling factor converges to zero .	The proofs are based on a dichotomy result for sequences of Gaussian measures and the concept of relative entropy .	Additionally , the relation between SAA and the notion of entire asymptotic separation for sequences of probability measures is exploited .
2	For other values of charge the divergent expansion determines the functions having essential singularity at origin ( beyond usual $ \delta $ -function ) .	The Schwinger -- DeWitt expansion for the evolution operator kernel is used to investigate analytical properties of the Schr\ '' odinger equation solution in time variable .	It is shown , that this expansion , which is in general asymptotic , converges for a number of potentials ( widely used , in particular , in one-dimensional many-body problems ) , and besides , the convergence takes place only for definite discrete values of the coupling constant .	This does not permit one to fulfil the initial condition .	So , the function obtained from the Schr\ '' odinger equation can not be the evolution operator kernel .
2	The calculations shown here are a follow-up of the work of Favier et al .	We here report calculations of magnetic buoyancy instabilities of a sheared magnetic layer where two separate zones are unstable .	The idea is to study the possible generation of large-scale helical structures which could then rise through a stellar convection zone and emerge at the surface to create active regions .	( 2012 ) where the instability developed in a weakly magnetized atmosphere , consisting of a uniform field oriented in a different direction from the unstable layer below .	Here , the top layer representing the atmosphere is itself unstable to buoyancy instabilities and thus quickly creates a more complex magnetic configuration with which the layer below will interact .
0	We introduce hermiticity as a new symmetry and show that when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical level , quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stay physically acceptable .	To show this , we calculated the effective potential of the ( $ g\phi^ { 4 } +h\phi^ { 6 } $ ) $ _ { 1+1 } $ model up to first order in $ g $ and $ h $ couplings which is sufficient as the region of interest has finite correlation length for which mean field calculation may suffice .	We show that , in the literature , there is a skipped phase of the theory due to the wrong believe that the theory in the broken hermiticity phase is unphysical .	However , in view of recent discoveries of the reality of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian but $ PT $ symmetric theories , in the broken hermiticity phase the theory possesses $ PT $ symmetry and thus physically acceptable .	In fact , ignoring this phase will lead to violation of universality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the same class of universality .
4	We use these observations , together with analytic formulae that we derive for the line profile distortions , to determine the projected angle between the spin axis of HAT-P-57 and the orbital axis of HAT-P-57b .	We present the discovery of HAT-P-57b , a P = 2.4653 day transiting planet around a V = 10.465 +- 0.029 mag , Teff = 7500 +- 250 K main sequence A8V star with a projected rotation velocity of v sin i = 102.1 +- 1.3 km s^-1 .	We measure the radius of the planet to be R = 1.413 +- 0.054 R_J and , based on RV observations , place a 95 % confidence upper limit on its mass of M & lt ; 1.85 M_J .	Based on theoretical stellar evolution models , the host star has a mass and radius of 1.47 +- 0.12 M_sun , and 1.500 +- 0.050 R_sun , respectively .	Spectroscopic observations made with Keck-I/HIRES during a partial transit event show the Doppler shadow of HAT-P-57b moving across the average spectral line profile of HAT-P- 57 , confirming the object as a planetary system .
4	Our proof requires only the existence of well defined UV behaviors that are devoid of Landau poles and UV divergences of the Wilson loops , allowing degrees of freedom to increase monotonously with energy scale .	Large N QCD is mostly governed by planar diagrams and should show linear confinement when these diagrams are suitably summed .	The linear confinement of quarks in a class of these theories using gravity duals that capture the logarithmic runnings of the coupling constants in the IR and strongly coupled asymptotic conformal behavior in the UV was studied in our previous work .	We also extended the theories to high temperatures and argued the possibilities of meltings and suppressions of heavy quarkonium states .	In this paper we give a formal proof of melting using very generic choices of UV completions , and point out some subtleties associated with meltings in generic large N theories .
3	The nonlinear $ \sigma $ - $ \omega $ - $ \rho $ hadronic mean-field approximation with or without vacuum fluctuation corrections and strange quark matter defined by MIT-bag model are employed to examine properties of hadron- ( strange ) quark hybrid stars .	Density-dependent relations among saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter and hyperonic matter , properties of hadron- ( strange ) quark hybrid stars are discussed by applying the conserving nonlinear $ \sigma $ - $ \omega $ - $ \rho $ hadronic mean-field theory .	Nonlinear interactions that will be renormalized as effective coupling constants , effective masses and sources of equations of motion are constructed self-consistently by maintaining thermodynamic consistency to the mean-field approximation .	The coupling constants expected from the hadronic mean-field model and SU ( 6 ) quark model for the vector coupling constants are compared ; the coupling constants exhibit different density-dependent results for effective masses and binding energies of hyperons , properties of hadron and hadron-quark stars .	We have found that hadron- ( strange ) quark hybrid stars become more stable in high density compared to pure hadronic and strange quark stars .
0	The dynamics of the convergence to the critical attractor for the logistic map is investigated .	At the border of chaos , when the Liapunov exponent is zero , the use of the non-extensive statistical mechanics formalism allows to define a weak sensitivity or insensitivity to initial conditions .	Using this formalism we analyse how a set of initial conditions spread all over the phase space converges to the critical attractor in the case of infinite bifurcation and tangent bifurcation points .	We show that the phenomena is governed in both cases by a power-law regime but the critical exponents depend on the type of bifurcation and may also depend on the numerical experiment set-up .	Differences and similarities between the two cases are also discussed .
2	We show that the Schmidt number is an almost equivalent measures to the von Neumann entanglement entropy when the delocalization of clusters occurs in the entire system but it shows different behaviors in a partially delocalized state containing localized clusters and delocalized ones .	We calculated the von Neumann entanglement entropy and the Schmidt number of one dimentional ( 1D ) cluster states and showed that these are useful measures to estimate entanglement caused by delocalization of clusters .	We analyze system size dependence of these entanglement measures in the linear-chain $ n\alpha $ states given by Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\ '' opke wave functions for 1D cluster gas states .	It means that the R\'enyi-2 entanglement entropy , which relates to the Schmidt number , is found to be almost equivalent to the von Neumann entanglement entropy for the full delocalized cluster system but it is less sensitive to the partially delocalized cluster system than the von Neumann entanglement entropy .	We also propose a new entanglement measure which has a generalized form of the Schmidt number .
3	The EST alignment procedure is based on the construction of maximal embeddings that are sequences obtained from paths of a graph structure , called Embedding Graph , whose vertices are the maximal pairings of a genomic sequence T and an EST P. The procedure runs in time linear in the size of P , T and of the output .	Current computational methods for exon-intron structure prediction from a cluster of transcript ( EST , mRNA ) data do not exhibit the time and space efficiency necessary to process large clusters of over than 20,000 ESTs and genes longer than 1Mb .	Guaranteeing both accuracy and efficiency seems to be a computational goal quite far to be achieved , since accuracy is strictly related to exploiting the inherent redundancy of information present in a large cluster .	We propose a fast method for the problem that combines two ideas : a novel algorithm of proved small time complexity for computing spliced alignments of a transcript against a genome , and an efficient algorithm that exploits the inherent redundancy of information in a cluster of transcripts to select , among all possible factorizations of EST sequences , those allowing to infer splice site junctions that are highly confirmed by the input data .	PIntron , the software tool implementing our methodology , is able to process in a few seconds some critical genes that are not manageable by other gene structure prediction tools .
4	3D scattering effects are important for the intensity in the core of the line .	The 133.5 nm lines are important observables for the NASA/SMEX mission Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph ( IRIS ) .	To make 3D non-LTE radiative transfer computationally feasible it is crucial to have a model atom with as few levels as possible while retaining the main physical processes .	We here develop such a model atom and we study the general formation properties of the C II lines .	We find that a nine-level model atom of C I-C III with the transitions treated assuming complete frequency redistribution ( CRD ) suffices to describe the 133.5 nm lines .
4	Students were engaged in the inquiry-based introductory activity and seemed to realize with care the measurements .	Sliding friction is usually introduced in high school , but rarely through activities in laboratory .	A qualitative introduction to friction is presented by proposing exploration of different kind of materials in order to suggest which aspects can be relevant and which interaction is involved .	Different quantitative experiments are proposed for studying Leonardo 's laws for friction .	The learning path was tested with two high school classes during an instruction trip at department .
3	Artificial agent-based simulations of this model highlight a `` good get richer '' mechanism where users with broad interests and good judgments are likely to become popular leaders for the others .	The study of the organization of social networks is important for understanding of opinion formation , rumor spreading , and the emergence of trends and fashion .	This paper reports empirical analysis of networks extracted from four leading sites with social functionality ( Delicious , Flickr , Twitter and YouTube ) and shows that they all display a scale-free leadership structure .	To reproduce this feature , we propose an adaptive network model driven by social recommending .	Simulations also indicate that the studied social recommendation mechanism can gradually improve the user experience by adapting to tastes of its users .
2	The proton $ v_1 ( y ) $ slope at midrapidity is found extremely small .	STAR 's measurements of directed flow ( $ v_1 $ ) for pions , kaons ( charged and $ K_s^0 $ ) , protons and antiprotons for Au + Au collisions at $ \sqrtsNN = 200 $ GeV are presented .	Negative $ v_1 ( y ) $ slope is observed for pions , antiprotons , protons and kaons .	Sizable difference is seen between $ v_1 $ of protons and anti-protons in 5-30 % central collisions .	Anti-flow can explain the negative slope , however , it has difficulties explaining the centrality dependence of the difference between the $ v_1 ( y ) $ slopes of protons and anti-protons .
0	With a help of hydrodynamical models , we explore fundamental modes of gas flow in central parts of a galaxy potential with non-axisymmetric perturbations of various strengths .	Our grid-based algorithm allows us to get a detailed picture of gas dynamics down to about 10 pc from the galaxy center , where the central black hole becomes dominant .	Gas inflow in a bar with an Inner Lindblad Resonance often stops at the nuclear ring .	We find that embedded bars in resonant coupling are unlikely to increase the inflow , but for certain gas parameters in a single bar , inflow to the center develops in a spiral shock , similar to the patterns observed in nuclear discs of real galaxies .	The spiral pattern persists for very weak non-axisymmetries of the potential .
2	The first approach is based on the binary reactions , and the second one is based on the population games theory .	In the work two ways of evolutionary interpretation of entropy model for correspondence matrix calculation are proposed .	Both approaches based on the stochastic chemical kinetic evolution under the detailed balance condition .	Both approaches allow one to understand better possible physical interpretations of the classic model and to obtain the answers for some open questions in neighborhoods branches .	For example , one can propose a selection rule to the unique equilibrium among the set of equilibriums .
0	We present Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA ( ALFALFA ) and follow-up Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ( GMRT ) HI observations of the gas-rich interacting group NGC 3166/9 .	The sensitive ALFALFA data provide a complete census of HI-bearing systems in the group while the high-resolution GMRT data elucidate their origin , enabling one of the first unbiased physical studies of gas-rich dwarf companions and the subsequent identification of second generation , tidal dwarf galaxies in a nearby group .	The ALFALFA maps reveal an extended HI envelope around the NGC 3166/9 group core , which we mosaic at higher resolution using six GMRT pointings spanning ~1 square degree .	A thorough search of the GMRT datacube reveals eight low-mass objects with gas masses ranging from 4x10^7 to 3x10^8 M_sol and total dynamical masses up to 1.4x10^9 M_sol .	A comparison of the HI fluxes measured from the GMRT data to those measured in the ALFALFA data suggests that a significant fraction ( ~60 % ) of the HI is smoothly distributed on scales greater than an arcminute ( ~7 kpc at the NGC 3166/9 distance ) .
0	We discuss the choice of weight functions for the moments of the spectral density for two-point correlators of hadronic currents over a finite energy interval .	Of phenomenological relevance is an analysis of the spectra of tau lepton decay on the energy interval [ 0 , M_tau ] and the low-energy hadron production in e+ e- annihilation .	General arguments are given for the calculability of such moments in perturbation theory using both a finite-order analysis and infinite resummation on the contour .	Nonperturbative contributions emerging from the operator product expansion for two-point correlators are discussed within explicit models for the physical spectra .	The quantitative analysis strongly disfavours weight functions that suppress the high-energy contribution to theoretical moments .
3	The exchange can not occur if the strings meet with very large relative velocity .	We study the dynamics of Nambu -- Goto strings with junctions at which three strings meet .	In particular , we exhibit one simple exact solution and examine the process of intercommuting of two straight strings , in which they exchange partners but become joined by a third string .	We show that there are important kinematical constraints on this process .	This may have important implications for the evolution of cosmic superstring networks and non-abelian string networks .
3	For low neutron star to black hole mass ratios the neutron star transfers mass to the black hole during a few cycles of orbital decay and subsequent widening before finally being disrupted , whereas for ratios near unity the neutron star is already distroyed during its first approach .	Hydrodynamic simulations of the merger of stellar mass black hole - neutron star binaries ( BH/NS ) are compared with mergers of binary neutron stars ( NS/NS ) .	The simulations are Newtonian , but take into account the emission and backreaction of gravitational waves .	The use of a physical nuclear equation of state allows us to include the effects of neutrino emission .	A gas mass between about 0.3 and about 0.7 solar masses is left in an accretion torus around the black hole and radiates neutrinos at a luminosity of several 10^ { 53 } erg/s during an estimated accretion time scale of about 0.1 s. The emitted neutrinos and antineutrinos annihilate into electron-positron pairs with efficiencies of 1-3 % percent and rates of up to 2*10^ { 52 } erg/s , thus depositing an energy of up to 10^ { 51 } erg above the poles of the black hole in a region which contains less than 10^ { -5 } solar masses of baryonic matter .
0	We present the first comprehensive abundance study of the massive , outer halo globular cluster ( GC ) M 75 ( NGC 6864 ) .	This unique system shows a very extended trimodal horizontal branch ( HB ) , but no other clues for multiple populations have been detected in its colour-magnitude diagram ( CMD ) .	Based on high-resolution spectroscopic observations of 16 red giant stars , we derived the abundances of a large variety of alpha , p-capture , iron-peak , and n-capture elements .	We found that the cluster is metal-rich ( [ Fe/H ] = -1.16 +/- 0.02 dex , [ alpha/Fe ] = +0.30 +/- 0.02 dex ) , and shows a marginal spread in [ Fe/H ] of 0.07 dex , typical of most GCs of similar luminosity .	We detected significant variations of O , Na , and Al among our sample , suggesting three different populations .
3	It is shown that near the event horizon , the extremal solutions reduce precisely to the static extremal black hole solutions .	Classical solutions describing charged dilaton black holes accelerating in a background magnetic field have recently been found .	They include the Ernst metric of the Einstein-Maxwell theory as a special case .	We study the extremal limit of these solutions in detail , both at the classical and quantum levels .	For a particular value of the dilaton coupling , these extremal black holes are five dimensional Kaluza-Klein monopoles .
3	and Samuelsson et al .	Very much like the ubiquitous quantum interference of a single particle with itself , quantum interference of two independent , but indistinguishable , particles is also possible .	This interference is a direct result of quantum exchange statistics , however , it is observed only in the joint probability to find the particles in two separated detectors .	Here we report the first observation of such interference fringes between two independent and non-interacting electrons in an interferometer proposed by Yurke et al .	Our experiment resembles the `` Hanbury Brown and Twiss '' ( HBT ) experiment , which was performed with classical waves .
2	We find the Bethe vectors for two -- component and inhomogeneous models .	The integrable close and open chain models can be formulated in terms of generators of the Hecke algebras .	In this review paper , we describe in detail the Bethe ansatz for the XXX and the XXZ integrable close chain models .	We also find the Bethe vectors for the fermionic realization of the integrable XXX and XXZ close chain models by means of the algebraic and coordinate Bethe ansatz .	Special modification of the XXZ closed spin chain model ( `` small polaron model '' ) is consedered .
0	Mass accretion onto ( proto- ) stars at high accretion rates & gt ; 10^-4 M_sun/yr is expected in massive star formation .	We study the evolution of massive protostars at such high rates by numerically solving the stellar structure equations .	In this paper we examine the evolution via disk accretion .	We consider a limiting case of `` cold '' disk accretion , whereby most of the stellar photosphere can radiate freely with negligible backwarming from the accretion flow , and the accreting material settles onto the star with the same specific entropy as the photosphere .	We compare our results to the calculated evolution via spherically symmetric accretion , the opposite limit , whereby the material accreting onto the star contains the entropy produced in the accretion shock front .
2	The asymptotic nature of the chiral expansion places the focus on the first few terms of the expansion .	Chiral effective field theory complements numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) on a space-time lattice .	It provides a model-independent formalism for connecting lattice simulation results at finite volume and a variety of quark masses to the physical world .	Thus , knowledge of the power-counting regime ( PCR ) of chiral effective field theory , where higher-order terms of the expansion may be regarded as negligible , is as important as knowledge of the expansion itself .	Through the consideration of a variety of renormalization schemes and associated parameters , techniques to identify the PCR where results are independent of the renormalization scheme are established .
2	The experiment , housed on board the Russian Resurs-DK1 satellite , was launched on June , 15 2006 in a $ 350\times 600 km $ orbit with an inclination of 70 degrees .	PAMELA is a satellite borne experiment designed to study with great accuracy cosmic rays of galactic , solar , and trapped nature in a wide energy range ( protons : 80 MeV-700 GeV , electrons 50 MeV-400 GeV ) .	Main objective is the study of the antimatter component : antiprotons ( 80 MeV-190 GeV ) , positrons ( 50 MeV-270 GeV ) and search for antimatter with a precision of the order of $ 10^ { -8 } $ ) .	The detector is composed of a series of scintillator counters arranged at the extremities of a permanent magnet spectrometer to provide charge , Time-of-Flight and rigidity information .	Lepton/hadron identification is performed by a Silicon-Tungsten calorimeter and a Neutron detector placed at the bottom of the device .
4	From our results , obtained by linking the simulation boxes back to source redshifts of 4 , we are able to observe the formation of structure in terms of the computed shear , and also note that the major contributions to the shear come from a very broad range of redshifts .	We investigate the effects of weak gravitational lensing in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmology , using an algorithm which evaluates the shear in three dimensions .	The algorithm has the advantage of variable softening for the particles , and our method allows the appropriate angular diameter distances to be applied to every evaluation location within each three-dimensional simulation box .	We investigate the importance of shear in the distance-redshift relation , and find it to be very small .	We also establish clearly defined values for the smoothness parameter in the relation , finding its value to be at least 0.88 at all redshifts in our simulations .
2	Although there are many algorithmic and visual techniques to analyze graphs , none of the existing approaches is able to present the structural information of graphs at large-scale .	Given a large-scale graph with millions of nodes and edges , how to reveal macro patterns of interest , like cliques , bi-partite cores , stars , and chains ?	Furthermore , how to visualize such patterns altogether getting insights from the graph to support wise decision-making ?	Hence , this paper describes StructMatrix , a methodology aimed at high-scalable visual inspection of graph structures with the goal of revealing macro patterns of interest .	StructMatrix combines algorithmic structure detection and adjacency matrix visualization to present cardinality , distribution , and relationship features of the structures found in a given graph .
2	In this paper we propose a method to test whether spatial variation of fundamental constants existed during the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis .	The detection of a spatial variation of the fine-structure constant , alpha , based on study of quasar absorption systems has recently been reported .	The physics that causes this alpha-variation should have other observable manifestations , and this motivates us to look for complementary astrophysical effects .	Using existing measurements of primordial deuterium abundance we find very weak indications that such a signature might exist , but the paucity of measurements precludes any firm conclusion .	We also examine existing quasar absorption spectra data that are sensitive to variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio , mu , and x = ( alpha^2 mu g_p ) for spatial variation .
4	Spiral arms and streamers recently imaged in four FU Ori systems at NIR wavelengths resemble GI-induced structures and support the interpretation that FUors are gravitationally unstable protostellar disks .	Protostellar ( class 0/I ) disks , having masses comparable to those of their nascent host stars , and fed continuously from their natal infalling envelopes , are prone to gravitational instability ( GI ) .	Motivated by advances in near-infrared ( NIR ) adaptive optics imaging and mm-wave interferometry , we explore the observational signatures of GI in disks , using hydrodynamical and Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to synthesize NIR scattered light images and mm dust continuum maps .	Spiral arms induced by GI , located at disk radii of hundreds of AUs , are local overdensities and have their photospheres displaced to higher altitudes above the disk midplane , arms therefore scatter more NIR light from their central stars than inter-arm regions , and are detectable at distances up to 1 kpc by Gemini/GPI , VLT/SPHERE , and Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO .	By contrast , collapsed clumps formed by disk fragmentation have such strong local gravitational fields that their scattering photospheres are at lower altitudes , such fragments appear fainter than their surroundings in NIR scattered light .
1	The calculation of liquid phase cross-sections extends previous treatments to consider multipole polarisabilities and a non-local treatment of exchange while the accuracy of the electron-argon potential is validated through comparison of the calculated gas phase cross-section with experiment .	The transport of excess electrons in liquid argon driven out of equilibrium by an applied electric field is revisited using a multi-term solution of Boltzmann 's equation together with ab initio liquid phase cross-sections calculated using the Dirac-Fock scattering equations .	The results presented highlight the inadequacy of local treatments of exchange that are commonly used in liquid and cluster phase cross-section calculations .	The multi-term Boltzmann equation framework accounting for coherent scattering enables the inclusion of the full anisotropy in the differential cross-section arising from the interaction and the structure factor , without an a priori assumption of quasi-isotropy in the velocity distribution function .	The model , which contains no free parameters and accounts for both coherent scattering and liquid phase screening effects , was found to reproduce well the experimental drift velocities and characteristic energies .
0	We explore Goldstone boson potentials in non-compact cosets of the form SO ( n,1 ) /SO ( n ) .	We employ a geometric approach to find the scalar potential , and focus on the conditions under which it is compact in the large field limit .	We show that such a potential is found for a specific misalignment of the vacuum .	This result has applications in different contexts , such as in Composite Higgs scenarios and theories for the Early Universe .	We work out an example of inflation based on a non-compact coset which makes predictions which are consistent with the current observational data .
3	These photons and nucleons produced within our Supergalactic halo may easily propagate to earth and initiate super-GZK air showers .	If neutrinos are a significant contributor to the matter density of the universe , then they should have $ \sim $ eV mass and cluster in galactic ( super ) cluster halos , and possibly in galactic halos as well .	It was noted in the early 1980 's that cosmic ray neutrinos with energy within $ \delta E/E_R=\Gamma_Z/M_Z \sim 3 % $ of the peak energy $ E_R=4 ( eV/m_ { \nu } ) \times 10^ { 21 } $ eV will annihilate on the nonrelativistic relic antineutrinos ( and vice versa ) to produce the Z-boson with an enhanced , resonant cross section of $ { \cal O } ( G_F ) \sim 10^ { -32 } { cm } ^2 $ .	The result of the resonant neutrino annihilation is a hadronic Z-burst 70 % of the time , which contains , on average , thirty photons and 2.7 nucleons with energies near or above the GZK cutoff energy of $ 5\times 10^ { 19 } $ eV .	Here we show that the probability for each neutrino flavor at its resonant energy to annihilate within the halo of our Supergalactic cluster is likely within an order of magnitude of 1 % , with the exact value depending on unknown aspects of neutrino mixing and relic neutrino clustering .
0	Grover 's algorithm is one of the most important quantum algorithms , which performs the task of searching an unsorted database without a priori probability .	Recently the adiabatic evolution has been used to design and reproduce quantum algorithms , including Grover 's algorithm .	In this paper , we show that quantum search algorithm by adiabatic evolution has two properties that conventional quantum search algorithm does n't have .	Firstly , we show that in the initial state of the algorithm only the amplitude of the basis state corresponding to the solution affects the running time of the algorithm , while other amplitudes do not .	Using this property , if we know a priori probability about the location of the solution before search , we can modify the adiabatic evolution to make the algorithm faster .
3	Nevertheless , extensions to nonlinear systems have thus far relied primarily on the conditions of homogeneity and subhomogeneity , and it has been conjectured that these can be relaxed .	Monotone systems comprise an important class of dynamical systems that are of interest both for their wide applicability and because of their interesting mathematical properties .	It is known that under the property of quasimonotonicity time-delayed systems become monotone , and some remarkable properties have been reported for such systems .	These include , for example , the fact that for linear systems global asymptotic stability of the undelayed system implies global asymptotic stability for the delayed system under arbitrary bounded delays .	Our aim in this paper is to show that this is feasible for a general class of nonlinear monotone systems by deriving convergence results in which simple properties of the undelayed system lead to delay-independent stability .
1	For illustration of these notions and the properties we use the explicitly constructed \textit { Lax semigroups } .	The paper gives a short account of some basic properties of \textit { Dirichlet-to-Neumann } operators $ \Lambda_ { \gamma , \partial\Omega } $ including the corresponding semigroups motivated by the Laplacian transport in anisotropic media ( $ \gamma \neq I $ ) and by elliptic systems with dynamical boundary conditions .	We demonstrate that for a general smooth bounded convex domain $ \Omega \subset \mathbb { R } ^d $ the corresponding { Dirichlet-to-Neumann } semigroup $ \left\ { U ( t ) : = e^ { -t \Lambda_ { \gamma , \partial\Omega } } \right\ } _ { t\geq0 } $ in the Hilbert space $ L^2 ( \partial \Omega ) $ belongs to the \textit { trace-norm } von Neumann-Schatten ideal for any $ t & gt ; 0 $ .	This means that it is in fact an \textit { immediate Gibbs } semigroup .	Recently Emamirad and Laadnani have constructed a \textit { Trotter-Kato-Chernoff } product-type approximating family $ \left\ { ( V_ { \gamma , \partial\Omega } ( t/n ) ) ^n \right\ } _ { n \geq 1 } $ \textit { strongly } converging to the semigroup $ U ( t ) $ for $ n\to\infty $ .
0	We consider the inverse problem of estimating the shape profile of an unknown deposit from a set of eddy current impedance measurements .	The measurements are acquired with an axial probe , which is modeled by a set of coils that generate a magnetic field inside the tube .	For the direct problem , we validate the method that takes into account the tube support plates , highly conductive part , by a surface impedance condition .	For the inverse problem , finite element and shape sensitivity analysis related to the eddy current problem are provided in order to determine the explicit formula of the gradient of a least square misfit functional .	A geometrical-parametric shape inversion algorithm based on cylindrical coordinates is designed to improve the robustness and the quality of the reconstruction .
4	Key Words : Vector Quantization , Grover 's Algorithm , Image Compression , Quantum Algorithm	Many classical encoding algorithms of Vector Quantization ( VQ ) of image compression that can obtain global optimal solution have computational complexity O ( N ) .	A pure quantum VQ encoding algorithm with probability of success near 100 % has been proposed , that performs operations 45sqrt ( N ) times approximately .	In this paper , a hybrid quantum VQ encoding algorithm between classical method and quantum algorithm is presented .	The number of its operations is less than sqrt ( N ) for most images , and it is more efficient than the pure quantum algorithm .
4	We also discuss the distortion of the lattice structure caused by the charge ordering .	We investigate a ( semi- ) metal to insulator transition ( MIT ) realized in geometrically frustrated electron systems on the basis of the Hubbard model on a three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice and a two-dimensional checkerboard lattice .	Using the renormalization group method and mean field analysis , we show that in the half-filling case , MIT occurs as a result of the interplay between geometrical frustration and electron correlation .	In the insulating phase , which has a spin gap , the spin rotational symmetry is not broken , while charge ordering exists .	The charge ordered state is stabilized so as to relax the geometrical frustration in the spin degrees of freedom .
1	The AO H and K ' photometry is calibrated using HST/NICMOS observations in the equivalent filters F160W and F205W obtained by Figer et al. ( 1999 ) ... . After a thorough technical comparison , the Gemini and HST data are used in combination to study the spatial distribution of stellar masses in the Arches cluster ... . A strong colour gradient is observed over the cluster field .	We have analysed high resolution adaptive optics ( AO ) science demonstration data of the young , massive stellar cluster Arches near the Galactic Center , obtained with the Gemini North telescope in combination with the University of Hawai'i AO system Hokupa'a .	The visual extinction increases by Delta A_V ~ 10 mag over a distance of 15 arcsec from the cluster core .	Extinction maps reveal a low-extinction cavity in the densest parts of Arches ( R & lt ; 5 arcsec ) , indicating the depletion of dust due to stellar winds or photo-evaporation .	We correct for the change in extinction over the field and show that the slope of the mass function is strongly influenced by the effects of differential extinction .
2	Our analysis leads to quantitative predictions that are in disagreement with those measured experimentally .	We have studied the composition-induced metal-to-insulator transitions of cation substituted Lithium Titanate , in the forms Li1+xTi2-xO4 and LiAlyTi2-yO4 , utilising a quantum site percolation model , and we argue that such a model provides a very reliable representation of the noninteracting electrons in this material if strong correlations are ignored .	We then determine whether or not such a model of 3d electrons moving on the Ti ( corner-sharing tetrahedral ) sublattice describes the observed metal-to-insulator transitions , with the critical concentration defined by the matching of the mobility edge and the chemical potential .	For example , experimentally for the LiAlyTi2-yO4 compound an Al concentration of y_c approximately 0.33 produces a metal-to-insulator transition , whereas our analysis of a quantum site percolation model predicts y_c approximately 0.83 .	One hypothesis that is consistent with these results is that since strong correlations are ignored in our quantum site percolation model , which includes the effects of configurational disorder only , such strong electronic correlations are both present and important .
3	The latter is employed to quantize the field in the framework of Dimock .	We quantize the massless p-form field that obeys the generalized Maxwell field equations in curved spacetimes of dimension n & gt ; 1 .	We begin by showing that the classical Cauchy problem of the generalized Maxwell field is well posed and that the field possess the expected gauge invariance .	Then the classical phase space is developed in terms of gauge equivalent classes , first in terms of the Cauchy data and then reformulated in terms of Maxwell solutions .	Finally , the resulting algebra of observables is shown to satisfy the wave equation with the usual canonical commutation relations .
2	As the angular rotation frequency $ \Omega $ is increased , the oscillation frequency $ \omega $ of the $ r $ -modes in the thin envelopes deviates appreciably from the asymptotic frequency $ \omega=2m\Omega/l^\prime ( l^\prime+1 ) $ defined in the limit of $ \Omega\to 0 $ , where $ \omega $ is the frequency observed in the corotating frame of the star , and $ m $ and $ l^\prime $ are the indices of the spherical harmonic function $ Y_ { l^\prime } ^m $ representing the angular dependence of the modes .	We study the $ r $ -modes propagating in steadily mass accreting , nuclear burning , and geometrically thin envelopes on the surface of rotating neutron stars .	For the modal analysis , we construct the envelope models which are fully radiaitive or have a convective region .	We find that the fundamental $ r $ -modes in the convective models are destabilized by strong nuclear burning in the convective region .	Because of excessive heating by nuclear buring , the corotating-frame oscillation frequency $ \omega $ of the $ r $ -modes in the convective models becomes larger , and hence the inertial-frame oscillation frequency $ |\sigma| $ becomes smaller , than those of the corresopnding $ r $ -modes in the radiative models , where $ \sigma=\omega-m\Omega $ is negative for the $ r $ -modes of positive $ m $ .
0	Near ultraviolet observations of OH+ and OH in diffuse molecular clouds reveal a preference for different environments .	The dominant absorption feature in OH+ arises from a main component seen in CH+ ( that with the highest CH+/CH column density ratio ) , while OH follows CN absorption .	This distinction provides new constraints on OH chemistry in these clouds .	Since CH+ detections favor low-density gas with small fractions of molecular hydrogen , this must be true for OH+ as well , confirming OH+ and H2O+ observations with the Herschel Space Telescope .	Our observed correspondence indicates that the cosmic ray ionization rate derived from these measurements pertains to mainly atomic gas .
2	Mainly , on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) fifth year , the data indicates that more than 90 % of the total energy density of the universe is dark .	In this work we review some of the theoretical efforts and experimental evidences related to Dark matter and Dark energy problems in the universe .	These dilemmas show us how incomplete our knowledge of gravity is , and how our concepts about the universe must at least be revised .	Here we discuss the impact of these phenomena imprint on gravitational and quantum field theory 's standard history .	Moreover , we point out some recent and upcoming projects on Cosmology intended to shed light on these problems .
1	For this purpose we prove that if the partial transpose of a two-qutrit NPT state has two non-positive eigenvalues , then the state is distillable .	We show that any bipartite quantum state of rank four is distillable , when the partial transpose of the state has at least one negative eigenvalue , i.e. , the state is NPT .	We further construct a parametrized two-qutrit NPT entangled state of rank five which is not 1-distillable , and show that it is not $ n $ -distillable for any given $ n $ when the parameter is sufficiently small .	This state has the smallest rank among all 1-undistillable NPT states .	We conjecture that the state is not distillable .
1	Axion is a viable particle candidate for dark matter .	Dark matter is a focused issue in galactic evolution and cosmology .	Its interaction with photon is an effective way to detect it , e.g. , pseudoscalar-photon interaction will generate vacuum dichroism in a magnetic field .	Motivated to measure the QED vacuum birefringence and to detect pseudoscalar-photon interaction , we started to build up the Q & amp ; A experiment ( QED [ Quantum Electrodynamics ] and Axion experiment ) in 1994 .	In this talk , we first give a brief historical account of planet hunting and dark matter evidence .
1	In particular the scale-free structure of real-world social networks allows unlikely diseases with low infection rates to spread and become endemic .	The structure of social contact networks strongly influences the dynamics of epidemic diseases .	However , in particular for potentially fatal diseases , also the impact of the disease on the social structure can not be neglected , leading to a complex interplay .	Here , we consider the growth of a network by preferential attachment from which nodes are simultaneously removed due to an SIR epidemic .	We show that increased infectiousness increases the prevalence of the disease and simultaneously causes a transition from scale-free to exponential topology .
1	This is achieved by integrating out auxiliary field components of the double metric in an iterative procedure that induces an infinite number of higher-derivative corrections .	We relate the unconstrained `double metric ' of the ` $ \alpha ' $ -geometry ' formulation of double field theory to the constrained generalized metric encoding the spacetime metric and b-field .	As an application we prove that , to first order in $ \alpha ' $ and to all orders in fields , the deformed gauge transformations are Green-Schwarz-deformed diffeomorphisms .	We also prove that to first order in $ \alpha ' $ the spacetime action encodes precisely the Green-Schwarz deformation with Chern-Simons forms based on the torsionless gravitational connection .	This seems to be in tension with suggestions in the literature that T-duality requires a torsionful connection , but we explain that these assertions are ambiguous since actions that use different connections are related by field redefinitions .
4	It is shown that under such circumstances and with $ J/\Psi $ disintegration in nuclear matter added , $ J/\Psi $ suppression evaluated agrees well with NA38 and NA50 data .	A model for $ J/\Psi $ suppression at a high energy heavy ion collision is presented .	The main ( and the only ) reason for the suppression is $ J/\Psi $ inelastic scattering within hadron matter .	The hadron matter is in the form of an evolving multi-component point-like non-interacting gas .	The estimations of the sound velocity in the gas and the approximate pattern of cooling caused by the longitudinal expansion are also presented .
2	In particular , it has long been planned for New Horizons to use its Alice ultraviolet spectrograph during solar occultation observations of Charon on July 14 , 2015 , for this purpose .	Observations of Pluto 's companion planet Charon have so far yielded no compelling evidence for a persistent atmosphere .	However , with the upcoming encounter of New Horizons at the Pluto-Charon system , sensitivity to detection of a possible Charon atmosphere will increase by orders of magnitude .	But in the days before closest encounter , the Alice instrument will also acquire spectra of reflected sunlight from Charon 's surface .	We examine the effect of absorption by several possible atmospheres around Charon composed of N $ _2 $ , CH $ _4 $ , and CO , with plausible surface pressures of 0.1 , 1 , and 10 nanobar ( nbar ) .
4	Interestingly , for biaxial strain , a band crossing effect occurs at the valence band maximum close to a 8\ % strain , leading to a dramatic increase of the hole effective mass .	A new two-dimensional material , the C $ _2 $ N holey 2D ( C $ _2 $ N- $ h $ 2D ) crystal , has recently been synthesized .	Here we investigate the strain effects on the properties of this new material by first-principles calculations .	We show that the material is quite soft with a small stiffness constant and can sustain large strains $ \geq 12\ % $ .	It remains a direct gap semiconductor under strain and the bandgap size can be tuned in a wide range as large as 1 eV .
1	Methods - Using multi-frequency VLA observations we have derived sub-arcsecond resolution images of the total intensity , polarisation , and rotation measure ( RM ) distributions .	Aims - We report new Very Large Array polarimetric observations of Compact Steep-Spectrum ( CSS ) sources at 8.4 , 15 , and 23GHz .	Results heading - We present multi-frequency VLA polarisation observations of CSS sources .	About half of the sources are point-like even at the resolution of about 0.1x0.1 arcseconds .	The remaining sources have double or triple structure .
2	The first controller achieves attitude synchronization for a group of spacecraft with a leaderless communication topology having a directed spanning tree .	This paper addresses the distributed attitude synchronization problem of multiple spacecraft with unknown inertia matrices .	Two distributed adaptive controllers are proposed for the cases with and without a virtual leader to which a time-varying reference attitude is assigned .	The second controller guarantees that all spacecraft track the reference attitude if the virtual leader has a directed path to all other spacecraft .	Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the results .
1	The spectra above 2 keV are modeled by a power-law with a photon-index of 2.56+/-0.06 .	We present results from a 50 ks observation of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564 with the Chandra HETGS .	We confirm the presence of the soft excess below about 1.5 keV .	If we fit the excess with blackbody model , the best-fit temperature is 0.124 keV .	Ark 564 has been reported to show a peculiar emission line-like feature at 1 keV in various observations using lower resolution detectors , and the Chandra grating spectroscopy rules out an origin of blends of several narrow emission lines .
0	At the end of the inflationary stage of the early universe , profuse particle production leads to the reheating of the universe .	Such explosive particle production is due to parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations for the unbroken symmetry case ( appropriate for chaotic inflation ) , or spinodal instabilities in the broken symmetry phase ( which is the case in new inflation ) .	The self-consistent methods presented in these lectures are the only approaches , so far , that lead to reliable quantitative results on the reheating mechanism in the inflationary universe .	They fully use the field theoretical Schwinger-Keldysh out of equilibrium method in a non-perturbative way .	These approaches take into account the non-linear interaction between the quantum modes and exactly conserve energy ( covariantly ) .
2	The new results are applied to several phenomenological scenarios which are in accordance with the recent discovery at the LHC .	We compute the total cross section for the production of a light CP even Higgs boson within the framework of supersymmetric QCD up to next-to-next-to-leading order .	Technical subtleties in connection to the evaluation of three-loop Feynman integrals with many mass scales are discussed in detail and explicit results for the counterterms of the evanescent couplings are provided .	In a large part of the still allowed parameter space the $ K $ factor of the supersymmetric theory is close to the one of the Standard Model .	However , for the case where one of the top squarks is light , a deviation of more than 5 % in the next-to-next-to-leading order prediction of the cross section can be observed where at the same time the predicted Higgs boson mass has a value of about 125 GeV .
2	The global version of this diagnostic tool is very similar to the cycle of Lorenz , but the local counterpart contains several additional terms , with zonal , eddy and static-stability components close to definitions already given by Pearce .	A diagnostic package is derived from the concept of specific available enthalpy , leading to the definition of a local and complete energy cycle .	It is useful to understand the transformations of energy occurring at any particular pressure level or pressure layer of a limited area domain .	The new cycle takes into account the flow of energy components across the vertical and horizontal boundaries , with additional conversion terms involving potential energy , leading to accurate computations of dissipation and generation terms obtained as residuals .	A new accurate temporal scheme is proposed in order to allow use of a large time interval in future numerical applications .
2	We show that it is indeed possible to explain the `excess ' power measured by the CBI experiment on small angular scales as originating from the SZ effect without ( arbitrary ) rescaling the value of $ \sigma_8 $ , the mass variance parameter .	The angular power spectrum of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich ( SZ ) effect is calculated in the $ \Lambda $ CDM cosmological model with the aim of investigating its detailed dependence on the cluster population , gas morphology , and gas evolution .	We calculate the power spectrum for three different mass functions , compute it within the framework of isothermal and polytropic gas distributions , and explore the effect of gas evolution on the magnitude and shape of the power spectrum .	The need for a self-consistent choice of the basic parameters characterizing the cluster population is emphasized .	In particular , we stress the need for a consistent choice of the value of $ \sigma_8 $ extracted from fitting theoretical models for the mass function to the observed cluster X-ray temperature function , such that it agrees with the mass-temperature relation used to evaluate the cluster Comptonization parameter .
3	The BzK colours of the emitters suggest that at least 80 % of our sample are likely to be H-alpha emitters ( HAEs ) at z=2.23 .	We present the results of a narrow-band ( H2S1 , 2.121/0.021um ) imaging search with WFCAM/UKIRT for H-alpha emitters around several potential signposts of rare ( 10^-7-10^-8 Mpc^-3 ) over-dense regions at z=2.23 : an over-density of QSOs ( 2QZ cluster ) , a powerful , high-redshift radio galaxy ( HzRG ) , and a concentration of submillimetre galaxies ( SMGs ) and optically faint radio galaxies ( OFRGs ) .	In total , we detect 137 narrow-band emitter candidates down to emission-line fluxes of 0.5-1 x 10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2 , across a total area of 0.56 sq .	degrees ( 2.1 x 10^5 comoving Mpc at z=2.23 ) in these fields .	This is one of the largest HAE samples known at z & gt ; 2 .
4	Such large branching fractions can be naturally obtained in dark $ U ( 1 ) _F $ models explaining the origin and hierarchy of the standard model Yukawa couplings .	Motivated by dark-photon $ \bar { \gamma } $ scenarios extensively considered in the literature , we explore experimentally allowed models where the Higgs boson coupling to photon and dark photon $ H\gamma\bar { \gamma } $ can be enhanced .	Correspondingly , large rates for the $ H\to \gamma\bar \gamma $ decay become plausible , giving rise to one monochromatic photon with $ E^ { \gamma } \simeq m_H/2 $ ( i.e. , more than twice the photon energy in the rare standard-model decay $ H\to \gamma Z\to\gamma\bar\nu\nu $ ) , and a similar amount of missing energy .	We perform a model-independent study of this exotic resonant monophoton signature at the LHC , featuring a distinctive $ E^ { \gamma } _T $ peak around 60 GeV , and $ \gamma+\slashed { E } _T $ transverse invariant mass ruled by $ m_H $ .	At parton level , we find a $ 5\ , \sigma $ sensitivity of the present LHC data set for a $ H\to \gamma\bar { \gamma } $ branching fraction of $ 0.5\ % $ .
1	We show that , when the configuration space is finite , a least-action principle does not exist for such systems .	In this paper we study the problem of the existence of a least-action principle for invertible , second-order dynamical systems , discrete in time and space .	We dichotomize discrete dynamical systems with infinite configuration spaces into those of finite type for which this theorem continues to hold , and those not of finite type for which it is possible to construct a least-action principle .	We also show how to recover an action by restriction of the phase space of certain second-order discrete dynamical systems .	We provide numerous examples to illustrate each of these results .
4	The present contribution , proposes the partial cooperation , namely coordination between the two coexisting transmitters in order to reduce interferences and enhance the performance of the whole system , while maintaining moderate system complexity .	The constantly increasing demand for interactive broadband satellite communications is driving current research to explore novel system architectures that reuse frequency in a more aggressive manner .	To this end , the topic of dual satellite systems , in which satellites share spatial ( i.e.same coverage area ) and spectral ( i.e.full frequency reuse ) degrees of freedom is introduced .	In each multibeam satellite , multiuser interferences are mitigated by employing zero forcing precoding with realistic per antenna power constraints .	However , the two sets of users that the transmitters are separately serving , interfere .
2	With analytical methods , we obtain the exact expression for the critical chemical potential as $ \mu_ { c } = 1 + \sqrt { 1+m^2 } $ , which has also been generalized to higher dimensions as $ \mu_c \thickapprox a + \sqrt { m^2-m_ { BF } ^2 } $ in this work .	We study the holographic description of a superconductor by the $ AdS_ { 3 } /CFT_ { 2 } $ correspondence .	The system is constructed with a Maxwell field and a charged scalar field coupled in the ( 2+1 ) -dimensional AdS soliton background .	Around the phase transition points , we find a correspondence between the value of the scalar field at the tip and the scalar operator at infinity .	We also arrive at the classical second order phase transition threshold exponent $ \beta=\frac { 1 } { 2 } $ as the same as the mean field theory near the critical chemical potential .
2	These issues are examined quantitatively on two types of 2D models , i.e. , ( a ) Rashba model for $ n $ -type GaAs , and ( b ) Luttinger model for $ p $ -type GaAs .	The role of the relaxation due to the impurity scattering and/or the contacts to leads/electrodes are studied for the spin Hall effect ( SHE ) .	Relaxation is essential to attain the steady state and also to the spin accumulation , but has been considered to be harmful for the intrinsic SHE ( ISHE ) .	It is found that ISHE is robust against the realistic strength of the disorder producing the observable amount of the spin accumulation .	Especially in model ( b ) the spin current and the accumulation are an order of magnitude larger than those in model ( a ) .
1	A new 6d action is the ( 1,0 ) supersymmetric extension of the 6d Born-Infeld action .	The supersymmetric Born-Infeld actions describing gauge-fixed D-5- and D-3-branes in ambient six-dimensional ( 6d ) spacetime are constructed in superspace .	It is related via dimensional reduction to another remarkable 4d action describing the N=2 supersymmetric extension of the Born-Infeld-Nambu-Goto action with two real scalars .	Both actions are the Goldstone actions associated with partial ( 1/2 ) spontaneous breaking of extended supersymmetry having 16 supercharges down to 8 supercharges .	Both actions can be put into the `non-linear sigma-model ' form by using certain non-linear superfield constraints .
2	We deduced these Weyl equations without gauge vector from quadric surface in three dimensional oriented projective geometry .	In the standard model , electroweak theory is based on chiral gauge symmetry , which only contains massless fermions and gauge vectors .	So the fundamental field equations are Weyl equations including gauge vectors .	It showed that Weyl equations were equations of generating lines in the quadric surface .	In other word , the geometric correspondence of spinor is generating lines of quadric surface in momentum space .
1	The capacities can be permanently or temporarily owned by the decision maker .	In networks , there are often more than one source of capacity .	Depending on the nature of sources , we identify the permanent capacity , spot market capacity and contract capacity .	We use a scenario tree to model the uncertainty , and build a multi-stage stochastic integer program that can incorporate multiple sources and multiple types of capacities in a general network .	We propose two solution methodologies for the problem .
3	A new twofold integration representation is found which can be easily evaluated numerically .	We consider the spectral statistics of the superposition of a random diagonal matrix and a GUE matrix .	By means of two alternative superanalytic approaches , the coset method and the graded eigenvalue method , we derive the two-level correlation function $ X_2 ( r ) $ and the number variance $ \Sigma^2 ( r ) $ .	The graded eigenvalue approach leads to an expression for $ X_2 ( r ) $ which is valid for all values of the parameter $ \lambda $ governing the strength of the GUE admixture on the unfolded scale .	For $ \lambda \gg 1 $ the Breit-Wigner width $ \Gamma_1 $ measured in units of the mean level spacing $ D $ is much larger than unity .
0	The BCS electron-phonon mechanism and the unconventional 'hole mechanism ' have been proposed as explanations for the high temperature superconductivity observed in $ MgB_2 $ .	It is proposed that a critical test of which theory is correct is the dependence of $ T_c $ on hole doping : the hole mechanism predicts that $ T_c $ will drop rapidly to zero as holes are added , while the electron-phonon mechanism appears to predict increasing $ T_c $ for a substantial range of hole doping .	Furthermore , the hole mechanism and electron-phonon mechanism differ qualitatively in their predictions of the effect on $ T_c $ of change in the $ B-B $ distances .	We discuss predictions of the hole mechanism for a variety of observables as a function of doping , emphasizing the expected differences and similarities with the electron-phonon explanation .	The hole mechanism predicts coherence length and penetration depth to increase and decrease monotonically with hole doping respectively .
3	Designed by assembling molecular building blocks of triphenyl-metal compounds with strong spin-orbit coupling into a hexagonal lattice , this new classes of organic TIs are shown to exhibit nontrivial topological edge states that are robust against significant lattice strain .	Topological insulators ( TIs ) are a recently discovered class of materials having insulating bulk electronic states but conducting boundary states distinguished by nontrivial topology .	So far , several generations of TIs have been theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed , all based on inorganic materials .	Here , based on first-principles calculations , we predict a family of two-dimensional organic TIs made of organometallic lattices .	We envision that organic TIs will greatly broaden the scientific and technological impact of TIs .
1	These are particularly challenging and necessary when exploring processes that exhibit long-range correlations .	Identifying and quantifying memory are often critical steps in developing a mechanistic understanding of stochastic processes .	The most common signatures employed rely on second-order temporal statistics and lead , for example , to identifying long memory in processes with power-law autocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $ 1/2 $ .	However , most stochastic processes hide their memory in higher-order temporal correlations .	Information measures -- -specifically , divergences in the mutual information between a process ' past and future ( excess entropy ) and minimal predictive memory stored in a process ' causal states ( statistical complexity ) -- -provide a different way to identify long memory in processes with higher-order temporal correlations .
3	This should help isolate the CMB polarization fluctuations that are due to reionization , allowing both cleaning of the patchy reionization polarization signal as a contaminating source of confusion to other signals and a measurement of the primordial quadrupole that would be measured at various locations in the universe at the epoch of reionization .	Large fluctuations in the electron column density can occur during the reionization process .	We investigate the possibility of deriving the electron density fluctuations through detailed mapping of the redshifted 21-cm emission from the neutral medium during reionization .	We find that the electron-scattering optical depth and 21-cm differential brightness temperature are strongly anti-correlated , allowing optical depth estimates based entirely on redshifted 21-cm measurements .	This latter application in principle allows mapping of the primordial density field at z~1100 over a large fraction of the Hubble volume .
4	These percentages are nearly identical to those found for luminous , low-redshift clusters of galaxies , suggesting little evolution in cluster cores since z~0.4 and that heating and cooling mechanisms may already have stabilised by this epoch .	We present a Chandra study of 38 X-ray luminous clusters of galaxies in the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample ( BCS ) that lie at z~0.15-0.4 .	We find that the majority of clusters at moderate redshift generally have smooth , relaxed morphologies with some evidence for mild substructure perhaps indicative of recent minor merger activity .	Using spatially-resolved spectral analyses , cool cores appear to still be common at these redshifts .	At a radius of 50 kpc , we find that at least 55 per cent of the clusters in our sample exhibit signs of mild cooling [ t ( cool ) & lt ; 10 Gyr ] , while in the central bin at least 34 per cent demonstrate signs of strong cooling [ t ( cool ) & lt ; 2 Gyr ] .
0	Several experimental studies have referred to the grain boundary ( GB ) defect as the origin of the ferromagnetism in ZnO .	However , the mechanism of this hypothesis has never been confirmed .	Present study investigates the atomic structure and the effect of point defects in a ZnO GB using the GGA+U approximation .	The relaxed GB possesses large periodicity and channels with 8 and 10 numbered atoms having 4 and 3 fold coordination .	Unlike O vacancy ( VO ) , Zn vacancy ( VZn ) is preferentially aggregated at the GB , relative to the bulk-like region , indicating the possibility of obtaining p-type conductivity in polycrystalline ZnO .
3	The complexity of this problem has been particularly studied for q ranging over the class of self-join-free Boolean conjunctive queries .	A relational database is said to be uncertain if primary key constraints can possibly be violated .	A repair ( or possible world ) of an uncertain database is obtained by selecting a maximal number of tuples without ever selecting two distinct tuples with the same primary key value .	For any Boolean query q , CERTAINTY ( q ) is the problem that takes an uncertain database db on input , and asks whether q is true in every repair of db .	A research challenge is to determine , given q , whether CERTAINTY ( q ) belongs to complexity classes FO , P , or coNP-complete .
1	The photometry has be obtained through the EROS project whose main purpose is the search for baryonic dark matter in the Galactic halo .	We present Fourier analysis at 490\ , nm for 87 Cepheid light curves in the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud .	The very high quality of the photometry and the good phase coverage enable us to obtain accurate Fourier decomposition of the ligh curves .	As a consequence we confirm that the so-called s-Cepheids are overtone pulsators and represent about 30 $ \ % $ of our sample , whereas the Classical Cepheids are fundamental pulsators .	We have identified a number of features in plots of amplitude ratios and phase differences versus period .
2	92 , 3060 ( 1988 ) ] , and the Thomas-Fermi approximation for the kinetic energy .	We derive a non-empirical , orbital-free density functional for the total energy of interacting electrons in two dimensions .	The functional consists of a local formula for the interaction energy , where we follow the lines introduced by Parr for three-dimensional systems [ R. G. Parr , J. Phys.Chem .	The freedom from orbitals and from the Hartree integral makes the proposed approximation numerically highly efficient .	The total energies obtained for confined two-dimensional systems are in a good agreement with the standard local-density approximation within density-functional theory , and considerably more accurate than the Thomas-Fermi approximation .
2	In contrast , Jupiter-like and less massive Saturn-like giant planets are able to survive through the base of the convection zone of a 1.22 solar-mass star .	The evolution of a giant planet within the stellar envelope of a main-sequence star is investigated as a possible mechanism for enhancing the stellar metallicities of the parent stars of extrasolar planetary systems .	Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a planet subject to impacting stellar matter indicate that the envelope of a Jupiter-like giant planet can be completely stripped in the outer stellar convection zone of a solar-mass star .	Although strongly dependent on details of planetary interior models , partial or total dissolution of giant planets can result in significant enhancements in the metallicity of host stars with masses between about 1.0 and 1.3 solar masses .	The implications of these results with regard to planetary orbital migration are briefly discussed .
0	We study the transverse momentum ( $ p_T $ ) spectrum of charged particles produced in deep inelastic scattering ( DIS ) at small Bjorken $ x $ in the central region between the current jet and the proton remnants .	We calculate the spectrum at large $ p_T $ with the BFKL $ \ln ( 1/x ) $ resummation included and then repeat the calculation with it omitted .	We find that data favour the former .	We normalize our BFKL predictions by comparing with HERA data for DIS containing a forward jet .	The shape of the $ x $ distribution of DIS + jet data are also well described by BFKL dynamics .
0	This article considers the task of automatically inducing role-semantic annotations in the FrameNet paradigm for new languages .	We propose a general framework that is based on annotation projection , phrased as a graph optimization problem .	It is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to reduce the human effort involved in creating role-semantic resources .	Within this framework , we present projection models that exploit lexical and syntactic information .	We provide an experimental evaluation on an English-German parallel corpus which demonstrates the feasibility of inducing high-precision German semantic role annotation both for manually and automatically annotated English data .
4	M3 and M13 are thus an extreme case of the `` second parameter problem '' in HB morphology .	We present preliminary results from HST/WFPC2 observations of the central regions of the of the Galactic globular clusters M13 and M3 .	The clusters are almost identical in most respects including chemical composition , but there are dramatic differences in both the horizontal branch ( HB ) and blue straggler ( BSS ) populations .	The M13 HB has a long blue tail extending 4.5 mag in V , reaching well below the level of the main sequence turn-off .	M3 has no such feature .
2	We investigate in detail the effects of Mn doping on magneto-transport properties in Ba ( Fe $ _ { 1-x } $ Mn $ _x $ As ) $ _2 $ for elucidating the intrinsic reason .	In Fe pnictide ( Pn ) superconducting materials , neither Mn- nor Cr- doping to the Fe site induces superconductivity , even though hole carriers are generated .	This is in strong contrast with the superconductivity appearing when holes are introduced by alkali metal substitution on the insulating blocking layers .	The negative Hall coefficient for $ x $ = 0 estimated in the low magnetic field ( $ B $ ) regime gradually increases as $ x $ increases , and its sign changes to a positive one at $ x $ = 0.020 .	Hall resistivities as well as simultaneous interpretation using the magnetoconductivity tensor including both longitudinal and transverse transport components clarify that minority holes with high mobility are generated by the Mn doping via spin density wave ( SDW ) transition at low temperatures , while original majority electrons and holes residing in the parabolic-like Fermi surfaces ( FSs ) of the semimetallic Ba ( FeAs ) $ _2 $ are negligibly affected .
4	The outcome is a powerful framework satisfying the requirements of modularity and openness for further thesaurus extension and updating , interlinking among thesauri , and exploitability from other systems .	The paper proposes an approach to transcend multicultural and multilingual barriers in the use and reuse of geographical data at the European level .	The approach aims at sharing scientific terms in the field of nature conservation with the goal of assisting different user communities with metadata compilation and information discovery .	A multi-thesauri solution is proposed , based on a Common Thesaurus Framework for Nature Conservation , where different well-known Knowledge Organization Systems are assembled and shared .	It has been designed according to semantic web and W3C recommendations employing SKOS standard models and Linked Data to publish the thesauri as a whole in machine-understandable format .
3	The stationary value I_c has a power-law dependence on the repair probability p_re .	With a simple attack and repair evolution model , we investigate the stability and structural changes of the Erdos-Renyi random graphs ( RG ) and Barabasi-Albert scale-free ( SF ) networks .	We introduce a new quantity , invulnerability I ( s ) , to describe the stability of the system .	We find that both RG and SF networks can evolve to a stationary state .	We also analyze the effects of the repair strategy to the attack tolerance of the networks .
2	We also obtain a new decomposition theory of right selfinjective von Neumann regular rings .	The rings whose simple right modules are absolutely pure are called right $ SAP $ -rings .	We give a new characterization of right $ SAP $ rings , right $ V $ rings , and von Neumann regular rings .	The relationships between $ SAP $ -rings , $ V $ -rings , and von Neumann regular rings are explored .	Some recent results obtained by Faith are generalized and the results of Wu-Xia are strengthened .
4	Small heads should always scale with small memories .	The material bases of information - paper , computer discs - usually scale with information quantity .	Large quantities of information usually require large material bases .	Conventional wisdom has it that human long-term memory locates within brain tissue , and so might be expected to scale with brain size which , in turn , depends on cranial capacity .	Large memories , as in savants , should always require large heads .
1	We apply a model in which the two-level system , characterized by a direction in space , is coupled to the strain field of the phonon via a tensor of coupling constants .	We calculate the scattering rates of phonons on two-level systems in disordered trigonal and hexagonal crystals .	The structure of the tensor of coupling constants is similar to the structure of the tensor of elastic stiffness constants , in the sense that they are determined by the same symmetry transformations .	In this way , we emphasize the anisotropy of the interaction of elastic waves with the ensemble of two-level systems in disordered crystals .	We also point to the fact that the ratio $ \gamma_l/\gamma_t $ has a much broader range of allowed values in disordered crystals than in isotropic solids .
0	Experiments aboard the Ulysses spacecraft discovered quasi-periodic bursts of relativistic electrons and of radio emissions with ~40-minute period ( QP-40 ) from the south pole of Jupiter in February 1992 .	Such polar QP-40 burst activities were found to correlate well with arrivals of high-speed solar winds at Jupiter .	We advance the physical scenario that the inner radiation belt ( IRB ) within ~2-3 Jupiter 's radius , where ralativistic electrons are known to be trapped via synchrotron emissions , can execute global QP-40 magnetoinertial oscillations excited by arrivals of high-speed solar winds .	Modulated by such QP-40 IRB oscillations , relativistic electrons trapped in the IRB may escape from the magnetic circumpolar regions during a certain phase of each 40-min period to form circumpolar QP-40 electron bursts .	Highly beamed synchrotron emissions from such QP-40 burst electrons with small pitch angles relative to Jovian magnetic field at ~30-40 Jupiter radius give rise to QP-40 radio bursts with typical frequencies & lt ; 0.2MHz .
1	As a novel branch of visual saliency , co-saliency detection refers to discovery of the common and salient foregrounds existed in two or more relevant images , and can be more widely used in many computer vision tasks .	Co-saliency detection is a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area in computer vision community .	The existing co-saliency detection algorithms mainly consist of three components : extracting effective features to represent the image regions , exploring the informative cues or factors to characterize co-saliency , and designing effective computational framework to formulate co-saliency .	Although enormous methods have been developed , a deep review of the literatures concerning about the co-saliency detection technique is still lacking .	In this paper , we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the fundamentals , challenges , and applications in co-saliency detection area .
4	We forecast constraints on these models achievable with forthcoming data sets .	The detection of primordial non-Gaussianity could provide a powerful means to test various inflationary scenarios .	Although scale-invariant non-Gaussianity ( often described by the $ f_ { NL } $ formalism ) is currently best constrained by the CMB , single-field models with changing sound speed can have strongly scale-dependent non-Gaussianity .	Such models could evade the CMB constraints but still have important effects at scales responsible for the formation of cosmological objects such as clusters and galaxies .	We compute the effect of scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianity on cluster number counts as a function of redshift , using a simple ansatz to model scale-dependent features .
0	Stochastic acceleration of $ ^3 $ He and $ ^4 $ He from a thermal background by parallel propagating turbulent plasma waves with a single power-law spectrum of the wavenumber is studied .	In the model , both ions interact with several resonant modes .	When one of these modes dominates , the acceleration rate is reduced considerably .	At low energies , this happens for $ ^4 $ He , but not for $ ^3 $ He where contributions from the two stronger modes are comparable so that acceleration of $ ^3 $ He is very efficient .	As a result , the acceleration of $ ^4 $ He is suppressed by a barrier below $ \sim 100 $ keV nucleon $ ^ { -1 } $ and there is a prominent quasi-thermal component in the $ ^4 $ He spectra , while almost all the injected $ ^3 $ He ions are accelerated to high energies .
3	We find that supersymmetry on the Coulomb branch is dynamically broken as a consequence of the strong dynamics of SU ( 2 ) gauge symmetry while the supersymmetric vacuum on the Higgs branch remains .	We investigate supersymmetry breaking meta-stable vacua in N=2 , SU ( 2 ) \times U ( 1 ) gauge theory with N_f=2 massless flavors perturbed by the addition of small N=1 preserving mass terms in a presence of a Fayet-Iliopoulos term .	We derive the low energy effective theory by using the exact results of N=2 supersymmetric QCD and examine the effective potential .	At the classical level , the theory has supersymmetric vacua on Coulomb and Higgs branches .	We also estimate the lifetimes of the local minima on the Coulomb branch .
0	We present here a machine that is capable of extracting work from a single heat bath .	Although no significant temperature gradient is involved in the operation of the machine , yet the Carnot efficiency as high as one is achievable .	Working of the machine is explained on the basis of a demon suggested by Maxwell .	Utilizing the kinetic energy spectrum of the molecules in solution , the demon can send `` hotter '' molecules to a higher gravitational potential at the expense of their own energies .	Difference in chemical potentials due to concentration gradients and use of semi-permeable membranes ensure the continuing cyclic process .
0	Halo coronal mass ejections ( HCMEs ) originating from regions close to the center of the Sun are likely to be geoeffective .	Assuming that the shape of HCMEs is a cone and they propagate with constant angular widths and velocities , at least in their early phase , we have developed a technique ( Michalek et al .	2003 ) which allowed us to obtain the space speed , width and source location .	We apply this technique to obtain the parameters of all full HCMEs observed by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) mission 's Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph ( LASCO ) experiment until the end of 2002 .	Using this data we examine which parameters determine the geoeffectiveness of HCMEs .
1	The contribution of this paper is threefold .	Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is an imaging technology designed to probe anatomical architectures of biological samples in an in vivo and non-invasive manner through measuring water diffusion .	First it proposes a new method to identify and estimate multiple diffusion directions within a voxel through a new and identifiable parametrization of the widely used multi-tensor model .	Unlike many existing methods , this method focuses on the estimation of diffusion directions rather than the diffusion tensors .	Second , this paper proposes a novel direction smoothing method which greatly improves direction estimation in regions with crossing fibers .
4	Then , current results on symmetric fiber bundles are generalized to noncommutative connections and an extension of the Witten ansatz is given .	Endomorphisms algebras can replace the concept of principal fiber bundle .	Gauge theories are reformulated within this algebraic framework and further generalized to unify ordinary connections and Higgs fields .	A 'noncommutative Maxwell ' model is built starting from non trivial fiber bundles thus requiring the development of the notion of Riemannian structure .	The tools involved in the study of associative algebras are presented and an algebraic method to characterize the usual Chern-Weil morphism is proposed .
2	Due to the inter-temporal nature of the market payoff , we introduce a two step transaction with single and mixed group of interacting traders .	The \ $ -Game was recently introduced as an extension of the Minority Game .	In this paper we compare this model with the well know Minority Game and the Majority Game models .	When the population is composed of two different group of \ $ -traders , they show an anti-imitative behavior .	However , when they interact with minority or majority players the \ $ -population imitates the usual behavior of these players .
4	Such description provides a thorough understanding of the phenomena , explains all the main features of their complex behaviour , and enables to control the system via the resonator parameters : eigenfrequencies , Q-factors , and coupling coefficients .	Superresolution , extraordinary transmission , total absorption , and localization of electromagnetic waves are currently attracting growing attention .	These phenomena are related to different physical objects and are usually studied within the context of different , sometimes rather sophisticated , physical approaches .	Remarkably , all these seemingly unrelated phenomena owe their origin to the same underlying physical mechanism - wave interaction with an open resonator .	Here we show that it is possible to describe all of these effects in a unified way , mapping each system onto a simple resonator model .
2	We obtain global material parameters , directly measurable with spectroscopic ellipsometry and distinguishable from mere wave parameters , by using the generalized dispersion equation for uniaxial crystals along with existing homogenization methods .	We present a general method for retrieving the effective tensorial permittivity of any uniaxially anisotropic metamaterial .	By relaxing the usually imposed condition of non-magnetic metal/dielectric metamaterials , we also retrieve the permeability tensor and show that hyperbolic metamaterials exhibit a strong diamagnetic response in the visible regime .	Our method is analytically and experimentally verified for Ag/SiO2 planar metamaterials with varying number of layers and compared to the effective medium theory .	We also propose an experimental method for retrieving material parameters using methods other than ellipsometry .
2	This fact leads to introduce the notion of universal $ \alpha $ -central extension .	We develop a theory of universal central extensions of Hom-Lie algebras .	Classical results of universal central extensions of Lie algebras can not be completely extended to Hom-Lie algebras setting , because of the composition of two central extensions is not central .	Classical results as the existence of a universal central extension of a perfect Hom-Lie algebra remains true , but others as the central extensions of the middle term of a universal central extension is split only holds for $ \alpha $ -central extensions .	A homological characterization of universal ( $ \alpha $ ) -central extensions is given .
1	In the case of three generation oscillations , superpartner production at the LHC and NLC may lead to an observable $ CP $ -violating signal $ N ( e^+\mu^- ) - N ( \mu^+e^- ) $ .	In supersymmetric theories the charged sleptons of different generations may oscillate amongst themselves while they decay .	This signal is proportional to a $ CP $ -violating invariant of the slepton mass matrix , $ \widetilde { J } $ , which is not constrained by searches for the electric dipole moment of the electron .	The sensitivity of the LHC and NLC to this signal is highly dependent on superpartner masses , but $ \widetilde { J } $ may be probed to a level of $ 10^ { -3 } $ .	Observation of the $ CP $ -violating signal would imply a definite structure for the slepton mass matrices and have strong implications for models of flavor and SUSY breaking .
1	Here we present a SED catalog of 413 X-ray ( \xmm ) selected type 1 ( emission line FWHM $ & gt ; 2000 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) AGN with Magellan , SDSS or VLT spectrum .	The `` Cosmic Evolution Survey '' ( COSMOS ) enables the study of the Spectral Energy Distributions ( SEDs ) of Active Galactic Nuclei ( AGN ) because of the deep coverage and rich sampling of frequencies from X-ray to radio .	The SEDs are corrected for the Galactic extinction , for broad emission line contributions , constrained variability , and for host galaxy contribution .	We present the mean SED and the dispersion SEDs after the above corrections in the rest frame 1.4 GHz to 40 keV , and show examples of the variety of SEDs encountered .	In the near-infrared to optical ( rest frame $ \sim 8\mu m $ -- 4000\AA ) , the photometry is complete for the whole sample and the mean SED is derived from detections only .
0	A nanometer-thin-cell ( in the direction of laser beam propagation ) has been elaborated with the thickness of the atomic vapor column varying smoothly in the range of $ L = \unit [ 50-1500 ] { nm } $ .	The cell allows one to study the behavior of the resonance absorption over the $ D_1 $ line of potassium atoms by varying the laser intensity and the cell thickness from $ L = \lambda / 2 $ to $ L = 2 \lambda $ with the step $ \lambda/2 $ ( $ \lambda =\unit [ 770 ] { nm } $ is the resonant wavelength of the laser ) .	It is shown that despite the huge Doppler broadening ( $ & gt ; \unit [ 0.9 ] { GHz } $ at the cell temperature $ \unit [ 170 ] { ^ { \circ } C } $ ) , at low laser intensities a narrowing of the resonance absorption spectrum is observed for $ L = \lambda/2 $ ( $ \sim \unit [ 120 ] { MHz } $ at FWHM ) and $ L = 3/2 \lambda $ , whereas for $ L = \lambda $ and $ L =2\lambda $ the spectrum broadens .	At moderate laser intensities narrowband velocity selective optical pumping ( VSOP ) resonances appear at $ L = \lambda $ and $ L=2\lambda $ with the linewidth close to the natural one .	A comparison with saturated absorption spectra obtained in a 1-cm-sized K cell is presented .
3	The principle is layering the specification , for the sake of clarity , in ( at least ) two different levels , the first one for the normal behavior and the others ( if more than one ) for the abnormal .	This paper proposes a method for deriving formal specifications of systems .	To accomplish this task we pass through a non trivial number of steps , concepts and tools where the first one , the most important , is the concept of method itself , since we realized that computer science has a proliferation of languages but very few methods .	We also propose the idea of Layered Fault Tolerant Specification ( LFTS ) to make the method extensible to dependable systems .	The abnormal behavior is described in terms of an Error Injector ( EI ) which represents a model of the erroneous interference coming from the environment .
4	Our model produces results in qualitative agreement with the experimental ( T , P ) phase diagram and the two gap openings in the system and quantitative agreement with the entropy and Sommerfeld coefficient evolution .	Within the framework of the Kondo-Heisenberg model , we analyse the effect of charge fluctuation on the modulated spin liquid ( MSL ) and antiferromagnetic ( AF ) orders which were established in a previous publication .	We discuss the emergence of two quantum critical lines separating the coexisting Kondo-MSL and Kondo-MSL-AF phases .	The various order parameters of the system possess a characteristic signature observable on the electronic band structure of each of the phases .	We calculate that the MSL order is indeed a possible explanation of the hidden order phase of $ URu_ { 2 } Si_ { 2 } $ heavy fermion compound .
2	Since this model changes the evolution of the universe , we should not a priori expect the Cardassian age to be the same as the WMAP Friedmann derived result of 13.7 +/- 0.2 Gyrs .	The age of the universe is obtained in a subset of Cardassian models by using WMAP data .	Cardassian expansion is a modification to the Friedmann equation that allows the universe to be flat , matter dominated , and accelerating , without a vacuum component .	However , in the subset of Cardassian models we consider , we discover that the age of the universe varies from 13.4 - 13.8 Gyr over the range of parameter space we explore , a result close to that of the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter model .	The Hubble constant h , which may also vary in these models , likewise varies little from the Friedmann result .
4	However , these Higgs couplings are allowed to have sizable deviations from SM for ( $ m_h= $ 125.5 GeV , 125.5 $ \leq m_H\leq $ 128 GeV ) and ( 125 GeV $ \leq m_h\leq $ 125.5 GeV , $ m_H= $ 125.5 GeV ) .	Imposing the theoretical constraints from vacuum stability , unitarity and perturbativity as well as the experimental constraints from the electroweak precision data , flavor observables and the non-observation of additional Higgs at collider , we study the implications of available Higgs signals on a two-Higgs-doublet model with the alignment of the down-type quarks and charged lepton Yukawa coupling matrices .	Compared to the four traditional types of two-Higgs-doublet models , the model has two additional mixing angles $ \theta_d $ and $ \theta_l $ in the down-type quark and charged lepton Yukawa interactions .	We find that the mixing angle $ \theta_d $ can loose the constraints on $ sin ( \beta-\alpha ) $ , $ tan\beta $ and $ m_ { H^ { \pm } } $ sizably .	The model can provide the marginally better fit to available Higgs signals data than SM , which requires the Higgs couplings with gauge bosons , $ u\bar { u } $ and $ d\bar { d } $ to be properly suppressed , and favors ( 1 & lt ; \theta_d & lt ; 2 , 0.5 & lt ; \theta_l & lt ; 2.2 ) for $ m_h= $ 125.5 GeV and ( 0.5 & lt ; \theta_d & lt ; 2 , 0.5 & lt ; \theta_l & lt ; 2.2 ) for $ m_H= $ 125.5 GeV .
1	This analysis is based on a data sample of $ 657\times 10^6 $ $ B\overline { B } $ pairs accumulated at the $ \Upsilon ( 4S ) $ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $ e^+e^- $ collider .	We report a measurement of $ CP $ violating asymmetries in $ B^0 ( \overline { B } ^0 ) \to K^+ K^- K^0_S $ decays with a time-dependent Dalitz approach .	As the result of an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the selected candidates , the mixing-induced and direct $ CP $ violation parameters , $ \phi^ { \rm eff } _1 $ and $ { \cal A } _ { CP } $ are obtained for $ B^0 \to \phi ( 1020 ) K^0_S $ , $ B^0 \to f_0 ( 980 ) K^0_S $ and other $ B^0 \to K^+ K^- K^0_S $ decays .	We find four solutions that describe the data .	There are \ { eqnarray* } \phi_1^ { \rm eff } ( B^0\to \phi ( 1020 ) K^0_S ) & amp ; = & amp ; ( 32.2 \pm 9.0 \pm 2.6 \pm 1.4 ) ^ { \circ } ; \phi_1^ { \rm eff } ( B^0\to \phi ( 1020 ) K^0_S ) & amp ; = & amp ; ( 26.2 \pm 8.8 \pm 2.7 \pm 1.2 ) ^ { \circ } ; \\ \phi_1^ { \rm eff } ( B^0\to \phi ( 1020 ) K^0_S ) & amp ; = & amp ; ( 27.3 \pm 8.6 \pm 2.8 \pm 1.3 ) ^ { \circ } \ ; { \rm and } \\ \phi_1^ { \rm eff } ( B^0\to \phi ( 1020 ) K^0_S ) & amp ; = & amp ; ( 24.3 \pm 8.0 \pm 2.9 \pm 5.2 ) ^ { \circ } .
0	The fundamental building block of social influence is for one person to elicit a response in another .	Researchers measuring a `` response '' in social media typically depend either on detailed models of human behavior or on platform-specific cues such as re-tweets , hash tags , URLs , or mentions .	Most content on social networks is difficult to model because the modes and motivation of human expression are diverse and incompletely understood .	We introduce content transfer , an information-theoretic measure with a predictive interpretation that directly quantifies the strength of the effect of one user 's content on another 's in a model-free way .	Estimating this measure is made possible by combining recent advances in non-parametric entropy estimation with increasingly sophisticated tools for content representation .
0	Wind energy is becoming a top contributor to the renewable energy mix , which raises potential reliability issues for the grid due to the fluctuating nature of its source .	To achieve adequate reserve commitment and to promote market participation , it is necessary to provide models that can capture daily patterns in wind power production .	This paper presents a cyclic inhomogeneous Markov process , which is based on a three-dimensional state-space ( wind power , speed and direction ) .	Each time-dependent transition probability is expressed as a Bernstein polynomial .	The model parameters are estimated by solving a constrained optimization problem : The objective function combines two maximum likelihood estimators , one to ensure that the Markov process long-term behavior reproduces the data accurately and another to capture daily fluctuations .
3	When only the two-point function is retained , exact Gaussian statistics are recovered .	We show how to obtain the probability density function for the amplitude of the curvature perturbation , R , produced during an epoch of slow-roll , single-field inflation , working directly from n-point correlation functions of R. These n-point functions are the usual output of quantum field theory calculations , and as a result we bypass approximate statistical arguments based on the central limit theorem .	Our method can be extended to deal with arbitrary forms of non-Gaussianity , appearing at any order in the n-point hierarchy .	We compute the probability density for the total smoothed perturbation within a Hubble volume , \epsilon , and for the spectrum of \epsilon .	When the three-point function is taken into account , we compute explicitly the leading slow-roll correction to the Gaussian result .
0	We present exact analytical solutions to study the coherent interaction between a single photon and the mechanical motion of a membrane in quadratic optomechanics .	We consider single-photon emission and scattering when the photon is initially inside the cavity and in the fields outside the cavity , respectively .	Using our solutions , we calculate the single-photon emission and scattering spectra , and find relations between the spectral features and the system 's inherent parameters , such as : the optomechanical coupling strength , the mechanical frequency , and the cavity-field decay rate .	In particular , we clarify the conditions for the phonon sidebands to be visible .	We also study the photon-phonon entanglement for the long-time emission and scattering states .
1	Holographic interferometry uses this faculty to make a phase object interfere with a memory of itself at a preceding time , recorded on a hologram .	Holography is an optical technique enabling to record phase objects .	Interference fringes therefore inform on any variation of the phase of the object .	For the study of liquids , these phase changes can result from the evolution of temperature or concentration ( via the index of refraction ) .	This access to the real-time evolution of concentration can be used to measure diffusion coefficients , Soret coefficients or dissolution coefficients .
4	Unfortunately , 2LPT fails on small scales due to severe shell crossing and a crude quadratic behaviour in the low density regime .	We present a new fast and efficient approach to model structure formation with Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory ( ALPT ) .	Our method is based on splitting the displacement field into a long and a short-range component .	The long-range component is computed by second order LPT ( 2LPT ) .	This approximation contains a tidal nonlocal and nonlinear term .
3	Regarding cohomological dimensions , we show that the cohomological dimension of a free Clifford monoid and that of its maximum group image agree and are equal to one .	The aim of this paper is to see at what extent homological properties of an inverse monoid are determined from those of its maximum group image .	We provide several evidences that the maximum group image contains vital homological information which can be used to study certain properties of the monoid itself .	For instance , we prove that an inverse monoid $ S $ is of type $ FP_ { \infty } $ , if and only if it contains a minimal idempotent and its maximum group image is of the same type .	Also we define the index of a full submonoid of an inverse monoid in terms of their maximum group images and show that if the index is finite then , the monoid is of type $ \text { FP } _ { \infty } $ if and only if its submonoid is of the same type .
0	We constrain anisotropic cosmic birefringence using four-point correlations of even-parity $ E $ -mode and odd-parity $ B $ -mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background measurements made by the POLARization of the Background Radiation ( POLARBEAR ) experiment in its first season of observations .	We find that the anisotropic cosmic birefringence signal from any parity-violating processes is consistent with zero .	The Faraday rotation from anisotropic cosmic birefringence can be compared with the equivalent quantity generated by primordial magnetic fields if they existed .	The POLARBEAR nondetection translates into a 95 % confidence level ( C.L . )	upper limit of 93 nanogauss ( nG ) on the amplitude of an equivalent primordial magnetic field inclusive of systematic uncertainties .
2	In the series papers [ 8-10 ] , the Murty-Simon Conjecture stated by Haynes et al is not the original conjecture , indeed , it is only for the diameter two edge-critical graphs of even order .	A graph is diameter two edge-critical if its diameter is two and the deletion of any edge increases the diameter .	Murty and Simon conjectured that the number of edges in a diameter two edge-critical graph on $ n $ vertices is at most $ \lfloor \frac { n^ { 2 } } { 4 } \rfloor $ and the extremal graph is the complete bipartite graph $ K_ { \lfloor \frac { n } { 2 } \rfloor , \lceil \frac { n } { 2 } \rceil } $ .	Haynes et al proved the conjecture for the graphs whose complements have diameter three but only with even vertices .	In this paper , we prove the Murty-Simon Conjecture for the graphs whose complements have diameter three , not only with even vertices but also odd ones .
2	The underlying branching mechanism is then either a binary branching model or one presenting infinite variance .	We study the impact on shape parameters of an underlying Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson branching process ( height , width and first hitting time ) , of having a non-spatial branching mechanism with infinite variance .	Aiming at providing a comparative study of the spread of an epidemics whose dynamics is given by the modulus of a branching Brownian motion ( BBM ) we then consider spatial branching processes in dimension d , not necessarily integer .	In particular we evaluate the chance p ( x ) of being hit if the epidemics started away at distance x .	We compute the large x tail probabilities of this event , both when the branching mechanism is regular and when it exhibits very large fluctuations .
1	For each galaxy we obtained broad-band images and narrow-band images using interference filters isolating the H\alpha + [ NII ] emission lines to derive the amount and morphology of dust and ionized gas .	We report the results of multicolour observations of 30 E/S0 galaxies with dust lanes .	To improve the wavelength coverage we retrieved data from the SDSS and 2MASS and combined these with our data .	Ionized gas is detected in 25 galaxies and shows in most cases a smooth morphology , although knots and filamentary structure are also observed in some objects .	The extended gas distribution closely follows the dust structure , with a clear correlation between the mass of both components .
0	The StarScan machine at the U.S .	Naval Observatory ( USNO ) completed measuring photographic astrograph plates to allow determination of proper motions for the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog ( UCAC ) program .	All applicable 1940 AGK2 plates , about 2200 Hamburg Zone Astrograph plates , 900 Black Birch ( USNO Twin Astrograph ) plates , and 300 Lick Astrograph plates have been measured .	StarScan comprises of a CCD camera , telecentric lens , air-bearing granite table , stepper motor screws , and Heidenhain scales to operate in a step-stare mode .	The repeatability of StarScan measures is about 0.2 micrometer .
1	We consider the maximal giant graviton in $ S^5 $ and the string configurations corresponding to the ground states of Z=0 and Y=0 open spin chain , and the spinning string in AdS $ _5 $ corresponding to the derivative type impurities in Y=0 or Z=0 open spin chain as well .	In this paper , we compute holographically the two-point and three-point functions of giant gravitons with open strings .	We treat the D-brane and open string contribution separately and find the corresponding D3-brane and string configurations in bulk which connect the composite operators at the AdS $ _5 $ boundary .	We apply a new prescription to treat the string state contribution and find agreements for the two-point functions .	For the three-point functions of two giant gravitons with open strings and one certain half-BPS chiral primary operator , we find that the D-brane contributions to structure constant are always vanishing and the open string contribution for the Y=0 ground state is in perfect match with the prediction in the free field limit .
3	We confirm the linear rise of the quark condensate with large external field previously found in other studies and observe the transition to the asymptotic power law at extremely large fields .	We investigate the effect of a strong magnetic field on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in quenched and unquenched QCD .	To this end we apply the Ritus formalism to the coupled set of ( truncated ) Dyson-Schwinger equations for the quark and gluon propagator under the presence of an external constant Abelian magnetic field .	We work with an approximation that is trustworthy for large fields eH & gt ; \Lambda_ { QCD } ^2 but is not restricted to the lowest Landau level .	We furthermore quantify the validity of the lowest Landau level approximation and find substantial quantitative differences to the full calculation even at very large fields .
3	The proof relies on vanishing theorems for log canonical varieties and on methods of the minimal model program .	The present paper is concerned with differential forms on log canonical varieties .	It is shown that any p-form defined on the smooth locus of a variety with canonical or klt singularities extends regularly to any resolution of singularities .	In fact , a much more general theorem for log canonical pairs is established .	In addition , a theory of differential forms on dlt pairs is developed .
2	On the other hand , if one of the oscillators is prepared in a nonclassical state ( pure squeezed state , for instance ) , entanglement may be created between members of the chain .	We investigate a simple arrangement of coupled harmonic oscillators which brings out some interesting effects concerning creation of entanglement .	It is well known that if each member in a linear chain of coupled harmonic oscillators is prepared in a `` classical state '' , such as a pure coherent state or a mixed thermal state , no entanglement is created in the rotating wave approximation .	In the setup considered here , we found that a great family of nonclassical ( squeezed ) states can localize entanglement in such a way that distant oscillators never become entangled .	We present a detailed study of this particular localization phenomenon .
0	We present an analysis of QCD sum rules for pion form factor in next-to-leading order of perturbation theory for the case of pseudoscalar pion currents .	The essential instanton contribution is reanalysed with account for present more accurate values of parameters entering Single Instanton Approximation ( SIA ) .	The theoretical curve obtained for Q^2 dependence of pion form factor is in a good agreement with existing experimental data .	To calculate NLO corrections for double spectral densities we developed an effective computational technic .	The details of the method together with the results for pion form factor in a more theoretically clean case of axial interpolating currents will be presented elsewhere .
0	Prior distributions play a crucial role in Bayesian approaches to clustering .	Two commonly-used prior distributions are the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes .	In this paper , we investigate the predictive probabilities that underlie these processes , and the implicit `` rich-get-richer '' characteristic of the resulting partitions .	We explore an alternative prior for nonparametric Bayesian clustering -- the uniform process -- for applications where the `` rich-get-richer '' property is undesirable .	We also explore the cost of this process : partitions are no longer exchangeable with respect to the ordering of variables .
3	Here we discuss the characterization of a ( non-negative ) probability density by a suitable set of all its escort mean values together with the set of all associated normalizing quantities , provided that all of them converge .	Escort mean values ( or $ q $ -moments ) constitute useful theoretical tools for describing basic features of some probability densities such as those which asymptotically decay like { \it power laws } .	They naturally appear in the study of many complex dynamical systems , particularly those obeying nonextensive statistical mechanics , a current generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs theory .	They recover standard mean values ( or moments ) for $ q=1 $ .	This opens the door to a natural extension of the well known characterization , for the $ q=1 $ instance , of a distribution in terms of the standard moments , provided that { \it all } of them have { \it finite } values .
4	Small dynamic perturbation around the static kink solution is considered to formulate the linear stability problem .	In a series of recent works by Demirkaya et al .	stability analysis for the static kink solutions to the 1D continuous and discrete Klein-Gordon equations with a $ \mathcal { PT } $ -symmetric perturbation has been analysed .	We consider the linear stability problem for the static kink in 2D Klein-Gordon field taking into account spatially localized $ \mathcal { PT } $ -symmetric perturbation .	The perturbation is in the form of viscous friction , which does not affect the static solutions to the unperturbed Klein-Gordon equation .
0	The demand for petroleum dependent chemicals and materials has been increasing despite the dwindling of their fossil resources .	As the dead-end of petroleum based industry has started to appear , today 's modern society has to implement alternative energy and valuable chemical resources immediately .	Owing to the importance of lignocellulosic biomass being the most abundant and bio-renewable biomass on earth , this critical review provides insights into the potential of lignocellulosic biomass as an alternative platform to fossil resources .	In this context , over 200 value-added compounds , which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass by various treatment methods , are presented with their references .	Lignocellulosic biomass based polymers and their commercial importance are also reported mainly in the frame of these compounds .
1	Such feedback appears ubiquitous in luminous obscured quasars where high velocity ionized nebulae have been found .	Luminous type-2 quasars in which the glow from the central black hole is obscured by dust are ideal targets for studying their host galaxies and the quasars ' effect on galaxy evolution .	We present rest-frame yellow-band ( ~5000 Angstroms ) observations using the Hubble Space Telescope for a sample of 20 luminous quasar host galaxies at 0.2 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.6 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .	For the first time , we combine host galaxy observations with geometric measurements of quasar illumination using blue-band HST observations and [ OIII ] integral field unit observations probing the quasar winds .	The HST images reveal bright merger signatures in about half the galaxies ; a significantly higher fraction than in comparison inactive ellipticals .
0	We discuss the prospects for setting limits on or discovering spin-1 $ Z ' $ bosons using early LHC data at 7 TeV .	Our results are based on the narrow width approximation in which the leptonic Drell-Yan $ Z ' $ boson production cross-section only depends on the $ Z ' $ boson mass together with two parameters $ c_u $ and $ c_d $ .	We carefully discuss the experimental cuts that should be applied and tabulate the theoretical next-to-next-to-leading order corrections which must be included .	Using these results the approach then provides a safe , convenient and unbiased way of comparing experiment to theoretical models which avoids any built-in model dependent assumptions .	We apply the method to three classes of perturbative $ Z ' $ boson benchmark models : $ E_6 $ models , left-right symmetric models and sequential standard models .
4	In particular , a pair of barbs first approached toward and then departed from each other in H-alpha , with the barb endpoints migrating as far as ~10 '' .	We present a selected few cases in which the sense of chirality of filament barbs changed within as short as hours .	We investigate in detail a quiescent filament on 2003 September 10 and 11 .	Of its four barbs displaying such changes only one overlay a small polarity inversion line inside the EUV filament channel ( EFC ) .	No magnetic elements with magnitude above the noise level were detected at the endpoints of all barbs .
1	In particular , we observed that the indirect proof was not applied correctly .	Recently , we had to realize that more and more game theoretical articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals with severe logical deficiencies .	These authors confuse between statements of propositional logic .	They apply an indirect proof while assuming a prerequisite in order to get a contradiction .	For instance , to find out that `` if A then B '' is valid , they suppose that the assumptions `` A and not B '' are valid to derive a contradiction in order to deduce `` if A then B '' .
3	We characterize the entire functions that lead to a partition of unity in this way , and we provide characterizations of the `` cut-off '' entire functions , considered as functions of a real variable , to have desired regularity .	Partition of unities appear in many places in analysis .	Typically they are generated by compactly supported functions with a certain regularity .	In this paper we consider partition of unities obtained as integer-translates of entire functions restricted to finite intervals .	In particular we obtain partition of unities generated by functions with small support and desired regularity .
1	We measured the cross-correlation amplitude between the two Lyman alpha forests for a mean transverse separation of 120 pc , and computed the RMS column density and velocity differences between individual absorption systems seen in both lines of sight .	Spectra from the Keck HIRES instrument of the Lyman alpha forests in the lines of sight to the A and C components of the gravitationally lensed QSO Q1422+231 were used to investigate the structure of the intergalactic medium at mean redshift z = 3.3 on sub-kpc scales .	The RMS differences between the velocity centroids of the Lyman alpha forest lines were found to be less than about 400 m/s , for unsaturated absorption lines with column densities in the range 12 & lt ; log N ( HI ) & lt ; 14.13 .	The rate of energy transfer into the low density IGM on a typical scale of 100 pc seems to be lower by 3-4 orders of magnitude than the rate measured earlier for strong CIV metal absorption systems .	The tight correlation between HI column density and baryonic density in the intergalactic medium was used to obtain an upper limit on the RMS fluctuations of the baryonic density field .
3	On two nights ( 990106 and 990107 ) we detected statistically significant variability ( at 0.99 confidence level ) in the line profile of H-alpha .	We report our search for variability in the H-alpha emission line of the recurrent novae T CrB with time resolution 10-15 minutes .	This is comparable with the time scale of the photometric flickering observed in this object .	This is the first time that observations of the short time scale variation in emission lines have been made in this object .	This variability is confined in the central part of the emission line ( \pm 100 km/s ) although FWZI ( H-alpha ) is ~800 km/s .
4	When a photon is subtracted from a squeezed vacuum state and another photon is added subsequently , a SSCS with a lower fidelity ( $ F\approx 0.96 $ ) yet higher amplitude ( $ \alpha\approx2 $ ) can be generated .	We study how photon addition and subtraction can be used to generate squeezed superpositions of coherent states in free-traveling fields ( SSCSs ) with high fidelities and large amplitudes .	It is shown that an arbitrary $ N $ -photon subtraction results in the generation of a SSCS with nearly the perfect fidelity ( $ F & gt ; 0.999 $ ) regardless of the number of photons subtracted .	In this case , the amplitude of the SSCS increases as the number of the subtracted photons gets larger .	For example , two-photon subtraction from a squeezed vacuum state of 6.1dB can generate a SSCS of $ \alpha=1.26 $ , while in the case of the four-photon subtraction a SSCS of a larger amplitude $ \alpha=1.65 $ is obtained under the same condition .
3	It is therefore crucial in our method to apply a PS which well reproduces the radiation activities evaluated from the matrix-element ( ME ) calculations for radiative processes .	We are developing a consistent method to combine tree-level event generators for hadron collision interactions with those including one additional QCD radiation from the initial-state partons , based on the limited leading-log ( LLL ) subtraction method , aiming at an application to NLO event generators .	In this method , a boundary between non-radiative and radiative processes necessarily appears at the factorization scale ( mu_F ) .	The radiation effects are simulated using a parton shower ( PS ) in non-radiative processes .	The PS activity depends on the applied kinematics model .
2	McGregor 's approach solves the problem only in the fast diffusion limit ; however , our approach yields a single analytical solution suitable in all diffusion regimes , including the intermediate regime .	We develop an approach , by calculating the autocorrelation function of spins , to derive the magnetic field gradient induced transverse ( $ T_2 $ ) relaxation of spins undergoing restricted diffusion .	This approach is an extension to the method adopted by McGregor .	This establishes a direct connection between the well-known Torrey 's slow diffusion result and the fast diffusion result .	We also perform free induction decay measurements on spin-exchange optically polarized $ ^3 $ He gas with different diffusion constants .
0	By performing accurate ab-initio density functional theory calculations , we study the role of $ 4f $ electrons in stabilizing the magnetic-field-induced ferroelectric state of DyFeO $ _ { 3 } $ .	We confirm that the ferroelectric polarization is driven by an exchange-strictive mechanism , working between adjacent spin-polarized Fe and Dy layers , as suggested by Y. Tokunaga [ Phys.Rev .	Lett , \textbf { 101 } , 097205 ( 2008 ) ] .	A careful electronic structure analysis suggests that coupling between Dy and Fe spin sublattices is mediated by Dy- $ d $ and O- $ 2p $ hybridization .	Our results are robust with respect to the different computational schemes used for $ d $ and $ f $ localized states , such as the DFT+ $ U $ method , the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof ( HSE ) hybrid functional and the GW approach .
1	Their annihilations on the relic neutrinos can be the origin of the cosmic rays with energies beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff .	Decays of superheavy relic particles may produce extremely energetic neutrinos .	The red shift acts as a cosmological filter selecting the sources at some particular value z_e , for which the present neutrino energy is close to the Z pole of the annihilation cross section .	We predict no directional correlation of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays with the galactic halo .	At the same time , there can be some directional correlations in the data , reflecting the distribution of matter at red shift z=z_e .
0	The method of separation of variables can be used to solve many separable linear partial differential equations ( LPDEs ) .	Moreover , variable separation solutions usually are some trigonometric series .	In the paper , base on some ideas of this method , we introduce a new technique to solve the Cauchy problem for some LPDEs with the initial conditions consisting of some trigonometric series , power series and exponential series .	Then many LPDEs which are not separable are solved , such as some second order elliptic equations , Stokes equations and so on .	In addition , the solutions of them can be expressed by trigonometric series , power series or exponential series .
2	Equipped with light sources the accelerating observers get involved in experiments like Doppler Effect , radar detection and radar echo .	We begin with a scenario that involves point-like observers starting at t=0 from the origin O of an inertial reference frame .	They move with all possible proper accelerations in the positive direction of the OX axis .	We derive formulas accounting for the experiments mentioned above .	In the case of the Doppler Effect we take into account the non-locality aspect in the time interval measurement by accelerating observers .
2	In order to enhance the effectiveness of ABPM for clinical and observational research studies via analytical and graphical results , developing alternative data analysis approaches are important .	The use of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) in clinical practice and observational epidemiological studies has grown considerably in the past 25 years .	ABPM is a very effective technique for assessing biological , environmental , and drug effects on blood pressure .	The linear mixed model for the analysis of longitudinal data is particularly well-suited for the estimation of , inference about , and interpretation of both population and subject-specific trajectories for ABPM data .	Subject-specific trajectories are of great importance in ABPM studies , especially in clinical research , but little emphasis has been placed on this dimension of the problem in the statistical analyses of the data .
4	In addition , the informed encoder has access to the sequence of channel states in a non-causal manner .	Problems dealing with the ability to take an action that affects the states of state-dependent communication channels are of timely interest and importance .	Therefore , we extend the study of action-dependent channels , which until now focused on point-to-point models , to multiple-access channels ( MAC ) .	In this paper , we consider a two-user , state-dependent MAC , in which one of the encoders , called the informed encoder , is allowed to take an action that affects the formation of the channel states .	Two independent messages are to be sent through the channel : a common message known to both encoders and a private message known only to the informed encoder .
3	Interpret those sentences whose G\ '' odel numbers are in $ U $ as true , and their negations as false .	We shall construct by ordinary recursion method subsets to the set $ D $ of G\ '' odel numbers of the sentences of a language $ \mathcal L $ .	That language is formed by sentences of a fully interpreted formal language $ L $ , called an MA language , and sentences containing a monadic predicate letter $ T $ .	From the class of the constructed subsets of $ D $ we extract one set $ U $ by transfinite recursion method .	These sentences together form an MA language .
3	The angular dependence of the electric and magnetic contributions to the response function is discussed .	It was recently suggested that the magnetic component of Gravitational Waves ( GWs ) is relevant in the evaluation of frequency response functions of gravitational interferometers .	In this paper we extend the analysis to the magnetic component of the scalar mode of GWs which arise from scalar-tensor gravity theory .	In the low-frequency approximation , the response function of ground-based interferometers is calculated .	Finally , for an arbitrary frequency range , the proper distance between two test masses is calculated and its usefulness in the high-frequency limit for space-based interferometers is briefly considered .

Ideas by Statistical Mechanics ( ISM ) is a generic program to model evolution and propagation of ideas/patterns throughout populations subjected to endogenous and exogenous interactions .	The program is based on the author 's work in Statistical Mechanics of Neocortical Interactions ( SMNI ) , and uses the author 's Adaptive Simulated Annealing ( ASA ) code for optimizations of training sets , as well as for importance-sampling to apply the author 's copula financial risk-management codes , Trading in Risk Dimensions ( TRD ) , for assessments of risk and uncertainty .	A statistical mechanical model of neocortical interactions , developed by the author and tested successfully in describing short-term memory and EEG indicators , is the proposed model .	Parameters with a given subset of macrocolumns will be fit using ASA to patterns representing ideas .
4	Furthermore , for arbitrary $ \epsilon & gt ; 0 $ and any $ 0 & lt ; \rho & lt ; 1 $ , with high probability a random $ F_q $ -linear rank metric codes with rate $ R= ( 1-\rho ) ( 1-b\rho ) -\epsilon $ can be list decoded up to a fraction $ \rho $ of rank errors with constant list size $ L $ satisfying $ L\leq O ( \exp ( 1/\epsilon ) ) $ .	In the present paper , we consider list decoding for both random rank metric codes and random linear rank metric codes .	Firstly , we show that , for arbitrary $ 0 & lt ; R & lt ; 1 $ and $ \epsilon & gt ; 0 $ ( $ \epsilon $ and $ R $ are independent ) , if $ 0 & lt ; \frac { n } { m } \leq \epsilon $ , then with high probability a random rank metric code in $ F_ { q } ^ { m\times n } $ of rate $ R $ can be list-decoded up to a fraction $ ( 1-R-\epsilon ) $ of rank errors with constant list size $ L $ satisfying $ L\leq O ( 1/\epsilon ) $ .	Moreover , if $ \frac { n } { m } \geq\Theta_R ( \epsilon ) $ , any rank metric code in $ F_ { q } ^ { m\times n } $ with rate $ R $ and decoding radius $ \rho=1-R-\epsilon $ can not be list decoded in $ { \rm poly } ( n ) $ time .	Secondly , we show that if $ \frac { n } { m } $ tends to a constant $ b\leq 1 $ , then every $ F_q $ -linear rank metric code in $ F_ { q } ^ { m\times n } $ with rate $ R $ and list decoding radius $ \rho $ satisfies the Gilbert-Varsharmov bound , i.e. , $ R\leq ( 1-\rho ) ( 1-b\rho ) $ .
0	The coarsening of catalytically-active metal clusters is often accelerated by the presence of gases through the formation of mobile intermediates , though the exact mechanism through which this happens is often subject to debate .	We use scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM ) to follow the CO induced coalescence of Pd adatoms supported on the Fe3O4 ( 001 ) surface at room temperature .	We show that highly-mobile Pd-carbonyl species , formed via the so-called skyhook effect , are temporarily trapped at other Pd adatoms .	Once these reach a critical density , clusters nucleate ; subsequent coarsening occurs through cluster diffusion and coalescence .	While CO increases the mobility in the Pd/Fe3O4 system , surface hydroxyls have the opposite effect .
2	Strikingly , their explosion sites also mark them out as distinct from other SN types .	Calcium-rich supernovae represent a significant challenge for our understanding of the fates of stellar systems .	They are less luminous than other supernova ( SN ) types and they evolve more rapidly to reveal nebular spectra dominated by strong calcium lines with weak or absent signatures of other intermediate- and iron-group elements , which are seen in other SNe .	Their galactocentric offset distribution is strongly skewed to very large offsets ( around one third are offset greater than 20 kpc ) , meaning they do not trace the stellar light of their hosts .	Many of the suggestions to explain this extreme offset distribution have invoked the necessity for unusual formation sites such as globular clusters or dwarf satellite galaxies , which are therefore difficult to detect .
4	However , there is evidence for weak Compton reflection .	We present XMM-Newton observations of the high redshift z=3.104 , radio-loud quasar PKS 0537-286 .	The EPIC CCD cameras provide the highest signal-to-noise spectrum of a high-z quasar to date .	The EPIC observations show that PKS 0537-286 is extremely X-ray luminous ( Lx=2x10^47 erg/s ) , with an unusually hard X-ray spectrum ( Gamma=1.27+/-0.02 ) .	The flat power-law emission extends over the whole observed energy range ; there is no evidence of intrinsic absorption , which has been claimed in PKS 0537-286 and other high z quasars .
0	We investigate in ZFC what can be the family of large enough cardinals mu in which an a.e.c .	K is categorical or even just solvable .	We show that for not few cardinals lambda & lt ; mu there is a superlimit model in K_lambda .	Moreover , our main result is that we can find a good lambda-frame s categorical in lambda such that K_s subseteq K_lambda .	We then show how to use [ Sh:705 ] to get categoricity in every large enough cardinality if K has cases of mu-amalgamation for enough mu and 2^mu & lt ; 2^ { mu^ { +1 } } & lt ; ... & lt ; 2^ { mu^ { +n } } ... for enough mu .
3	The purpose of this paper is to develop Mallat 's theory further by allowing for general convolution kernels , or in more technical parlance , general semi-discrete shift-invariant frames ( including Weyl-Heisenberg , curvelet , shearlet , ridgelet , and wavelet frames ) and general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities ( e.g. , rectified linear units , shifted logistic sigmoids , hyperbolic tangents , and modulus functions ) , as well as pooling through sub-sampling , all of which can be different in different network layers .	Deep convolutional neural networks have led to breakthrough results in practical feature extraction applications .	The mathematical analysis of such networks was initiated by Mallat , 2012 .	Specifically , Mallat considered so-called scattering networks based on semi-discrete shift-invariant wavelet frames and modulus non-linearities in each network layer , and proved translation invariance ( asymptotically in the wavelet scale parameter ) and deformation stability of the corresponding feature extractor .	The resulting generalized network enables extraction of significantly wider classes of features than those resolved by Mallat 's wavelet-modulus scattering network .
1	These fields result in a determinant free of all cutoffs .	The Euclidean fermionic determinant in four-dimensional quantum electrodynamics is considered as a function of the fermionic mass for a class of $ O ( 2 ) \times O ( 3 ) $ symmetric background gauge fields .	Consider the one-loop effective action , the logarithm of the determinant , and subtract off the renormalization dependent second-order term .	Suppose the small-mass behavior of this remainder is fully determined by the chiral anomaly .	Then either the remainder vanishes at least once as the fermionic mass is varied in the interval $ 0 & lt ; m & lt ; \infty $ or it reduces to its fourth-order value in which case the new remainder , obtained after subtracting the fourth-order term , vanishes at least once .
0	The interstellar medium in star-forming galaxies is a multiphase gas in which turbulent support is at least as important as thermal pressure .	Sustaining this configuration requires continuous radiative cooling , such that the overall average cooling rate matches the decay rate of turbulent energy into the medium .	Here we carry out a set of numerical simulations of a stratified , turbulently stirred , radiatively cooled medium , which uncover a fundamental transition at a critical one-dimensional turbulent velocity of ~ 35 km/s .	At turbulent velocities below ~35 km/s , corresponding to temperatures below 300,000 K , the medium is stable , as the time for gas to cool is roughly constant as a function of temperature .	On the other hand , at turbulent velocities above the critical value , the gas is shocked into an unstable regime in which the cooling time increases strongly with temperature , meaning that a substantial fraction of the interstellar medium is unable to cool on a turbulent dissipation timescale .
2	The photometric flux of the primary star inferred from eclipse observations is compared with the synthetic spectrum .	Taking into account a range of parameters determined from the evolutionary models and available observational data , the detailed non-LTE spectra for the primary star and the irradiated donor star in the only known eclipsing AM CVn system to date SDSS J0926+3624 are constructed based on the TLUSTY stellar atmosphere code .	The combined spectrum of the primary and the donor stars along with a multi-color blackbody spectrum of the accretion disk that reproduces a detailed numerical model is compared to the SDSS optical spectrum of the system .	The model fit of the two independent observations provides an upper limit on the distance of the system for different effective temperatures of the primary .	In addition , an upper limit on the combined flux of the disk and the donor in the infrared region wherein the contribution of the primary is negligible is also determined .
4	For the kernel of the learning mechanism , we use a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) as the structure of the attack vector model to capture the implicit manner of the attack vector , and this manner is benefited from the syntax meanings that are labeled by the proposed tokenizing mechanism .	Web applications suffer from cross-site scripting ( XSS ) attacks that resulting from incomplete or incorrect input sanitization .	Learning the structure of attack vectors could enrich the variety of manifestations in generated XSS attacks .	In this study , we focus on generating more threatening XSS attacks for the state-of-the-art detection approaches that can find potential XSS vulnerabilities in Web applications , and propose a mechanism for structural learning of attack vectors with the aim of generating mutated XSS attacks in a fully automatic way .	Mutated XSS attack generation depends on the analysis of attack vectors and the structural learning mechanism .
2	First the ability of SN observations to differentiate between dark matter made of macroscopic compact objects and dark matter made of microscopic particles is reviewed .	Observations of high redshift type Ia supernovae ( SNe ) will enable us to probe the structure of galaxy halos and the composition of dark matter .	The future prospects for this field are briefly discussed here .	Then a new method for probing the structure of galaxy halos and galaxy cluster halos is described .	This method utilizes the correlations between foreground galaxy light and supernova brightnesses to substantially decrease possible systematic errors .
4	Optical depths are basically identical for all kinds of stellar coronae and we conclude that identical optical depths are more probable when effects from resonant scattering are generally negligible .	The relevance of resonant scattering ( absorption by photo-excitation and re-emission out of the line of sight ) in the solar corona has always been discussed controversially .	Ratios of emission lines from identical ions but different oscillator strengths are tracers for damping of resonance lines due to possible resonant scattering .	We present an analysis of a large sample of 44 stellar spectra obtained with all gratings on board Chandra and XMM-Newton and systematically measure line ratios of FeXVII lines at 15.27A and 16.78A lines to the resonance line at 15.03A as well as the He-like f/r ratio of OVII and NeIX .	The same ratios obtained from optically thin plasma atomic databases such as MEKAL , Chianti , and APEC are found to be discrepant , however , we find no convincing proof for resonance line scattering .
2	An award value depends on the number of times the game is played .	The prospects of Kahneman and Tversky , Mega Million and Powerball lotteries , St. Petersburg paradox , premature profits and growing losses criticized by Livermore are reviewed under an angle of view comparing mathematical expectations with awards received .	Original prospects have been formulated as a one time opportunity .	The random sample mean is discussed as a universal award .	The role of time in making a risky decision is important as long as the frequency of games and playing time affect their number .
1	Such research requires advances in optical techniques for the delivery of light through brain tissue with high spatial resolution .	Recent progress in neuroscience to image and investigate brain function has been made possible by impressive developments in optogenetic and opto-molecular tools .	The tissue causes distortions of the wavefront of the incoming light which broadens the focus , thereby reducing the intensity and resolution especially in techniques requiring focal illumination .	Adaptive wavefront correction has been demonstrated to compensate for these distortions .	However , in many situations iterative derivation of the corrective wavefront introduces time constraints that limit its usefulness when used to probe living cells .
1	An essential ingredient of the used model is the Weinberg 's $ 2 ( 2j+1 ) $ component formalism for describing a particle of spin $ j $ , recently developed substantially .	The amplitudes for boson-boson and fermion-boson interactions are calculated in the second order of perturbation theory in the Lobachevsky space .	The boson-boson amplitude is then compared with the two-fermion amplitude obtained long ago by Skachkov on the ground of the hamiltonian formulation of quantum field theory on the mass hyperboloid , $ p_0^2 - { \bf p } ^2=M^2 $ , proposed by Kadyshevsky .	The parametrization of the amplitudes by means of the momentum transfer in the Lobachevsky space leads to same spin structures in the expressions of $ T $ matrices for the fermion and the boson cases .	However , certain differences are found .
4	The mass-loss rate for the 554-day variable , MAG29 , appears to be consistent with that found for Miras of comparable period in other Local Group galaxies .	JHK_S photometry is presented for a 35 arcmin square field centred on the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy .	With the aid of published kinematic data definite galaxy members are identified and the width in J-K of the colour-magnitude diagram is shown to be consistent with an old population of stars with a large range in metal abundance .	We identify two Asymptotic Giant Branch variables , both carbon Miras , with periods of 189 and 554 days , respectively , and discuss their ages , metallicities and mass loss as well as their positions in the Mira period-luminosity diagram .	There is evidence for a general period-age relation for Local Group Miras .
3	There is no significant systematic difference in the lithium abundances of high- and low-alpha halo stars .	We investigate if there is a difference in the lithium abundances of stars belonging to two halo populations of F and G main-sequence stars previously found to differ in [ alpha/Fe ] for the metallicity range -1.4 & lt ; [ Fe/H ] & lt ; -0.7 .	Li abundances are derived from the LiI 6707.8 A line measured in high-resolution spectra using MARCS model atmospheres .	Furthermore , masses of the stars are determined from the logTeff - logg diagram by interpolating between Yonsei-Yale evolutionary tracks .	For the large majority of stars with masses 0.7 & lt ; M/M_sun & lt ; 0.9 and heavy-element mass fractions 0.001 & lt ; Z & lt ; 0.006 , the Li abundance is well fitted by a relation A ( Li ) = a0 + a1 M + a2 Z + a3 M Z , where a0 , a1 , a2 , and a3 are constants .
1	An ( electric ) SU ( N ) gauge theory in the conformal window at large N is described by the 5D bulk , while its weakly coupled ( magnetic ) dual is confined to the IR brane .	A slice of AdS_5 is used to provide a 5D gravitational description of 4D strongly-coupled Seiberg dual gauge theories .	This framework can be used to construct an N = 1 MSSM on the IR brane , reminiscent of the original Randall-Sundrum model .	In addition , we use our framework to study strongly-coupled scenarios of supersymmetry breaking mediated by gauge forces .	This leads to a unified scenario that connects the extra-ordinary gauge mediation limit to the gaugino mediation limit in warped space .
3	\ ] We consider a class of infinite randomly weighted trees related to the Poisson-weighted infinite tree , and determine precisely which trees in this class have linear growth almost surely .	Let $ T $ be an infinite rooted tree with weights $ w_e $ assigned to its edges .	Denote by $ m_n ( T ) $ the minimum weight of a path from the root to a node of the $ n $ th generation .	We consider the possible behaviour of $ m_n ( T ) $ with focus on the two following cases : we say $ T $ is explosive if \ [ \lim_ { n\to \infty } m_n ( T ) & lt ; \infty , \ ] and say that $ T $ exhibits linear growth if \ [ \liminf_ { n\to \infty } \frac { m_n ( T ) } { n } & gt ; 0 .	We then apply this characterization to obtain new results concerning the event of explosion in infinite randomly weighted spherically-symmetric trees , answering a question of Pemantle and Peres .
1	It is also an ellipsoidal variable with a known binary period just over two hours .	KPD 1930+2752 is a short-period pulsating subdwarf B ( sdB ) star .	The companion is most likely a white dwarf and the total mass of the system is close to the Chandresakhar limit .	In this paper we report the results of Whole Earth Telescope ( WET ) photometric observations during 2003 and a smaller multisite campaign from 2002 .	From 355 hours of WET data , we detect 68 pulsation frequencies and suggest an additional 13 frequencies within a crowded and complex temporal spectrum between 3065 and 6343 $ \mu $ Hz ( periods between 326 and 157 s ) .
3	The laser path was oriented in longitudinal as well as transverse geometries with respect to the atoms flow .	The proof of principle of the Laser Ion Source Trap ( LIST ) coupled to a gas cell catcher system has been demonstrated at the Leuven Isotope Separator On-Line ( LISOL ) .	The experiments were carried out by using the modified gas cell-based laser ion source and the SextuPole Ion Guide ( SPIG ) .	Element selective resonance laser ionization of neutral atoms was taking place inside the cold jet expanding out of the gas cell catcher .	The enhancement of beam purity and the feasibility for in-source laser spectroscopy were investigated in off-line and on-line conditions .
2	Adopting the flexible Beta distribution as the underlying prior for eccentricity , we derive the marginalized transit probability as well as the a-priori joint probability distribution of eccentricity and argument of periastron , given that a planet is known to transit .	Planets on eccentric orbits have a higher geometric probability of transiting their host star .	By application of Bayes ' theorem , we reverse this logic to show that the eccentricity distribution of transiting planets is positively biased .	These results allow to demonstrate that most planet occurrence rate calculations using Kepler data have overestimated the prevalence of planets by ~10 % .	Indeed , the true occurrence of planets from transit surveys is fundamentally intractable without a prior assumption for the eccentricity distribution .
4	Particular computational models can then be encoded as an axiomatic set of such rules .	We present a form of algebraic reasoning for computational objects which are expressed as graphs .	Edges describe the flow of data between primitive operations which are represented by vertices .	These graphs have an interface made of half-edges ( edges which are drawn with an unconnected end ) and enjoy rich compositional principles by connecting graphs along these half-edges .	In particular , this allows equations and rewrite rules to be specified between graphs .
2	We find that the corresponding configurations possess similar properties to the homogeneous relativistic Dyson rings .	In this paper , we discuss general relativistic , self-gravitating and uniformly rotating perfect fluid bodies with a toroidal topology ( without central object ) .	For the equations of state describing the fluid matter we consider polytropic as well as completely degenerate , perfect Fermi gas models .	On the one hand , there exists no limit to the mass for a given maximal mass-density inside the body .	On the other hand , each model permits a quasistationary transition to the extreme Kerr black hole .
1	If the static field is varied the system shows a plethora of dynamical phenomena .	The dynamics of a ( quasi ) one-dimensional interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a tilted optical lattice is studied in a discrete mean-field approximation , i.e. , in terms of the discrete nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger equation .	In the strong field limit we demonstrate the existence of ( almost ) non-spreading states which remain localized on the lattice region populated initially and show coherent Bloch oscillations with fractional revivals in the momentum space ( so called quantum carpets ) .	With decreasing field , the dynamics becomes irregular , however , still confined in configuration space .	For even weaker fields we find sub-diffusive dynamics with a wave-packet width spreading as $ t^ { 1/4 } $ .
4	Thus the introduction of a kick velocity to neutron stars do not improve the statistics of neither the disk model nor the halo model .	The effect of kick velocity to newly born pulsars on the distribution of $ \gamma $ -ray bursters is examined in the context of a disk origin model and a halo model of $ \gamma $ -ray bursters .	The conversion formula from a 2-dimensional velocity distribution function to a 3-dimensional distribution function is derived and applied to reproduce the distribution function of the kick velocity of radio pulsars .	Monte Carlo simulations of the kicked neutron stars show that the disk neutron star model of $ \gamma $ -ray bursters still needs unnatural assumptions if the velocity distribution of the $ \gamma $ -ray bursters is the same as that of neutron stars -- -only neutron stars with very high kick velocities can become $ \gamma $ -ray bursters and there are silent majorities .	On the other hand , the core radius of $ \gamma $ -ray bursters is not found to be extended by the kick velocity if the core-halo structure similar to the Galactic dark matter distribution is based on the initial distribution of the halo neutron stars .
0	Helium atoms and hydrogen molecules can be strongly bound inside interstitial channels within bundles of carbon nanotubes .	An exploration of the low energy and low temperature properties of He-3 atoms is presented here .	Recent study of the analogous He-4 system has shown that the effect of heterogeneity is to yield a density of states N ( E ) that is qualitatively different from the one-dimensional ( 1D ) form of N ( E ) that would occur for an ideal set of identical channels .	In particular , the functional form of N ( E ) is that of a 4D gas near the very lowest energies and a 2D gas at somewhat higher energies .	Similar behavior is found here for He-3 .
0	Many interesting problems are obtained by attempting to generalize classical results on convexity in Euclidean spaces to other convexity spaces , in particular to convexity spaces on graphs .	In this paper we consider $ P_3 $ -convexity on graphs .	A set $ U $ of vertices in a graph $ G $ is $ P_3 $ -convex if every vertex not in $ U $ has at most one neighbour in $ U $ .	More specifically , we consider Radon numbers for $ P_3 $ -convexity in trees .	Tverberg 's theorem states that every set of $ ( k-1 ) ( d+1 ) -1 $ points in $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ can be partitioned into $ k $ sets with intersecting convex hulls .
1	We perform the Painlev\'e test and analyse the possibility of deriving the B\ '' acklund transformation from the singularity analysis of the complex Sine-Gordon equation .	The connection between the complex Sine and Sinh-Gordon equations on the complex plane associated with a Weierstrass type system and the possibility of construction of several classes of multivortex solutions is discussed in detail .	We make use of the analysis using the known relations for the Painlev\ ' { e } equations to construct explicit formulae in terms of the Umemura polynomials which are $ \tau $ -functions for rational solutions of the third Painlev\ ' { e } equation .	New classes of multivortex solutions of a Weierstrass system are obtained through the use of this proposed procedure .	Some physical applications are mentioned in the area of the vortex Higgs model when the complex Sine-Gordon equation is reduced to coupled Riccati equations .
4	Residual impurities in the samples from misidentification and contributions from feed-down are corrected using data-driven techniques .	Two-particle correlations at small relative momenta give insight into the size of the emitting source .	Of particular interest is the test of hydrodynamic models which predict a universal , apparent decrease of the extent of the system with increasing transverse mass mT as a consequence of the strong radial flow in heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies .	This contribution presents a study of correlations for protons and { \Lambda } particles in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt ( sNN ) = 2.76 TeV measured with ALICE .	The investigated particle species expand the experimental reach in mT due to their high rest mass .
0	I discuss outstanding questions about the formation of the ring nebula around SN1987A and some implications of similar ring nebulae around Galactic B supergiants .	There are notable obstacles for the formation of SN1987A 's bipolar nebula through interacting winds in a transition from a red supergiant to a blue supergiant .	Instead , several clues hint that the nebula may have been ejected in an LBV-like event .	In addition to the previously known example of Sher25 , there are two newly-discovered Galactic analogs of SN1987A 's ringed nebula .	Of these three Galactic analogs around blue supergiants , two ( Sher25 and SBW1 ) have chemical abundances indicating that they have not been through a red supergiant phase , and the remaining ringed bipolar nebula surrounds a luminous blue variable ( HD168625 ) .
1	Such band matrices appear as monodromy operators in the study of certain quantum dynamical systems .	This paper is devoted to the spectral properties of a class of unitary operators with a matrix representation displaying a band structure .	These doubly infinite matrices essentially depend on an infinite sequence of phases which govern their spectral properties .	We prove the spectrum is purely singular for random phases and purely absolutely continuous in case they provide the doubly infinite matrix with a periodic structure in the diagonal direction .	We also study some properties of the singular spectrum of such matrices considered as infinite in one direction only .
0	We initiate a systematic study of amplitudes with massive external particles on the Coulomb-branch of N=4 super Yang Mills theory : 1 ) We propose that ( multi- ) soft-scalar limits of massless amplitudes at the origin of moduli space can be used to determine Coulomb-branch amplitudes to leading order in the mass .	This is demonstrated in numerous examples .	2 ) We find compact explicit expressions for several towers of tree-level amplitudes , including scattering of two massive W-bosons with any number of positive helicity gluons , valid for all values of the mass .	3 ) We present the general structure of superamplitudes on the Coulomb branch .	For example , the n-point `` MHV-band '' superamplitude is proportional to a Grassmann polynomial of mixed degree 4 to 12 , which is uniquely determined by supersymmetry .
2	The system can be described as a disordered array of superconducting islands coupled by a two dimensional electron gas ( 2DEG ) .	We study the magnetic field driven Quantum Phase Transition ( QPT ) in electrostatically gated superconducting LaTiO3/SrTiO3 interfaces .	Through finite size scaling analysis , we show that it belongs to the ( 2+1 ) D XY model universality class .	Depending on the 2DEG conductance tuned by the gate voltage , the QPT is single ( corresponding to the long range phase coherence in the whole array ) or double ( one related to local phase coherence , the other one to the array ) .	By retrieving the coherence length critical exponent \nu , we show that the QPT can be `` clean '' or `` dirty '' according to the Harris criteria , depending on whether the phase coherence length is smaller or larger than the island size .
4	The pulse profile is double peaked and generally not significantly energy dependent although there is an indication of possible softening during the main pulse .	We present an analysis of the highly variable accreting X-ray pulsar 3A 1954+319 using 2005-2009 monitoring data obtained with INTEGRAL and Swift .	This considerably extends the pulse period history and covers flaring episodes in 2005 and 2008 .	In 2006 the source was identified as one of only a few known symbiotic X-ray binaries ( SyXBs ) , i.e. , systems composed of a neutron star accreting from the inhomogeneous medium around an M-giant star .	The extremely long pulse period of 5.3 hr is directly visible in the 2008 INTEGRAL-ISGRI outburst light curve .
4	The axial anomaly appears as a reflection of the symmetry of the matter field and not as a reflection of the symmetry of the pure vacuum , which is consistent with recent arguments on condensates and confinement .	With an assumption that in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian , a left-handed fermion and a right-handed fermion both expressed as the quaternion makes an octonion , and the gauge field can be treated as self-dual , we calculate the axial current and two vector currents triangle diagram of Bardeen , which yields the contribution of the axial anomaly .	The octonion possesses the triality symmetry , and there are 5 symmetry operations $ G_ { ij } $ and $ G_ { ijk } $ ( $ ijk=123 ) $ , in which mixing of spinors and vectors occur .	$ G_ { 23 } $ does not mix vectors and spinors , but mismatch of the spinor and vector fields occurs .	Hence , electro magnetic ( EM ) wave emitted from galaxies transformed by the five transformations would not be detected by EM detectors in our galaxy , and the source would be regarded as dark matter .
4	It could be associated with expanding ring and its satellite components at about +/- 2430 km/s with bipolar jets .	We present results of our modeling the H-alpha line profile along the 2006 RS Oph outburst .	At day 1.38 the very broad component of the H-alpha profile was possible to fit by a bipolar wind model .	The model corresponds to a very fast acceleration of the wind particles , and the line luminosity of about 2900 ( d/1.6 kpc ) ^2 solar luminosities to the mass-loss rate of around ( 1-2 ) x 10E-4 solar masses per year .	During days 10-30 the broad component shrank to FWZI = 1800 km/s .
2	In this work , we focus on the challenge of preserving the privacy of users ' social contacts , while still enabling the design of social trust based applications .	Social network based trust relationships present a critical foundation for designing trustworthy systems , such as Sybil defenses , secure routing , and anonymous/censorshipresilient communications .	A key issue in the design of such systems , is the revelation of users ' trusted social contacts to an adversary-information that is considered sensitive in today 's society .	First , we propose LinkMirage , a community detection based algorithm for anonymizing links in social network topologies ; LinkMirage preserves community structures in the social topology while anonymizing links within the communities .	LinkMirage considers the evolution of the social network topologies , and minimizes privacy leakage due to temporal dynamics of the system .
4	The difference in LBV spectral appearance is due to some objects being in a quiescent phase and some objects being in an active or outburst phase .	Massive evolved stars in transition phases , such as Luminous Blue Variables ( LBVs ) , B [ e ] Supergiants ( B [ e ] SGs ) , and Yellow Hypergiants ( YHGs ) , are not well understood , and yet crucial steps in determining accurate stellar and galactic evolution models .	The circumstellar environments of these stars reveal their mass-loss history , identifying clues to both their individual evolutionary status and the connection between objects of different phases .	Here we present a survey of 25 such evolved massive stars ( 16 B [ e ] SGs , 6 LBVs , 2 YHGs , and 1 Peculiar Oe star ) , observed in the K-band with the Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observation in the Near-Infrared ( SINFONI ; R = 4500 ) on the ESO VLT UT4 8 m telescope .	The sample can be split into two categories based on spectral morphology : one group includes all of the B [ e ] SGs , the Peculiar Oe star , and two of the LBVs , while the other includes the YHGs and the rest of the LBVs .
1	We seek to constrain the three-dimensional gas properties and the outflow energetics of the EELRs in this study .	Extended emission-line regions ( EELRs ) , found around radio loud sources , are likely outflows driven by one form of powerful AGN feedback mechanism .	We used an integral field unit to observe EELRs around two samples of of radio loud AGNs with similar radio properties but different orientations : a sample of quasars and a sample of radio galaxies .	A morphological comparison suggests a scenario where the three-dimensional EELR gas distribution follows rough biconical shapes with wide opening angles .	The average extent of the EELRs is $ \sim 18.5 $ kpc .
4	The weak bases have a highly regular form and are in many cases easily relatable to the smallest members in the intervals , which suggests that the lattice of strong partial clones is considerably simpler than the full lattice of partial clones .	Universal algebra and clone theory have proven to be a useful tool in the study of constraint satisfaction problems since the complexity , up to logspace reductions , is determined by the set of polymorphisms of the constraint language .	For classifications where primitive positive definitions are unsuitable , such as size-preserving reductions , weaker closure operations may be necessary .	In this article we consider strong partial clones which can be seen as a more fine-grained framework than Post 's lattice where each clone splits into an interval of strong partial clones .	We investigate these intervals and give simple relational descriptions , weak bases , of the largest elements .
4	The microturbulent velocity appears to be minimal at the bottom of overshooting convection region and increases sharply through superadiabatic layer and upper photosphere .	In this paper , the physical conditions within the inhomogeneous solar atmosphere have been reconstructed by means of solving the inverse problem of Non Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium ( NLTE ) radiative transfer .	The profiles of $ \lambda=523.42 $ nm FeI spectral line of high spatial and time resolution were used as observational data .	The velocity field has been studied for the real solar granulation in superadiabatic layer and overshooting convection region .	Also , we investigate the vertical structure of inhomogeneous solar photosphere and consider penetration of granules from convective region into upper layers of stable atmosphere .
1	Our algorithms are cache oblivious and generalize the randomized divide and conquer strategy given by Reischuk and Reif and Sen .	In this paper we present randomized algorithms for sorting and convex hull that achieves optimal performance ( for speed-up and cache misses ) on the multicore model with private cache model .	Although the approach yielded optimal speed-up in the PRAM model , we require additional techniques to optimize cache-misses in an oblivious setting .	Under a mild assumption on input and number of processors our algorithm will have optimal time and cache misses with high probability .	Although similar results have been obtained recently for sorting , we feel that our approach is simpler and general and we apply it to obtain an optimal parallel algorithm for 3D convex hulls with similar bounds .
4	Significant drops in 6cm radio emission near the phases of both primary and secondary eclipse indicate relatively compact radio emitting volumes that may lie between the binary components .	We review the results of the 1988 multi-wavelength campaign on the late-type eclipsing binary YY Geminorum .	Observations include : broad-band optical and near infra-red photometry , simultaneous optical and ultraviolet ( IUE ) spectroscopy , X-ray ( Ginga ) and radio ( VLA ) data .	From models fitted to the optical light curves , fundamental physical parameters have been determined together with evidence for transient maculations ( spots ) located near quadrature longitudes and intermediate latitudes .	Eclipses were observed at optical , ultraviolet and radio wavelengths .
2	This PEC is adapted to suit our method prior to the computation of ro-vibrational energies .	Comprehensive vibration-rotation line lists for eight isotopologues of carbon monosulphide ( CS ) ( $ ^ { 12 } $ C $ ^ { 32 } $ S , $ ^ { 12 } $ C $ ^ { 33 } $ S , $ ^ { 12 } $ C $ ^ { 34 } $ S , $ ^ { 12 } $ C $ ^ { 36 } $ S , $ ^ { 13 } $ C $ ^ { 32 } $ S , $ ^ { 13 } $ C $ ^ { 33 } $ S , $ ^ { 13 } $ C $ ^ { 34 } $ S , $ ^ { 13 } $ C $ ^ { 36 } $ S ) in their ground electronic states are calculated .	These line lists are suitable for temperatures up to 3000 K. A spectroscopically-determined potential energy curve ( PEC ) and dipole moment curve ( DMC ) are taken from literature .	The calculated energies are then substituted by experimental energies , where available , to improve the accuracy of the line lists .	The { \it ab initio } DMC is used without refinement to generate Einstein A coefficients .
1	We consider a paramagnetic solution without spin-orbit interaction as a function of volume for the face-centered cubic ( fcc ) unit cell .	We present results for the electronic structure of plutonium by using a recently developed quasiparticle self-consistent $ GW $ method ( \qsgw ) .	We span unit-cell volumes ranging from 10 % greater than the equilibrium volume of the $ \delta $ phase to 90 % of the equivalent for the $ \alpha $ phase of Pu .	The self-consistent $ GW $ quasiparticle energies are compared to those obtained within the Local Density Approximation ( LDA ) .	The goal of the calculations is to understand systematic trends in the effects of electronic correlations on the quasiparticle energy bands of Pu as a function of the localization of the $ f $ orbitals .
0	We consider two strongly hyperbolic Hamiltonian formulations of general relativity and their numerical integration with a free and a partially constrained symplectic integrator .	In those formulations we use hyperbolic drivers for the shift and in one case also for the densitized lapse .	A system where the densitized lapse is an external field allows to enforce the momentum constraints in a holonomically constrained Hamiltonian system and to turn the Hamilton constraint function from a weak to a strong invariant .	These schemes are tested in a perturbed Minkowski and the Schwarzschild space-time .	In those examples we find advantages of the strongly hyperbolic formulations over the ADM system presented in [ arXiv:0807.0734 ] .
0	We discuss the conditions under which an anomaly occurs in conductance and localization length of Anderson model on a lattice .	Using the ladder hamiltonian and analytical calculation of average conductance we find the set of resonance conditions which complements the $ \pi $ -coupling rule for anomalies .	We identify those anomalies that might vanish due to the symmetry of the lattice or the distribution of the disorder .	In terms of the dispersion relation it is known from strictly one-dimensional model that the lowest order ( i.e. , the most strong ) anomalies satisfy the equation $ E ( k ) =E ( 3k ) $ .	We show that the anomalies of the generalized model studied here are also the solutions of the same equation with modified dispersion relation .
0	Standard candles are one of the most important tools to study the universe .	In this paper , the constraints of standards candles on the cosmological parameters are estimated for different cases .	The dependence of the constraints on the intrinsic scatter of the luminosity relation and the redshift distribution of the standard candles is specifically investigated .	The results , especially for the constraints on the components of the universe , clearly show that constraints from standard candles at different redshifts have different degeneracy orientations , thus standard candles with a wide redshift distribution can self break the degeneracy and improve the constraints significantly .	As a result of this , even with the current level of tightness of known luminosity relations , gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) can give comparable tightness of constraint with type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) on the components of the universe as long as the redshifts of the GRBs are diversifying enough .
2	Information gain and state disturbance are quantified by fidelities which , for our schemes , saturate the ultimate bound imposed by quantum mechanics for randomly distributed signals .	A class of optimal quantum repeaters for qubits is suggested .	The schemes are minimal , i.e.involve a single additional probe qubit , and optimal , i.e.provide the maximum information adding the minimum amount of noise .	Special classes of signals are also investigated , in order to improve the information-disturbance trade-off .	Extension to higher dimensional signals ( qudits ) is straightforward .
3	In this paper we propose a general framework in which to model belief change .	Belief change is a fundamental problem in AI : Agents constantly have to update their beliefs to accommodate new observations .	In recent years , there has been much work on axiomatic characterizations of belief change .	We claim that a better understanding of belief change can be gained from examining appropriate semantic models .	We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge and plausibility : an agent believes p if he knows that p is more plausible than its negation .
3	We present comprehensive mean-field phase diagrams for these lattices and discuss the competition between topologically non-trivial phases and numerous other ordered states , including various charge , spin , and bond orderings .	We study the spinless and spinful extended Hubbard models with repulsive interactions on the kagome and the decorated honeycomb ( `` star '' ) lattice .	Using Hartree-Fock mean-field theory , we show that interaction-driven insulating phases with non-trivial topological invariants ( Chern number or $ Z_2 $ invariant ) exist for an experimentally reasonable range of parameters .	These phases occur at filling fractions which involve either Dirac points or quadratic band crossing points in the non-interacting limit .	Our results suggest that $ Z_2 $ topological insulators should be found in a number of systems with either little or no intrinsic spin-orbit coupling .
3	Here we report the discovery of the second and third longest orbital period post-common envelope binaries ( PCEBs ) containing white dwarf ( WD ) primaries , i.e.SDSSJ121130.94-024954.4 ( Porb = 7.818 +- 0.002 days ) and SDSSJ222108.45+002927.7 ( Porb = 9.588 +- 0.002 days ) , reconstruct their evolutionary history , and discuss the implications for the energy budget of CE evolution .	Virtually all close compact binary stars are formed through common-envelope ( CE ) evolution .	It is generally accepted that during this crucial evolutionary phase a fraction of the orbital energy is used to expel the envelope .	However , it is unclear whether additional sources of energy , such as the recombination energy of the envelope , play an important role .	We find that , despite their long orbital periods , the evolution of both systems can still be understood without incorporating recombination energy , although at least small contributions of this additional energy seem to be likely .
0	Stochastic processes often exhibit sudden systematic changes in pattern a short time before certain failure events .	Examples include increase in medical costs before death and decrease in CD4 counts before AIDS diagnosis .	To study such terminal behavior of stochastic processes , a natural and direct way is to align the processes using failure events as time origins .	This paper studies backward stochastic processes counting time backward from failure events , and proposes one-sample nonparametric estimation of the mean of backward processes when follow-up is subject to left truncation and right censoring .	We will discuss benefits of including prevalent cohort data to enlarge the identifiable region and large sample properties of the proposed estimator with related extensions .
1	From the Montague 's point of view , the meaning of an idea can be considered as particular extensions in different possible worlds .	Contemporary use of the term 'intension ' derives from the traditional logical Frege-Russell 's doctrine that an idea ( logic formula ) has both an extension and an intension .	In this paper we analyze the minimal intensional semantic enrichment of the syntax of the FOL language , by unification of different views : Tarskian extensional semantics of the FOL , modal interpretation of quantifiers , and a derivation of the Tarskian theory of truth from unified semantic theory based on a single meaning relation .	We show that not all modal predicate logics are intensional , and that an equivalent modal Kripke 's interpretation of logic quantifiers in FOL results in a particular pure extensional modal predicate logic ( as is the standard Tarskian semantics of the FOL ) .	This minimal intensional enrichment is obtained by adopting the theory of properties , relations and propositions ( PRP ) as the universe or domain of the FOL , composed by particulars and universals ( or concepts ) , with the two-step interpretation of the FOL that eliminates the weak points of the Montague 's intensional semantics .
3	The measurements used to validate the model and characterize its uncertainty are derived primarily from a dedicated photon radiation pressure actuator , with cross-checks provided by optical and radio frequency references .	In Advanced LIGO , detection and astrophysical source parameter estimation of the binary black hole merger GW150914 requires a calibrated estimate of the gravitational-wave strain sensed by the detectors .	Producing an estimate from each detector 's differential arm length control loop readout signals requires applying time domain filters , which are designed from a frequency domain model of the detector 's gravitational-wave response .	The gravitational-wave response model is determined by the detector 's opto-mechanical response and the properties of its feedback control system .	We describe how the gravitational-wave readout signal is calibrated into equivalent gravitational-wave-induced strain and how the statistical uncertainties and systematic errors are assessed .
4	We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference .	Observations consisting of measurements on relationships for pairs of objects arise in many settings , such as protein interaction and gene regulatory networks , collections of author-recipient email , and social networks .	Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold .	In this paper , we describe a latent variable model of such data called the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel .	This model extends blockmodels for relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational structure , thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation .
1	These results were extended by McQuillan in his proof of the Green-Griffiths conjecture for entire curves on such surfaces .	Surfaces of general type with positive second Segre number $ s_2 : =c_1^2-c_2 & gt ; 0 $ are known by results of Bogomolov to be quasi-hyperbolic i.e.with finitely many rational and elliptic curves .	In this work , we study hyperbolic properties of minimal surfaces of general type with minimal $ c_1^2 $ , known as Horikawa surfaces .	In principle these surfaces should be the most difficult case for the above conjecture as illustrate the quintic surfaces in $ \bP^3 $ .	Using orbifold techniques , we exhibit infinitely many irreducible components of the moduli of Horikawa surfaces whose very generic member has no rational curves or even is algebraically hyperbolic .
3	Below this value , the microstructure governs the endurance limit mainly through Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing ( SDAS ) .	Experimental Kitagawa analysis has been performed on A356-T6 containing natural and artificial defects .	Results are obtained with a load ratio of R = -1 for three different loadings : tension , torsion and combined tension-torsion .	The critical defect size determined is 400 \pm 100 \mum in A356-T6 under multiaxial loading .	Four theoretical approaches are used to simulate the endurance limit characterized by a Kitagawa relationship are compared : Murakami relationships [ Y Murakami , Metal Fatigue : Effects of Small Defects and Nonmetallic Inclusions , Elsevier , 2002 .
2	The general formulae are specialised to cases involving a scalar superfield L , which contains global symmetry currents , and the supercurrent , which contains the energy momentum tensor , and the consequences of superconformal Ward identities analysed .	The implications of N=1 superconformal symmetry for four dimensional quantum field theories are studied .	Superconformal covariant expressions for two and three point functions of quasi-primary superfields of arbitrary spin are found and connected with the operator product expansion .	The three point function of L is shown to have unique completely antisymmetric or symmetric forms .	In the latter case the superspace version of the axial anomaly equation is obtained .
1	When an electron hits the barrier from an oblique direction , its spin-up and spin-down states have different energies due to the spin-orbit interaction and the fact that the system has a structural inversion asymmetry .	The Dirac equation is used to describe oblique spin-conserving and spin-flip reflections of relativistic electrons from a one-dimensional potential barrier in a vacuum .	When the electron is reflected in an elastic spin-conserving process , incoming and outgoing angles are the same .	If an elastic reflection is a spin-flip process , the outgoing angle is different from the incoming one .	As a result , a beam of incoming spin-polarized electrons is split after the reflection into two beams .
1	This is due to variation in local coalescent times caused by , for example , selection or recombination .	Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) often appear in clusters along the length of a chromosome .	Here we investigate whether recombination alone ( within a neutral model ) can cause statistically significant SNP clustering .	We measure the extent of SNP clustering as the ratio between the variance of SNPs found in bins of length $ l $ , and the mean number of SNPs in such bins , $ \sigma^2_l/\mu_l $ .	For a uniform SNP distribution $ \sigma^2_l/\mu_l=1 $ , for clustered SNPs $ \sigma^2_l/\mu_l & gt ; 1 $ .
2	A new approach to model the free electron is presented .	It is argued here that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics violates the tenets on which both Galileo 's and Einstein 's theories of relativity are based .	It is postulated that the `` building blocks '' of the universe are not `` particles '' but are holistic wave-entitities which act and interact with other wave-entities as one would expect from waves .	It is argued from Coulomb 's law that the electromagnetic quantum-field energy is not part of an electric field surrounding the electron , but is localised , so that it is wholly equal to the mass of the electron .	It is found that an energy component must also exist along a fourth spatial dimension which could be the origin of the `` dark energy '' in the universe and which , in turn , should be responsible for `` vacuum-fluctuations '' as governed by Heisenberg 's uncertainty relationship for energy and time .
3	For each group we compute two statistics , $ { \cal R } $ and $ { \cal S } $ , which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group members .	It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo , that is , the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy , is also the brightest halo galaxy ( BHG ) , and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter potential well .	This central galaxy paradigm ( CGP ) is an essential assumption made in various fields of astronomical research .	In this paper we test the validity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .	By comparing the cumulative distributions of $ | { \cal R } | $ and $ | { \cal S } | $ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues , we rule out the null-hypothesis that the CGP is correct .
4	We find that the assumptions used by Traini and others are not valid for typical ( e , e ' ) experiments on medium and heavy nuclei , and hence the extracted structure functions based on this formalism are not reliable .	In this paper we address the adequacy of various approximate methods of including Coulomb distortion effects in ( e , e ' ) reactions by comparing to an exact treatment using Dirac-Coulomb distorted waves .	In particular , we examine approximate methods and analyses of ( e , e ' ) reactions developed by Traini et al .	using a high energy approximation of the distorted waves and phase shifts due to Lenz and Rosenfelder .	This approximation has been used in the separation of longitudinal and transverse structure functions in a number of ( e , e ' ) experiments including the newly published 208Pb ( e , e ' ) data from Saclay .
0	In multi-cloud environment , task scheduling has attracted a lot of attention due to NP-Complete nature of the problem .	Moreover , it is very challenging due to heterogeneity of the cloud resources with varying capacities and functionalities .	Therefore , minimizing the makespan for task scheduling is a challenging issue .	In this paper , we propose a genetic algorithm ( GA ) based approach for solving task scheduling problem .	The algorithm is described with innovative idea of fitness function derivation and mutation .
0	Before we combine actions and probabilities two very obvious questions should be asked .	Firstly , what does `` the probability of an action '' mean ?	Secondly , how does probability interact with nondeterminism ?	Neither question has a single universally agreed upon answer but by considering these questions at the outset we build a novel and hopefully intuitive probabilistic event-based formalism .	In previous work we have characterised refinement via the notion of testing .
3	Our experiment uses pair creation in two separate down-conversion crystals .	Indistinguishable quantum states interfere , but the mere possibility of obtaining information that could distinguish between overlapping states inhibits quantum interference .	Quantum interference imaging can outperform classical imaging or even have entirely new features .	Here , we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a quantum imaging concept that relies on the indistinguishability of the possible sources of a photon that remains undetected .	While the photons passing through the object are never detected , we obtain images exclusively with the sister photons that do not interact with the object .
3	We propose a `` centrifugal barrier mechanism '' as an alternative to the previously suggested `` fountain mechanism '' for explaining the flat metallicity profiles of dIrrs and flat , rotating dEs .	We show results based on a large suite of N-Body/SPH simulations of isolated , flat dwarf galaxies , both rotating and non-rotating .	The main goal is to investigate possible mechanisms to explain the observed dichotomy in radial stellar metallicity profiles of dwarf galaxies : dwarf irregulars ( dIrr ) and flat , rotating dwarf ellipticals ( dE ) generally possess flat metallicity profiles , while rounder and non-rotating dEs show strong negative metallicity gradients .	These simulations show that flattening by rotation is key to reproducing the observed characteristics of flat dwarf galaxies , proving particularly efficient in erasing metallicity gradients .	While only flattening the dark-matter halo has little influence , the addition of angular momentum slows down the infall of gas , so that star formation ( SF ) and the ensuing feedback are less centrally concentrated , occurring galaxy-wide .
2	Depending on a few global parameters , the structure of the flow may be either a solid-body rotation ( zonal flow ) or a dipole .	The large-scale circulation of planetary atmospheres like that of the Earth is traditionally thought of in a dynamical framework .	Here , we apply the statistical mechanics theory of turbulent flows to a simplified model of the global atmosphere , the quasi-geostrophic model , leading to non-trivial equilibria .	A second order phase transition occurs between these two phases , with associated spontaneous symmetry-breaking in the dipole phase .	This model allows us to go beyond the general theory of marginal ensemble equivalence through the notion of Goldstone modes .
0	This paper deals with the detection problem of extragalactic point-sources in multi-frequency , microwave sky maps that will be obtainable in future cosmic microwave background radiation ( CMB ) experiments with instruments capable of very high spatial resolution .	With spatial resolutions that can be of order of 0.1-1.0 arcsec or better , the extragalactic point-sources will appear isolated .	The same holds also for the compact structures due to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich ( SZ ) effect ( both thermal and kinetic ) .	This situation is different from the maps obtainable with instruments as WMAP or PLANCK where , because of the smaller spatial resolution ( approximately 5-30 arcmin ) , the point-sources and the compact structures due to the SZ effect form a uniform noisy background ( the `` confusion noise '' ) .	Hence , the point-source detection techniques developed in the past are based on the assumption that all the emissions that contribute to the microwave background can be modeled with homogeneous and isotropic ( often Gaussian ) random fields and make use of the corresponding spatial power-spectra .
1	One such experiment , the Square Kilometre Array ( SKA ) , will carry out several wide and deep surveys of resolved and unresolved neutral hydrogen ( HI ) 21cm line-emitting galaxies , mapping a significant fraction of the sky from $ 0 \le z \lesssim 6 $ .	Tests of general relativity ( GR ) are still in their infancy on cosmological scales , but forthcoming experiments promise to greatly improve their precision over a wide range of distance scales and redshifts .	I present forecasts for the ability of a suite of possible SKA HI surveys to detect deviations from GR by reconstructing the cosmic expansion and growth history .	SKA Phase 1 intensity mapping surveys can achieve sub-1\ % measurements of $ f\sigma_8 $ out to $ z\approx 1 $ , with an SKA1-MID Band 2 survey out to $ z \lesssim 0.6 $ able to surpass contemporary spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as DESI and Euclid in terms of constraints on modified gravity parameters if challenges such as foreground contamination can be tackled effectively .	A more futuristic Phase 2 HI survey of $ \sim10^9 $ spectroscopic galaxy redshifts would be capable of detecting a $ \sim 2\ % $ modification of the Poisson equation out to $ z\approx 2 $ .
4	This case raises the possibility of anthropic selection of other parameters in addition .	One way that an anthropic selection mechanism may be manifest in a physical theory involves multiple domains in the universe with different values of the physical parameters .	If this mechanism is to be relevant for understanding the small observed value of the cosmological constant , it may involve a mechanism by which some contributions to the cosmological constant can be fixed at a continuous range of values in the different domains .	I study the properties of four possible mechanisms , including the possibility of the Hubble damping of a scalar field with an extremely flat potential .	Another interesting possibility involves fixed random values of non-dynamical form fields , and a cosmological mechanism is suggested .
4	The model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation functions are compared with the recent results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .	We extend the subhalo abundance matching method to assign galaxy color to subhalos .	We separate a luminosity-binned subhalo sample into two groups by a secondary subhalo property which is presumed to be correlated with galaxy color .	The two subsamples then represent red and blue galaxy populations .	We explore two models for the secondary property , namely subhalo assembly time and local dark matter density around each subhalo .
1	Here we present studies of fluctuations in facial electromyography ( fEMG ) and electrodermal activity ( EDA ) massive time series and changes of such signals in the course of emotional stimulation .	High frequency psychophysiological data create a challenge for quantitative modeling based on Big Data tools since they reflect the complexity of processes taking place in human body and its responses to external events .	Zygomaticus major ( ZYG , `` smiling '' muscle ) activity , corrugator supercilii ( COR , `` frowning '' bmuscle ) activity , and phasic skin conductance ( PHSC , sweating ) levels of 65 participants were recorded during experiments that involved exposure to emotional stimuli ( i.e. , IAPS images , reading and writing messages on an artificial online discussion board ) .	Temporal Taylor 's fluctuations scaling were found when signals for various participants and during various types of emotional events were compared .	Values of scaling exponents were close to 1 , suggesting an external origin of system dynamics and/or strong interactions between system 's basic elements ( e.g. , muscle fibres ) .
2	By reinvestigating this small $ \tan\beta $ region , we find that the indirect constraints like $ \Delta\rho $ , $ b\to s \gamma $ , $ \Delta M_ { B_d } $ , $ R_b $ , $ \epsilon_K $ , and the perturbativity of running top Yukawa coupling are rather weak to be $ \tan\beta & gt ; 0.5 $ .	We study the implications of the LHC heavy neutral Higgs search data on the aligned two Higgs doublet model with softly broken $ Z_2 $ symmetry .	When $ \tan\beta $ is small , the gluon fusion production of the heavy CP-even scalar $ H^0 $ or the CP-odd scalar $ A^0 $ becomes large enough to constrain the model by the current $ \gamma\gamma $ , $ \tau^+\tau^- $ , and $ t\bar { t } $ data .	The current heavy Higgs search results are shown to put more significant bounds .	If $ m_H \simeq m_A $ , the $ t\bar { t } $ mode excludes $ \tan\beta & lt ; 1.5 $ for $ m_ { H , A } =500-600\ , $ GeV in all four types , and the $ \gamma\gamma $ and $ \tau^+\tau^- $ modes exclude $ \tan\beta & lt ; 1-3 $ ( $ \tan\beta & lt ; 3-10 $ ) for $ m_ { H , A } =120-340\ , $ GeV in Type I , II , and Y ( Type X ) .
4	As an application , we construct simultaneous confidence bands for drift and volatility functions in a dynamic short-term rate model for the U.S. Treasury yield curve rates data .	We consider kernel estimation of marginal densities and regression functions of stationary processes .	It is shown that for a wide class of time series , with proper centering and scaling , the maximum deviations of kernel density and regression estimates are asymptotically Gumbel .	Our results substantially generalize earlier ones which were obtained under independence or beta mixing assumptions .	The asymptotic results can be applied to assess patterns of marginal densities or regression functions via the construction of simultaneous confidence bands for which one can perform goodness-of-fit tests .
4	The equivalence of the new formulation with the original one demonstrates that the time evolution which is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian and a dissipator of the Lindblad form is nevertheless completely positive , just as systems with hermitian Hamiltonians .	We consider an open quantum system which contains unstable states .	The time evolution of the system can be described by an effective non-hermitian Hamiltonian H_ { eff } , in accord with the Wigner -- Weisskopf approximation , and an additional term of the Lindblad form , the socalled dissipator .	We show that , after enlarging the original Hilbert space by states which represent the decay products of the unstable states , the non-hermitian part of H_ { eff } -- the `` particle decay '' -- can be incorporated into the dissipator of the enlarged space via a specific Lindblad operator .	Thus the new formulation of the time evolution on the enlarged space has a hermitian Hamiltonian and is probability conserving .
2	We propose a constant subtraction technique , which helps one to ensure a well-balanced property of the schemes , while maintaining arbitrary high-order of accuracy .	We develop well-balanced central schemes on overlapping cells for the Saint-Venant shallow water system and its variants .	The main challenge in deriving the schemes is related to the fact that the Saint-Venant system contains a geometric source term due to nonflat bottom topography and therefore a delicate balance between the flux gradients and source terms has to be preserved .	Hierarchical reconstruction limiting procedure is applied to eliminate spurious oscillations without using characteristic decomposition .	Extensive one- and two-dimensional numerical simulations are conducted to verify the well-balanced property , high-order of accuracy , and non-oscillatory high-resolution for both smooth and nonsmooth solutions .
4	In this paper we propose a Spatio-Temporal data warehousing ( STDW ) for efficiently querying location information of moving objects .	In the last decade , Moving Object Databases ( MODs ) have attracted a lot of attention from researchers .	Several research works were conducted to extend traditional database techniques to accommodate the new requirements imposed by the continuous change in location information of moving objects .	Managing , querying , storing , and mining moving objects were the key research directions .	This extensive interest in moving objects is a natural consequence of the recent ubiquitous location-aware devices , such as PDAs , mobile phones , etc. , as well as the variety of information that can be extracted from such new databases .
1	This sedimentary basin is 3000m wide and 350m deep .	This paper aims at the analysis of seismic wave amplification in a deep alluvial basin in the city of Tunis in Tunisia .	Since the seismic hazard is significant in this area , the depth of the basin and the strong impedance ratio raise the need for an accurate estimation of seismic motion amplification .	Various experimental investigations were performed in previous studies to characterize site effects .	The Boundary Element Method is considered herein to assess the parameter sensitivity of the amplification process and analyse the prevailing phenomena .
0	This paper investigates the influence of magneto-centrifugally driven or simply magnetic winds of rapidly-rotating , strongly-magnetized T Tauri stars in causing the inward or outward migration of close-in giant planets .	The azimuthal ram pressure of the magnetized wind acting on the planet tends to increase the planet 's angular momentum and cause outward migration if the star 's rotation period $ P_* $ is less than the planet 's orbital period $ P_p $ .	In the opposite case , $ P_* & gt ; P_p $ , the planet migrates inward .	Thus , planets orbiting at distances larger ( smaller ) than $ 0.06 { \rm AU } ( P_*/5 { \rm d } ) ^ { 2/3 } $ tend to be pushed outward ( inward ) , where $ P_* $ is the rotation period of the star assumed to have the mass of the sun .	The magnetic winds are likely to occur in T Tauri stars where the thermal speed of the gas close to the star is small , where the star 's magnetic field is strong , and where the star rotates rapidly .
4	We computed the theoretical Rossby number of stellar models with the TGEC code , and analyze its evolution with time during the main sequence .	Magnetic fields of late-type stars are presumably generated by a dynamo mechanism at the interface layer between the radiative interior and the outer convective zone .	The Rossby number , which is related to the dynamo process , shows an observational correlation with activity .	It represents the ratio between the rotation period of the star and the local convective turnover time .	The former is well determined from observations but the latter is estimated by an empirical iterated function depending on the color index ( B-V ) and the mixing-length parameter .
2	The code features a wealth of built-in geometries , radiation source spectra , dust characterizations , dust grids , and detectors , in addition to various mechanisms for importing snapshots generated by hydrodynamical simulations .	We discuss the architecture and design principles that underpin the latest version of SKIRT , a state-of-the-art open source code for simulating continuum radiation transfer in dusty astrophysical systems , such as spiral galaxies and accretion disks .	SKIRT employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical processes including scattering , absorption and emission by the dust .	The configuration for a particular simulation is defined at run-time through a user-friendly interface suitable for both occasional and power users .	These capabilities are enabled by careful C++ code design .
4	In this paper , we shed light on the shortcomings of current anonymization schemes in the context of enterprise data .	Data privacy is one of the key challenges faced by enterprises today .	Anonymization techniques address this problem by sanitizing sensitive data such that individual privacy is preserved while allowing enterprises to maintain and share sensitive data .	However , existing work on this problem make inherent assumptions about the data that are impractical in day-to-day enterprise data management scenarios .	Further , application of existing anonymization schemes on enterprise data could lead to adversarial attacks in which an intruder could use information fusion techniques to inflict a privacy breach .
3	These are stoquastic local Hamiltonians with a `` frustration free '' ground-state .	We study several problems related to properties of non-negative matrices that arise at the boundary between quantum and classical probabilistic computation .	Our results are twofold .	First , we identify a large class of quantum Hamiltonians describing systems of qubits for which the adiabatic evolution can be efficiently simulated on a classical probabilistic computer .	A Hamiltonian belongs to this class iff it can be represented as $ H=\sum_a H_a $ where ( 1 ) every term $ H_a $ acts non-trivially on a constant number of qubits , ( 2 ) every term $ H_a $ has real non-positive off-diagonal matrix elements in the standard basis , and ( 3 ) the ground-state of $ H $ is a ground-state of every term $ H_a $ .
2	We derive properties of this process and propose an extended model which generalises the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to the class of continuous-time ARMA ( CARMA ) processes .	We propose a parsimonious stochastic model for characterising the distributional and temporal properties of rainfall .	The model is based on an integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by the Hougaard L\'evy process .	The model is illustrated by fitting it to empirical rainfall data on both daily and hourly time scales .	It is shown that the model is sufficiently flexible to capture important features of the rainfall process across locations and time scales .
1	A substantial fraction of the resistance drop with voltage can be ascribed to variations of the density of states and the barrier transmission with the bias .	In this paper we analyze different contributions to the magnetoresistance of magnetic tunneling junctions at low voltages .	However , we found that the anomaly observed at zero bias and the magnetoresistance behavior at very small voltages , point to the contribution of inelastic magnon-assisted tunneling .	The latter is described by a transfer parameter $ T^ { J } $ , which is one or two orders of magnitude smaller than $ T^ { d } $ , the direct transmission for elastic currents .	Our theory is in excellent agreement with experimental data , yielding estimated values of $ T^ { J } $ which are of the order of $ T^ { d } $ / $ T^ { J } $ ~ 40 .
3	Graphene hosts long-lived , electrically tunable plasmons that also interact strongly with light .	Nonlinear optical processes rely on the intrinsically weak interactions between photons enabled by their coupling with matter .	Unfortunately , many applications in nonlinear optics are severely hindered by the small response of conventional materials .	Metallic nanostructures partially alleviate this situation , as the large light enhancement associated with their localized plasmons amplifies their nonlinear response to record high levels .	Here we show that the nonlinear polarizabilities of graphene nanoislands can be electrically tuned to surpass by several orders of magnitude those of metal nanoparticles of similar size .
2	Both supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry are spontaneously broken , with the spin-3/2 , spin-1 and spin-1/2 masses sliding along a classical flat direction , with a single real massless scalar in the spectrum .	We introduce a new N=1 no-scale supergravity model with F- and D-term breaking .	It contains a single chiral supermultiplet T and a single U ( 1 ) vector multiplet U , gauging an axionic shift symmetry .	The other degrees of freedom are absorbed by the massive gravitino and vector .	We extend our model , under very mild conditions , to general gauge groups and matter content .
2	As a byproduct we settle a question of Hough and the late Simion on the divisibility of the 4-Catalan numbers .	In this paper we consider the generalized Catalan numbers F ( s , n ) = 1/ ( ( s-1 ) n+1 ) binom { sn } { n } .	We find all $ n $ such that for $ p $ prime , p^q divides F ( p^q , n ) , q & gt ; =1 .	We also prove that \binom { p^qn+1 } { n } , p^q & lt ; =99999 , is squarefree for n sufficiently large ( explicit ) , and with the help of the generalized Catalan numbers we find the set of possible exceptions .	As consequences , we obtain that binom { 4n+1 } { n } , binom { 9n+1 } { n } are squarefree for n & gt ; 2^ { 1518 } , respectively n & gt ; 3^ { 956 } , with at most 2^ { 18.2 } , respectively 3^ { 15.3 } possible exceptions .
1	The exchangeable mezzanine cards allow for an employment of the system in very different applications such as analog-to-digital or time-to-digital conversions , coincidence matrix formation , fast pattern recognition or fast trigger generation .	The GANDALF 6U-VME64x/VXS module has been designed to cope with a variety of readout tasks in high energy and nuclear physics experiments , in particular the COMPASS experiment at CERN .	Based on this platform , we present a 128-channel TDC which is implemented in a single Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA using a shifted clock sampling method .	In this concept each input signal is continuously sampled by 16 flip-flops using equidistant phase-shifted clocks .	Compared to previous FPGA designs , usually based on delay lines and comprising few TDC channels with resolutions in the order of 10 ps , our design permits the implementation of a large number of TDC channels with a resolution of 64 ps in a single FPGA .
4	The contribution of this work regards three main aspects : First , the use of OMNeT++ for network development in automotive industry .	In this paper , the network simulation framework OMNeT++ is used for development and testing of automotive Ethernet-Networks .	Therefore OMNeT++ is extended by the INET framework .	It is augmented by an implementation of the protocol SOME/IP ( -SD ) and an connector to the middleware Gamma V. The middleware is used to configure the network by initialization .	Additionally data , which is sent over the network , can be changed on the fly .
4	In a $ ^ { 87 } $ Rb condensate this instability is present already at zero magnetic field .	The stability of nonstationary states of homogeneous spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates is studied by performing Bogoliubov analysis in a frame of reference where the state is stationary .	In particular , the effect of an external magnetic field is examined .	It is found that a nonzero magnetic field introduces instability in a $ ^ { 23 } $ Na condensate .	The wavelengths of this instability can be controlled by tuning the strength of the magnetic field .
4	This invariance constraint applies to the entire spectrum of states , from the vacuum to the excited states ( should they exist ) , and is in that sense much stronger than the usual Poincare invariance requirement of the Minkowski vacuum alone .	Backreactions are considered in a de Sitter spacetime whose cosmological constant is generated by the potential of scalar field .	The leading order gravitational effect of nonlinear matter fluctuations is analyzed and it is found that the initial value problem for the perturbed Einstein equations possesses linearization instabilities .	We show that these linearization instabilities can be avoided by assuming strict de Sitter invariance of the quantum states of the linearized fluctuations .	We furthermore show that quantum anomalies do not block the invariance requirement .
4	While slower than q-hull for the general case it significantly outperforms q-hull for the pathological case where all of the points are on the 3D hull ( as is the case for Delaunay triangulation ) .	This paper presents a new O ( nlog ( n ) ) algorithm for computing the convex hull of a set of 3 dimensional points .	The algorithm first sorts the point in ( x , y , z ) then incrementally adds sorted points to the convex hull using the constraint that each new point added to the hull can 'see ' at least one facet touching the last point added .	The reduces the search time for adding new points .	The algorithm belongs to the family of swept hull algorithms .
1	energies ranging from 35 GeV through 189 GeV .	We employ data taken by the JADE and OPAL experiments for an integrated QCD study in hadronic e+e- annihilations at c.m.s .	The study is based on jet-multiplicity related observables .	The observables are obtained to high jet resolution scales with the JADE , Durham , Cambridge and cone jet finders , and compared with the predictions of various QCD and Monte Carlo models .	The strong coupling strength , alpha_s , is determined at each energy by fits of O ( alpha_s^2 ) calculations , as well as matched O ( alpha_s^2 ) and NLLA predictions , to the data .
0	Properties of finite nuclei are evaluated with two-nucleon ( NN ) and three-nucleon ( NNN ) interactions derived within chiral effective field theory ( EFT ) .	The nuclear Hamiltonian is fixed by properties of the A=2 system , except for two low-energy constants ( LECs ) that parameterize the short range NNN interaction .	We constrain those two LECs by a fit to the A=3 system binding energy and investigate sensitivity of 4He , 6Li , 10,11B and 12,13C properties to the variation of the constrained LECs .	We identify a preferred choice that gives globally the best description .	We demonstrate that the NNN interaction terms significantly improve the binding energies and spectra of mid-p-shell nuclei not just with the preferred choice of the LECs but even within a wide range of the constrained LECs .
1	When the energy scale is above the string scale or Planck scale a number of interesting phenomena occur , namely , production of stringy states , p-branes , string balls , black hole , etc .	In models of large extra dimensions , the string and Planck scales become accessible at future colliders .	In this work , we systematically study the production cross sections of black holes , string balls , and p-branes at hadronic supercolliders .	We also discuss their signatures .	At the energy scale between the string scale M_s and M_s/g_s^2 , where g_s is the string coupling , the production is dominated by string balls , while beyond M_s/g_s^2 it is dominated by black holes .
3	Thus , the merger rate depends critically upon whether or not the BH is retained by the cluster after the merger .	We model the formation of black hole-neutron star ( BH-NS ) binaries via dynamical interactions in globular clusters .	We find that in dense , massive clusters , 16-61 % of the BH-NS binaries formed by interactions with existing BH binaries will undergo mergers driven by the emission of gravitational radiation .	If the BHs are retained by the cluster after merging with a NS , the BHs acquire subsequent NS companions and undergo several mergers .	Results from numerical relativity suggest that kick imparted to a ~7 M_sun BH after it merges with a NS will greatly exceed the cluster 's escape velocity .
1	As a general principle ( GP ) , such variations can not be locally detected because the basic parameters of all of the 'well-defined parts ' of the instruments change , lineally , in the same proportion with respect to their original values '' .	From the equivalence principle and true gravitational ( G ) time dilation experiments it is concluded that `` matter is not invariable after a change of relative position with respect to other bodies '' .	Only observers that do n't change of position can detect them .	Thus , to relate quantities measured by observers in different G potentials they must be previously transformed after Lorenz and G transformations derived from experiments .	They are account for all of the `` G tests '' .
4	Under a Poisson assumption , we fit a model to observed data using the negative log-likelihood score .	Tensors have found application in a variety of fields , ranging from chemometrics to signal processing and beyond .	In this paper , we consider the problem of multilinear modeling of sparse count data .	Our goal is to develop a descriptive tensor factorization model of such data , along with appropriate algorithms and theory .	To do so , we propose that the random variation is best described via a Poisson distribution , which better describes the zeros observed in the data as compared to the typical assumption of a Gaussian distribution .
0	Theoretical spectra of X-ray bursting neutron star ( NS ) model atmospheres are widely used to determine the basic NS parameters such as their masses and radii .	We construct accurate NS atmosphere models using for the first time an exact treatment of Compton scattering via the integral relativistic kinetic equation .	We also compare the results with the previous calculations based on the Kompaneets operator .	We solve the radiation transfer equation together with the hydrostatic equilibrium equation accounting exactly for the radiation pressure by electron scattering .	We thus construct a new set of plane-parallel atmosphere models in LTE for hot NSs .
1	In this work , we study these wall effects on a spherical particle entrapped in a closed cylinder .	The diffusive motion of a colloidal particle trapped inside a small cavity filled with fluid is reduced by hydrodynamic interactions with the confining walls .	We calculate the diffusion coefficient along the radial , azimuthal and axial direction for different particle positions .	At all locations the diffusion is smaller than in a bulk fluid and it becomes anisotropic near the container 's walls .	We present a simple model which reasonably well desribes the simulation results for the given dimensions of the cylinder , which are taken from recent experimental work .
2	We find that even for halos not undergoing major mergers the mass accretion rates are plausibly sufficient to account for the high star formation rates observed in z~2 disks .	Recent observations of UV-/optically selected , massive star forming galaxies at z~2 indicate that the baryonic mass assembly and star formation history is dominated by continuous rapid accretion of gas and internal secular evolution , rather than by major mergers .	We use the Millennium Simulation to build new halo merger trees , and extract halo merger fractions and mass accretion rates .	On the other hand , the fraction of major mergers in the Millennium Simulation is sufficient to account for the number counts of submillimeter galaxies ( SMGs ) , in support of observational evidence that these are major mergers .	When following the fate of these two populations in the Millennium Simulation to z=0 , we find that subsequent mergers are not frequent enough to convert all z~2 turbulent disks into elliptical galaxies at z=0 .
3	Twelve of these stars are eclipsing binaries and fifteen are likely new , low-amplitude Cepheids .	We have performed a search for variable stars in the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822 using wide-field multi-epoch VI photometry down to a limiting magnitude $ V $ $ \sim $ 22 .	Apart from the Cepheid variables in this galaxy already reported in an earlier paper by Pietrzynski et al .	( 2004 ) , we have found 1019 `` non-periodic '' variable stars , 50 periodically variable stars with periods ranging from 0.12 to 66 days and 146 probably periodic variables .	Interestingly , seven of these Cepheid candidates have periods longer than 100 days , have very low amplitudes ( less than 0.2 mag in $ I $ ) , and are very red .
0	The minimal models M ( p ' , p ) with p ' & gt ; 2 have a unique ( non-trivial ) simple current of conformal dimension h = ( p ' - 2 ) ( p - 2 ) / 4 .	The representation theory of the extended algebra defined by this simple current is investigated in detail .	All highest weight representations are proved to be irreducible : There are thus no singular vectors in the extended theory .	This has interesting structural consequences .	In particular , it leads to a recursive method for computing the various terms appearing in the operator product expansion of the simple current with itself .
0	We studied the properties of the neutral gas in a sample of 38 local [ U ] LIRGs , which mainly covers the less explored LIRG luminosity range .	This study is based on the analysis of the spatially integrated and spatially resolved spectra of the NaD feature obtained with the VIMOS/VLT-IFS .	Analyzing spatially integrated spectra , we find that the contribution of stars to the observed NaD-EWs is generally small ( & lt ; 35 % ) , and therefore this feature is dominated by ISM absorption .	After subtracting the stellar contribution , we find that the pure-ISM integrated spectra generally show blueshifted NaD profiles , indicating neutral gas outflow velocities V in the range 65-260 km/s .	Excluding galaxies with AGNs , V shows a dependency with the SFR of the type V \propto SFR^0.15 ( in rather good agreement with previous results ) .
3	The quantitative interpretation of single and di-hadron measurements is , however , complicated by the fact that the initial parton energy is unknown .	One of the most active areas of investigation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is the study of the jet quenching phenomenon whereby hard partons lose their energy as they traverse the hot , dense matter created in such collisions .	Strong parton energy loss has been observed in central nucleus-nucleus collisions as evidenced by the a large suppression of the yield of high pT hadrons as compared to the expected yield based on measurements in p+p collisions .	Moreover , measurements of back-to-back correlations of charged hadrons suggest that jet shapes are strongly modified modified by the medium .	A more informative measurement would be one in which the initial parton energy is known , allowing the determination of the fragmentation function , which may be effectively modified from its vacuum form by the presence of the medium .
0	We present high quality long slit spectra along the major and minor axes out to 1.5 effective radius ( $ R_e $ ) of the massive galaxy NGC4636 taken by Hobby-Eberly Telescope ( HET ) .	Using Fourier Correlation Quotient ( FCQ ) method , we measured the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution along the axes .	Furthermore , six Lick/IDS indices ( $ H\beta , Mgb , Fe_ { 5015 } , Fe_ { 5270 } , Fe_ { 5335 } , Fe_ { 5406 } $ ) are derived from the clean spectrum .	By comparing the measured absorption line strengths with the predictions of Simple Stellar Populations ( SSP ) models , we derived ages , total metallicity and $ \alpha $ abundance profiles of the galaxy .	This galaxy presents old and $ [ \alpha/Fe ] $ over abundant stellar populations .
3	There are two classes of solutions .	A reduction of the Dirac-Maxwell equations in the case of static cylindrical symmetry is performed .	The behaviour of the resulting system of o.d.e .	's is examined analytically and numerical solutions presented .	The first type of solution is a Dirac field surrounding a charged `` wire '' .
0	Gold nanoparticles have been conceived as a radiosensitizer in cancer radiation therapy , but one of the important questions for primary drug screening is what size of gold nanoparticles can optimally enhance radiation effects .	Herein , we perform in vitro and in vivo radiosensitization studies of 4.8 , 12.1 , 27.3 , and 46.6 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles .	In vitro results show that all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can cause a significant decrease in cancer cell survival after gamma radiation .	12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have dispersive distributions in the cells and have stronger sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles by both cell apoptosis and necrosis .	Further , in vivo results also show all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can decrease tumor volume and weight after 5 Gy radiations , and 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have greater sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles , which can lead to almost complete disappearance of the tumor .
1	All of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range z = 2 to 6.5 .	We use observed optical to near infrared spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) of 266 galaxies in the COSMOS survey to derive the wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation at high redshift .	The presence of the CIV absorption feature , indicating that the rest-frame UV-optical SED is dominated by OB stars , is used to select objects for which the intrinsic , unattenuated spectrum has a well-established shape .	Comparison of this intrinsic spectrum with the observed broadband photometric SED then permits derivation of the wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation .	The derived dust attenuation curve is similar in overall shape to the Calzetti curve for local starburst galaxies .
0	Thermodynamic properties of extensive but nonadditive systems are investigated .	The precise definitions of additivity and extensivity are presented , and we will see that additivity derives several important properties including the shape-independence of the thermodynamic functions , the concavity of the entropy , and the equivalence of ensembles .	In nonadditive systems , some of the above properties can be violated .	It is pointed out that the shape-dependence of the entropy density in a nonadditive system results in the violation of the Gibbs-Duhem equation .	As an example , the dipolar gas is numerically studied and the violation of the Gibbs-Duhem equation is confirmed .
4	We also find , using both theoretical and empirical calibrations of the PLK relation , a true distance to M5 of ( 14.44 \pm 0.02 ) mag .	We present new and accurate near-infrared ( NIR ) J , K-band time series data for the Galactic globular cluster ( GC ) M5 = NGC5904 .	Data were collected with SOFI at the NTT ( 71 J + 120 K images ) and with NICS at the TNG ( 25 J + 22 K images ) and cover two orthogonal strips across the center of the cluster of \approx 5 \times 10 arcmin^ { 2 } each .	These data allowed us to derive accurate mean K-band magnitudes for 52 fundamental ( RR_ { ab } ) and 24 first overtone ( RR_ { c } ) RR Lyrae stars .	Using this sample of RR Lyrae stars , we find that the slope of the K-band Period Luminosity ( PLK ) relation ( -2.33 \pm 0.08 ) agrees quite well with similar estimates available in the literature .
1	It was shown , that for small thermalisation time , two loop rate contribute substantially to high $ p_T $ photons .	Assuming QGP as the initial state , we have analyzed the direct photon data , obtained by the WA98 collaboration , in 158 A GeV Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS .	We argue that for extremely short thermalisation time scale , the higher loop contribution should not be neglected .	For thermalisation time 0.4 fm or greater , when higher loop contribution are not substantial , the initial temperature of the QGP is not large and the system does not produce enough hard $ p_T $ photons to fit the WA98 experiment .	For initial time in the ranges of 0.4-1.0 fm , WA98 data could be fitted only if the fluid has initial radial velocity in the range of 0.3-0.5c .
1	Here , sparse Big Data is a set of $ n $ vectors in $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ , where each vector has $ O ( 1 ) $ non-zeroes entries , and $ d\geq n $ .	We provide the first streaming algorithm for computing a provable approximation to the $ k $ -means of sparse Big data .	E.g. , adjacency matrix of a graph , web-links , social network , document-terms , or image-features matrices .	Our streaming algorithm stores at most $ \log n\cdot k^ { O ( 1 ) } $ input points in memory .	If the stream is distributed among $ M $ machines , the running time reduces by a factor of $ M $ , while communicating a total of $ M\cdot k^ { O ( 1 ) } $ ( sparse ) input points between the machines .
2	The results revolve around the use of geodesic Witten diagrams , recently introduced in arXiv:1508.00501 , evaluated in locally AdS $ _3 $ geometries generated by backreaction of heavy operators .	We present a unified framework for the holographic computation of Virasoro conformal blocks at large central charge .	In particular , we provide bulk constructions that correctly reproduce all semiclassical Virasoro blocks that are known explicitly from conformal field theory computations .	We also provide an alternative computation of the heavy-light semiclassical block -- in which two external operators become parametrically heavy -- as a certain scattering process involving higher spin gauge fields in AdS $ _3 $ ; this approach highlights the chiral nature of Virasoro blocks .	These techniques may be systematically extended to compute corrections to these blocks and to interpolate amongst the different semiclassical regimes .
0	We present a sample of 1899 galaxies with a close companion taken from the SDSS DR7 .	The galaxy pairs are selected to have velocity differences & lt ; 300 km/s , projected separations ( rp ) & lt ; 80 kpc/h , mass ratios between 0.1 and 10 , and robust measurements of star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities .	We match the galaxies in total stellar mass , redshift , and local density to a set of 10 control galaxies per pair galaxy .	For each pair galaxy we can therefore calculate the statistical change in star formation rate ( SFR ) and metallicity associated with the interaction process .	Relative to the control sample , we find that galaxies in pairs show typical SFR enhancements that are , on average , 60 % higher than the control sample at rp & lt ; 30 kpc/h .
2	The model satisfies a natural energy equality , in which the sum of the entropic , elastic and electrostatic free energies are dissipated through viscous , electrodiffusive and osmotic flows .	We introduce a model for ionic electrodiffusion and osmotic water flow through cells and tissues .	The model consists of a system of partial differential equations for ionic concentration and fluid flow with interface conditions at deforming membrane boundaries .	We discuss limiting models when certain dimensionless parameters are small .	Finally , we develop a numerical scheme for the one-dimensional case and present some simple applications of our model to cell volume control .
2	These concepts are examined here in the framework of a criterion for identifying classicality of a system of spin-1/2s based on the concept of joint quasiprobability ( JQP ) for the eigevalues of spin components .	A sufficient condition for a quantum state of a system of spin-1/2 particles ( spin-1/2s ) to admit a local hidden variable ( LHV ) description i.e.to be classical is the separability of the density matrix characterizing its state , but not all classical states are separable .	This leads one to infer that separability and classicality are two different concepts .	The said criterion identifies a state as classical if a suitably defined JQP of the eigenvalues of spin components in suitably chosen three or two orthogonal directions is non-negative .	In agreement with other approaches , the JQP based criterion leads to the result that all non-factorizable pure states of two spin-1/2s are non-classical .
4	This is a lower value than the result for ordinary percolation .	We report numerical studies of the cluster development of two-phase flow in a steady-state environment of porous media .	This is done by including biperiodic boundary conditions in a two-dimensional flow simulator .	Initial transients of wetting and non-wetting phases that evolve before steady-state has occurred , undergo a cross-over where every initial patterns are broken up .	For flow dominated by capillary effects with capillary numbers in order of $ 10^ { -5 } $ , we find that around a critical saturation of non-wetting fluid the non-wetting clusters of size $ s $ have a power-law distribution $ n_s \sim s^ { -\tau } $ with the exponent $ \tau = 1.92 \pm 0.04 $ for large clusters .
1	Applying this new formalism , calculations are performed for nuclear matter .	A relativistic extension of the particle-particle hole-hole ring-diagram many-body formalism is developed by using the Dirac equation for single-particle motion in the medium .	The results show that the saturation density is improved and the equation of state becomes softer as compared to corresponding Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations .	Using the Bonn A potential , nuclear matter is predicted to saturate at an energy per nucleon of -- 15.30 MeV and a density equivalent to a Fermi momentum of 1.38 fm $ ^ { -1 } $ , in excellent agreement with empirical information .	The compression modulus is 152 MeV at the saturation point .
2	This thesis focuses on DW manipulation and DW-based devices in spin-valve ( SV ) tracks .	Magnetic systems based on the manipulation of domain walls ( DWs ) in nano-tracks have been shown to store data at high density , perform complex logic operations , and mechanically manipulate magnetic beads .	The magnetic track has been a model system to study magnetic and magneto-electronic phenomena , such as field induced DW propagation and spin-transfer torque .	In comparison to monolayer tracks , the SV track enables more sensitive and versatile measurements , as well as an electronic output of DW-based devices , of crucial interest to applications .	However , these multi-layered tracks add new , potentially disruptive magnetic interactions , as well as fabrication challenges .
3	On the other hand , the off-diagonal or superconducting composite order breaks the gauge symmetry of conduction electrons , and the collective mode couples with charge excitations near the zone boundary .	Goldstone modes emerge associated with spontaneous breakdown of the continuous symmetry in the two-channel Kondo lattice , which describes strongly correlated f-electron systems with a non-Kramers doublet at each site .	This paper derives the spectra of these collective modes by the equation of motion method together with the random phase approximation .	The diagonal composite order breaks the SU ( 2 ) channel symmetry , and the symmetry-restoring collective mode couples with magnetic field .	At half-filling of the conduction bands , the spectra of these two modes become identical by a shift of the momentum , owing to the SO ( 5 ) symmetry of the system .
3	For example , multinomial distributions over words are uncovered that can be understood as `` nouns about weather '' or `` verbs about law '' .	This article presents a probabilistic generative model for text based on semantic topics and syntactic classes called Part-of-Speech LDA ( POSLDA ) .	POSLDA simultaneously uncovers short-range syntactic patterns ( syntax ) and long-range semantic patterns ( topics ) that exist in document collections .	This results in word distributions that are specific to both topics ( sports , education , ... ) and parts-of-speech ( nouns , verbs , ... ) .	We describe the model and an approximate inference algorithm and then demonstrate the quality of the learned topics both qualitatively and quantitatively .
1	The DLA has been earlier identified as a low surface brightness galaxy SBS 1543+593 at an impact parameter of ~ 400 pc to the QSO line of sight .	We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ( GMRT ) HI 21cm emission images of the z=0.009 damped Lyman-alpha ( DLA ) absorber towards the QSO HS 1543+5921 .	The extremely low redshift of the absorber allows us to make spatially resolved images of the 21cm emission ; besides the HI mass , this also enables us to determine the velocity field of the galaxy and , hence , to estimate its dynamical mass .	We obtain a total HI mass of ~ 1.4x10^9 Msun , considerably smaller than the value of M* ( HI ) determined from blind 21cm emission surveys .	This continues the trend of low HI mass in all low redshift DLAs for which HI emission observations have been attempted .
1	In this paper , based on weakly dependent sample , we investigate the single-index prediction ( SIP ) model which is robust against deviation from the single-index model .	For the past two decades , single-index model , a special case of projection pursuit regression , has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high dimensional problem in nonparametric regression .	The single-index is identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of the response variable , regardless of whether the prediction function is a genuine single-index function .	A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for the single-index prediction coefficients , and is shown to be root-n consistent and asymptotically normal .	An iterative optimization routine is used which is sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within seconds .
1	We describe this hyperon here , its structure , binding energy and lifetime , resonance width , production mechanisms , production cross sections , and decay modes .	The strange-anticharmed Pentaquark is a $ uud\bar { c } s $ or $ udd\bar { c } s $ five-quark baryon that is expected to be either a narrow resonance , or possibly even stable against strong and electromagnetic decay .	We describe techniques to reduce backgrounds in search experiments and to optimize the conditions for Pentaquark observation .	Possibilities for enhancing the signal over background in Pentaquark searches are investigated by examining predictions for detailed momentum and angular distributions in multiparticle final states .	General model-independent predictions are presented as well as those from two models : a loosely bound $ D_ { s } ^-N $ molecule and a strongly-bound five-quark system .
0	The Bose-Hubbard model is a system of interacting bosons that live on the vertices of a graph .	The particles can move between adjacent vertices and experience a repulsive on-site interaction .	The Hamiltonian is determined by a choice of graph that specifies the geometry in which the particles move and interact .	We prove that approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on a graph at fixed particle number is QMA-complete .	In our QMA-hardness proof , we encode the history of an n-qubit computation in the subspace with at most one particle per site ( i.e. , hard-core bosons ) .
0	Next generation surveys will observe the large-scale structure of the Universe with unprecedented accuracy .	This will enable us to test the relationships between matter over-densities , the curvature perturbation and the Newtonian potential .	Any large-distance modification of gravity or exotic nature of dark energy modifies these relationships as compared to those predicted in the standard smooth dark energy model based on General Relativity .	In linear theory of structure growth such modifications are often parameterised by virtue of two functions of space and time that enter the relation of the curvature perturbation to , first , the matter over-density , and second , the Newtonian potential .	We investigate the predictions for these functions in Brans-Dicke theory , clustering dark energy models and interacting dark energy models .
3	Here we demonstrate that a more sophisticated metamaterial model may fix this deficiency via breaking the mirror and temporal ( PT ) symmetries of the original model and producing one-way propagation along the timelike spatial coordinate .	Hyperbolic metamaterials may be used to model a 2+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime in which the role of time is played by one of the spatial coordinates .	When a metamaterial is built and illuminated with a coherent extraordinary laser beam , the stationary pattern of light propagation inside the metamaterial may be treated as a collection of particle world lines , which represents a complete history of this 2+1 dimensional spacetime .	While this model may be used to build interesting spacetime analogs , such as metamaterial black holes and big bang , it lacks causality : since light inside the metamaterial may propagate back and forth along the timelike spatial coordinate , events in the future may affect events in the past .	Resulting 2+1 Minkowski spacetime appears to be causal .
1	When the inversion symmetry of the potential energy is broken , we find that the multi-photon processes can coexist in the multi-level SFQ circuits .	In contrast to natural atoms , the potential energies for superconducting flux qubit ( SFQ ) circuits can be artificially controlled .	Moreover , there are not only transverse but also longitudinal couplings between the external magnetic fields and the SFQs when the inversion symmetry of potential energy is broken .	The longitudinal coupling would induce some new phenomena in the SFQs .	Here we will show how the longitudinal coupling can result in the coexistence of multi-photon processes in a two-level system formed by a SFQ circuit .
3	In addition to spherically-symmetric mass-ejection events , we consider planetary dynamics under the influence of an expanding disk .	In this paper , we study the general impact of stellar mass-ejection events in planetary orbits in post-common envelope binaries with circumbinary planets like those around NN Serpentis .	We discuss a set of simple equations that determine upper and lower limits for orbital expansion and investigate the effect of initial eccentricity .	We deduce the range of possible semi-major axes and initial eccentricity values of the planets prior to the common-envelope event .	In order to have survived , we suggest that the present planets in NN Ser must have had semi-major axes $ \ , { } ^ & gt ; _ { \sim } \ , 10 $ AU and high eccentricity values which is in conflict with current observations .
4	In this paper , we address this issue by learning to map from initial representations to task-specific ones .	We consider the setting in which we train a supervised model that learns task-specific word representations .	We assume that we have access to some initial word representations ( e.g. , unsupervised embeddings ) , and that the supervised learning procedure updates them to task-specific representations for words contained in the training data .	But what about words not contained in the supervised training data ?	When such unseen words are encountered at test time , they are typically represented by either their initial vectors or a single unknown vector , which often leads to errors .
2	Our results lead to the conclusion that both measures can drop by an arbitrary amount when only a single qubit of a local system is lost .	Squashed entanglement and entanglement of purification are quantum mechanical correlation measures and defined as certain minimisations of entropic quantities .	We present the first non-trivial calculations of both quantities .	This property is known as `` locking '' and has previously been observed for other correlation measures , such as the accessible information , entanglement cost and the logarithmic negativity .	In the case of squashed entanglement , the results are obtained with the help of an inequality that can be understood as a quantum channel analogue of well-known entropic uncertainty relations .
3	We point out the necessity of disentangling two form factors that contribute to the matrix element ; previous calculations did not make the separation , which led to an underestimate of the physical matrix elements .	We present a model-independent calculation of hadron matrix elements for all dimension-six operators associated with baryon number violating processes using lattice QCD .	The calculation is performed with the Wilson quark action in the quenched approximation at $ \beta=6/g^2=6.0 $ on a $ 28^2\times 48\times 80 $ lattice .	Our results cover all the matrix elements required to estimate the partial lifetimes of ( proton , neutron ) $ \to $ ( $ \pi , K , \eta $ ) + ( $ { \bar \nu } , e^+ , \mu^+ $ ) decay modes .	With a correct separation , we find that the matrix elements have values 3-5 times larger than the smallest estimates employed in phenomenological analyses of the nucleon decays , which could give strong constraints on several GUT models .
0	Wireless networking is becoming an increasingly important and popular way of providing global information access to users on the move .	One of the main challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of simple and robust handoff algorithms , which allow a mobile node to roam among heterogeneous wireless networks .	In this paper , the authors devise a scheme , A Novel Adaptive Channel Allocation Scheme ( ACAS ) where the number of guard channel ( s ) is adjusted automatically based on the average handoff blocking rate measured in the past certain period of time .	The handoff blocking rate is controlled under the designated threshold and the new call blocking rate is minimized .	The performance evaluation of the ACAS is done through simulation of nodes .
1	The layered data is encoded by means of Prioritized Random Linear Coding ( PRLC ) in order to be resilient to channel loss while respecting the unequal levels of importance in the data , and data blocks are transmitted simultaneously in order to reduce decoding delays and improve the delivery performance .	In this paper , we deal with the problem of jointly determining the optimal coding strategy and the scheduling decisions when receivers obtain layered data from multiple servers .	We formulate the optimal coding and scheduling decisions problem in our novel framework with the help of Markov Decision Processes ( MDP ) , which are effective tools for modeling adapting streaming systems .	Reinforcement learning approaches are then proposed to derive reduced computational complexity solutions to the adaptive coding and scheduling problems .	The novel reinforcement learning approaches and the MDP solution are examined in an illustrative example for scalable video transmission .
0	We observed with Suzaku the symbiotic star SS73 17 , motivated by the discovery by the INTEGRAL satellite and the Swift BAT survey that it emits hard X-rays .	Our observations showed a highly-absorbed X-ray spectrum with NH & gt ; 10^23 cm-2 , equivalent to A_V & gt ; 26 , although the source has B magnitude 11.3 and is also bright in UV .	The source also shows strong , narrow iron lines including fluorescent Fe K as well as Fe xxv and Fe xxvi .	The X-ray spectrum can be fit with a thermal model including an absorption component that partially covers the source .	Most of the equivalent width of the iron fluorescent line in this model can be explained as a combination of reprocessing in a dense absorber plus reflection off a white dwarf surface , but it is likely that the continuum is partially seen in reflection as well .
4	The well-like pit , which is known to many researchers , is a special case of this model .	Models of the magnetic field enhancement at pits are discussed .	In order to build a model of pit , parameters that characterize a geometry of edges of pit , such as a curvature radius and a slope angle of edge , should be included , because the magnetic field is enhanced at an edge of a pit .	A shape of the bottom of the pit is not important , because the magnetic field attenuates at the bottom .	The simplest model of the pit is given by the two-dimensional pit with a triangular section .
3	We give a brief sketch for the first formula and a rather detailed exposition for the second one .	The paper is devoted to the problem of finding explicit combinatorial formulae for the Pontryagin classes .	We discuss two formulae , the classical Gabrielov-Gelfand-Losik formula based on investigation of configuration spaces and the local combinatorial formula obtained by the author in 2004 .	The latter formula is based on the notion of a universal local formula introduced by the author and on the usage of bistellar moves .	For the second formula , we also succeed to simplify it by providing a new simpler algorithm for decomposing a cycle in the graph of bistellar moves of two-dimensional combinatorial spheres into a linear combination of elementary cycles .
4	The non-relativistic conformal symmetries also have applications to time-dependent harmonic oscillators .	We show explicitly how the Newton-Hooke groups act as symmetries of the equations of motion of non-relativistic cosmological models with a cosmological constant .	We give the action on the associated non-relativistic spacetimes and show how these may be obtained from a null reduction of 5-dimensional homogeneous pp-wave Lorentzian spacetimes .	This allows us to realize the Newton-Hooke groups and their Bargmann type central extensions as subgroups of the isometry groups of the pp-wave spacetimes .	The extended Schrodinger type conformal group is identified and its action on the equations of motion given .
1	In fact , these two profiles provide two different insights of the shower : the electromagnetic component gives a measurement of the energy and the strength of the neutral pion channel ; while the muonic profile , being intimately related with the charged mesons decays , can be used as a direct probe for the high energy hadronic interactions .	The electromagnetic and the muonic longitudinal profile at production enclosure important information about the primary particle and the hadronic interactions that rule the shower development .	In this work we explore the interplay between the electromagnetic and muonic profiles , by analysing their phenomenologic behaviour for different primary masses and energies , zenith angles , and also different high energy hadronic interaction models .	We have found that the muonic longitudinal profile at production displays universal features similar to what is known for the electromagnetic one .	Moreover , we show that both profiles have new primary mass composition variables which are fairly independent of the high energy hadronic interaction model .
1	Solutions of the so called quantum master equation satisfying certain boundary conditions are proven to be in 1-1 correspondence with representations of a wheeled dg prop which , on the one hand , is isomorphic to the cobar construction of the prop of unimodular Lie 1-bialgebras and , on the other hand , is quasi-isomorphic to the dg wheeled prop of unimodular Poisson structures .	Using technique of wheeled props we establish a correspondence between the homotopy theory of unimodular Lie 1-bialgebras and the famous Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism .	These results allow us to apply properadic methods for computing formulae for a homotopy transfer of a unimodular Lie 1-bialgebra structure on an arbitrary complex to the associated quantum master function on its cohomology .	It is proven that in the category of quantum BV manifolds associated with the homotopy theory of unimodular Lie 1-bialgebras quasi-isomorphisms are equivalence relations .	It is shown that Losev-Mnev 's BF theory for unimodular Lie algebras can be naturally extended to the case of unimodular Lie 1-bialgebras ( and , eventually , to the case of unimodular Poisson structures ) .
1	The trajectory of the front wheel and the initial position of the bicycle uniquely determine its motion and its terminal position ; the monodromy map sending the initial position to the terminal one arises .	The model of a bicycle is a unit segment AB that can move in the plane so that it remains tangent to the trajectory of point A ( the rear wheel is fixed on the bicycle frame ) ; the same model describes the hatchet planimeter .	According to R. Foote 's theorem , this mapping of a circle to a circle is a Moebius transformation .	We extend this result to multi-dimensional setting .	Moebius transformations belong to one of the three types : elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic .
3	The metering platform features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation of the current measurement unit .	Smart meters are an enabling technology for many smart grid applications .	This paper introduces a design for a low-cost smart meter system as well as the fundamentals of smart metering .	The smart meter platform , provided as open hardware , is designed with a connector interface compatible to the Arduino platform , thus opening the possibilities for smart meters with flexible hardware and computation features , starting from low-cost 8 bit micro controllers up to powerful single board computers that can run Linux .	The suggested design can switch loads , offers a variable sampling frequency , and provides measurement data such as active power , reactive and apparent power .
0	Different theoretical and phenomenological aspects of the Minimal and Nonminimal Walking Technicolor theories have recently been studied .	The goal here is to make the models ready for collider phenomenology .	We do this by constructing the low energy effective theory containing scalars , pseudoscalars , vector mesons and other fields predicted by the minimal walking theory .	We construct their self-interactions and interactions with standard model fields .	Using the Weinberg sum rules , opportunely modified to take into account the walking behavior of the underlying gauge theory , we find interesting relations for the spin-one spectrum .
1	We look at the relative stabilities of the G , C and A type antiferromagnetic ph ases .	We study the anisotropic magnetic structures exhibited by electron-doped manganites using a model which incorporates the double-exchange between orbital ly degenerate $ e_ { g } $ electrons and the super-exchange between $ t_ { 2g } $ electrons with realistic values of the Hund 's coupling ( $ J_H $ ) , the super-exchange coupling ( $ J_ { AF } $ ) , and the bandwidth ( $ W $ ) .	In particular we find that the G-phase is stable for low electron doping as seen in experiments .	We find good agreement with the experimentally observed magnetic phase diagrams of electron-doped manganites ( $ x & gt ; 0.5 $ ) such as Nd $ _ { 1-x } $ Sr $ _ { x } $ MnO $ _ { 3 } $ , Pr $ _ { 1-x } $ Sr $ _ { x } $ MnO $ _ { 3 } $ , and Sm $ _ { 1-x } $ Ca $ _ { x } $ MnO $ _ { 3 } $ .	We can also explain the experimentally observed orbital structures of the C a nd A phases .
2	We show that in contrast to known asymptotic bounds , as long as the number of prediction/optimization iterations is sub exponential , the logistic loss provides no improvement over a generic non-smooth loss function such as the hinge loss .	The logistic loss function is often advocated in machine learning and statistics as a smooth and strictly convex surrogate for the 0-1 loss .	In this paper we investigate the question of whether these smoothness and convexity properties make the logistic loss preferable to other widely considered options such as the hinge loss .	In particular we show that the convergence rate of stochastic logistic optimization is bounded from below by a polynomial in the diameter of the decision set and the number of prediction iterations , and provide a matching tight upper bound .	This resolves the COLT open problem of McMahan and Streeter ( 2012 ) .
2	First , it is mathematically proven , that these discrete chaotic iterations can be considered as a \linebreak particular case of topological chaos .	This paper presents a new procedure of generating hash functions which can be evaluated using some mathematical tools .	This procedure is based on discrete chaotic iterations .	Then , the process of generating hash function based on the \linebreak topological chaos is detailed .	Finally it is shown how some tools coming from the domain of \linebreak topological chaos can be used to measure quantitatively and qualitatively some desirable properties for hash functions .
0	The bondage number $ b ( G ) $ of a graph $ G $ is the smallest number of edges whose removal from $ G $ results in a graph with larger domination number .	An orientable surface $ \mathbb { S } _h $ of genus $ h $ , $ h \geq 0 $ , is obtained from the sphere $ \mathbb { S } _0 $ by adding $ h $ handles .	A non-orientable surface $ \mathbb { N } _q $ of genus $ q $ , $ q \geq 1 $ , is obtained from the sphere by adding $ q $ crosscaps .	The Euler characteristic of a surface is defined by $ \chi ( \mathbb { S } _h ) = 2 - 2h $ and $ \chi ( \mathbb { S } _q ) = 2-q $ .	Let $ G $ be a connected graph of order $ n $ which is 2-cell embedded on a surface $ \mathbb { M } $ with $ \chi ( \mathbb { M } ) = \chi $ .
3	We confirm the recent result of Chernyshev and Zhitomirsky ( Phys.Rev.Lett .	We use the coupled cluster method to high orders of approximation in order to calculate the ground-state phase diagram of the XXZ spin- $ s $ kagome antiferromagnet with easy-plane anisotropy , i.e.the anisotropy parameter $ \Delta $ varies between $ \Delta=1 $ ( isotropic Heisenberg model ) and $ \Delta=0 $ ( $ XY $ model ) .	We find that for the extreme quantum case $ s=1/2 $ the ground state is magnetically disordered in the entire region $ 0 \le \Delta \le 1 $ .	For $ s=1 $ the ground state is disordered for $ 0.818 & lt ; \Delta \le 1 $ , it exhibits $ \sqrt { 3 } \times\sqrt { 3 } $ magnetic long-range order for $ 0.281 & lt ; \Delta & lt ; 0.818 $ , and $ q=0 $ magnetic long-range order for $ 0 \le \Delta & lt ; 0.281 $ .	113 , 237202 ( 2014 ) ) that the selection of the ground state by quantum fluctuations is different for small $ \Delta $ ( $ XY $ limit ) and for $ \Delta $ close to one ( Heisenberg limit ) , i.e. , $ q=0 $ magnetic order is favored over $ \sqrt { 3 } \times\sqrt { 3 } $ for $ 0\le \Delta & lt ; \Delta_c $ and vice versa for $ \Delta_c & lt ; \Delta \le 1 $ .
4	The away-side angular correlation functions are asymmetric with respect to the back-to-back direction in some regions of $ \phi_ { s } $ , which could provide insight on testing $ v_ { 1 } $ method to reconstruct the reaction plane .	Dihadron azimuthal angle correlations relative to the reaction plane have been investigated in Au + Au collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } $ = 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model ( AMPT ) .	Such reaction plane azimuthal angle dependent correlations can shed light on path-length effect of energy loss of high transverse momentum particles propagating through the hot dense medium .	The correlations vary with the trigger particle azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane direction , $ \phi_ { s } =\phi_ { T } -\Psi_ { EP } $ , which is consistent with the experimental observation by the STAR collaboration .	The dihadron azimuthal angle correlation functions on the away side of the trigger particle present a distinct evolution from a single peak to a broad , possibly double peak , structure when the trigger particle direction goes from in-plane to out-of-plane of the reaction plane .
1	The offset event , conventionally interpreted as a signature of piezomagnetic effects , however could not be ascribed as such .	Two types of coseismic magnetic field events are simultaneously observed : transient offset events and magnetic field signal that occurred at the destructive , Mw6.1 LAquila earthquake ( EQ ) mainshock .	The reason is that the presently known geology of the LAquila basin consists mainly of carbonates , dolomites and limestone , thus it does not suggest an appearance of piezomagnetic related effects under EQ fracture/slip events .	The second type of coseismic event , the transient magnetic signal starts simultaneously with the offset event and reaches amplitude of 0.8 nT in the total magnetic field .	The signal is local one , in the sense that its form differs from the signals of ionospheric/magnetospheric origin confirmed ( indirectly ) by additional magnetic field data in Italy and Central Europe .
3	We particularly stress the conditions that must be fulfilled for successful driving .	Rapidly oscillating Ap stars consitute a unique class of pulsators to study nonradial oscillations under some - even for stars - unusual physical conditions .	These stars are chemically peculiar , they have strong magnetic fields , and they often pulsate in several high-order acoustic modes simultaneously .	We discuss here an excitation mechanism for short-period oscillation modes based on the classical kappa mechanism .	Specifically , we discuss the roles of chemical peculiarity and strong magnetic field on the oscillation modes and what separates these pulsators from delta Scuti and Am-type stars .
4	In our simulations , we find gamma = 1.4 - 0.08Log ( M/M_* ) for haloes of 0.01M_* to 1000M_* , with a large scatter of gamma ~ +/-0.3 $ ; and c_gamma = 8*M/M_*^ { -0.15 } , with a large M/M_* dependent scatter roughly equal to +/- c_gamma .	We use numerical simulations in a Lambda CDM cosmology to model density profiles in a set of 16 dark matter haloes with resolutions of up to 7 million particles within the virial radius .	These simulations allow us to follow robustly the formation and evolution of the central cusp over a large mass range of 10^11 to 10^14 M_sun , down to approximately 0.5 % of the virial radius , and from redshift 5 to the present .	The cusp of the density profile is set at redshifts of 2 or greater and remains remarkably stable to the present time , when considered in non-comoving coordinates .	We fit our haloes to a 2 parameter profile where the steepness of the asymptotic cusp is given by gamma , and its radial extent is described by the concentration , c_gamma .
3	The spectral energy distribution of the ionizing radiation is taken from appropriate model atmospheres .	The planetary nebula TS 01 ( also called PN G 135.9+55.9 or SBS 1150+599A ) , with its record-holding low oxygen abundance and its double degenerate close binary core ( period 3.9 h ) , is an exceptional object located in the Galactic halo .	We have secured observational data in a complete wavelength range in order to pin down the abundances of half a dozen elements in the nebula .	The abundances are obtained via detailed photoionization modelling taking into account all the observational constraints ( including geometry and aperture effects ) using the pseudo-3D photoionization code Cloudy_3D .	Both stellar components contribute to the ionization : the `` cool '' one provides the bulk of hydrogen ionization , and the `` hot '' one is responsible for the presence of the most highly charged ions , which explains why previous attempts to model the nebula experienced difficulties .
4	In this paper we propose a conjecture involving signed graphs which contains all of these results .	An even-cycle decomposition of a graph $ G $ is a partition of $ E ( G ) $ into cycles of even length .	Evidently , every Eulerian bipartite graph has an even-cycle decomposition .	Seymour ( 1981 ) proved that every $ 2 $ -connected loopless Eulerian planar graph with an even number of edges also admits an even-cycle decomposition .	Later , Zhang ( 1994 ) generalized this to graphs with no $ K_5 $ -minor .
0	Presented in this paper is a derivation of a 2D catalytic reaction-based model to solve combinatorial optimization problems ( COPs ) .	The simulated catalytic reactions , a computational metaphor , occurs in an artificial chemical reactor that finds near-optimal solutions to COPs .	The artificial environment is governed by catalytic reactions that can alter the structure of artificial molecular elements .	Altering the molecular structure means finding new solutions to the COP .	The molecular mass of the elements was considered as a measure of goodness of fit of the solutions .
4	The application of the suggested technique to realistic experimental conditions is analyzed and it is shown that the considered effect can be realized for experimentally available condensates .	A technique is proposed for creating nonground-state Bose-Einstein condensates in a trapping potential by means of the temporal modulation of atomic interactions .	Applying a time-dependent spatially homogeneous magnetic field modifies the atomic scattering length .	An alternating modulation of the scattering length excites the condensate , which , under special conditions , can be transferred to an excited nonlinear coherent mode .	It is shown that there occurs a phase-transition-like behavior in the time-averaged population imbalance between the ground and excited states .
0	We analyze the parametric space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with mu & gt ; 0 supplemented by a generalized asymptotic Yukawa coupling quasi-unification condition which yields acceptable masses for the fermions of the third family .	We impose constraints from the cold dark matter abundance in the universe and its direct detection experiments , the B-physics , as well as the masses of the sparticles and the lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson .	Fixing the mass of the latter to its central value from the LHC and taking 40 & lt ; =tanbeta & lt ; =50 , we find a relatively wide allowed parameter space with -11 & lt ; =A_0/M_ { 1/2 } & lt ; =15 and mass of the lightest sparticle in the range ( 0.09-1.1 ) TeV .	This sparticle is possibly detectable by the present cold dark matter direct search experiments .	The required fine-tuning for the electroweak symmetry breaking is much milder than the one needed in the neutralino-stau coannihilation region of the same model .
1	The Cyborg Astrobiologist platform has thus far been used for testing and development of these algorithms and systems : robotic acquisition of quasi-mosaics of images , real-time image segmentation , and real-time determination of interesting points in the image mosaics .	We present results from the first geological field tests of the `Cyborg Astrobiologist ' , which is a wearable computer and video camcorder system that we are using to test and train a computer-vision system towards having some of the autonomous decision-making capabilities of a field-geologist .	This work is more of a test of the whole system , rather than of any one part of the system .	However , beyond the concept of the system itself , the uncommon map ( despite its simplicity ) is the main innovative part of the system .	The uncommon map helps to determine interest-points in a context-free manner .
2	No emission is detected from the substellar companion , GQ Lup B , $ 0\farcs7 $ away .	We present Submillimeter Array observations of the GQ Lup system at 1.3 millimeters wavelength with $ 0\farcs4 $ ( $ \sim $ 60 AU ) resolution .	Emission is detected from the position of the primary star , GQ Lup A , and is marginally resolved .	These data , together with models of the spectral energy distribution , suggest a compact disk around GQ Lup A with mass $ \sim 3 $ M $ _ { Jup } $ , perhaps truncated by tidal forces .	There is no evidence for a gap or hole in the disk that might be the signature of an additional inner companion body capable of scattering GQ Lup B out to $ \sim100 $ AU separation from GQ Lup A .
1	We give a mathematical construction for optimal predictors of such processes , in the form of hidden Markov models .	We present a new method for nonlinear prediction of discrete random sequences under minimal structural assumptions .	We then describe an algorithm , CSSR ( Causal-State Splitting Reconstruction ) , which approximates the ideal predictor from data .	We discuss the reliability of CSSR , its data requirements , and its performance in simulations .	Finally , we compare our approach to existing methods using variablelength Markov models and cross-validated hidden Markov models , and show theoretically and experimentally that our method delivers results superior to the former and at least comparable to the latter .
3	However , in this MOF cooperative interactions between the antiferro-distortive distortions of the framework and the C ( NH2 ) $ _ { 3 } $ organic cation via hydrogen bonding breaks the inversion symmetry and induces a ferroelectric polarization . [ Angew.Chem.Int.Ed .	There is great interest in hybrid organic-inorganic materials such as metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs ) .	The compounds [ C ( NH $ _ { 2 } $ ) $ _ { 3 } $ ] M ( HCOO ) $ _ { 3 } $ , where M=Cu $ ^ { 2+ } $ or Cr $ ^ { 2+ } $ are Jahn-Teller ( JT ) active ions , are MOF with perovskite topology which crystallizes in polar space group Pna2 $ _ { 1 } $ .	In inorganic compounds , octahedral tilting and Jahn-Teller structural distortions are usually non-polar distortions .	50 , 5847 , 2011 ] Our ab-initio study supports the picture of an orbital-order-induced ferroelectricity , a rare example of dipolar ordering caused by electronic degrees of freedom .
1	We use dimensional regularization with adiabatic subtraction and introduce a novel analytic approximation for the inflaton fluctuations which is valid during the slow-rollover regime .	We study the renormalized energy-momentum tensor ( EMT ) of the inflaton fluctuations in rigid space-times during the slow-rollover regime for chaotic inflation with a mass term .	Using this approximation we find a scale invariant spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations in a rigid space-time , and we confirm this result by numerical methods .	The resulting renormalized EMT is covariantly conserved and agrees with the Allen-Folacci result in the de Sitter limit , when the expansion is exactly linearly exponential in time .	We analytically show that the EMT tensor of the inflaton fluctuations grows initially in time , but saturates to the value H^2 H ( 0 ) ^2 , where H is the Hubble parameter and H ( 0 ) is its value when inflation has started .
2	This leads to a natural suppression of these masses relative to the $ Q=2/3 $ quarks , as well as the generation of quark mixing angles , both long-standing challenges for ETC theories .	We study fermion masses and mixing angles , including the generation of a seesaw mechanism for the neutrinos , in extended technicolor ( ETC ) theories .	We formulate an approach to these problems that relies on assigning right-handed $ Q=-1/3 $ quarks and charged leptons to ETC representations that are conjugates of those of the corresponding left-handed fermions .	Standard-model-singlet neutrinos are assigned to ETC representations that provide a similar suppression of neutrino Dirac masses , as well as the possibility of a realistic seesaw mechanism with no mass scale above the highest ETC scale of roughly $ 10^3 $ TeV .	A simple model based on the ETC group SU ( 5 ) is constructed and analyzed .
3	The conformal anomaly and induced effective action for 2d and 4d dilaton coupled theories are found .	We review ( mainly ) quantum effects in the theories where gravity sector is described by metric and dilaton .	The one-loop effective action for dilatonic gravity in two and four dimensions is evaluated .	Renormalization group equations are constructed .	It is applied to study of quantum aspects of black hole thermodynamics , like calculation of Hawking radiation and quantum corrections to black hole parameters and investigation of quantum instability for such objects with multiple horizons .
2	For hadronic showers of energy greater than 100 GeV , the timing resolution is measured to be about 1.2 ns .	This paper discusses the design and performance of the time measurement technique and of the synchronization systems of the CMS hadron calorimeter .	Time measurement performance results are presented from test beam data taken in the years 2004 and 2006 .	Time synchronization and out-of-time background rejection results are presented from the Cosmic Run At Four Tesla and LHC beam runs taken in the Autumn of 2008 .	The inter-channel synchronization is measured to be within 2 ns .
2	The sub-dominant mode is anisotropic throughout , but in a scale-independent way ( at higher frequencies ) .	We present the first measurement of the scale-dependent power anisotropy of Elsasser variables in imbalanced fast solar wind turbulence .	The dominant Elsasser mode is isotropic at lower spacecraft frequencies but becomes increasingly anisotropic at higher frequencies .	There are two distinct subranges exhibiting different scalings within what is normally considered the inertial range .	The low Alfven ratio and shallow scaling of the sub-dominant Elsasser mode suggest an interpretation of the observed discrepancy between the velocity and magnetic field scalings .
2	The structure of the graph of $ c ( a ) $ is surprisingly rich .	This paper calculates the function $ c ( a ) $ whose value at $ a $ is the infimum of the size of a ball that contains a symplectic image of the ellipsoid $ E ( 1 , a ) $ .	( Here $ a \ge 1 $ is the ratio of the area of the large axis to that of the smaller axis . )	The volume constraint implies that $ c ( a ) $ is always greater than or equal to the square root of $ a $ , and it is not hard to see that this is equality for large $ a $ .	However , for $ a $ less than the fourth power $ \tau^4 $ of the golden ratio , $ c ( a ) $ is piecewise linear , with graph that alternately lies on a line through the origin and is horizontal .
0	Magnetic small-angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) is a powerful tool for investigating nonuniform magnetization structures inside magnetic materials .	Here , considering a ferromagnetic medium with weakly inhomogeneous uniaxial magnetic anisotropy , saturation magnetization , and exchange stiffness , we derive the second-order ( in the amplitude of the inhomogeneities ) micromagnetic solutions for the equilibrium magnetization textures and compute the corresponding magnetic SANS cross sections up to the next , third order .	We find that in the case of perpendicular scattering ( the incident neutron beam is perpendicular to the applied magnetic field ) if twice the cross section along the direction orthogonal to both the field and the neutron beam is subtracted from the cross section along the field direction , the result has only a third-order contribution ( the lower-order terms are canceled ) .	This difference does not depend on the amplitude of the exchange inhomogeneities and provides a separate gateway for a deeper analysis of the sample 's magnetic structure .	We derive and analyze analytical expressions for the dependence of this combination on the scattering-vector magnitude for the case of spherical Gaussian inhomogeneities .
4	The model can also be used to calculate the flux-weighted radial velocity of the stars during an eclipse ( Rossiter-McLaughlin effect ) .	Very high quality light curves are now available for thousands of detached eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanet systems as a result of surveys for transiting exoplanets and other large-scale photometric surveys .	I have developed a binary star model ( ELLC ) that can be used to analyse the light curves of detached eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanet systems that is fast and accurate , and that can include the effects of star spots , Doppler boosting and light-travel time within binaries with eccentric orbits .	The model represents the stars as triaxial ellipsoids .	The apparent flux from the binary is calculated using Gauss-Legendre integration over the ellipses that are the projection of these ellipsoids on the sky .
4	The SCLC behavior and slow time response indicate that the charge transport is dominated by tunneling at the percolating inter-nanowire junctions .	We present electronic transport characteristics of ternary alloy Cd1-xZnxS nanowire networks in the dark and under white light illumination .	Compared to the negligible dark current , we observed a photocurrent enhancement up to 4 orders of magnitude at intensity of 460 mW/cm2 .	The time constant of the dynamic photoresponse is ~5 sec .	The current-voltage characteristics at different intensities show Ohmic behavior at low bias and space charge limited conduction ( SCLC ) at higher bias voltages .
2	The time delay extraction is constructed by incorporating a linearly varying phase factor to the system of equations that determines Fourier coefficients .	We present a new method for time delay estimation using band limited frequency domain data representing the port responses of interconnect structures .	The approach is based on the recently developed by the authors spectrally accurate method for causality characterization that employs SVD-based causal Fourier continuations .	The method is capable of determining time delay using data affected by noise or approximation errors that come from measurements or numerical simulations .	It can also be employed when only a limited number of frequency responses is available .
0	We use numerical N-body simulations of the Orion Nebula Cluster ( ONC ) to investigate the destruction of protoplanetary disks by close stellar encounters and UV radiation from massive stars .	The simulations model a cluster of 4000 stars , and we consider separately cases in which the disks have fixed radii of 100 AU and 10 AU .	In the former case , depending on a star 's position and orbit in the cluster over 10^7 years , UV photoevaporation removes at least 0.01 Msol from its disk , and can remove up to 1 Msol .	We find no dynamical models of the ONC consistent with the suggestion of Storzer and Hollenbach that the observed distribution and abundance of proplyds could be explained by a population of stars on radial orbits which spend relatively little time near Theta 1C Ori ( the most massive star in the ONC ) .	Instead the observations require either massive disks ( e.g.a typical initial disk mass of 0.4 Msol ) or a very recent birth for Theta 1C Ori .
2	In this article , we develop an alternate way to formalize knowledge about the state of quantum systems , based solely on experimentally accessible elements , namely on outcomes of finite measurements .	One of the most central and controversial element of quantum mechanics is the use of non zero vectors of a Hilbert space ( or , more generally , of one dimension subspaces ) for representing the state of a quantum system .	In particular , the question whether such a representation is complete has been debated since almost the early days of quantum mechanics .	We introduce what we call partial description which , given a feasible measurement , indicates some outcomes which are known to be impossible ( i.e.known to have a probability equal to 0 to occur ) and hence have to be discarded .	Then , we introduce partial states ( which are partial descriptions providing as much information as possible ) and compare this way to describe quantum states to the orthodox one , using vector rays .
1	In-chain and off-chain substitutions quench the spin-Peierls state and induce 3D antiferromagnetic order at T\leq 5 K. Consequently a suppression of a 1D gap-induced mode as well as a constant intensity of a spinon continuum are observed at low temperatures .	The effect of in-chain and off-chain substitutions on 1D spin fluctuations in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO_3 has been studied using Raman scattering in order to understand the interplay between defect induced states , enhanced spin-spin correlations and the ground state of low dimensional systems .	A 3D two-magnon density of states now gradually extends to higher temperatures T\leq 60K compared with pure CuGeO_3 .	This effect is more pronounced in the case of off-chain substitutions ( Si ) for which a N\'eel state occurs over a larger substitution range , starting at very low concentrations .	Besides , additional low energy excitations are induced .
3	In addition , we show that the uniform lower Ricci curvature bounds in these theorems can be replaced by the existence of a uniform linear contractibility function .	We prove that if a family of metrics , $ g_i $ , on a compact Riemannian manifold , $ M^n $ , have a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound and converge to $ g_\infty $ smoothly away from a singular set , $ S $ , with Hausdorff measure , $ H^ { n-1 } ( S ) = 0 $ , and if there exists connected precompact exhaustion , $ W_j $ , of $ M^n \setminus S $ satisfying $ \diam_ { g_i } ( M^n ) \le D_0 $ , $ \vol_ { g_i } ( \partial W_j ) \le A_0 $ and $ \vol_ { g_i } ( M^n \setminus W_j ) \le V_j where \lim_ { j\to\infty } V_j=0 $ then the Gromov-Hausdorff limit exists and agrees with the metric completion of $ ( M^n \setminus S , g_\infty ) $ .	Recall that in the prior work with Sormani the same conclusion is reached but the singular set is assumed to be a submanifold of codimension two .	We have a second main theorem in which the Hausdorff measure condition on $ S $ is replaced by diameter estimates on the connected components of the boundary of the exhaustion , $ \partial W_j $ .	If this condition is removed altogether , then we prove that $ \lim_ { j\to \infty } d_ { \mathcal { F } } ( M_j ' , N ' ) =0 $ , in which $ M_j ' $ and $ N ' $ are the settled completions of $ ( M , g_j ) $ and $ ( M_\infty\setminus S , g_\infty ) $ respectively and $ d_ { \mathcal { F } } $ is the Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat distance .
0	Triggered by the study of Carquillat & amp ; Prieur ( 2007 , MNRAS , 380 , 1064 ) of Am binaries , I reanalyse their sample of 60 orbits to derive the mass ratio distribution ( MRD ) , assuming as they did a priori functional forms , i.e.a power law or a Gaussian .	The sample is then extended using orbits published by several groups and a full analysis of the MRD is made , without any assumption on the functional form .	I derive the MRD using a Richardson-Lucy inversion method , assuming a fixed mass of the Am primary and randomly distributed orbital inclinations .	Using the large sub-sample of double-lined spectroscopic binaries , I show that this methodology is indeed perfectly adequate .	Using the inversion method , applied to my extended sample of 162 systems , I find that the final MRD can be approximated by a uniform distribution .
0	An orthogonal complex structure on a domain in R^4 is a complex structure which is integrable and is compatible with the Euclidean metric .	This gives rise to a first order system of partial differential equations which is conformally invariant .	We prove two Liouville-type uniqueness theorems for solutions of this system , and use these to give an alternative proof of the classification of compact locally conformally flat Hermitian surfaces first proved by Pontecorvo .	We also give a classification of non-degenerate quadrics in CP^3 under the action of the conformal group .	Using this classification , we show that generic quadrics give rise to orthogonal complex structures defined on the complement of unknotted solid tori which are smoothly embedded in R^4 .
0	We investigate self-interacting scalar , pseudoscalar and vector meson fields and their influence on NN interactions .	Due to the self -- interaction one has to solve nonlinear field equations which allow solitary wave solutions .	A propability amplitude for the propagation of these solutions is calculated which can be applied in a One-Boson-Exchange Potential ( OBEP ) .	Using proper normalization as an alternative to the usual renormalization scheme one obtains amplitudes with the same momentum dependence as the conventional Feynman-propagators multiplied with the form factors of the Bonn-B OBEP .	From this the usage of form factors might be replaced by the application of solitary wave exchange .
1	As the typical energy for quantum gravity is the Planck mass , $ M_ { pl } $ , LIV will , most likely , be manifested at very high energies that are not accessible on Earth in the foreseeable future .	Lorentz Invariance Violation ( LIV ) arises in various quantum-gravity theories .	One has to turn to astronomical observations .	Time of flight measurement from different astronomical sources set current limits on the energy scale of possible LIV to $ & gt ; 0.01 M_ { pl } $ ( for n=1 models ) and $ & gt ; 10^ { -9 } M_ { pl } $ ( for n=2 ) .	According to current models Gamma-Ray Bursts ( GRBs ) are accompanied by bursts of high energy ( $ \gsim 100 $ TeV ) neutrinos .
2	The main message of these papers is that , given a family of predictors , we are able to build a new predictor that predicts the series as well as the best predictor in the family , up to a remainder of order $ 1/\sqrt { n } $ .	In this paper we tackle the problem of fast rates in time series forecasting from a statistical learning perspective .	In a serie of papers ( e.g.Meir 2000 , Modha and Masry 1998 , Alquier and Wintenberger 2012 ) it is shown that the main tools used in learning theory with iid observations can be extended to the prediction of time series .	It is known that this rate can not be improved in general .	In this paper , we show that in the particular case of the least square loss , and under a strong assumption on the time series ( phi-mixing ) the remainder is actually of order $ 1/n $ .
3	Further , I will analytically treat the case of gaussian \onefas noise , with explicit high and low frequency cutoffs , and derive the scaling of the correlation integral $ C ( N , r ) $ in various regimes of the $ ( N , r ) $ plane .	It has recently been observed that a stochastic ( infinite degree of freedom ) time series with a $ 1/f^\alpha $ power spectrum can exhibit a finite correlation dimension , even for arbitrarily large data sets . [ A.R .	Osborne and A.~Provenzale , { \sl Physica D } { \bf 35 } , 357 ( 1989 ) . ]	I will discuss the relevance of this observation to the practical estimation of dimension from a time series , and in particular I will argue that a good dimension algorithm need not be trapped by this anomalous fractal scaling .

2	We find that at a high density the energy of the ferromagnetic order is lower than that of the ordinary neutron matter , and the reduction effect is enhanced by the anomaly .	We study ferromagnetism at high density of neutrons in the QCD hadron phase , by using the simplest chiral effective model incorporating magnetic fields and the chiral anomaly .	Under the assumption of spatial homogeneity , we calculate the energy density as a function of neutron density , with a magnetization and a neutral pion condensation a la Dautry and Neyman .	Compared to the inhomogeneous phase with the alternating layer structure , our ferromagnetic phase turns out to be unfavored .	However , once an axial vector meson condensation is taken into account in our simplest model , the ferromagnetic energy density is lowered significantly , which still leaves some room for a possible realization of a QCD ferromagnetic phase and ferromagnetic magnetars .
0	We study symmetric teleparallel ( STP ) gravity model , in which only spacetime non-metricity is nonzero .	First we obtain STP equivalent Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian and give an approach for a generic solution in terms of only metric tensor .	Then we obtain a spherically symmetric static solution to the Einstein 's equation in STP space-time and discuss the singularities .	Finally , we study a model given by a Lagrangian 4-form quadratic in non-metricity .	Thus , we seek Schwarzschild-type solutions because of its observational success and obtain some sets of solutions .
3	This ratio depends on the neutrino energy , density profile of the sources and on the oscillation parameters .	High-energy neutrinos are expected to be produced in a vareity of astrophysical sources as well as in optically thick hidden sources .	We explore the matter-induced oscillation effects on emitted neutrino fluxes of three different flavors from the latter class .	We use the ratio of electron and tau induced showers to muon tracks , in upcoming neutrino telescopes , as the principal observable in our analysis .	The largely unknown flux normalization drops out of our calculation and only affects the statistics .
3	Our result relies on the fact that the Lee-Yang zeros of the generating function for $ \ { E ( k ; J ) \ } $ -- - the probabilities of there being exactly $ k $ points in $ J $ -- - all lie on the negative real $ z $ -axis .	We prove a local central limit theorem ( LCLT ) for the number of points $ N ( J ) $ in a region $ J $ in $ \mathbb R^d $ specified by a determinantal point process with an Hermitian kernel .	The only assumption is that the variance of $ N ( J ) $ tends to infinity as $ |J| \to \infty $ .	This extends a previous result giving a weaker central limit theorem ( CLT ) for these systems .	In particular , the result applies to the scaled bulk eigenvalue distribution for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble ( GUE ) and that of the Ginibre ensemble .
0	We study the role of QCD plasma instabilities in non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasmas .	First , we argue that such instabilities must drastically modify the `` bottom-up '' thermalization scenario for heavy-ion collisions .	Second , we discuss conditions for the existence of instabilities in a more general context than previously treated in the QCD literature .	We also give a thorough qualitative review of the origin of instabilities .	We discuss some mechanisms whereby the growth of plasma instabilities saturates .
0	Fermion mixing is generally believed to be a low-energy manifestation of an underlying theory whose energy scale is much larger than the electroweak scale .	In this paper we investigate the possibility that the parameters describing lepton mixing actually arise from the low-energy behavior of the neutrino interacting fields .	In particular , we conjecture that the measured value of the mixing angles for a given process depends on the number of unobservable flavor states at the energy of the process .	We provide a covariant implementation of such conjecture , draw its consequences in a two neutrino family approximation and compare these findings with current experimental data .	Finally we show that this infrared origin of mixing will be manifest at the Ice Cube DeepCore array , which measures atmospheric oscillations at energies much larger than the tau lepton mass ; it will hence be experimentally tested in a short time scale .
1	The aim is to identify the conditions for the locally and temporally controlled spin switching .	We study a chain of non-linear , interacting spins driven by a static and a time-dependent magnetic field .	Analytical and full numerical calculations show the possibility of stochastic control if the underlying semi-classical dynamics is chaotic .	This is achievable by tuning the external field parameters according to the method described in this paper .	We show analytically for a finite spin chain that Arnold diffusion is the underlying mechanism for the present stochastic control .
4	The tack energy for the perpendicular alignment can be 50 % less than the isotropic case .	The mechanical properties of liquid crystal elastomers ( LCEs ) make them suitable candidates for pressure-sensitive adhesives ( PSAs ) .	Using the nematic dumbbell constitutive model , and the block model of PSAs , we study their tack energy and the debonding process as could be measured experimentally in the probe-tack test .	To investigate their performance as switchable PSAs we compare the tack energy for the director aligned parallel , and perpendicular to the substrate normal , and for the isotropic state .	We find that the tack energy is larger in the parallel alignment than the isotropic case by over a factor of two .
0	We describe the resulting phenomenology of string theory/supergravity models with strong moduli stabilization .	The KL model with F-term uplifting , is one such example .	Models of this type predict universal scalar masses equal to the gravitino mass .	In contrast , A-terms receive highly suppressed gravity mediated contributions .	Under certain conditions , the same conclusion is valid for gaugino masses , which like A-terms , are then determined by anomalies .
3	In both regions the CO clouds have different properties and may be of a distinct nature .	Stephan 's Quintet ( SQ ) is a Hickson Compact Group well known for its complex dynamical and star formation history and its rich intergalactic medium ( IGM ) .	In order to study the extent , origin and fate of the intergalactic molecular gas and its relation to the formation of stars outside galaxies and Tidal Dwarf Galaxies ( TDGs ) , we mapped with the IRAM 30m antenna carbon monoxide ( CO ) towards several regions of the IGM in SQ .	In two star forming regions ( SQ A and B ) , situated in very different environments , we detected unusually large amounts of molecular gas ( $ 3.1 \times 10^9 $ \msun and $ 7 \times 10^8 $ \msun , respectively ) , covering an extended area ( between 15 and 25 kpc ) .	The integrated CO line of SQ A is in particular much wider than in SQ B .
2	Natural selection results in organisms that are well adapted to their local environments , but it is not clear how local adaptation can produce a global trend .	The idea that there are any large-scale trends in the evolution of biological organisms is highly controversial .	It is commonly believed , for example , that there is a large-scale trend in evolution towards increasing complexity , but empirical and theoretical arguments undermine this belief .	In this paper , I present a simple computational model , in which local adaptation to a randomly changing environment results in a global trend towards increasing evolutionary versatility .	In this model , for evolutionary versatility to increase without bound , the environment must be highly dynamic .
1	Optimized geometries are found by using a mix of classical-quantum semiempirical computations .	We present some computational simulations of graphene-based nanoribbons with a number of half-twists varying from 0 to 4 and two types of defects obtained by removing a single carbon atom from two different sites .	According with the simulations results , the local curvature of the nanoribbons increases at the defect sites , specially for a higher number of half-twists .	The HOMO-LUMO energy gap of the nanostructures has significant variation when the number of half-twists increases for the defective nanoribbons .	At the quantum semiempirical level , the first optically active transitions and oscillator strengths are calculated using the full configuration interaction ( CI ) framework , and the optical absorption in the UV/Visible range ( electronic transitions ) and in the infrared ( vibrational transitions ) are achieved .
1	Incorporation of the brane inflation scenario and the noncommutative inflation scenario can nicely explain the large negative running of the spectral index as indicated by WMAP three-year data and can significantly release the fine-tuning for the parameter $ \beta $ .	In this paper , we investigate the noncommutative KKLMMT D3/anti-D3 brane inflation scenario in detail .	Using the WMAP three year results ( blue-tilted spectral index with large negative running ) , we explore the parameter space and give the constraints and predictions for the inflationary parameters and cosmological observables in this scenario .	We show that this scenario predicts a quite large tensor/scalar ratio and what is more , a too large cosmic string tension ( assuming that the string coupling $ g_s $ is in its likely range from 0.1 to 1 ) to be compatible with the present observational bound .	A more detailed analysis reveals that this model has some inconsistencies according to the fit to WMAP three year results .
3	We focus on the anomalously small ordered moments in the stripe state of the pnictides .	We study a two-orbital spin model to describe ( pi,0 ) stripe antiferromagnetism in the iron pnictides .	The `` double-spin '' model has an on-site Hunds 's coupling and inter-site interactions extending to second neighbors ( inter- and intra-orbital ) on the square lattice .	Using a variational method based on a cluster decomposition , we optimize wave functions with up to 8 cluster sites ( up to 2^16 variational parameters ) .	To account for it , and large variations among different compounds , we show that the second-neighbor cross-orbital exchange constant should be ferromagnetic , which leads to `` partially hidden '' stripe order , with a moment that can be varied over a large range by small changes in the coupling constants .
3	The quality of the approximation may be controlled to arbitrary precision through a parameter \epsilon & gt ; 0 .	We consider a method for approximate inference in hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) .	The method circumvents the need to evaluate conditional densities of observations given the hidden states .	It may be considered an instance of Approximate Bayesian Computation ( ABC ) and it involves the introduction of auxiliary variables valued in the same space as the observations .	We provide theoretical results which quantify , in terms of \epsilon , the ABC error in approximation of expectations of additive functionals with respect to the smoothing distributions .
0	$ \Lambda^+_c $ hypernuclei are expected to have binding energies and other properties similar to those of strange hypernuclei in view of the similarity between the quark structures of the strange and charmed hyperons , namely $ \Lambda ( uds ) $ and $ \Lambda^+_c ( udc ) $ .	One striking difference however occurs in their mesonic decays , as there is almost no Pauli blocking in the nucleonic decay of a charm hypernucleus because the final-state nucleons leave the nucleus at high energies .	The nuclear medium nevertheless affects the mesonic decays of charm hypernucleus because the nuclear mean fields modify the masses of the charm hyperon .	In the present communication we present results of a first investigation of the effects of finite baryon density on different weak mesonic decay channels of the $ \Lambda^+_c $ baryon .	We found a non-negligible reduction of the decay widths as compared to their vacuum values .
1	Rectangular layouts were originally used as floorplans in VLSI design to represent VLSI chip layouts .	A rectangular layout $ \mathcal { L } $ is a rectangle partitioned into disjoint smaller rectangles so that no four smaller rectangles meet at the same point .	More recently , they are used in graph drawing as rectangular cartograms .	In these applications , an area $ a ( r ) $ is assigned to each rectangle $ r $ , and the actual area of $ r $ in $ \mathcal { L } $ is required to be $ a ( r ) $ .	Moreover , some applications require that we use combinatorially equivalent rectangular layouts to represent multiple area assignment functions .
3	Gap width variations show the transition from a normal glow plasma to a pure sheath discharge .	Space resolved concentrations of helium He metastable atoms in an atmospheric pressure radio-frequency micro-plasma jet were measured using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy .	The spatial profile of metastable atoms in the volume between the electrodes was deduced for various electrode gap distances .	Density profiles reveal the sheath structure and reflect the plasma excitation distribution , as well as the dominance of the alpha-mode discharge .	In order to analyze and verify the experimentally observed profiles of the metastable atoms a 2-dimensional simulation model was set up .
2	One is the wedge pair consists of exterior spacetime of a black hole and the exterior spacetime of a white hole , and the other is that of exterior and interior spacetimes of one black hole .	The possibility of an alternative way to formulate the Hawking radiation in a static Schwarzschild spacetime has been explored .	To calculate the Hawking radiation , there can be two possible choices of the spacetime wedge pairs in the Krucal-Szekeres coordinates .	The radiation from the former is the Hawking 's original one .	Though the the latter has been often regarded as the same phenomena as the former , the result here suggests it is not ; its radiation has a temperature twice as high as the Hawking temperature .
4	Comparing disc structure between these S0s and the spirals from our previous studies , we find : i ) no evidence for the Type I scalelength being dependent on morphology ; and ii ) some evidence suggesting the Type II/III break strength is smaller ( weaker ) in S0s compared to spirals .	We present an analysis of V-band radial surface brightness { \mu } ( r ) profiles for S0s in different environments using HST/ACS imaging and data from the Space Telescope A901/2 Galaxy Evolution Survey ( STAGES ) .	Using a sample of ~280 field and cluster S0s , we find that in both environments , ~25 per cent have a pure exponential disc ( Type I ) and ~50 per cent exhibit an up-bending disc break ( antitruncation , Type III ) .	However , we find hardly any ( & lt ; 5 per cent ) down-bending disc breaks ( truncations , Type II ) in our S0s and many cases ( ~20 per cent ) where no exponential component was observed .	We also find no evidence for an environmental dependence on the disc scalelength or break strength ( outer-to-inner scalelength ratio ) , implying that the galaxy environment does not affect the stellar distribution in S0 stellar discs .
0	In 1988 , Brown and Ellis published [ 3 ] a generalised Hopf formula for the higher homology of a group .	Although substantially correct , their result lacks one necessary condition .	We give here a counterexample to the result without that condition .	The main aim of this paper is , however , to generalise this corrected result to derive formulae of Hopf type for the n-fold Cech derived functors of the lower central series functors Z_k .	The paper ends with an application to algebraic K-theory .
1	We pay special attention to the biconic localizations of the conic intrinsic volumes , the so-called support measures .	This paper is about conic intrinsic volumes and their associated integral geometry .	An analysis of these quantities has so far been confined to the PhD thesis of Stefan Glasauer ( 1995 ) .	We rederive the results from this thesis with novel streamlined proofs and expand them in several ways .	Additionally , we introduce a new class of functionals on polyhedral cones lying between the intrinsic volumes and the well-studied f-vector , which counts the equidimensional faces of a cone , and derive a characterization and kinematic formulas for these functionals as well .
4	Further , we provide the conditions under which the dynamics of the extents of reaction exhibit cooperative behavior .	Material balance equations describe the dynamics of the species in open reaction systems and contain information regarding reaction topology , kinetics and operation mode .	For reaction systems , the state variables ( the numbers of moles , or concentrations ) have recently been transformed into decoupled reaction variants ( extents of reaction ) , and reaction invariants ( extents of flow ) ( Amrhein et al. , AIChE Journal , 2010 ) .	This paper analyses the conditions under which an open homogeneous reaction system is cooperative in the extents domain .	Further , it is shown that the dynamics of the extents of flow exhibit cooperative behavior .
2	Contrarily , the photometric evolution resembles more that of a Type IIP SN with a large drop in luminosity at the end of the plateau phase .	We present an optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic study of supernova ( SN ) 2009kn spanning ~1.5 yr from the discovery .	The optical spectra are dominated by the narrow ( full width at half-maximum ~1000 km s^-1 ) Balmer lines distinctive of a Type IIn SN with P Cygni profiles .	These characteristics are similar to those of SN 1994W , whose nature has been explained with two different models with different approaches .	The well-sampled data set on SN 2009kn offers the possibility to test these models , in the case of both SN 2009kn and SN 1994W .
3	From the mock X-ray observations with Astro-E2 XRS , we find that turbulent motion of the ICM in cluster cores could be detected with the satellite .	This is the first attempt to construct detailed X-ray spectra of clusters of galaxies from the results of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations and simulate X-ray observations in order to study velocity fields of the intracluster medium ( ICM ) .	The hydrodynamic simulations are based on the recently proposed tsunami model , in which cluster cores are affected by bulk motions of the ICM and turbulence is produced .	We note that most other solutions of the cooling flow problem also involve the generation of turbulence in cluster cores .	The Doppler shifts of the metal lines could be used to discriminate among turbulence models .
2	We give a general mechanism due to which the violation of the fluctuation theorem can be significant , even for weak coupling .	Small systems in contact with a heat bath evolve by stochastic dynamics .	Here we show that , when one such small system is weakly coupled to another one , it is possible to infer the presence of such weak coupling by observing the violation of the steady state fluctuation theorem for the partial entropy production of the observed system .	We analytically demonstrate on a realistic model system that this mechanism can be realized by applying an external random force to the system .	In other words , we find a new fluctuation theorem for the entropy production of a partial system , in the limit of weak coupling .
2	As a measure of top polarization , we look at decay-lepton angular distributions in the laboratory frame , without requiring reconstruction of the rest frame of the top , and study the effect of the anomalous couplings on these distributions .	We study the sensitivity of the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) to top quark chromomagnetic ( CMDM ) and chromoelectric ( CEDM ) dipole moments and $ Wtb $ effective couplings in single-top production in association with a $ W^- $ boson , followed by semileptonic decay of the top .	We calculate the top polarization and the effects of these anomalous couplings on it at two centre-of-mass ( cm ) energies , 8 TeV and 14 TeV .	We construct certain asymmetries to study the sensitivity of these distributions to top-quark couplings .	The Wt single-top production mode helps to isolate the anomalous $ ttg $ and $ Wtb $ couplings , in contrast to top-pair production and other single-top production modes , where other new-physics effects can also contribute .
1	The scaling limit of the SAW has a natural parameterization and SLE has a standard parameterization using the half-plane capacity .	The scaling limit of the two-dimensional self-avoiding walk ( SAW ) is believed to be given by the Schramm-Loewner evolution ( SLE ) with the parameter kappa equal to 8/3 .	These two parameterizations do not correspond with one another .	To make the scaling limit of the SAW and SLE agree as parameterized curves , we must reparameterize one of them .	We present Monte Carlo results that show that if we reparameterize the SAW using the half-plane capacity , then it agrees well with SLE with its standard parameterization .
2	It is known that this fiber polytope has face lattice indexed by the coherent polytopal subdivisions of $ C ( n , d ) $ which are induced by the map $ \pi $ .	The cyclic polytope $ C ( n , d ) $ is the convex hull of any $ n $ points on the moment curve $ { ( t , t^2 , ... , t^d ) : t \in \reals } $ in $ \reals^d $ .	For $ d ' & gt ; d $ , we consider the fiber polytope ( in the sense of Billera and Sturmfels ) associated to the natural projection of cyclic polytopes $ \pi : C ( n , d ' ) \to C ( n , d ) $ which `` forgets '' the last $ d'-d $ coordinates .	Our main result characterizes the triples $ ( n , d , d ' ) $ for which the fiber polytope is canonical in either of the following two senses : - all polytopal subdivisions induced by $ \pi $ are coherent , - the structure of the fiber polytope does not depend upon the choice of points on the moment curve .	We also discuss a new instance with a positive answer to the Generalized Baues Problem , namely that of a projection $ \pi : P\to Q $ where $ Q $ has only regular subdivisions and $ P $ has two more vertices than its dimension .
4	We test our policy in the presence of decoherence-induced noise as well as show its robustness against random external noise generated by the control electronics .	Three-qubit quantum gates are crucial for quantum error correction and quantum information processing .	We generate policies for quantum control procedures to design three types of three-qubit gates , namely Toffoli , Controlled-Not-Not and Fredkin gates .	The design procedures are applicable to an architecture of nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting artificial atoms .	The resultant fidelity for each gate is above 99.9 % , which is an accepted threshold fidelity for fault-tolerant quantum computing .
3	The geometric mean of the widths of the corresponding exclusive and inclusive residual distributions for the probed detector is then taken as a measure of the intrinsic spatial resolution of the probed detector : $ \sigma=\sqrt { \sigma_ { ex } \cdot\sigma_ { in } } $ .	The geometric-mean method is often used to estimate the spatial resolution of a position-sensitive detector probed by tracks .	It calculates the resolution solely from measured track data without using a detailed tracking simulation and without considering multiple Coulomb scattering effects .	Two separate linear track fits are performed on the same data , one excluding and the other including the hit from the probed detector .	The validity of this method is examined for a range of resolutions with a stand-alone Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation that specifically takes multiple Coulomb scattering in the tracking detector materials into account .
2	In the present letter we extend these results to a system which is out of equilibrium and evolves to a stationary state according to a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation .	In a recent paper [ Phys.Lett .	A { \bf335 } , 351 ( 2005 ) ] the authors discussed the equivalence among the various probability distribution functions of a system in equilibrium in the Tsallis entropy framework .	By means of time-scale conversion , it is shown that there exists a `` correspondence '' among the self-similar solutions of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations associated with the different Tsallis formalisms .	The time-scale conversion is related to the corresponding Lyapunov functions of the respective nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations .
1	In this communication , we show that the resonances can be derived by shifted Gaussian functions , whereas the unspecific nuclear interaction compounds can be represented by an error function , which also provides the asymptotic behavior .	We have previously developed for nuclear cross-sections of therapeutic protons a calculation model , which is founded on the collective model as well as a quantum mechanical many particle problem to derive the S matrix and transition probabilities .	The energy shifts can be interpreted in terms of necessary domains of energy to excite typical nuclear processes .	Thus the necessary formulas referring to previous calculations of nuclear cross-sections will be represented in section 2 .	The mass number AN determines the strong interaction range .
0	The availability of data on digital traces is growing to unprecedented sizes , but inferring actionable knowledge from large-scale data is far from being trivial .	This is especially important for computational finance , where digital traces of human behavior offer a great potential to drive trading strategies .	We contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates various datasources in the design of algorithmic traders .	This allows us to derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading strategies .	We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin , a cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations .
3	Eventually , the Higgs potential is investigated in the approach of bilinear functions .	The next-to-minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model ( NMSSM ) is one of the most favored supersymmetric models .	After an introduction to the model , the Higgs sector and the neutralino sector are discussed in detail .	Theoretical , experimental , and cosmological constraints are studied .	Emphasis is placed on aspects which are different from the minimal supersymmetric extension .
2	We combine our data with the 2MASS and DENIS catalogs to provide , when available , U through K_S data for stars .	We present our catalog of U , B , V , and I stellar photometry of the central 18 sq .	degree area of the Small Magellanic Cloud .	Internal and external astrometric and photometric tests using existing optical photometry ( U , B , and V from Massey 's bright star catalog ; B , V , and I from the microlensing database of OGLE and I from the near-infrared sky survey DENIS ) are used to determine the observational uncertainties and identify systematic errors .	We fit stellar atmosphere models to the optical data to check the consistency of the photometry for individual stars across the passbands and to estimate the line-of-sight extinction .
2	At all settings the pulse energy within the soliton is around 800 pJ .	We present a passively mode-locked , tunable soliton Ho : fiber ring oscillator , optimized for seeding of Ho : YLF amplifiers .	The oscillator is independently tunable in central wavelength and spectral width from 2040 nm to 2070 nm and from 5 nm to 10 nm , respectively .	The soliton oscillator was optimized to fully meets the spectral requirements for seeding Ho : YLF amplifiers .	Its Kelly sidebands are located outside the amplifier gain spectrum , resulting in a train of about 1 ps long pedestal-free pulses with relative intensity noise ( RIN ) of only 0.13 % RMS when integrated from 1 Hz to Nyquist frequency .
1	The model has an explicit field theory realization as strongly coupled N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter at finite temperature and finite isospin chemical potential .	We give a detailed account and extensions of a holographic flavor superconductivity model which we have proposed recently .	Using gauge/gravity duality , i.e.a probe of two flavor D7-branes in the AdS black hole background , we show that the system undergoes a second order phase transition with critical exponent 1/2 .	The new ground state may be interpreted as a rho meson superfluid .	It shows signatures known from superconductivity , such as an infinite dc conductivity and a gap in the frequency-dependent conductivity .
4	They also yield exact second-order cone relaxation for robust quadratically constrained programs .	This paper studies robust solutions and semidefinite linear programming ( SDP ) relaxations of a class of convex polynomial programs in the face of data uncertainty .	The class of convex programs , called robust SOS-convex programs , includes robust quadratically constrained convex programs and robust separable convex polynomial programs .	It establishes sums of squares polynomial representations characterizing robust solutions and exact SDP-relaxations of robust SOS-convex programs under various commonly used uncertainty sets .	In particular , the results show that the polytopic and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets , that allow second-order cone re-formulations of robust quadratically constrained programs , continue to permit exact SDP-relaxations for a broad class of robust SOS-convex programs .
3	We investigate this representation within the framework of Denjoy-Carleman classes .	Let $ V $ be a real finite dimensional representation of a compact Lie group $ G $ .	It is well-known that the algebra $ \mathbb R [ V ] ^G $ of $ G $ -invariant polynomials on $ V $ is finitely generated , say by $ \sigma_1 , ... , \sigma_p $ .	Schwarz proved that each $ G $ -invariant $ C^\infty $ -function $ f $ on $ V $ has the form $ f=F ( \sigma_1 , ... , \sigma_p ) $ for a $ C^\infty $ -function $ F $ on $ \mathbb R^p $ .	One can in general not expect that $ f $ and $ F $ lie in the same Denjoy-Carleman class $ C_M $ ( with $ M= ( M_k ) $ ) .
0	We present Keck-Adaptive Optics and Hubble Space Telescope high resolution near-infrared ( IR ) imaging for 500 um-bright candidate lensing systems identified by the Herschel Multi-tiered Extra-galactic Survey ( HerMES ) and Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Survey ( H-ATLAS ) .	Out of 87 candidates with near-IR imaging , 15 ( ~17 % ) display clear near-IR lensing morphologies .	We present near-IR lens models to reconstruct and recover basic rest-frame optical morphological properties of the background galaxies from 12 new systems .	Sources with the largest near-IR magnification factors also tend to be the most compact , consistent with the size bias predicted from simulations and pre- vious lensing models for sub-millimeter galaxies .	For four new sources that also have high-resolution sub-mm maps , we test for differential lensing between the stellar and dust components and find that the 880 um magnification factor ( u_880 ) is ~1.5 times higher than the near-IR magnification factor ( u_NIR ) , on average .
2	We find the nuclear PNe population of M31 is only marginally consistent with the generally adopted form of the PNe luminosity function ( PNLF ) .	Following a first study of the central regions of M32 that illustrated the power of integral-field spectroscopy ( IFS ) in detecting and measuring the [ O III ] { \lambda } 5007 emission of PNe against a strong stellar background , we turn to the very nuclear PN population of M31 , within 80 pc of its centre .	We show that PNe can also be found in the presence of emission from diffuse gas and further illustrate the excellent sensitivity of IFS in detecting extragalactic PNe through a comparison with narrowband images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope .	In particular , this is due to a lack of PNe with absolute magnitude M5007 brighter than -3 , which would only result from a rather unfortunate draw from such a model PNLF .	We suggest that the observed lack of bright PNe in the nuclear regions of M31 is due to a horizontal-branch population that is more tilted toward less massive and hotter He-burning stars , so that its progeny consists mostly of UV-bright stars that fail to climb back up the asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) and only of few , if any , bright PNe powered by central post-AGB stars .
0	Braverman and Finkelberg recently proposed the geometric Satake correspondence for the affine Kac-Moody group $ G_\aff $ [ Braverman A. , Finkelberg M. , arXiv:0711.2083 ] .	They conjecture that intersection cohomology sheaves on the Uhlenbeck compactification of the framed moduli space of $ G_ { \mathrm { cpt } } $ -instantons on $ \R^4/\Z_r $ correspond to weight spaces of representations of the Langlands dual group $ G_\aff^\vee $ at level $ r $ .	When $ G = \SL ( l ) $ , the Uhlenbeck compactification is the quiver variety of type $ \algsl ( r ) _\aff $ , and their conjecture follows from the author 's earlier result and I. Frenkel 's level-rank duality .	They further introduce a convolution diagram which conjecturally gives the tensor product multiplicity [ Braverman A. , Finkelberg M. , Private communication , 2008 ] .	In this paper , we develop the theory for the branching in quiver varieties and check this conjecture for $ G=\SL ( l ) $ .
0	We present the results of high-resolution optical spectroscopy , low-resolution near-IR spectroscopy and near-infrared speckle interferometry of the massive young stellar object candidate V645 Cyg , acquired to refine its fundamental parameters and the properties of its circumstellar envelope .	Speckle interferometry in the $ H $ - and $ K $ -bands and an optical spectrum in the range 5200 -- 6680 \AA with a spectral resolving power of $ R $ = 60 000 were obtained at the 6-m telescope of the Russian Academy of Sciences .	Another optical spectrum in the range 4300 -- 10500 \AA with $ R $ = 79 000 was obtained at the 3.6-m CFHT .	Low-resolution spectra in the ranges 0.46 -- 1.4 $ \mu $ m and 1.4 -- 2.5 $ \mu $ m with $ R \sim $ 800 and $ \sim $ 700 , respectively , were obtained at the 3-m Shane telescope of the Lick Observatory .	Using a novel kinematical method based on the non-linear modeling of the neutral hydrogen density profile in the direction toward the object , we propose a distance of $ D = 4.2\pm $ 0.2 kpc .
0	The possibility to study the M/string theory cosmology via 5d bulk & amp ; brane action is investigated .	The role of the 4-form field in the theory of BPS branes in 5d is clarified .	We describe arguments suggesting that the effective 4d description of the universe in the ekpyrotic scenario ( hep-th/0103239 ) should lead to contraction rather than expansion of the universe .	To verify these arguments , we study the full 5d action prior to its integration over the 5th dimension .	We show that if one adds the potential V ( Y ) to the action of the bulk brane , then the metric ansatz used in the ekpyrotic scenario does not solve the dilaton and gravitational equations .
0	We investigate maximum efficiency at a given power for low-dissipation heat engines .	Close to maximum power , the maximum gain in efficiency scales as a square root of relative loss in power and this scaling is universal for broad class of systems .	For the low-dissipation engines , we calculate the maximum gain in efficiency for an arbitrary fixed power .	We show that the engines working close to maximum power can operate at considerably larger efficiency compared to the efficiency at maximum power .	Furthermore , we derive universal bounds on maximum efficiency at a given power for low-dissipation heat engines .
1	This allows us to study the reliability of our understanding of white dwarf cooling sequences , to confront different methods to determine its age , and to assess other important characteristics , like its star formation history .	47 Tucanae is one of the most interesting and well observed and theoretically studied globular clusters .	Here we present a population synthesis study of the cooling sequence of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae .	In particular , we study the distribution of effective temperatures , the shape of the color-magnitude diagram , and the corresponding magnitude and color distributions .	We do so using an up-to-date population synthesis code based on Monte Carlo techniques , that incorporates the most recent and reliable cooling sequences and an accurate modeling of the observational biases .
1	One of the most interesting is its relation to the coordinate on the quantum moduli space $ u= & lt ; \tr \phi^2 & gt ; $ that results into recursion equations for the coefficients of the prepotential due to instantons .	The prepotential in N=2 SUSY Yang-Mills theories enjoys remarkable properties .	In this work we show , with an explicit multi-instanton computation , that this relation holds true at arbitrary winding numbers .	Even more interestingly we show that its validity extends to the case in which gravitational corrections are taken into account if the correlators are suitably modified .	These results apply also to the cases in which matter in the fundamental and in the adjoint is included .
2	I then give motivations why spacetime can not be treated classically at the most fundamental level .	I give a review of the conceptual issues that arise in theories of quantum cosmology .	I start by emphasising some features of ordinary quantum theory that also play a crucial role in understanding quantum cosmology .	Two important issues in quantum cosmology -- the problem of time and the role of boundary conditions -- are discussed at some length .	Finally , I discuss how classical spacetime can be recovered as an approximate notion .
1	Let $ \mathfrak { M } ^ { s ( ss ) } _X ( r , d ) $ ( resp .	Let $ X $ be a smooth projective curve of genus $ g ( X ) \geq 1 $ over an algebraically closed field $ k $ of characteristic $ p & gt ; 0 $ and $ F_ { X/k } : X\rightarrow X^ { ( 1 ) } $ be the relative Frobenius morphism .	$ \mathfrak { M } ^ { s ( ss ) } _ { X^ { ( 1 ) } } ( r\cdot p , d+r ( p-1 ) ( g-1 ) ) $ ) be the moduli space of ( semi ) -stable vector bundles of rank $ r $ ( resp .	$ r\cdot p $ ) and degree $ d $ ( resp .	$ d+r ( p-1 ) ( g-1 ) $ ) on $ X $ ( resp. $ X^ { ( 1 ) } $ ) .
4	Finally , some specific applications to safety analysis in public buildings or public transport are presented .	This extensive review was written for the `` Encyclopedia of Complexity and System Science '' ( Springer , 2008 ) and addresses a broad audience ranging from engineers to applied mathematicians , computer scientists and physicists .	It provides an extensive overview of various aspects of pedestrian dynamics , focussing on evacuation processes .	First the current status of empirical results is critically reviewed as it forms the basis for the calibration of models needed for quantitative predictions .	Then various modeling approaches are discussed , focussing on cellular automata models .
4	Therefore , besides horizontal compatibilities ( between exercises ) vertical compatibilities are also presented ( with LOGOMON system ) .	In order to help children with dyslalia we created a set of software exercises .	This set has a unitary software block ( data base , programming language , programming philosophy ) .	In this paper we present this software infrastructure with its advantage and disadvantage .	The exercises are part of a software system named LOGOMON .
3	In this paper , we generalize the index notion for the nonlinear case .	The definition of index for differential algebraic equations ( DAEs ) or integral algebraic equations ( IAEs ) in the linear case ( time variable ) depends only on the coefficients of integrals or differential operators and the coefficients of the unknown functions .	Is this possible for the nonlinear case ?	In this paper we answer this question .	One of the difficulties for nonlinear case , is its dependence on the exact solution which motivates us to give an important warning to whom want to solve DAEs using numerical methods such as Runge-Kutta , multistep or collocation methods .
0	We have measured the flux dependence of both real and imaginary conductance of $ GaAs/GaAlAs $ isolated mesoscopic rings at 310 MHz .	The rings are coupled to a highly sensitive electromagnetic superconducting micro-resonator and lead to a perturbation of the resonance frequency and quality factor .	This experiment provides a new tool for the investigation of the conductance of mesoscopic systems without any connection to invasive probes .	It can be compared with recent theoretical predictions emphasizing the differences between isolated and connected geometries and the relation between ac conductance and persistent currents .	We observe $ \Phi_0/2 $ periodic oscillations on both components of the magnetoconductance .
1	We apply hybrid plasma simulations in a simplified two-dimensional geometry to demonstrate our method and its applicability to plasma turbulence in the ion kinetic regime .	We present a method for studying the evolution of plasma turbulence by tracking dispersion relations in the energy spectrum in the wavenumber-frequency domain .	We identify four dispersion relations : ion-Bernstein waves , oblique whistler waves , oblique Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron waves , and a zero-frequency mode .	The energy partition and frequency broadening are evaluated for these modes .	The method allows us to determine the evolution of decaying plasma turbulence in our restricted geometry and shows that it cascades along the dispersion relations during the early phase with an increasing broadening around the dispersion relations .
3	12 , used in this work as a comparison cluster .	We present the results of photometric measurements from images of the LMC cluster ESO 121-SC03 taken with HST/ACS .	Our resulting CMD reaches 3 magnitudes below the main-sequence turn-off , representing the deepest observation of this cluster to date .	We also present similar photometry from ACS imaging of the accreted Sagittarius dSph cluster Pal .	From analysis of its CMD , we obtain estimates for the metallicity and reddening of ESO 121-SC03 : [ Fe/H ] = -0.97 +/- 0.10 and E ( V-I ) = 0.04 +/- 0.02 , in excellent agreement with previous studies .
0	Following Dyson 's analogy between the quantum field theory and the 19th-century chemistry-both explain how but not why-one could also establish an analogy between atomic physics and string theory .	Atomic physics was needed to answer the question why in chemistry , string theory is trying to answer the question why in the standard model .	This attempt is very briefly reviewed in this talk .	After discussing the phenomenological aspects of string theory , the study of soft terms is emphasized as a possible connection between theory and experiment .	Special attention is paid to the issues of flavor changing neutral currents , loop effects , charge and color breaking minima , and M-theory versus weakly coupled string theory .
1	The zero order approximation gives the classical Gross-Pitaevskii equations .	We develop a consistent perturbation theory in quantum fluctuations around the classical evolution of a system of interacting bosons .	In the next order we recover the truncated Wigner approximation , where the evolution is still classical but the initial conditions are distributed according to the Wigner transform of the initial density matrix .	Further corrections can be characterized as quantum scattering events , which appear in the form of a nonlinear response of the observable to an infinitesimal displacement of the field along its classical evolution .	At the end of the paper we give a few numerical examples to test the formalism .
1	It can be generated when an intense laser beam ( the pump ) and a weak laser beam ( the seed ) overlap in a $ \chi^ { ( 3 ) } $ medium ( here cesium vapor ) , with frequencies close to resonance with atomic transitions .	Four-wave mixing ( 4WM ) is a known source of intense non-classical twin beams .	The twin beams generated by 4WM have frequencies naturally close to atomic transitions , and can be intense ( gain $ \gg 1 $ ) even in the CW pump regime , which is not the case for PDC $ \chi^ { ( 2 ) } $ phenomenon in non-linear crystals .	So , 4WM is well suited for atom-light interaction and atom-based quantum protocols .	Here we present the first realization of a source of 4-wave mixing exploiting $ D_2 $ line of Cesium atoms .
0	We analyse the 3-extremal holomorphic maps from the unit disc $ \mathbb { D } $ to the symmetrised bidisc $ \mathcal { G } $ , defined to be the set $ \ { ( z+w , zw ) : z , w\in\mathbb { D } \ } $ , with a view to the complex geometry and function theory of $ \mathcal { G } $ .	These are the maps whose restriction to any triple of distinct points in $ \mathbb { D } $ yields interpolation data that are only just solvable .	We find a large class of such maps ; they are rational of degree at most 4 .	It is shown that there are two qualitatively different classes of rational $ \mathcal { G } $ -inner functions of degree at most 4 , to be called { \em aligned } and { \em caddywhompus } functions ; the distinction relates to the cyclic ordering of certain associated points on the unit circle .	The aligned ones are 3-extremal .
0	We have carried out WFPC2 V- and I-band imaging of the young LMC cluster NGC 2157 .	Construction of a color-magnitude diagram and isochrone fitting yields an age of tau = 100 000 000 yrs , a reddening E ( B-V ) = 0.1 and a distance modulus of 18.4 mag .	Our data covers the mass range 0.75 & lt ; m & lt ; 5.1 solar masses .	We find that the cluster mass function changes significantly from the inner regions to the outer regions , becoming steeper ( larger number of low mass stars relative to high mass stars ) at larger radii .	The age of NGC 2157 is comparable to its two-body relaxation timescale only in the cluster core .
4	Using a gaussian variational method , we obtain the full frequency dependence of the conductivity tensor .	We study the effects of weak disorder on a Wigner crystal in a magnetic field .	We show that an elastic description of the pinned Wigner crystal provides an excellent framework to obtain most of the physically relevant observables .	Using such a description , we compute the static and dynamical properties .	We find that , akin to the Bragg glass phase , a good degree of translational order survives ( up to a large lengthscale in $ d=2 $ , infinite in $ d=3 $ ) .
2	However , in contrast to previous claims , we find convergence to universal behaviour as the system size increases , over a range of values of the dissipation parameter , $ \alpha $ .	We make an extensive numerical study of a two dimensional nonconservative model proposed by Olami-Feder-Christensen to describe earthquake behavior .	By analyzing the distribution of earthquake sizes using a multiscaling method , we find evidence that the model is critical , with no characteristic length scale other than the system size , in agreement with previous results .	We also find that both `` free '' and `` open '' boundary conditions tend to the same result .	Our analysis indicates that , as $ L $ increases , the behaviour slowly converges toward a power law distribution of earthquake sizes $ P ( s ) \sim s^ { -\tau } $ with exponent $ \tau \simeq 1.8 $ .
0	We present in detail a new systematic method which can be used to automatically eliminate the renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities in perturbative QCD predictions at all orders .	We show that all of the nonconformal \beta-dependent terms in a QCD perturbative series can be readily identified by generalizing the conventional renormalization schemes based on dimensional regularization .	We then demonstrate that the nonconformal series of pQCD at any order can be resummed systematically into the scale of the QCD coupling in a unique and unambiguous way due to a special degeneracy of the \beta-terms in the series .	The resummation follows from the principal of maximum conformality ( PMC ) and assigns a unique scale for the running coupling at each perturbative order .	The final result is independent of the initial choices of renormalization scheme and scale , in accordance with the principles of the renormalization group , and thus eliminates an unnecessary source of systematic error in physical predictions .
3	In contrast to his comment , it is proved that the presented formulae in our study are original and obtained independently , not by changing by the summation indices .	The comments of Guseinov on our recent paper ( Czech.J .	Phys. , 52 ( 2002 ) 1297 ) have been analyzed critically .	It is shown that his comments are irrelevant and also unjust .	It should be stressed that our algorithm is not affected from possible instability problems and also can be used in large scale calculations without loss of significant figures .
0	Graph theory provides a primary tool for analyzing and designing computer communication networks .	In the past few decades , Graph theory has been used to study various types of networks , including the Internet , wide Area Networks , Local Area Networks , and networking protocols such as border Gateway Protocol , Open shortest Path Protocol , and Networking Networks .	In this paper , we present some key graph theory concepts used to represent different types of networks .	Then we describe how networks are modeled to investigate problems related to network protocols .	Finally , we present some of the tools used to generate graph for representing practical networks .
4	The proofs involve studying the convex hull of the set of $ \lie { h } $ -weights $ \wt ( \V ) $ in their own right .	In this short note we announce three formulas for the set of weights of various classes of highest weight modules $ \V $ with highest weight \lambda , over a complex semisimple Lie algebra $ \lie { g } $ with Cartan subalgebra $ \lie { h } $ .	These include , but are not restricted to , all ( highest weight ) simple modules L ( \lambda ) .	We also assert that these formulas are the `` best possible '' , in that they do not hold in general for other highest weight modules in a very precise sense .	The proofs of the results in this note are included in an updated copy ( Version 3 ) of the paper arxiv:1301.1140 .
4	After t~4 days , the decay slows considerably , and the light curve remains approximately flat at R~24 mag for a month before decaying by another magnitude to reach R~25 mag two months after the burst .	We present deep optical photometry of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) 041006 and its associated hypernova obtained over 65 days after detection ( 55 R-band epochs on 10 different nights ) .	Our early data ( t & lt ; 4 days ) joined with published GCN data indicates a steepening decay , approaching F_nu ~t^ { -0.6 } at early times ( & lt ; & lt ; 1 day ) and F_nu ~t^ { -1.3 } at late times .	The break at t_b=0.16+-0.04 days is the earliest reported jet break among all GRB afterglows .	During our first night , we obtained 39 exposures spanning 2.15 hours from 0.62 to 0.71 days after the burst that reveal a smooth afterglow , with an rms deviation of 0.024 mag from the local power-law fit , consistent with photometric errors .
2	In order to avoid the pitfalls of plug-in methods that estimate each sample density independently with respect to the Lebesgue measure , we make direct inference on the two distributions simultaneously from a joint prior , i.e. , the coupled binary partition prior .	A Bayesian model is proposed to characterize the discrepancy of two samples , e.g. , to estimate the divergence or distance of their underlying distributions .	The core idea of this framework is to learn a partition of the sample space that best captures the landscapes of their distributions .	Our prior leverages on the class of piecewise constant functions built upon binary partitions of the domain .	Our model ushers a unified way to estimate various types of discrepancies between samples and enjoys convincing accuracy .
0	We present a detailed study of the Faraday depth structure of four bright ( & gt ; 1 Jy ) , strongly polarized , unresolved , radio-loud quasars .	The Australia Telescope Compact Array ( ATCA ) was used to observe these sources with 2 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth from 1.1 to 3.1 GHz .	This allowed us to spectrally resolve the polarization structure of spatially unresolved radio sources , and by fitting various Faraday rotation models to the data , we conclusively demonstrate that two of the sources can not be described by a simple rotation measure ( RM ) component modified by depolarization from a foreground Faraday screen .	Our results have important implications for using background extragalactic radio sources as probes of the Galactic and intergalactic magneto-ionic media as we show how RM estimations from narrow-bandwidth observations can give erroneous results in the presence of multiple interfering Faraday components .	We postulate that the additional RM components arise from polarized structure in the compact inner regions of the radio source itself and not from polarized emission from Galactic or intergalactic foreground regions .
3	Based on this study , we introduce methods for finding dielectric permittivity , temperature and geometrical characteristics of observed surfaces .	Using polarization measurements in remote sensing and optical studies allows retrieving more information .	We consider relationship between the reflection coefficients of plane and rough surfaces for linearly polarized waves .	Certain polarization properties of reflected waves and polarization invariants , in particular at incident angle of forty five degrees , allow finding amplitude and phase characteristics of reflected waves .	Experimental results prove that these methods can be used for different practical purposes in technological and remote sensing applications , in a broad range of electromagnetic spectrum .
1	This increase of eccentricity reduces the merging timescale of the binary through the gravitational radiation to the value well below the Hubble Time .	In recent numerical simulations \citep { matsubayashi07 , lockmann08 } , it has been found that the eccentricity of supermassive black hole ( SMBH ) - intermediate black hole ( IMBH ) binaries grows toward unity through interactions with stellar background .	It also gives the theoretical explanation of the existence of eccentric binary such as that in OJ287 \citep { lehto96 , valtonen08 } .	In self-consistent N-body simulations , this increase of eccentricity is always observed .	On the other hand , the result of scattering experiment between SMBH binaries and field stars \citep { quinlan96 } indicated no increase of eccentricity .
2	Galactic outflows lead to two countervailing effects : removal of small-scale magnetic helicity , which helps to avert catastrophic quenching of the dynamo , and advection of the large-scale magnetic field , which suppresses dynamo action .	Galactic magnetic arms have been observed between the gaseous arms of some spiral galaxies ; their origin remains unclear .	We suggest that magnetic spiral arms can be naturally generated in the interarm regions because the galactic fountain flow or wind is likely to be weaker there than in the arms .	For realistic galactic parameters , the net consequence of outflows being stronger in the gaseous arms is higher saturation large-scale field strengths in the interarm regions as compared to in the arms .	By incorporating rather realistic models of spiral structure and evolution into our dynamo models , an interlaced pattern of magnetic and gaseous arms can be produced .
1	States $ \Psi^\pm $ are entangled for all finite accelerations , whereas , due to the Unruh effect , states $ \Phi^\pm $ lose their entanglement for finite accelerations .	We study the entanglement of families of Unruh modes in the Bell states $ |\Phi^\pm\rangle =1/\sqrt { 2 } ( |00\rangle\pm|11\rangle ) $ and $ |\Psi^\pm\rangle=1/\sqrt { 2 } ( |01\rangle\pm|10\rangle ) $ shared by two accelerated observers and find fundamental differences in the robustness of entanglement against acceleration for these states .	This is true for Bell states of two bosonic modes , as well as for Bell states of a bosonic and a fermionic mode .	Furthermore , there are also differences in the degradation of entanglement for Bell states of fermionic modes .	We reveal the origin of these distinct characteristics of entanglement degradation and discuss the role that is played by particle statistics .
4	Rates of convergence between the previously mentioned iterative schemes are compared , as well as their respective timing properties .	This study concerns the fast and accurate solution of the line radiation transfer problem , under non-LTE conditions .	We propose and evaluate an alternative iterative scheme to the classical ALI-Jacobi method , and to the more recently proposed Gauss-Seidel and Successive Over-Relaxation ( GS/SOR ) schemes .	Our study is indeed based on the application of a preconditioned bi-conjugate gradient method ( BiCG-P ) .	Standard tests , in 1D plane parallel geometry and in the frame of the two-level atom model , with monochromatic scattering , are discussed .
4	To test the robustness of the approach , we directly compare theoretical results with experimental magnetoimpedance measurements obtained in a wide range of frequencies for an exchange biased multilayered film .	The magnetoimpedance effect is a versatile tool to investigate ferromagnetic materials , revealing aspects on the fundamental physics associated to magnetization dynamics , broadband magnetic properties , important issues for current and emerging technological applications for magnetic sensors , as well as insights on ferromagnetic resonance effect at non-saturated magnetic states .	Here , we perform a theoretical and experimental investigation of the magnetoimpedance effect for the thin film geometry in a wide frequency range .	We calculate the longitudinal magnetoimpedance for single layered , multilayered or exchange biased systems from an approach that considers a magnetic permeability model for planar geometry and the appropriate magnetic free energy density for each structure .	From numerical calculations and experimental results found in literature , we analyze the magnetoimpedance behavior , and discuss the main features and advantages of each structure .
3	The present calculations are carried out using an all order relativistic many-body theory considering only single and double excitations in the coupled-cluster ansatz .	We investigate electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constant ( $ B $ ) results in $ ^ { 135 } $ Ba $ ^+ $ and $ ^ { 137 } $ Ba $ ^+ $ and compare their ratios with the reported measurements of the ratio between the nuclear quadrupole moment ( $ Q $ ) values of these isotopes .	We carry out confidence tests for the reported experimental $ B $ values and calculations of $ B/Q $ from the present work .	Inconsistencies in the experimental $ B $ values are observed in both the isotopes from different experiments performed using the same techniques .	After a detailed analysis of the results , the values of $ Q $ we obtain for $ ^ { 135 } $ Ba and $ ^ { 137 } $ Ba are 0.153 ( 2 ) $ b $ and 0.236 ( 3 ) $ b $ , respectively , which differ by about 4 % from the currently referred precise values .
0	We present preliminary numerical evidence that the physical conditions in high-mass star forming regions can arise from global gravitational infall , with the velocity dispersions being caused primarily by infall motions rather than random turbulence .	To this end , we study the clumps and cores appearing in the region of central collapse in a numerical simulation of the formation , evolution , and subsequent collapse of a dense cloud out of a transonic compression in the diffuse atomic ISM .	The clumps have sizes $ \sim 1 $ pc , masses of several hundred $ M_\odot $ , and three-dimensional velocity dispersions $ \sim 3 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ , in agreement with typical observed values for such structures .	The clumps break down into massive cores of sizes $ \sim 0.1 $ pc , densities $ \sim 10^5 $ , masses 2-300 $ M_\odot $ , with distributions of these quantities that peak at the same values as the massive core sample in a recent survey of the Cygnus X molecular cloud complex .	Although preliminary , these results suggest that high-mass star forming clumps may be in a state of global gravitational collapse rather than in equilibrium supported by strong turbulence .
0	We show that application of quantum unitary groups , in place of ordinary flavor SU ( n_f ) , to such static aspects of hadron phenomenology as hadron masses and mass formulas is indeed fruitful .	The so-called q-deformed mass formulas are given for octet baryons ( 1/2 ) ^+ and decuplet baryons ( 3/2 ) ^+ , as well as for the case of vector mesons 1^- involving heavy flavors .	For deformation parameter q , rigid fixation of values is used .	New mass sum rules of remarkable accuracy are presented .	As shown in decuplet case , the approach accounts for effects highly nonlinear in SU ( 3 ) -breaking .
2	The stacking interactions of the methyl groups globally inhibit CG : CG step overtwisting while simultaneously softening the modes locally via potential energy modulations that create metastable states .	Van der Waals density functional theory is integrated with analysis of a non-redundant set of protein-DNA crystal structures from the Nucleic Acid Database to study the stacking energetics of CG : CG base-pair steps , specifically the role of cytosine 5-methylation .	Principal component analysis of the steps reveals the dominant collective motions to correspond to a tensile 'opening ' mode and two shear 'sliding ' and 'tearing ' modes in the orthogonal plane .	Additionally , the indirect effects of the methyl groups on possible base-pair steps neighboring CG : CG are observed to be of comparable importance to their direct effects on CG : CG .	The results have implications for the epigenetic control of DNA mechanics .
2	By using repeated observations of a specific calibration star field , we were able to achieve integration times in excess of 3900 seconds compared to the 7.8 seconds in the standard 2MASS data product .	This is one of two papers in which we report the detection of structure in the cosmic infrared background ( CIB ) between 1.25 - 2.2 micron through the use of data from the Two Micron Sky Survey ( 2MASS ) .	This paper concentrates on data assembly , analysis and the estimate of the various foreground contributions ; the companion paper ( Kashlinsky , Odenwald , Mather , Skrutskie , Cutri 2002 , hereafter KOMSC ) presents the cosmological results for the CIB fluctuations and their implications .	This yielded a point source detection limit ( 3 \sigma ) of +18.5^m in K_s band .	The resulting co-added images were processed to remove point sources to a limiting surface brightness of +20^m/arcsec $ ^2 or 40 nW/m^2/sr .
1	( Szeged ) 24 ( 1963 ) , 34-59 ) is adapted to provide an alternative proof to a well-known fact that every finite distributive lattice is representable , seen as a special case of the Finite Lattice Representation Problem .	A partial algebra construction of Gr\ '' atzer and Schmidt from `` Characterizations of congruence lattices of abstract algebras '' ( Acta Sci.Math .	The construction of this proof brings together Birkhoff 's representation theorem for finite distributive lattices , an emphasis on boolean lattices when representing finite lattices , and a perspective based on inequalities of partially ordered sets .	It may be possible to generalize the techniques used in this approach .	Other than the aforementioned representation theorem only elementary tools are used for the two theorems of this note .
4	EGLEs may have interesting astrophysical effects , such as the destruction of dust grains , ignition of masers , etc .	Every astrophysical object ( dark or not ) is a gravitational lens , as well as a receiver/observer of the light from sources lensed by other objects in its neighborhood .	For a given pair of source and lens , there is a thin on-axis tubelike volume behind the lens in which the radiation flux from the source is greatly increased due to gravitational lensing .	Any objects which pass through such a thin tube or beam will experience strong bursts of radiation , i.e. , Extreme Gravitational Lensing Events ( EGLEs ) .	We have studied the physics and statistics of EGLEs .
2	We present a generic method , based on the uniform approximation , to analytically derive the primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations .	Inflationary models within string theory exhibit unusual scalar field dynamics involving non-minimal kinetic terms and generically referred to as k-inflation .	In this situation , the standard slow-roll approach used to determine the behavior of the primordial cosmological perturbations can not longer be used .	At leading order , the scalar spectral index , its running and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are modified by the new dynamics .	We provide their new expression , correct previous results at next-to-leading order and clarify the definition of what is the tensor-to-scalar ratio when the sound horizon and Hubble radius are not the same .
3	For typical environment around SNRs the dominant ionization process is the photo-ionization due to the background galactic radiation .	We study the acceleration of heavy nuclei at SNR shocks taking into account the process of ionization .	In the interstellar medium atoms heavier then hydrogen which start the diffusive shock acceleration ( DSA ) are never fully ionized at the moment of injection .	We will show that electrons in the atomic shells are stripped during the acceleration process , when the atoms already move relativistically .	The ionization has two interesting consequences .
1	We analyze a series of numerical integrations , each involving the 4 migratory giant planets and 400 test particles distributed throughout trans-Neptunian space , to measure efficiencies of capture as functions of migration speed .	We illuminate dynamical properties of Kuiper Belt Objects ( KBOs ) in the 3:2 ( `` Plutino '' ) and 2:1 ( `` Twotino '' ) Neptunian resonances within the model of resonant capture and migration .	Snapshots of the spatial distribution of resonant KBOs reveal that Twotinos cluster +/- 75 degrees away from Neptune 's longitude , while Plutinos cluster +/- 90 degrees away .	Longitudinal clustering persists even for surveys that are not volume-limited in their ability to detect resonant KBOs .	Remarkably , between -90 degrees and -60 degrees of Neptune 's longitude , we find the sky density of Twotinos to nearly equal that of Plutinos , despite the greater average distance of Twotinos .
3	This result is compared to single-spin asymmetries for charged pion production measured in the same kinematic range .	A single-spin asymmetry in the azimuthal distribution of neutral pions relative to the lepton scattering plane has been measured for the first time in deep-inelastic scattering of positrons off longitudinally polarized protons .	The analysing power in the sin ( phi ) moment of the cross section is 0.019 +/- 0.007 ( stat . )	+/- 0.003 ( syst . ) .	The pi^0 asymmetry is of the same size as the pi^+ asymmetry and shows a similar dependence on the relevant kinematic variables .
1	Such structure exhibits discrete Legendre symmetry .	The work within the Geometrothermodynamics programme rests upon the metric structure for the thermodynamic phase-space .	In this work , we study the class of metrics which are invariant along the infinitesimal generators of Legendre transformations .	We solve the Legendre-Killing equation for a $ K $ -contact general metric .	We consider the case with two thermodynamic degrees of freedom , i.e.when the dimension of the thermodynamic phase-space is five .
0	We present the first high-angular resolution ( up to 0.7 '' , ~5000 AU ) polarization and thermal dust continuum images toward the massive star-forming region W51 North .	The observations were carried out with the Submillimeter Array ( SMA ) in both the subcompact ( SMA-SubC ) and extended ( SMA-Ext ) configurations at a wavelength of 870 micron .	W51 North is resolved into four cores ( SMA1 to SMA4 ) in the 870 micron continuum image .	The associated dust polarization exhibits more complex structures than seen at lower angular resolution .	We analyze the inferred morphologies of the plane-of-sky magnetic field ( B_bot ) in the SMA1 to SMA4 cores and in the envelope using the SMA-Ext and SMA-SubC data .
1	We study the map $ x_ { n+1 } =x_ { n } +u| x_ { n } | ^ { z } $ , $ z & gt ; 1 $ , as it describes generically the neighborhood of all of these transitions .	We consider the period-doubling and intermittency transitions in iterated nonlinear one-dimensional maps to corroborate unambiguously the validity of Tsallis ' non-extensive statistics at these critical points .	The exact renormalization group ( RG ) fixed-point map and perturbation static expressions match the corresponding expressions for the dynamics of iterates .	The time evolution is universal in the RG sense and the non-extensive entropy $ S_ { Q } $ associated to the fixed-point map is maximum with respect to that of the other maps in its basin of attraction .	The degree of non-extensivity - the index $ Q $ in $ S_ { Q } $ - and the degree of nonlinearity $ z $ are equivalent and the generalized Lyapunov exponent $ \lambda_ { q } $ , $ q=2-Q^ { -1 } $ , is the leading map expansion coefficient $ u $ .
4	However , using different coordinates $ ( \tau , U ) $ , we find that one can evolve the waves so that WKB in these coordinates is valid throughout this transition region -- which contradicts the above identification of the breakdown of WKB as the cause of the radiation .	Inspired by the condensed matter analogues of black holes ( a.k.a .	dumb holes ) , we study Hawking radiation in the presence of a modified dispersion relation which becomes super-luminal at large wave-numbers .	In the usual stationary coordinates $ ( t , x ) $ , one can describe the asymptotic evolution of the wave-packets in WKB , but this WKB approximation breaks down in the vicinity of the horizon , thereby allowing for a mixing between initial and final creation and annihilation operators .	Thus , one might be tempted to identify this point where WKB breaks down with the moment of particle creation .
0	We show that it is possible to prepare and identify ultra -- thin sheets of graphene on crystalline substrates such as SrTiO $ _3 $ , TiO $ _2 $ , Al $ _2 $ O $ _3 $ and CaF $ _2 $ by standard techniques ( mechanical exfoliation , optical and atomic force microscopy ) .	On the substrates under consideration we find a similar distribution of single , bi- and few layer graphene and graphite flakes as with conventional SiO $ _2 $ substrates .	The optical contrast $ C $ of a single graphene layer on any of those substrates is determined by calculating the optical properties of a two-dimensional metallic sheet on the surface of a dielectric , which yields values between $ C= $ ~- 1.5 % ( G/TiO $ _2 $ ) and $ C= $ ~- 8.8 % ( G/CaF $ _2 $ ) .	This contrast is in reasonable agreement with experimental data and is sufficient to make identification by an optical microscope possible .	The graphene layers cover the crystalline substrate in a carpet-like mode and the height of single layer graphene on any of the crystalline substrates as determined by atomic force microscopy is $ d_ { SLG } =0.34 $ nm and thus much smaller than on SiO $ _2 $ .
4	We provide a description of the algorithm and the strategy followed to handle large simulation data .	Cosmological simulations are the key tool for investigating the different processes involved in the formation of the universe from small initial density perturbations to galaxies and clusters of galaxies observed today .	The identification and analysis of bound objects , halos , is one of the most important steps in drawing useful physical information from simulations .	In the advent of larger and larger simulations , a reliable and parallel halo finder , able to cope with the ever-increasing data files , is a must .	In this work we present the freely available MPI parallel halo finder AHF .
1	During the later Paleolithic , technologies increase not only in terms of diversity but also in their complexity and interdependence .	Cultural transmission models are coming to the fore in explaining increases in the Paleolithic toolkit richness and diversity .	As Mesoudi and O'Brien ( 2008 ) have shown , selection broadly favors social learning of information that is hierarchical and structured , and multiple studies have demonstrated that teaching within a social learning environment can increase fitness .	We believe that teaching also provides the scaffolding for transmission of more complex cultural traits .	Here , we introduce an extension of the Axelrod ( 1997 } model of cultural differentiation in which traits have prerequisite relationships , and where social learning is dependent upon the ordering of those prerequisites .
2	We find that , similar to the case of the isotropic exchange , the tunneling density of states as a function of energy has the maximum due to a finite value of the total spin of the ground state near the Stoner instability .	We reexamine the tunneling density of states in quantum dots and nanoparticles within the model which is extension of the universal Hamiltonian to the case of uniaxial anisotropic exchange .	We derive the exact analytical result for the tunneling density of states in the case of arbitrary single-particle energy spectrum .	We demonstrate that there are no additional extrema which have been predicted on the basis of perturbative analysis [ M.N .	Kiselev and Y. Gefen , Phys.Rev.Lett .
2	We show how the dimension of the state space , the behavior of the coupling and the Hamiltonian at infinity affect the existence and non-existence of regular solutions .	We consider stationary viscous Mean-Field Games systems in the case of local , decreasing and unbounded coupling .	These systems arise in ergodic mean-field game theory , and describe Nash equilibria of games with a large number of agents aiming at aggregation .	Our approach relies on the study of Sobolev regularity of the invariant measure and a blow-up procedure which is calibrated on the scaling properties of the system .	In very special cases we observe uniqueness of solutions .
0	Symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures ( SIC-POVMs ) are studied within the framework of the probability representation of quantum mechanics .	A SIC-POVM is shown to be a special case of the probability representation .	The problem of SIC-POVM existence is formulated in terms of symbols of operators associated with a star-product quantization scheme .	We show that SIC-POVMs ( if they do exist ) must obey general rules of the star product , and , starting from this fact , we derive new relations on SIC-projectors .	The case of qubits is considered in detail , in particular , the relation between the SIC probability representation and other probability representations is established , the connection with mutually unbiased bases is discussed , and comments to the Lie algebraic structure of SIC-POVMs are presented .
3	The X-ray morphology is varied , but in general closely matches the radio structure until the first sharp radio bend .	We are conducting an X-ray survey of flat spectrum radio quasars ( FSRQs ) with extended radio structures .	We summarize our results from the first stage of our survey , then we present findings from its continuation .	We have discovered jet X-ray emission from 12 of our first 20 Chandra targets , establishing that strong 0.5-7.0 keV emission is a common feature of FSRQ jets .	In the sources with optical data as well as X-ray detections we rule out simple synchrotron models for X-ray emission , suggesting these systems may instead be dominated by inverse Compton ( IC ) scattering .
0	The proton radioactivity lifetimes of spherical proton emitters from the ground and the isomeric states are calculated using the microscopic nucleon-nucleus interaction potentials .	The daughter nuclei density distributions are folded with a realistic density dependent M3Y effective interaction supplemented by a zero-range pseudo-potential .	The density dependence parameters of the interaction are extracted from the nuclear matter calculations .	The saturation energy per nucleon used for nuclear matter calculations is determined from the co-efficient of the volume term of Bethe-Weizsacker mass formula which is evaluated by fitting the recent experimental and estimated atomic mass excesses from Audi-Wapstra-Thibault atomic mass table by minimizing the mean square deviation .	The quantum mechanical tunneling probability is calculated within the WKB approximation .
4	Moreover , the first extension of rankers admits a characterization of the intersection of Sigma2 and FO2 while the other leads to a characterization of the intersection of Pi2 and FO2 .	We consider the four fragments FO2 , the intersection of Sigma2 and FO2 , the intersection of Pi2 and FO2 , and Delta2 of first-order logic FO [ & lt ; ] over finite and infinite words .	For all four fragments , we give characterizations in terms of rankers .	In particular , we generalize the notion of a ranker to infinite words in two possible ways .	Both extensions are natural in the sense that over finite words , they coincide with classical rankers and over infinite words , they both have the full expressive power of FO2 .
1	The present work investigates the extent to which such Gauss Laws follow from diffeomorphism invariance .	It has been argued that holography in gravitational theories is related to the existence of a particularly useful Gauss Law that allows energy to be measured at the boundary .	We study parametrized field theories , which are a class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories without gravity .	We find that the Hamiltonian for parametrized field theories vanishes on shell even in the presence of a boundary and under a variety of boundary conditions .	We conclude that parametrized theories have no useful Gauss Law , consistent with the absence of holography in these theories .
1	Consider the category of g^-modules at the critical level , on which the action of the Iwahori subalgebra integrates to algebraic action of the Iwahori subgroup I .	Let g be a semi-simple Lie algebra , and let g^ be the corresponding affine Kac-Moody algebra .	We study the action on this category of the convolution functors with the `` central '' sheaves on the affine flag scheme G ( ( t ) ) /I .	We show that each object of our category is an `` eigen-module '' with respect to these functors .	In order to prove this , we use the fusion product of modules over the affine Kac-Moody algebra .
0	In order to develop a toy model for car 's traffic in cities , in this paper we analyze , by means of numerical simulations , the transition among fluid regimes and a congested jammed phase of the flow of `` kinetically constrained '' hard spheres in planar random networks similar to urban roads .	In order to explore as timescales as possible , at a microscopic level we implement an event driven dynamics as the infinite time limit of a class of already existing model ( e.g . `` Follow the Leader '' ) on an Erdos-Renyi two dimensional graph , the crossroads being accounted by standard Kirchoff density conservations .	We define a dynamical order parameter as the ratio among the moving spheres versus the total number and by varying two control parameters ( density of the spheres and coordination number of the network ) we study the phase transition .	At a mesoscopic level it respects an , again suitable adapted , version of the Lighthill-Whitham model , which belongs to the fluid-dynamical approach to the problem .	At a macroscopic level the model seems to display a continuous transition from a fluid phase to a jammed phase when varying the density of the spheres ( the amount of cars in a city-like scenario ) and a discontinuous jump when varying the connectivity of the underlying network .
2	For time-reversible equations , such as the Hamilton or the Schr\ '' odinger equation , it is immaterial whether or not the decomposition coefficients are positive .	The solution of many physical evolution equations can be expressed as an exponential of two or more operators acting on initial data .	Accurate solutions can be systematically derived by decomposing the exponential in a product form .	In fact , most symplectic algorithms for solving classical dynamics contain some negative coefficients .	For time-irreversible systems , such as the Fokker-Planck equation or the quantum statistical propagator , only positive-coefficient decompositions , which respect the time-irreversibility of the diffusion kernel , can yield practical algorithms .
0	Stavskaya 's model is a one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton ( PCA ) introduced in the end of the 1960 's as an example of a model displaying a nonequilibrium phase transition .	Although its absorbing state phase transition is well understood nowadays , the model never received a full numerical treatment to investigate its critical behavior .	In this short article we characterize the critical behavior of Stavskaya 's PCA by means of Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis .	The critical exponents of the model are calculated and indicate that its phase transition belongs to the directed percolation universality class of critical behavior , as it would be expected on the basis of the directed percolation conjecture .	We also explicitly establish the relationship of the model with the Domany-Kinzel PCA on its directed site percolation line , a connection that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature so far .
4	Blass showed that the Specker phenomenon is closely related to a combinatorial phenomenon he called evading and predicting .	We study the set -- theoretic combinatorics underlying the following two algebraic phenomena .	( 1 ) A subgroup G leq Z^omega exhibits the Specker phenomenon iff every homomorphism G to Z maps almost all unit vectors to 0 .	Let se be the size of the smallest G leq Z^omega exhibiting the Specker phenomenon .	( 2 ) Given an uncountably dimensional vector space E equipped with a symmetric bilinear form Phi over an at most countable field KK , ( E , Phi ) is strongly Gross iff for all countably dimensional U leq E , we have dim ( U^perp ) leq omega .
0	The renormalization group equations for the general 2 by 2 , complex , neutrino mass matrix are shown to have exact , analytic solutions .	Simple formulas are given for the physical mixing angle , complex phase and mass ratio in terms of their initial values and the energy scales .	We also establish a ( complex ) renormalization invariant relating these parameters .	The qualitative features of the physical parameters ' renormalization are clearly illustrated in vector field plots .	In both the SM and MSSM , maximal mixing is a saddle point .
4	Within the framework of this model , the NMR measurement is sensitive to the distribution of native defects within these materials .	Bismuth chalcogenides Bi $ _2 $ Se $ _3 $ and Bi $ _2 $ Te $ _3 $ are semiconductors , which can be both thermoelectric materials ( TE ) and topological insulators ( TI ) .	Lattice defects arising from vacancies , impurities , or dopants in these materials are important in that they provide the charge carriers in TE applications and compromise the performance of these materials as TIs .	We present the first solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) study of the $ ^ { 77 } $ Se and $ ^ { 125 } $ Te NMR resonances in polycrystalline powders of Bi $ _2 $ Se $ _3 $ and Bi $ _2 $ Te $ _3 $ , respectively .	The spin-lattice ( $ T_1 $ ) relaxation is modeled by at most two exponentials .
2	The estimate also applies to the exterior domains of non-trapping polygons via a doubling process .	We consider manifolds with conic singularites that are isometric to $ \mathbb { R } ^ { n } $ outside a compact set .	Under natural geometric assumptions on the cone points , we prove the existence of a logarithmic resonance-free region for the cut-off resolvent .	The proof of the resolvent estimate relies on the propagation of singularities theorems of Melrose and the second author to establish a `` very weak '' Huygens ' principle , which may be of independent interest .	As applications of the estimate , we obtain a exponential local energy decay and a resonance wave expansion in odd dimensions , as well as a lossless local smoothing estimate for the Schr { \ '' o } dinger equation .
4	Furthermore , one must consider more intricate searches , such as lepton-based searches , which could be susceptible to flavor effects .	Uncovering the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking ( EWSB ) is the raison-d'etre of the LHC .	Flavor questions , it would seem , are of minor relevance for this quest , apart from their role in constraining the possible structure of EWSB physics .	In this short review article , we outline , using flavor-dependent sleptons as an example , how flavor can affect both searches for supersymmetry , and future measurements aimed at understanding the nature of any new discoveries .	If the production cross-sections for supersymmetry are relatively low , as indicated by the fact that it has not revealed itself yet in standard searches , the usual assumptions about the superpartner spectra need re-thinking .
4	When the contra-covariant is required for the non-commutative field , both Lorentz gauge and Coulomb gauge are derived in this research .	Gravity field theory and electromagnetic field theory are well established and confirmed by experiments .	The Schwarzschild metric and Kerr Metric of Einstein field equation shows that the spatial differential of time gauge is the gravity field .	For pure time displacement field , when its spatial differentials are commutative , conservative fields can be established .	When its spatial differentials are non-commutative , Maxwell electromagnetic field equations can be established .
4	Cluster ages derived with the lithium depletion boundary technique are erroneously young by $ \sim 15 $ % and $ 10 $ % at $ 30 $ and $ 100 $ Myr respectively , if 50 % spotted stars are interpreted with un-spotted models .	We assess the impact of starspots on the evolution of late-type stars during the pre-main sequence ( pre-MS ) using a modified stellar evolution code .	We find that heavily spotted models of mass 0.1-1.2\msun\ are inflated by up to $ 10 $ % during the pre-MS , and up to 4 % and 9 % for fully- and partially-convective stars at the zero-age MS , consistent with measurements from active eclipsing binary systems .	Spots similarly decrease stellar luminosity and $ T_ { \rm eff } $ , causing isochrone-derived masses to be under-estimated by up to a factor of $ 2 \times $ , and ages to be under-estimated by a factor of 2-10 $ \times $ , at 3 Myr .	Consequently , pre-MS clusters and their active stars are systematically older and more massive than often reported .
0	The publicly available EIS-DEEP optical-NIR data for the AXAF ( Chandra ) Deep Field have been used to construct samples of Extremely Red Objects ( EROs ) using various single-band and multi-band color criteria .	In this work we define as EROs objects with colors consistent with passively evolving elliptical galaxies at z $ \geq $ 1 .	The EROs surface densities we derive are intermediate between previous published values , emphasizing again the need for larger survey areas to constrain the effects of possible large-scale structure .	Although various single-color selected samples can be derived , the EROs sample selected using R-Ks & gt ; 5 , I-Ks & gt ; 4 , J-Ks & gt ; 1.8 jointly is likely to contain the highest fraction of passively evolving luminous field elliptical galaxies at z & gt ; = 1 , or conversely , the lowest fraction of lower redshift interlopers .	The surface density of this multi-band selected EROs sample is consistent with the conclusion that little or no field elliptical volume density evolution has occurred in the redshift range 0 & gt ; z & gt ; 1.5 .
1	The state of the system is described by deformation and magnetization .	We investigate a variational theory for magnetoelastic solids under the incompressibility constraint .	While the former is classically related to the reference configuration , magnetization is defined in the deformed configuration instead .	We discuss the existence of energy minimizers without relying on higher-order deformation gradient terms .	Then , by introducing a suitable positively $ 1 $ -homogeneous dissipation , a quasistatic evolution model is proposed and analyzed within the frame of energetic solvability .
0	In this paper , we study sharp Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for a large class of symmetric Markov processes in $ C^ { 1 , \eta } $ open sets .	The processes are symmetric pure jump Markov processes with jumping intensity $ \kappa ( x , y ) \psi_1 ( |x-y| ) ^ { -1 } |x-y|^ { -d-\alpha } $ , where $ \alpha \in ( 0,2 ) $ .	Here , $ \psi_1 $ is an increasing function on $ [ 0 , \infty ) $ , with $ \psi_1 ( r ) =1 $ on $ 0 & lt ; r \le 1 $ and $ c_1e^ { c_2r^ { \beta } } \le \psi_1 ( r ) \le c_3 e^ { c_4r^ { \beta } } $ on $ r & gt ; 1 $ for $ \beta \in [ 0 , \infty ] $ , and $ \kappa ( x , y ) $ is a symmetric function confined between two positive constants , with $ |\kappa ( x , y ) -\kappa ( x , x ) |\leq c_5|x-y|^ { \rho } $ for $ |x-y| & lt ; 1 $ and $ \rho & gt ; \alpha/2 $ .	We establish two-sided estimates for the transition densities of such processes in $ C^ { 1 , \eta } $ open sets when $ \eta \in ( \alpha/2 , 1 ] $ .	In particular , our result includes ( relativistic ) symmetric stable processes and finite-range stable processes in $ C^ { 1 , \eta } $ open sets when $ \eta \in ( \alpha/2 , 1 ] $ .
2	The input to all pedestrian tracking algorithms is an identical set of head and body detections , obtained using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients ( HOG ) detector .	The paper evaluates the error performance of three random finite set based multi-object trackers in the context of pedestrian video tracking .	The evaluation is carried out using a publicly available video dataset of 4500 frames ( town centre street ) for which the ground truth is available .	The tracking error is measured using the recently proposed OSPA metric for tracks , adopted as the only known mathematically rigorous metric for measuring the distance between two sets of tracks .	A comparative analysis is presented under various conditions .
3	We also make comments regarding the d $ 2d N=4 conformal Liouville description of the Higgs branch throat by following the analysis of [ 18 ] .	We study the singularities of the Higgs branch of supersymmetric U ( 1 ) ^r gauge theories with eight supercharges .	We derive new solutions for the moduli space of vacua preserving manifestly the eight supercharges by using a geometric realization of the SU ( 2 ) _R symmetry and a separation procedure of the gauge and SU ( 2 ) _R charges , which allow us to put the hypermultiplet vacua in a form depending on a parameter $ \gamma $ .	For $ \gamma=1 $ , we obtain new models which flow in the infrared to 2d N= ( 4,4 ) conformal models and we show that the classical moduli spaces are given by intersecting cotangent weighted complex projective spaces containing the small instanton singularity , discussed in [ 17 ] , as a leading special case .	Other features are also discussed .
4	By embedding the sensor under irradiation within a tungsten radiator , the exposure incorporated hadronic species that would potentially contribute to the degradation of a sensor mounted in a precision sampling calorimeter .	Detectors proposed for the International Linear Collider ( ILC ) incorporate a tungsten sampling calorimeter ( `BeamCal ' ) intended to reconstruct showers of electrons , positrons and photons that emerge from the interaction point of the collider with angles between 5 and 50 milliradians .	For the innermost radius of this calorimeter , radiation doses at shower-max are expected to reach 100 MRad per year , primarily due to minimum-ionizing electrons and positrons that arise in the induced electromagnetic showers of e+e- `beamstrahlung ' pairs produced in the ILC beam-beam interaction .	However , radiation damage to calorimeter sensors may be dominated by hadrons induced by nuclear interactions of shower photons , which are much more likely to contribute to the non-ionizing energy loss that has been observed to damage sensors exposed to hadronic radiation .	We report here on the results of SLAC Experiment T-506 , for which several different types of silicon diode and gallium-arsenide sensors were exposed to doses of radiation induced by showering electrons of energy 3.5-10.6 GeV .
2	The weighted $ L^2 $ setting allows us to cover some singular cases , such as optimal stopping for stochastic equations with degenerate diffusion coefficient .	We study the existence theory for parabolic variational inequalities in weighted $ L^2 $ spaces with respect to excessive measures associated with a transition semigroup .	We characterize the value function of optimal stopping problems for finite and infinite dimensional diffusions as a generalized solution of such a variational inequality .	As an application of the theory , we consider the pricing of American-style contingent claims .	Among others , we treat the cases of assets with stochastic volatility and with path-dependent payoffs .
1	His model assumes that there is a finite-state Markov process X that drives the economy in discrete time .	Recently , Ross showed that it is possible to recover an objective measure from a risk-neutral measure .	Many authors extended his model to a continuous-time setting with a Markov diffusion process X with state space R. Unfortunately , the continuous-time model fails to recover an objective measure from a risk-neutral measure .	We determine under which information recovery is possible in the continuous-time model .	It was proven that if X is recurrent under the objective measure , then recovery is possible .
1	This network reflects the internal structure of the program , and defines the `` information flow '' within the program .	A large computer program is typically divided into many hundreds or even thousands of smaller units , whose logical connections define a network in a natural way .	We show that , ( 1 ) due to its growth in time this network displays a scale-free feature in that the probability of the number of links at a node obeys a power-law distribution , and ( 2 ) as a result of performance optimization of the program the network has a small-world structure .	We believe that these features are generic for large computer programs .	Our work extends the previous studies on growing networks , which have mostly been for physical networks , to the domain of computer software .
3	In particular , no signs of scaling violations could be found in either quantity , at least to well below the numerical accuracy where these violations were visible for the gluon propagator .	The ghost propagator and the Coulomb potential are evaluated in Coulomb gauge on the lattice , using an improved gauge fixing scheme which includes the residual symmetry .	This setting has been shown to be essential in order to explain the scaling violations in the instantaneous gluon propagator .	We find that both the ghost propagator and the Coulomb potential are insensitive to the Gribov problem or the details of the residual gauge fixing , even if the Coulomb potential is evaluated from the A0 -- propagator instead of the Coulomb kernel .	The Coulomb potential from the A0-propagator is shown to be in qualitative agreement with the ( formally equivalent ) expression evaluated from the Coulomb kernel .
0	For any fixed alphabet A , the maximum topological entropy of a Z^d subshift with alphabet A is obviously log |A| .	We study the class of nearest neighbor Z^d shifts of finite type which have topological entropy very close to this maximum , and show that they have many useful properties .	Specifically , we prove that for any d , there exists beta_d such that for any nearest neighbor Z^d shift of finite type X with alphabet A for which log |A| - h ( X ) & lt ; beta_d , X has a unique measure of maximal entropy .	Our values of beta_d decay polynomially ( like O ( d^ ( -17 ) ) ) , and we prove that the sequence must decay at least polynomially ( like d^ ( -0.25+o ( 1 ) ) ) .	We also show some other desirable properties for such X , for instance that the topological entropy of X is computable and that the unique m.m.e .
1	The effect of muon pair production in hadronic Extensive Air Showers ( EAS ) is unlikely to be seen by next generation detectors .	Production of muon pairs by high-energy photons in electromagnetic and hadronic showers in atmosphere has been calculated .	Applications of muon pair production process in electromagnetic showers to the very high energy gamma-ray astronomy is discussed .	It is shown that , although this process dominates over conventional pion and kaon decay above a few TeV in photon-initiated showers and provides a distinctive signature of photon-induced event ( muon pair ) , it is practically impossible to discriminate such events statistically from the background of muon pairs produced in the hadronic EAS .	The rate of events is very low and requires detectors of a huge size .
3	Some vanishings arising from the torus action provide polynomial relations among GW-invarants and FJRW-invaraints which give an effective algorithm for the computation of those invariants .	This is a survey on the mixed spin P-fields ( MSP fields for short ) theory which provides a platform to understand the phase transition between Gromov-Witten theory of quintic CY 3-folds and Landau-Ginzburg theory of the corresponding quintic polynomials .	It discusses key ideas that lead to the definition of MSP fields and how moduli of stable maps to the quintic and that of 5-spin curves appear in the moduli of MSP fields .	It also explains some properties of the moduli of MSP fields such as the cosection localisation , the properness of the degeneracy locus , and a torus action on the moduli..	Some examples of computations of genus 1 low degree of GW invariants are provided .
3	However , existing network inference methods for continuous , steady-state data are typically rooted in statistical formulations , which do not exploit chemical kinetics to guide inference .	Network inference approaches are widely used to shed light on regulatory interplay between molecular players such as genes and proteins .	Biochemical processes underlying networks of interest ( e.g.gene regulatory or protein signalling networks ) are generally nonlinear .	In many settings , knowledge is available concerning relevant chemical kinetics .	Herein , we present an approach to network inference for steady-state data that is rooted in non-linear descriptions of biochemical mechanism .
1	Here , for the first time , we propose and experimentally demonstrated bilayer structure to achieve simultaneously independent manipulation of multi-physics field ( dc electric fields and thermal ) by directly solving the dc electric/ thermal field equations .	Recently , increasing attention has been focused on the employment of transformation and metamaterial for manipulation of various physical fields , which requires complicated configuration and usually limits in single field .	This structure is composed of two layers : the outer layer is made of isotropic and homogeneous material , while the inner layer is fan-shape layer .	Since it is not based on TO , it can be readily experimentally fabricated with naturally occurring materials .	Experimentally , we has designed , fabricated and characterized two structures simultaneously behaving as dc electric cloak/ thermal concentrator and dc electric concentrator/ thermal cloak , respectively .
0	This paper studies multi-armed bandit algorithms for queueing systems where system parameters , such as service rates , may be unknown .	This is a fundamental issue in many queueing systems , including crowdsourcing systems and wireless networks .	We consider a system with multiple queues and servers , where the servers have queue-dependent , but unknown , service rates .	At each time , a matching must be chosen between queues and servers .	We focus on the goal of keeping the queue sizes small , and in particular aim to design algorithms that minimize queue-regret : the ( expected ) difference between the queue-lengths obtained by the algorithm , and those obtained by a `` genie '' -aided matching algorithm that knows exact server statistics .
0	A generalization of Buttiker 's voltage probe concept for nonzero temperatures is an open third terminal of a quantum thermoelectric circuit .	An explicit analytic expression for the thermoelectric correction to an ideal quantum voltage measurement is derived , and interpreted in terms of local Peltier cooling/heating within the nonequilibrium system .	The thermoelectric correction is found to be large ( up to +-24 % of the peak voltage ) in a prototypical ballistic quantum conductor ( graphene nanoribbon ) .	The effects of measurement non-ideality are also investigated .	Our findings have important implications for precision local electrical measurements .
2	During the short-time dissipative dynamics , the system is driven into a particular finite-momentum phonon mode , which in real space corresponds to an ordered structure with non-local density-density correlations .	We propose a technique for engineering momentum-dependent dissipation in Bose-Einstein condensates with non-local interactions .	The scheme relies on the use of momentum-dependent dark-states in close analogy to velocity-selective coherent population trapping .	Dissipation-induced ordering can be observed and studied in present-day experiments using cold atoms with dipole-dipole or off-resonant Rydberg interactions .	Due to its dissipative nature , the ordering does not require artificial breaking of translational symmetry by an opticallattice or harmonic trap .
2	On the other hand , it is also widely known that transverse momentum distributions in general follow a power-like Tsallis distribution , rather than an exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs , with a ( generally energy dependent ) nonextensivity parameter q .	It has been noticed recently that transverse momenta ( p_T ) distributions observed in high energy production processes exhibit remarkably universal scaling behaviour .	This is the case when a suitable variable replaces the usual p_T .	Here we show that it is possible to choose a suitable variable such that all the data can be fitted by the same Tsallis distribution ( with the same , energy independent value of the q-parameter ) .	Thus they exhibit q-scaling .
3	We describe the associated Bethe algebra $ B^q ( K_T ( T^*F_\lambda ) ) $ by generators and relations in terms of a discrete Wronski map .	We consider the cotangent bundle $ T^*F_\lambda $ of a $ GL_n $ partial flag variety , $ \lambda= ( \lambda_1 , ... , \lambda_N ) $ , $ |\lambda|=\sum_i\lambda_i=n $ , and the torus $ T= ( \C^\times ) ^ { n+1 } $ equivariant K-theory algebra $ K_T ( T^*F_\lambda ) $ .	We introduce K-theoretic stable envelope maps $ \Stab_ { \sigma } : \oplus_ { |\lambda|=n } K_T ( ( T^*F_\lambda ) ^T ) \to\oplus_ { |\lambda|=n } K_T ( T^*F_\lambda ) $ , where $ \sigma\in S_n $ .	Using these maps we define a quantum loop algebra action on $ \oplus_ { |\lambda|=n } K_T ( T^*F_\lambda ) $ .	We prove that the limiting Bethe algebra $ B^q ( K_T ( T^*F_\lambda ) ) $ , called the Gelfand-Zetlin algebra , coincides with the algebra of multiplication operators of the algebra $ K_T ( T^*F_\lambda ) $ .
4	As a concrete example , we consider a different initial expansion rate along one direction , and the following isotropization which takes place during inflation .	Most of the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background relies on the assumption of statistical isotropy .	However , given some recent evidence pointing against isotropy , as for instance the observed alignment of different multipoles on large scales , it is worth testing this assumption against the increasing amount of available data .	As a pivot model , we assume that the spectrum of the primordial perturbations depends also on their directionality ( rather than just on the magnitude of their momentum , as in the standard case ) .	We explicitly compute the correlation matrix for the temperature anisotropies in the simpler case in which there is a residual isotropy between two spatial directions .
2	This paper describes the automated calibration and reduction scheme used to process the archive data with particular emphasis on `jiggle-map ' observations of compact sources .	The Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array ( SCUBA ) instrument has been operating on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope ( JCMT ) since 1997 .	The data archive is now sufficiently large that it can be used to investigate instrumental properties and the variability of astronomical sources .	We demonstrate the validity of our automated approach at both 850- and 450-microns and apply it to several of the JCMT secondary flux calibrators .	We determine light curves for the variable sources IRC+10216 and OH231.8 .
0	Many Active Galactic Nuclei ( AGN ) are surrounded by gas which absorbs the radiation produced by accretion onto the central black hole and obscures the nucleus from direct view .	The dust component of the gas greatly enhances the effect of radiation pressure above that for Thomson scattering so that an AGN which is sub-Eddington for ionized gas in the usual sense can appear super-Eddington for cold dusty gas .	The radiation-pressure enhancement factor depends on the AGN spectrum but ranges between unity and about 500 , depending on the column density .	It means that an AGN for which the absorption is long-lived should have a column density N_H & gt ; 5x10^23 lambda cm^-2 , where lambda is its Eddington fraction L_bol/L_Edd , provided that N_H } & gt ; 5x10^21 cm^-2 .	We have compared the distribution of several samples of AGN - local , CDFS and Lockman Hole - with this expectation and find good agreement .
2	In this article we advance analytical and numerical investigations of this issue considering different classes of states living in a discrete and finite dimensional Hilbert space .	The trace distance ( TD ) possesses several of the good properties required for a faithful distance measure in the quantum state space .	Despite its importance and ubiquitous use in quantum information science , one of its questionable features , its possible non-monotonicity under taking tensor products of its arguments ( NMuTP ) , has been hitherto unexplored .	Our results reveal that although this property of TD does not shows up for pure states and for some particular classes of mixed states , it is present in a non-negligible fraction of the regarded density operators .	Hence , even though the percentage of quartets of states leading to the NMuTP drawback of TD and its strength decrease as the system 's dimension grows , this property of TD must be taken into account before using it as a figure of merit for distinguishing mixed quantum states .
3	Alternatively this apparent dearth may be simply a selection bias.Aims .	Context .	Observations of cataclysmic variables in globular clusters appear to show a dearth of outbursts compared to those observed in the field .	A number of explanations have been proposed , including low mass-transfer rates and/or moderate magnetic fields implying higher mass white dwarfs than the average observed in the field .	We examine multi-wavelength data of a new cataclysmic variable , CV1 , in the globular cluster M 22 to try to constrain its period and magnetic nature , with an aim at understanding whether globular cluster cataclysmic variables are intrinsically different from those observed in the field.Methods .
4	We give examples to show that several plausible weaker conditions do not suffice for the results above .	Let A be a unital simple direct limit of recursive subhomogeneous C*-algebras with no dimension growth .	We give criteria which specify exactly when A has real rank zero , and exactly when A has the Property ( SP ) : every nonzero hereditary subalgebra of A contains a nonzero projection .	Specifically , A has real rank zero if and only if the natural map from K_0 ( A ) to the continuous affine functions on the tracial state space has dense range , A has the Property ( SP ) if and only if the range of this map contains strictly positive functions with arbitrarily small norm .	By comparison with results for unital simple direct limit of homogeneous C*-algebras with no dimension growth , one might hope that weaker conditions might suffice .
2	All other theoretically-fast algorithms for sparse graphs have been shown to be significantly slower than the algorithm of Tomita et al .	We implement a new algorithm for listing all maximal cliques in sparse graphs due to Eppstein , L\ '' offler , and Strash ( ISAAC 2010 ) and analyze its performance on a large corpus of real-world graphs .	Our analysis shows that this algorithm is the first to offer a practical solution to listing all maximal cliques in large sparse graphs .	( Theoretical Computer Science , 2006 ) in practice .	However , the algorithm of Tomita et al .
3	They found that the blueshift of 2D band of misoriented graphene relative to that of single layer graphene shows a strong dependence on the excitation laser energy .	In a recent paper [ Phys.Rev .	B 78 , 113407 ( 2008 ) ] , Poncharal et al .	studied the Raman spectra of misoriented bilayer graphene .	The blueshift increases with decreasing excitation energy .
0	Let $ D\in\mathbb { N } $ , $ q\in [ 2 , \infty ) $ and $ ( \mathbb { R } ^D , |\cdot| , dx ) $ be the Euclidean space equipped with the $ D $ -dimensional Lebesgue measure .	In this article , via an auxiliary function space $ \mathrm { WE } ^ { 1 , \ , q } ( \mathbb R^D ) $ defined via wavelet expansions , the authors establish the Riesz transform characterization of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $ \dot { F } ^0_ { 1 , \ , q } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ .	As a consequence , the authors obtain the Fefferman-Stein decomposition of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $ \dot { F } ^0_ { \infty , \ , q ' } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ .	Finally , the authors give an explicit example to show that $ \dot { F } ^0_ { 1 , \ , q } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ is strictly contained in $ \mathrm { WE } ^ { 1 , \ , q } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ and , by duality , $ \mathrm { WE } ^ { \infty , \ , q ' } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ is strictly contained in $ \dot { F } ^0_ { \infty , \ , q ' } ( \mathbb { R } ^D ) $ .	Although all results when $ D=1 $ were obtained by C.-C. Lin et al .
4	A study of the relation of the obtained purity inequalities with the entanglement is presented .	We analyze a recently found inequality for eigenvalues of the density matrix and purity parameter describing either a bipartite system state or a single qudit state .	The Minkowski type trace inequality for the density matrices of the qudit states is rewritten in terms of the purities .	The properties of the obtained inequality are discussed .	The $ X $ -states of the two qubits and the single qudit are considered in detail .
3	Counterintuitively , mass media can induce cultural diversity when its intensity is above some threshold value .	We study the effect of mass media , modeled as an applied external field , on a social system based on Axelrod 's model for the dissemination of culture .	The numerical simulations show that the system undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition between an ordered phase ( homogeneous culture ) specified by the mass media and a disordered ( culturally fragmented ) one .	The critical boundary separating these phases is calculated on the parameter space of the system , given by the intensity of the mass media influence and the number of options per cultural attribute .	The nature of the phase transition changes from continuous to discontinuous at some critical value of the number of options .
4	This paper shows that the SRM problem can actually be solved in a convex and tractable fashion , by recasting the SRM problem as a semidefinite program ( SDP ) .	In recent years there has been growing interest in study of multi-antenna transmit designs for providing secure communication over the physical layer .	This paper considers the scenario of an intended multi-input single-output channel overheard by multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers .	Specifically , we address the transmit covariance optimization for secrecy-rate maximization ( SRM ) of that scenario .	The challenge of this problem is that it is a nonconvex optimization problem .
3	Simplified analytical models are frequently used for the description of MCs , and fit certain observational data well .	Magnetic clouds ( MCs ) are `` magnetized plasma clouds '' moving in the solar wind .	MCs transport magnetic flux and helicity away from the Sun .	These structures are not stationary but feature temporal evolution as they propagate in the solar wind .	The goal of the present study is to investigate numerically the validity of an analytical model which is widely used for the description of MCs , and to determine under which conditions this model 's implied assumptions cease to be valid .
4	Many other applications are obtained .	In this paper we prove two new cases of Langlands functoriality .	The first is a functorial product for cusp forms on $ GL_2\times GL_3 $ as automorphic forms on $ GL_6 $ , from which we obtain our second case , the long awaited functorial symmetric cube map for cusp forms on $ GL_2 $ .	We prove these by applying a recent version of converse theorems of Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro to analytic properties of certain $ L $ -functions obtained from the method of Eisenstein series ( Langlands-Shahidi method ) .	As a consequence , we prove the bound 5/34 for Hecke eigenvalues of Maass forms over any number field and at every place , finite or infinite , breaking the crucial bound 1/6 ( see below and Section 7 and 8 ) towards Ramanujan-Petersson and Selberg conjectures for $ GL_2 $ .
4	In the generalized Gross-Neveu model limit , we derive an analytic expression for this susceptibility .	We quantitatively analyze the meson mass inequality relations of two dimensional gauged four fermi models in the large N limit .	The class of models we study includes the 't Hooft model , the chiral and non-chiral Gross-Neveu models as special points in the space of field theories .	Cases where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously or explicitly broken are both studied .	We study the meson mass inequality quantitatively and define a susceptibility which allows us to systematically analyze the inequality .
1	It is shown to be a simultaneous transformation of the field and the `` time '' parameter explicitly used in the definition of path integrals central to the Lagrangian approach and in the definition of the `` time '' ordered products used in the Hamiltonian ( or canonical ) approach .	The scattering transformation developed by Mallat is put into the perspective of field theory .	This transformation preserves the form of the S-matrix as `` time '' ordered products .	The transformed `` time '' coordinate is the inverse `` time '' scale .	This is traditionally the UV cutoff or renormalization parameter in standard approaches to renormalization .
1	We find the canonical su ( 2|2 ) ^2 invariant S-matrix satisfying the standard Yang-Baxter and crossing symmetry equations .	We discuss the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra for the superstring sigma-model on AdS_5 x S^5 .	Its near-plane-wave expansion matches exactly the leading order term recently obtained by the direct perturbative computation .	We also show that the S-matrix obtained by Beisert in the gauge theory framework does not satisfy the standard Yang-Baxter equation , and , as a consequence , the corresponding ZF algebra is twisted .	The S-matrices in gauge and string theories however are physically equivalent and related by a non-local transformation of the basis states which is explicitly constructed .
4	Subsequently , we extract and find their needs , high-level requirements , and architectural structures which lead to important design decisions and thus influence their quality attributes .	Software architecture is defined as the process of a well-structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements , as well as improving the quality attributes of the system such as readability , Reliability , maintainability , and performance .	It involves a series of design decisions that can have a considerable impact on the systems quality attributes , and on the overall success of the application .	In this work , we start with analysis and investigation of two open source software ( OSS ) platforms DMARF and GIPSY , predominantly implemented in Java .	Many research papers have been studied in order to gain more insights and clear background about their architectures , enhancement , evolution , challenges , and features .
0	A method is presented for optically preparing WS2 monolayers to luminesce from only the charged exciton ( trion ) state -- completely suppressing the neutral exciton .	When isolating the trion state , we observed changes in the Raman A1g intensity and an enhanced feature on the low energy side of the E12g peak .	Photoluminescence and optical reflectivity measurements confirm the existence of the prepared trion state .	This technique also prepares intermediate regimes with controlled luminescence amplitudes of the neutral and charged exciton .	This effect is reversible by exposing the sample to air , indicating the change is mitigated by surface interactions with the ambient environment .
4	To this end , there has been continuous search for alternative plasmonic materials that are , unlike gold , the current metal of choice in plasmonics , compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology .	Plasmonics has established itself as a branch of physics which promises to revolutionize data processing , improve photovoltaics , increase sensitivity of bio-detection .	A widespread use of plasmonic devices is notably hindered ( in addition to high losses ) by the absence of stable and inexpensive metal films suitable for plasmonic applications .	This may seem surprising given the number of metal compounds to choose from .	Unfortunately , most of them either exhibit a strong damping of surface plasmons or easily oxidize and corrode .
3	These equations form the basis for future systematic tests of alternative gravity theories .	The motion of test bodies in gravity is tightly linked to the conservation laws .	This well-known fact in the context of General Relativity is also valid for gravitational theories which go beyond Einstein 's theory .	Here we derive the equations of motion for test bodies for a very large class of gravitational theories with a general nonminimal coupling to matter .	Our treatment is covariant and generalizes the classic Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon result for spinning ( extended ) test bodies .
4	This suggests that in these systems a major merger did occur , but at least several Gyr ago .	We present results of an HI study of a complete sample of nearby radio galaxies .	Our goal is to investigate whether merger or interaction events could be at the origin of the radio-AGN activity .	Around five of our radio galaxies , hosted mainly by early-type galaxies , we detect extended HI in emission .	In most cases this HI is distributed in large ( up to 190 kpc ) and massive ( up to M ( HI ) ~ 10^10 M ( sun ) ) disk- or ring-like structures , that show fairly regular rotation around the host galaxy .
2	It is found that when heavily squashed , the DWNT will become an insulator-coated metallic wire , and the conductance near the Fermi level has been significantly changed by the radial squash .	The electronic and transport property of a radially deformed double-walled carbon nanotube ( DWNT ) intramolecular junction ( IMJ ) has been studied by the tight-binding ( TB ) model combined with the first-principle calculations .	The geometrical structures of the DWNT IMJ have been first optimized in energy by the universal force field ( UFF ) method .	Specially , several resonance conductance peaks appear at some energies in the conduction band of the squashed DWNT IMJ .	Finally , we have also investigated the conductance variation due to change of the length of the central semiconductor in the squashed DWNT IMJ .
1	No direct cosmological observables are normally traceable to this period of reheating .	Reheating is a transition era after the end of inflation , during which the inflaton is converted into the particles that populate the Universe at later times .	Indirect bounds can however be derived .	One possibility is to consider cosmological evolution for observable CMB scales from the time of Hubble crossing to the present time .	Depending upon the model , the duration and final temperature after reheating , as well as its equation of state , may be directly linked to inflationary observables .
3	We find that our z~4 $ ( g'-dropout ) sample suffers from both unreliability and incompleteness but present 7 previously unidentified QSOs at 3.50 & lt ; z & lt ; 3.89 .	We use a simple optical/infrared ( IR ) photometric selection of high-redshift QSOs that identifies a Lyman Break in the optical photometry and requires a red IR color to distinguish QSOs from common interlopers .	The search yields 100 z~3 ( U-dropout ) QSO candidates with 19 & lt ; r ' & lt ; 22 over 11.7 deg^2 in the ELAIS-N1 ( EN1 ) and ELAIS-N2 ( EN2 ) fields of the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic ( SWIRE ) Legacy Survey .	The z~3 selection is reliable , with spectroscopic follow-up of 10 candidates confirming they are all QSOs at 2.83 & lt ; z & lt ; 3.44 .	Detailed simulations show our z~3 completeness to be ~80-90 % from 3.0 & lt ; z & lt ; 3.5 , significantly better than the ~30-80 % completeness of the SDSS at these redshifts .
2	Some ratio-behaviours would also be dealt with in the light of the same approaches .	We would attempt here to understand some properties of the transverse momentum ( $ p_T $ ) and rapidity ( $ y $ ) spectra on production of deuteron ( $ d $ ) and antideuteron ( $ \overline { d } $ ) in lead-lead $ ( Pb+Pb ) $ collisions at 158A GeV recently reported by NA49 collaboration .	Starting from some basic properties of $ p+p $ reactions for production of secondary proton-antiprotons the cases of production of the composite set of particles , like $ d $ and $ \overline { d } $ , would be analysed .	It is found that the combination of the models put into use here capture modestly well the trends of the data on some important observables .	Some limitations of the approach would also be pointed out in the end .
1	We develop a bootstrap assisted test based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov type statistic , which tracks the deviation of the time varying spectral density from its best stationary approximation .	In this paper we propose a nonparametric procedure for validating the assumption of stationarity in multivariate locally stationary time series models .	In contrast to all other nonparametric approaches , which have been proposed in the literature so far , the test statistic does not depend on any regularization parameters like smoothing bandwidths or a window length , which is usually required in a segmentation of the data .	We additionally show how our new procedure can be used to identify the components where non-stationarities occur and indicate possible extensions of this innovative approach .	We conclude with an extensive simulation study , which shows finite sample properties of the new method and contains a comparison with existing approaches .
3	Our variational calculation shows that the molecular , deuteron-like state structure changes rather abruptly , as the separation between the two mesons decreases , at a separation of about 0.45 fm , into a four-quark bound state , although one maintaining an internal structure rather than that of a four-quark bag .	Using the LAMP model for nuclear quark structure , we calculate the binding energy and quark structure of a $ B $ meson merging with a $ D $ meson .	The larger-than-nucleon masses of the two heavy quarks allow for a more reliable application of the Born-Oppenheimer-like approximation of the LAMP .	With the absence of quark-level Pauli Exclusion Principle repulsive effects , the appearance of a bound state is unsurprising .	Unlike the deuteron , pion exchange does not provide any contribution to the $ \approx 150 $ MeV binding .
3	The critical point is found to be located at \begin { equation } a_c^+ = \cases { 1.779 \pm 0.003 , & amp ; \hbox { in the square lattice } ; \\ 1.306 \pm 0.007 , & amp ; \hbox { in the cubic lattice } . }	Linear polymers adsorbing on a wall can be modelled by half-space self-avoiding walks adsorbing on a line in the square lattice , or on a surface in the cubic lattice .	In this paper a numerical approach based on the GAS algorithm is used to approximately enumerate states in the partition function of this model .	The data are used to approximate the free energy in the model , from which estimates of the location of the critical point and crossover exponents are made .	\end { equation } These results are then used to estimate the crossover exponent $ \phi $ associated with the adsorption transition , giving \begin { equation } \phi = \cases { 0.496 \pm 0.009 , & amp ; \hbox { in two dimensions } ; \\ 0.505 \pm 0.006 , & amp ; \hbox { in three dimensions } . }
4	The wave energy fluxes are highly sensitive to the form of the height dependence of the radiative damping time .	Modelling of adiabatic gravity wave propagation in the solar atmosphere showed that mode conversion to field guided acoustic waves or Alfv\'en waves was possible in the presence of highly inclined magnetic fields .	This work aims to extend the previous adiabatic study , exploring the consequences of radiative damping on the propagation and mode conversion of gravity waves in the solar atmosphere .	We model gravity waves in a VAL-C atmosphere , subject to a uniform , and arbitrarily orientated magnetic field , using the Newton cooling approximation for radiatively damped propagation .	The results indicate that the mode conversion pathways identified in the adiabatic study are maintained in the presence of damping .
1	The study also includes a high luminosity e+e- collider operating in the centre-of-mass energy range of 90-350 GeV as a possible intermediate step , the FCC-ee .	The FCC ( Future Circular Collider ) study represents a vision for the next large project in high energy physics , comprising an 80-100 km tunnel that can house a future 100 TeV hadron collider .	The FCC-ee aims at definitive electro-weak precision measurements of the Z , W , H and top particles , and search for rare phenomena .	Although FCC-ee is based on known technology , the goal performance in luminosity and energy calibration make it quite challenging .	During 2014 the study went through an exploration phase .
3	A save-then-transmit ( ST ) protocol is introduced , in which a fraction of time { \rho } ( dubbed the save-ratio ) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting , with the remaining fraction 1 - { \rho } used for data transmission .	In this paper , the design of a wireless communication device relying exclusively on energy harvesting is considered .	Due to the inability of rechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time , a constraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint , two rechargeable energy storage devices ( ESDs ) are assumed so that at any given time , there is always one ESD being recharged .	The energy harvesting rate is assumed to be a random variable that is constant over the time interval of interest .	The ratio of the energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the energy storage efficiency , { \eta } .
1	WHFast is significantly faster and conserves energy better than all other Wisdom-Holman integrators tested .	We present WHFast , a fast and accurate implementation of a Wisdom-Holman symplectic integrator for long-term orbit integrations of planetary systems .	We achieve this by significantly improving the Kepler-solver and ensuring numerical stability of coordinate transformations to and from Jacobi coordinates .	These refinements allow us to remove the linear secular trend in the energy error that is present in other implementations .	For small enough timesteps we achieve Brouwer 's law , i.e.the energy error is dominated by an unbiased random walk due to floating-point round-off errors .
4	Electric field fluctuations on the scale of the electron gyro-diameter were found to be of finite amplitude in the shock ramp , which requires that the electron trajectories be more random and chaotic than orderly and adiabatic .	Seventy crossings of the Earths bow shock by the THEMIS satellites have been used to study thermal electron heating in collisionless , quasi-perpendicular shocks .	It was found that the temperature increase of thermal electrons differed from the magnetic field increase by factors as great as three , that the parallel electron temperature increase was not produced by parallel electric fields , and that the parallel and perpendicular electron temperature increases were the same on the average .	It was also found that the perpendicular and parallel electron heating occurred simultaneously so that the isotropization time is the same as the heating time .	These results can not be explained by energy transfer from waves to electrons or by the motion of magnetized electrons through the shock .
1	Allowing more obtrusive advertising can increase the effectiveness of ads , so the platform can elicit more short-term revenue from advertisers , but the nuisance to viewers can decrease their engagement over time , which decreases the platform 's opportunity for future revenue .	A media platform 's policy on obtrusive ads mediates an effectiveness-nuisance tradeoff .	To optimize long-term revenue , a platform can use a combination of advertiser bids and ad impact on user experience to price and allocate ad space .	We study the conditions for advertisers , viewers , and the platform to simultaneously benefit from using ad impact on user experience as a criterion for ad selection and pricing .	It is important for advertisers to benefit , because media platforms compete with one another for advertisers .
4	Apparently proxies should have their own identity for security-related applications whereas other applications , in particular contract systems , require transparent proxies that compare equal to their target objects .	Proxies are the swiss army knives of object adaptation .	They introduce a level of indirection to intercept select operations on a target object and divert them as method calls to a handler .	Proxies have many uses like implementing access control , enforcing contracts , virtualizing resources .	One important question in the design of a proxy API is whether a proxy object should inherit the identity of its target .
3	Furthermore , we establish the absence of infinite sequences in a D-limit corresponding to the large complex structure limit of a two-parameter Calabi-Yau .	Ashok and Douglas have shown that infinite sequences of type IIB flux vacua with imaginary self-dual flux can only occur in so-called D-limits , corresponding to singular points in complex structure moduli space .	In this work we refine this no-go result by demonstrating that there are no infinite sequences accumulating to the large complex structure point of a certain class of one-parameter Calabi-Yau manifolds .	We perform a similar analysis for conifold points and for the decoupling limit , obtaining identical results .	In particular , our results demonstrate analytically that the series of vacua recently discovered by Ahlqvist et al. , seemingly accumulating to the large complex structure point , are finite .
1	This allows one to make less measurements than what was considered necessary to record a signal , enabling faster or more precise measurement protocols in a wide range of applications .	Compressed sensing is a signal processing method that acquires data directly in a compressed form .	Using an interdisciplinary approach , we have recently proposed in [ arXiv:1109.4424 ] a strategy that allows compressed sensing to be performed at acquisition rates approaching to the theoretical optimal limits .	In this paper , we give a more thorough presentation of our approach , and introduce many new results .	We present the probabilistic approach to reconstruction and discuss its optimality and robustness .
2	Expressions for all necessary thermodynamic variables as a function of the model parameters are derived in closed form .	In this paper we study the unfolding transition observed in polymer stretching experiments .	We use a known model and extend it with a mean-field-like interaction .	To obtain the exact force-extension relation at constant temperature , we invert these relations numerically .	Below a critical temperature the model exhibits a sharp first order phase transition .
4	While we restrict ourselves to linear order in perturbation theory , the approach can be straightforwardly generalized to higher order .	We review recent studies that rigorously define several key observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe in a general relativistic context .	Specifically , we consider i ) redshift perturbation of cosmic clock events ; ii ) distortion of cosmic rulers , including weak lensing shear and magnification ; iii ) observed number density of tracers of the large-scale structure .	We provide covariant and gauge-invariant expressions of these observables .	Our expressions are given for a linearly perturbed flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric including scalar , vector , and tensor metric perturbations .
2	At the moment , the best candidate for such an equation is the modified non-linear Schroedinger equation .	Fullerenes and nanotubes consist of a large number of carbon atoms sitting on the sites of a regular lattice .	For pratical reasons it is often useful to approximate the equations on this lattice in terms of the continuous equation .	In this paper , we study the modified non-linear Schroedinger equation , which arises as continuous equation in a system describing an excitation on a hexagonal lattice .	This latter system can e.g.describe electron-phonon interaction on fullerene related structures such as the buckminster fullerene and nanotubes .
4	This system opens new possibilities for investigating quantum scattering , provides a new testing ground for classical and quantum chaos and enables to revisit the quantum-classical correspondence .	We study an experimental setup in which a quantum probe , provided by a quasi-monomode guided atom laser , interacts with a static localized attractive potential whose characteristic parameters are tunable .	In this system , classical mechanics predicts a transition from a regular to a chaotic behavior as a result of the coupling between the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom .	Our experimental results display a clear signature of this transition .	On the basis of extensive numerical simulations , we discuss the quantum versus classical physics predictions in this context .
2	Pionic properties are investigated using this lagrangian , and the formal equivalence to the equal-time formulation is demonstrated .	The NJL model is formulated on the light cone .	Using the 1/N expansion to solve the fermionic constraint , an effective 4-fermi lagrangian is derived .	Two regularization schemes in terms of light-cone variables are discussed : An extension of the 'invariant mass cut-off scheme ' , and a transverse momentum cut-off scheme .	It is shown that the first one is equivalent to the covariant 3-momentum cut-off ( dispersion cut-off ) scheme in the equal-time formulation .
1	The dihedral group D_n is shown to be generated by a RGSPP and a LGSPP ( this is observed to be true in S_3 ) but the geometric interpretations of a RGSPP and a LGSPP are found not to be rotation and reflection respectively .	The idea of left ( right ) palindromic permutations ( LPPs , RPPs ) and left ( right ) generalized Smarandache palindromic permutations ( LGSPPs , RGSPPs ) are introduced in symmetric groups S_n of degree n. It is shown that in S_n , there exist a LPP and a RPP and they are unique ( this fact is demonstrated using S_2 and S_3 ) .	In S_3 , each permutation is at least a RGSPP or a LGSPP .	There are 4 RGSPPs and 4 LGSPPs in S_3 , while 2 permutations are both RGSPPs and LGSPPs .	A permutation in S_n is shown to be a LPP or RPP ( LGSPP or RGSPP ) if and only if its inverse is a LPP or RPP ( LGSPP or RGSPP ) respectively .
3	We find that the sources with the cutoff located at lower frequency are indeed sited in the RBL region of the $ \alpha_ { ro } -\alpha_ { ox } $ plane , while those with the cutoff located at higher frequency are distributed in the XBL region .	We investigate quantitatively how the peak emission frequency of the overall energy spectrum is at work in distinguishing RBL-like and XBL-like objects .	We employ the sample of Giommi et al .	( 1995 ) to study the distribution of BL Lacertae objects with various locations of the cutoff of the overall energy spectrum .	For a more quantitative study , we employ the BL Lacertae samples presented by Sambruna et al .
0	The spectroscopic properties of an open large Bunimovich cavity are studied numerically in the framework of the effective Hamiltonian formalism .	The cavity is opened by attaching leads to it in four different ways .	In some cases , short-lived and long-lived resonance states coexist .	The short-lived states cause traveling waves in the transmission while the long-lived ones generate superposed fluctuations .	The traveling waves oscillate as a function of energy .
3	The globular cluster system has about 2000 members , so it is not as rich as those of giant ellipticals in galaxy clusters with a comparable stellar mass , but richer than many cluster systems of other isolated ellipticals .	We investigate the globular cluster system of the isolated elliptical NGC 7796 , present new photometry of the galaxy , and use published kinematical data to constrain the dark matter content .	Deep images in B and R , obtained with the VIsible MultiObject Spectrograph ( VIMOS ) at the VLT , form the data base .	We present isotropic and anisotropic Jeans-models and give a morphological description of the companion dwarf galaxy .	The colour distribution of GCs is bimodal , which does not necessarily mean a metallicity bimodality .
0	We report on the structural , thermodynamic and transport properties of high-quality single crystals of YbNiSi3 grown by the flux method .	This compound crystallizes in the SmNiGe3 layered structure type of the Cmmm space group .	The general physical behavior is that of a Kondo lattice showing an antiferromagnetic ground state below T_N = 5.1 K. This is among the highest ordering temperatures for a Yb-based intermetallic , indicating strong exchange interaction between the Yb ions , which are close to +3 valency based on the effective moment of 4.45 mu_B/f.u .	The compound has moderately heavy-electron behavior with Sommerfeld coefficient 190 mJ/mol K^2 .	Resistivity is highly anisotropic and exhibits the signature logarithmic increase below a local minimum , followed by a sharp decrease in the coherent/magnetically ordered state , resulting in residual resistivity of 1.5 micro Ohm cm and RRR = 40 .
4	The advantage of this approach is in its ability to compute accurately all variables of interest , including the electric field , for any value of the power in the power law current-voltage relation characterizing the superconducting material .	Thin film magnetization problems in type-II superconductivity are usually formulated in terms of the magnetization function alone , which allows one to compute the sheet current density and the magnetic field but often inhibits computing the electric field in the film .	Accounting for the current leads presents an additional difficulty encountered in thin film transport current problems .	We generalize , to the presence of a transport current , the two-variable variational formulation proposed recently for thin film magnetization problems .	The formulation , written in terms of the magnetization function and the electric field , is used as a basis for a new numerical approximation enabling us to solve the magnetization and transport current problems for flat films of arbitrary shapes , including multiply connected films .
1	In order to put constraints on their bispectra , a logical first step is to put these into factorized form which can be achieved via the recently proposed method of polynomial basis expansion on the tetrahedral domain .	We consider the presence of oscillations in the primordial bispectrum , inspired by three different cosmological models ; features in the primordial potential , resonant type non-Gaussianities and de- viation from the standard Bunch Davies vacuum .	We investigate the viability of such an expansion for the oscillatory bispectra and find that one needs an increasing number of or- thonormal mode functions to achieve significant correlation between the expansion and the original spectrum as a function of their frequency .	To reduce the number of modes required , we propose a basis consisting of Fourier functions orthonormalized on the tetrahedral domain .	We show that the use of Fourier mode functions instead of polynomial mode functions can lead to the necessary factorizability with the use of only 1/5 of the total number of modes required to reconstruct the bispectra with polynomial mode functions .
4	Computational complexity problems , ways of improving this approach and methods for implementing `` explaining away '' in other graphical frameworks are discussed .	This paper presents a Bayesian model for unsupervised learning of verb selectional preferences .	For each verb the model creates a Bayesian network whose architecture is determined by the lexical hierarchy of Wordnet and whose parameters are estimated from a list of verb-object pairs found from a corpus .	`` Explaining away '' , a well-known property of Bayesian networks , helps the model deal in a natural fashion with word sense ambiguity in the training data .	On a word sense disambiguation test our model performed better than other state of the art systems for unsupervised learning of selectional preferences .
4	The construction of the relative Burroni fibrations and free T-categories in this context , allow us to extend the definition of the set of opetopes given by T. Leinster to the category of opetopic sets ( internally to any Grothendieck topos , if needed ) .	We introduce the notion of a lax monoidal fibration and we show how it can be conveniently used to deal with various algebraic structures that play an important role in some definitions of the opetopic sets ( Baez-Dolan , Hermida-Makkai-Power ) .	We present the 'standard ' such structures , the exponential fibrations of basic fibrations and three areas of applications .	First area is related to the T-categories of A. Burroni .	The monoids in the Burroni lax monoidal fibrations form the fibration of T-categories .
4	Because the excited , outflowing OH gas in Mrk 231 is associated with the warm , far-IR continuum source , it is likely more compact ( diameter of 200-300 pc ) than that probed by CO and HCN .	We report on the Herschel/PACS observations of OH in Mrk 231 , with detections in 9 doublets observed within the PACS range , and present radiative transfer models for the outflowing OH .	Signatures of outflowing gas are found in up to 6 OH doublets with different excitation requirements .	At least two outflowing components are identified , one with OH radiatively excited , and the other with low excitation , presumably spatially extended .	Particularly prominent , the blue wing of the absorption detected in the in-ladder 2Pi_ { 3/2 } J=9/2-7/2 OH doublet at 65 um , with E_lower=290 K , indicates that the excited outflowing gas is generated in a compact and warm ( circum ) nuclear region .
3	We find that the WMAP and 2dF data alone can not rule out the evidence from neutrinoless double beta decay reported by the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment .	We have performed a thorough analysis of the constraints which can be put on neutrino parameters from cosmological observations , most notably those from the WMAP satellite and the 2dF galaxy survey .	For this data we find an upper limit on the sum of active neutrino mass eigenstates of \sum m_nu & lt ; 1.0 eV ( 95 % conf .	) , but this limit is dependent on priors .	In terms of the relativistic energy density in neutrinos or other weakly interacting species we find , in units of the equivalent number of neutrino species , N_nu , that N_nu = 4.0+3.0-2.1 ( 95 % conf . ) .
2	We use a version of the Ramses code that includes radiative transfer of UV photons , and we employ a refinement strategy that allows us to resolve accretion streams in their natural environment to an unprecedented level .	{ Abridged } We investigate the observability of cold accretion streams at redshift 3 via Lyman-alpha ( Lya ) emission and the feasibility of cold accretion as the main driver of Lya blobs ( LABs ) .	We run cosmological zoom simulations focusing on 3 halos spanning two orders of magnitude in mass , roughly from 10^11 to 10^13 solar masses .	For the first time , we self-consistently model self-shielding in the cold streams from the cosmological UV background , which enables us to predict their temperatures , ionization states and Lya luminosities with improved accuracy .	We find the efficiency of gravitational heating in cold streams in a ~10^11 solar mass halo is around 10-20 % throughout most of the halo but reaching much higher values close to the center .
3	The derived Ne abundances span approximately an order of magnitude , up to values of ~3 times solar .	We present spectroscopy of MIR emission lines in twelve starburst regions , located in eleven starburst galaxies , for which a significant number of lines between 2.38 and 45micron were observed with the ISO Short Wavelength Spectrometer , with the intention of providing a reference resource for MIR spectra of starburst galaxies .	The observation apertures were centred on actively star forming regions , including those which are inaccessible at optical wavelengths due to high levels of obscuration .	We use this data set , which includes fine structure and hydrogen recombination lines , to investigate excitation and to derive gas phase abundances of neon , argon , and sulphur of the starburst galaxies .	The excitation ratios measured from the Ne and Ar lines correlate well with each other ( positively ) and with abundances ( negatively ) .
1	We explore how nuclear weak charge measurements in atomic parity violation ( APV ) experiments can be used to constrain $ Z ' $ bosons .	The discovery of a new neutral gauge boson , $ Z ' $ , could provide the first concrete evidence of physics beyond the standard model .	We use the recent measurement of the $ ^ { 133 } $ Cs nuclear weak charge to estimate lower bounds on the mass of $ Z ' $ bosons for a number of representative models and to put constraints on the couplings of a newly discovered $ Z ' $ boson .	We also consider how these constraints might be improved by future APV experiments that will measure nuclear weak charges of multiple isotopes .	We show how measurements of a single isotope , and combining measurements into ratios and differences , can be used to constrain the couplings of a $ Z ' $ and discriminate between models .
3	This paper is part of a package submitted in conjunction with Planck 's Early Release Compact Source Catalogue , the first data product based on Planck to be released publicly .	The European Space Agency 's Planck satellite was launched on 14 May 2009 , and has been surveying the sky stably and continuously since 13 August 2009 .	Its performance is well in line with expectations , and it will continue to gather scientific data until the end of its cryogenic lifetime .	We give an overview of the history of Planck in its first year of operations , and describe some of the key performance aspects of the satellite .	The package describes the scientific performance of the Planck payload , and presents results on a variety of astrophysical topics related to the sources included in the Catalogue , as well as selected topics on diffuse emission .
3	The SP spectral function , A ( q , omega ) , is worked out from the one-particle Matsubara Green 's function .	The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in 2D dipolar systems has been studied recently by path integral Monte Carlo ( PIMC ) simulations [ A. Filinov et al. , PRL 105 , 070401 ( 2010 ) ] .	Here , we complement this analysis and study temperature-coupling strength dependence of the density ( particle-hole ) and single-particle ( SP ) excitation spectra both in superfluid and normal phases .	The dynamic structure factor , S ( q , omega ) , of the longitudinal excitations is rigorously reconstructed with full information on damping .	A stochastic optimization method is applied for reconstruction from imaginary times .
2	The Thomas -- Fermi approximation in combination with assumed nucleon distribution functions and a free energy minimization is adopted to describe the non-uniform matter , which is composed of a lattice of heavy nuclei .	We construct the equation of state ( EOS ) of dense matter covering a wide range of temperature , proton fraction , and density for the use of core-collapse supernova simulations .	The study is based on the relativistic mean-field ( RMF ) theory , which can provide an excellent description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .	We treat the uniform matter and non-uniform matter consistently using the same RMF theory .	We present two sets of EOS tables , namely EOS2 and EOS3 .
4	A large class of perfect QST models with a certain spectrum structure are discovered to support our analytical results .	We study the quantum state transfer ( QST ) of a class of tight-bonding Bloch electron systems with mirror symmetry by considering the mode entanglement .	Some rigorous results are obtained to reveal the intrinsic relationship between the fidelity of QST and the mirror mode concurrence ( MMC ) , which is defined to measure the mode entanglement with a certain spatial symmetry and is just the overlap of a proper wave function with its mirror image .	A complementarity is discovered as the maximum fidelity is accompanied by a minimum of MMC .	And at the instant , which is just half of the characteristic time required to accomplish a perfect QST , the MMC can reach its maximum value one .
1	It turns out that this product is multiplicity free for the symplectic and general unitary groups , but not for the general linear groups .	We compute the irreducible constitutents of the product of the Weil character and the Steinberg character in those finite classical groups for which a Weil character is defined , namely the symplectic , unitary and general linear groups .	As an application we show that the restriction of the Steinberg character of such a group to the subgroup stabilizing a vector in the natural module is multiplicity free .	The proof of this result for the unitary groups uses an observation of Brunat , published as an appendix to our paper .	As our `` Weil character '' for the symplectic groups in even characteristic we use the 2-modular Brauer character of the generalized spinor representation .
1	The measured change in absorbance is consistent with standard spectrometer measurements .	We have developed a white light interferometric microscope ( WLIM ) , which can spatially resolve the change in the complex index of refraction and apply it to study reversible photodegradation of 1,4-Diamino-9,10-anthraquinone doped into ( poly ) methyl methacrylate .	The refractive index of a pristine sample measured with the WLIM is also found to be consistent with the spectrum found by independent means ( F. Yakuphanoglu and B. Senkal , Electrical conductivity , photoconductivity , and optical properties of poly ( 1,4 diaminoanthraquinone ) organic semiconductor for optoelectronic applications , Polym.Adv.Technol .	19 , 1193 to 1198 ( 2008 ) ) .	We report on measurements of the change in refractive index due to photodegradation , which is found to be consistent with Embaye 's two population model ( N. Embaye et al. , Mechanisms of reversible photodegradation in disperse orange 11 dye doped in PMMA polymer , J. Chem.Phys .
0	We study the structural constraint of random scale-free networks that determines possible combinations of the degree exponent $ \gamma $ and the upper cutoff $ k_c $ in the thermodynamic limit .	We employ the framework of graphicality transitions proposed by [ Del Genio and co-workers , Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 107 } , 178701 ( 2011 ) ] , while making it more rigorous and applicable to general values of kc .	Using the graphicality criterion , we show that the upper cutoff must be lower than $ k_c N^ { 1/\gamma } $ for $ \gamma & lt ; 2 $ , whereas any upper cutoff is allowed for $ \gamma & gt ; 2 $ .	This result is also numerically verified by both the random and deterministic sampling of degree sequences .
1	The inversion technique developed is applied to non-diagonal $ S^J_ { ll ' } $ for spin one projectiles , yielding a tensor interaction $ T_ { \rm R } $ , and is also applicable to spin-1/2 plus spin-1/2 scattering .	We present a practical $ S $ -matrix to potential inversion procedure for coupled-channel scattering .	The method is a generalization of the iterative-perturbative , IP , method .	It is tested and evaluated and we investigate the degree of uniqueness of the potential , particularly for cases where there is insufficient information to define the potential uniquely .	We examine the potentials which result when the $ S $ -matrix is generated from a $ T_ { \rm P } $ interaction .
2	We find that there are two typical stages in the variation of the morphology with the increase of active force .	We simulate a two dimensional model of self-propelled particles confined by a deformable boundary .	The particles tend to accumulate near the boundary and the shape of the boundary deforms upon the collisions .	One is at small force characterized by radially inhomogeneous redistribution of particles and suppression of local fluctuations of the boundary .	The other is at large force featured by angularly redistribution of particles and global shape deformation of the boundary .
1	We analyzed the near-infrared photometric and structural properties of a sample of 20 BGGs present in FGs in order to better understand their formation mechanisms .	( Abridged ) Fossil systems are galaxy associations dominated by a relatively isolated , bright elliptical galaxy , surrounded by a group of smaller galaxies lacking L* objects .	Their surface-brightness distribution was fitted to a Sersic profile using the GASP2D algorithm .	Then , the standard scaling relations were derived for the first time for these galaxies and compared with those of normal ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies in non-fossil systems .	The BGGs presented in this study represent a subset of the most massive galaxies in the Universe .
3	Experimentally thin films ( ~ 20 nm ) of ZrO2 : Fe at high doping concentration are grown by atomic layer deposition .	In this study we explore , both from theoretical and experimental side , the effect of Fe doping in ZrO2 ( ZrO2 : Fe ) .	By means of first principles simulation we study the magnetization density and the magnetic interaction between Fe atoms .	We also consider how this is affected by the presence of oxygen vacancies and compare our findings with models based on impurity band and carrier mediated magnetic interaction .	We provide experimental evidence that Fe is uniformly distributed in the ZrO2 by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray mapping , while X-ray diffraction evidences the presence of the fluorite crystal structure .
0	We measure the three components of velocity dispersion , $ \sigma_ { R } , \sigma_ { \theta } , \sigma_ { \phi } $ , for stars within 6 & lt ; R & lt ; 30 kpc of the Milky Way using a new radial velocity sample from the MMT telescope .	We combine our measurements with previously published data so that we can more finely sample the stellar halo .	We use a maximum likelihood statistical method for estimating mean velocities , dispersions , and covariances assuming only that velocities are normally distributed .	The alignment of the velocity ellipsoid is consistent with a spherically symmetric gravitational potential .	From the spherical Jeans equation , the mass of the Milky Way is M ( & lt ; 12 kpc ) = $ 1.3\times10^ { 11 } $ M $ _ { \odot } $ with an uncertainty of 40 % .
3	In this paper we study how the right preconditioned changes the Krylov subspaces where the CGLS iterates live , and draw a tighter connection between Bayesian inference and Krylov subspace methods .	The solution of linear inverse problems when the unknown parameters outnumber data requires addressing the problem of a nontrivial null space .	After restating the problem within the Bayesian framework , a priori information about the unknown can be utilized for determining the null space contribution to the solution .	More specifically , if the solution of the associated linear system is computed by the Conjugate Gradient for Least Squares ( CGLS ) method , the additional information can be encoded in the form of a right preconditioner .	The advantages of a Krylov-meet-Bayes approach to the solution of underdetermined linear inverse problems is illustrated with computed examples .
4	A comparison with the FSS functions of the 3D site-diluted EA model with Gaussian interactions at a site occupation of 62.5 % gives very strong evidence for the universality of the SG transition in the 3D EA model .	We study the three-dimensional ( 3D ) bond-diluted Edwards-Anderson ( EA ) model with binary interactions at a bond occupation of 45 % by Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulations .	Using an efficient cluster MC algorithm we are able to determine the universal finite-size scaling ( FSS ) functions and the critical exponents with high statistical accuracy .	We observe small corrections to scaling for the measured observables .	The critical quantities and the FSS functions indicate clearly that the bond-diluted model for dilutions above the critical dilution p* , at which a spin glass ( SG ) phase appears , lies in the same universality class as the 3D undiluted EA model with binary interactions .
0	Here we report the localizations and properties of four short-duration GRBs localized by the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 satellite ( HETE-2 ) : GRBs 010326B , 040802 , 051211 and 060121 , all of which were detected by the French Gamma Telescope ( Fregate ) and localized with the Wide-field X-ray Monitor ( WXM ) and/or Soft X-ray Camera ( SXC ) instruments .	We discuss eight possible criteria for determining whether these GRBs are `` short population bursts '' ( SPBs ) or `` long population bursts '' ( LPBs ) .	These criteria are ( 1 ) duration , ( 2 ) pulse widths , ( 3 ) spectral hardness , ( 4 ) spectral lag , ( 5 ) energy Egamma radiated in gamma rays ( or equivalently , the kinetic energy E_KE of the GRB jet ) , ( 6 ) existence of a long , soft bump following the burst , ( 7 ) location of the burst in the host galaxy , and ( 8 ) type of host galaxy .	In particular , we have developed a likelihood method for determining the probability that a burst is an SPB or a LPB on the basis of its T90 duration alone .	A striking feature of the resulting probability distribution is that the T90 duration at which a burst has an equal probability of being a SPB or a LPB is T90 = 5 s , not T90 = 2 s , as is often used .
4	The constraints on them are given by $ \lambda=2.933\pm0.012 $ and $ \ln ( 10^5M/M_p ) = -0.401^ { +0.457 } _ { -0.451 } $ at the $ 68\ % $ confidence level .	We propose the gravity 's rainbow scenario as a possible alternative of the inflation paradigm to account for the flatness and horizon problems .	We focus on studying the cosmological scalar perturbations which are seeded by the quantum fluctuations in the very early universe .	The scalar power spectrum is expected to be nearly scale-invariant .	We estimate the rainbow index $ \lambda $ and energy scale $ M $ in the gravity 's rainbow scenario by analyzing the Planck temperature and WMAP polarization datasets .
1	In J.Math.Phys .	Two quantities quantifying uncertainty relations are examined .	48 , 082103 ( 2007 ) , Busch and Pearson investigated the limitation on joint localizability and joint measurement of position and momentum by introducing overall width and error bar width .	In this paper , we show a simple relationship between these quantities for finite-dimensional systems .	Our result indicates that if there is a bound on joint localizability , it is possible to obtain a similar bound on joint measurability .
2	To minimize the number of uncompleted transmission tasks , we study laxity-based scheduling policies in this paper .	Many data applications in the next generation cellular networks , such as content precaching and video progressive downloading , require flow-level quality of service ( QoS ) guarantees .	One such requirement is deadline , where the transmission task needs to be completed before the application-specific time .	We propose a Less-Laxity-Higher-Possible-Rate ( L $ ^2 $ HPR ) policy and prove its asymptotic optimality in underloaded identical-deadline systems .	The asymptotic optimality of L $ ^2 $ HPR can be applied to estimate the schedulability of a system and provide insights on the design of scheduling policies for general systems .
3	We test our inversion method at z=3 through the following steps : [ i ] simulation of a sample of synthetic spectra for which P_Delta is known ; [ ii ] computation of P_F ; [ iii ] inversion of the Ly-alpha forest through the F-Delta relation .	We present a novel , fast method to recover the density field through the statistics of the transmitted flux in high redshift quasar absorption spectra .	The proposed technique requires the computation of the probability distribution function of the transmitted flux ( P_F ) in the Ly-alpha forest region and , as a sole assumption , the knowledge of the probability distribution function of the matter density field ( P_Delta ) .	We show that the probability density conservation of the flux and matter density unveils a flux-density ( F-Delta ) relation which can be used to invert the Ly-alpha forest without any assumption on the physical properties of the intergalactic medium .	Our technique , when applied to only 10 observed spectra characterized by a signal-to noise ratio S/N & gt ; = 100 provides an exquisite ( relative error epsilon_Delta & lt ; ~ 12 % in & gt ; ~ 50 % of the pixels ) reconstruction of the density field in & gt ; ~ 90 % of the line of sight .
2	A second is the diffuse extragalactic background due to distant and unresolved AGNs and GRBs , a key test of the nature of the highest-energy sources in the universe .	At high energies , the very steep decrease of the conventional atmospheric component of the neutrino spectrum should allow the emergence of even small and isotropic components of the total spectrum , indicative of new physics , provided that they are less steeply decreasing , as generically expected .	One candidate is the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux , a probe of cosmic ray composition in the region of the knee as well as small- $ x $ QCD , below the reach of collider experiments .	Separating these new physics components from the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux , as well as from each other , will be very challenging .	We show that the charged-current { \it electron } neutrino `` shower '' channel should be particularly effective for isolating the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux , and that it is more generally an important complement to the usually-considered charged-current { \it muon } neutrino `` track '' channel .
4	In this paper , we address these two questions .	The nascent field of compressed sensing is founded on the fact that high-dimensional signals with `` simple structure '' can be recovered accurately from just a small number of randomized samples .	Several specific kinds of structures have been explored in the literature , from sparsity and group sparsity to low-rankness .	However , two fundamental questions have been left unanswered , namely : What are the general abstract meanings of `` structure '' and `` simplicity '' ?	And do there exist universal algorithms for recovering such simple structured objects from fewer samples than their ambient dimension ?
4	For each 5-dimensional scenario considered , the requirement that observers be confined to the embedded spacetime places restrictions on the 4-geometry .	Stated succinctly , the original version of the Campbell-Magaard theorem says that it is always possible to locally embed any solution of 4-dimensional general relativity in a 5-dimensional Ricci-flat manifold .	We discuss the proof of this theorem ( and its variants ) in n dimensions , and its application to current theories that postulate that our universe is a 4-dimensional hypersurface Sigma_0 within a 5-dimensional manifold , such as Space-Time-Matter ( STM ) theory and the Randall & amp ; Sundrum ( RS ) braneworld scenario .	In particular , we determine whether or not arbitrary spacetimes may be embedded in such theories , and demonstrate how these seemingly disparate models are interconnected .	Special attention is given to the motion of test observers in 5 dimensions , and the circumstances under which they are confined to Sigma_0 .
3	We also find a correlation between the presence of massive outflows launched from the accretion disk and the stabilization of its oscillations .	The microquasar IGR J17091 , which is the recently discovered analogue of the well known source GRS 1915+105 , exhibits quasi-periodic outbursts , with a period of 5-70 seconds , and regular amplitudes , referred to as `` heartbeat state '' .	We argue that these states are plausibly explained by accretion disk instability , driven by the dominant radiation pressure .	Using our GLobal Accretion DIsk Simulation hydrodynamical code , we model these outbursts quantitatively .	We verify the theoretical predictions with the available timing and spectral observations .
4	Thus , numerical relativity is able to bridge the gap between fully non-linear dynamics and linearized approximations , which may have important applications .	Numerical relativity has seen incredible progress in the last years , and is being applied with success to a variety of physical phenomena , from gravitational-wave research and relativistic astrophysics to cosmology and high-energy physics .	Here we probe the limits of current numerical setups , by studying collisions of unequal mass , non-rotating black holes of mass-ratios up to 1:100 and making contact with a classical calculation in General Relativity : the infall of a point-like particle into a massive black hole .	Our results agree well with the predictions coming from linearized calculations of the infall of point-like particles into non-rotating black holes .	In particular , in the limit that one hole is much smaller than the other , and the infall starts from an infinite initial separation , we recover the point-particle limit .
4	The self-duality may still hold after we break one of the U ( 1 ) symmetries ( which makes the system a bosonic topological insulator ) , with some subtleties that will be discussed .	Inspired by the recent developments of constructing novel Dirac liquid boundary states of the $ 3d $ topological insulator , we propose one possible $ 2d $ boundary state of the $ 3d $ bosonic symmetry protected topological state with $ U ( 1 ) _e \rtimes Z_2^T \times U ( 1 ) _s $ symmetry .	This boundary theory is described by a $ ( 2+1 ) d $ quantum electrodynamics ( QED $ _3 $ ) with two flavors of Dirac fermions ( $ N_f = 2 $ ) coupled with a noncompact U ( 1 ) gauge field : $ \mathcal { L } = \sum_ { j = 1 } ^2 \bar { \psi } _j \gamma_\mu ( \partial_\mu - i a_\mu ) \psi_j - i A^ { s } _\mu \bar { \psi_i } \gamma_\mu \tau^z_ { ij } \psi_j + \frac { i } { 2\pi } \epsilon_ { \mu\nu\rho } a_\mu \partial_\nu A^ { e } _\rho $ , where $ a_\mu $ is the internal noncompact U ( 1 ) gauge field , $ A^s_\mu $ and $ A^e_\mu $ are two external gauge fields that couple to $ U ( 1 ) _s $ and $ U ( 1 ) _e $ global symmetries respectively .	We demonstrate that this theory has a `` self-dual '' structure , which is a fermionic analogue of the self-duality of the noncompact CP $ ^1 $ theory with easy plane anisotropy .	Under the self-duality , the boundary action takes exactly the same form except for an exchange between $ A^s_\mu $ and $ A^e_\mu $ .
0	Previously , we proposed a physically-inspired method to construct data points into an effective in-tree ( IT ) structure , in which the underlying cluster structure in the dataset is well revealed .	Although there are some edges in the IT structure requiring to be removed , such undesired edges are generally distinguishable from other edges and thus are easy to be determined .	For instance , when the IT structures for the 2-dimensional ( 2D ) datasets are graphically presented , those undesired edges can be easily spotted and interactively determined .	However , in practice , there are many datasets that do not lie in the 2D Euclidean space , thus their IT structures can not be graphically presented .	But if we can effectively map those IT structures into a visualized space in which the salient features of those undesired edges are preserved , then the undesired edges in the IT structures can still be visually determined in a visualization environment .
2	IDE is a read-only interface used to generate custom outputs based on the information contained in a Together model .	Together is the recommended software development tool in the Atlas collaboration .	The programmatic API , which provides the capability to use and augment Together 's internal functionality , is comprised of three major components - IDE , RWI and SCI .	RWI allows to both extract and write information to a Together model .	SCI is the Source Code Interface , as the name implies it allows to work at the level of the source code .
0	We show that in a tracial and finitely generated $ W^\ast $ -probability space existence of conjugate variables excludes algebraic relations for the generators .	Moreover , under the assumption of maximal non-microstates free entropy dimension , we prove that there are no zero divisors in the sense that the product of any non-commutative polynomial in the generators with any element from the von Neumann algebra is zero if and only if at least one of those factors is zero .	In particular , this shows that in this case the distribution of any non-constant self-adjoint non-commutative polynomial in the generators does not have atoms .	Questions on the absence of atoms for polynomials in non-commuting random variables ( or for polynomials in random matrices ) have been an open problem for quite a while .	We solve this general problem by showing that maximality of free entropy dimension excludes atoms .
0	A theoretical study of the magnetoelectronic properties of zigzag and armchair bilayer graphene nanoribbons ( BGNs ) is presented .	Using the recursive Green 's function method , we study the band structure of BGNs in uniform perpendicular magnetic fields and discuss the zero-temperature conductance for the corresponding clean systems .	The conductance quantized as 2 ( n+1 ) G_ for the zigzag edges and nG_0 for the armchair edges with G_ { 0 } =2e^2/h being the conductance unit and $ n $ an integer .	Special attention is paid to the effects of edge disorder .	As in the case of monolayer graphene nanoribbons ( GNR ) , a small degree of edge disorder is already sufficient to induce a transport gap around the neutrality point .
1	The $ \mathbb { Z } $ -valued topological invariant , which was originally called the TKNN invariant in physics , has now been fully understood as the first Chern number .	This paper is a survey of the $ \mathbb { Z } /2\mathbb { Z } $ -valued invariant of topological insulators used in condensed matter physics .	The $ \mathbb { Z } /2\mathbb { Z } $ invariant is more mysterious , we will explain its equivalent descriptions from different points of view and provide the relations between them .	These invariants provide the classification of topological insulators with different symmetries in which K-theory plays an important role .	Moreover , we establish that both invariants are realizations of index theorems which can also be understood in terms of condensed matter physics .
3	The first leading-order action includes instantaneous one-pion exchange and same-site contact interactions .	We study nucleon-nucleon scattering on the lattice at next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory .	We determine phase shifts and mixing angles from the properties of two-nucleon standing waves induced by a hard spherical wall in the center-of-mass frame .	At fixed lattice spacing we test model independence of the low-energy effective theory by computing next-to-leading-order corrections for two different leading-order lattice actions .	The second leading-order action includes instantaneous one-pion exchange and Gaussian-smeared interactions .
1	Using a range of GRB properties , such as peak optical brightness and time , isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy and redshift , we simulate radio light curves in a framework generalized for any circumburst medium structure and including a parametrization of the shell thickness regime that is more realistic than the simple assumption of thick- or thin-shell approximations .	We present predictions of centimeter and millimeter radio emission from reverse shocks in the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts with the goal of determining their detectability with current and future radio facilities .	Building on earlier work by Mundell et al .	( 2007 ) and Melandri et al .	( 2010 ) in which the typical frequency of the reverse shock was suggested to lie at radio , rather than optical wavelengths at early times , we show that the brightest and most distinct reverse-shock radio signatures are detectable up to 0.1 -- 1 day after the burst , emphasizing the need for rapid radio follow-up .
2	Second , we considered that both scattering cross sections are of the same order , with the aim of studying the dependencies of the capture rate on stellar elements other than hydrogen .	We studied the rate at which stars capture dark matter ( DM ) particles , considering different assumptions regarding the DM characteristics and in particular investigating how the stellar physics influences the capture rate .	Two scenarios were considered : first , we assumed the maximal values for the spin-dependent and spin-independent DM particle-nucleon scattering cross sections allowed by the limits from direct detection experiments .	We found that the characteristics of the capture rate are very different in the two scenarios .	Furthermore , we quantified the uncertainties on the computed capture rate ( C_x ) and on the ratio between the luminosities from DM annihilations and thermonuclear reactions ( L_x/L_nuc ) derived from an imprecise knowledge of the stellar structure and DM parameters .
1	This relation induces an elliptic Lefschetz pencil structure on the four-manifold \cp $ # ( 9-k ) $ \cpb $ $ with $ k $ base points and twelve singular fibers .	We find a new relation among right-handed Dehn twists in the mapping class group of a $ k $ -holed torus for $ 4 \leq k \leq 9 $ .	By blowing up the base points we get an elliptic Lefschetz fibration on the complex elliptic surface $ E ( 1 ) = $ \cp $ # 9 $ \cpb $ \to S^2 $ with twelve singular fibers and $ k $ disjoint sections .	More importantly we can locate these $ k $ sections in a Kirby diagram of the induced elliptic Lefschetz fibration .	The $ n $ -th power of our relation gives an explicit description for $ k $ disjoint sections of the induced elliptic fibration on the complex elliptic surface $ E ( n ) \to S^2 $ for $ n \geq 1 $ .
0	The joint user association and spectrum allocation problem is studied for multi-tier heterogeneous networks ( HetNets ) in both downlink and uplink in the interference-limited regime .	Users are associated with base-stations ( BSs ) based on the biased downlink received power .	Spectrum is either shared or orthogonally partitioned among the tiers .	This paper models the placement of BSs in different tiers as spatial point processes and adopts stochastic geometry to derive the theoretical mean proportionally fair utility of the network based on the coverage rate .	By formulating and solving the network utility maximization problem , the optimal user association bias factors and spectrum partition ratios are analytically obtained for the multi-tier network .
2	This allows us to study the effects of Lyman-Werner radiation on suppressing H2 cooling at low densities as well as the high-density evolution of the collapsing core in a self-consistent cosmological framework .	We examine aspects of primordial star formation in the presence of a molecular hydrogen-dissociating ultraviolet background .	We compare a set of AMR hydrodynamic cosmological simulations using a single cosmological realization but with a range of ultraviolet background strengths in the Lyman-Werner band .	We find that the addition of a photodissociating background results in a delay of the collapse of high density gas at the center of the most massive halo in the simulation and , as a result , an increase in the virial mass of this halo at the onset of baryon collapse .	We find that , contrary to previous results , Population III star formation is not suppressed for J $ _ { 21 } \geq 0.1 $ , but occurs even with backgrounds as high as J $ _ { 21 } = 1 $ .
3	By combining these results with Lekner 's ( 1991 ) earlier treatment of waves propagating from isotropic media to anisotropic media and employing a matrix method we determine a solution to the general form of the multiple reflection case .	We develop a model for the reflection and transmission of plane waves by an isotropic layer sandwiched between two uniaxial crystals of arbitrary orientation .	In the laboratory frame , reflection and transmission coefficients corresponding to the principal polarization directions in each crystal are given explicitly in terms of the c-axis and propagation directions .	The solution is found by first deriving explicit expressions for reflection and transmission amplitude coefficients for waves propagating from an arbitrarily oriented uniaxial anisotropic material into an isotropic material .	The example system of a wetted interface between two ice crystals is used to contextualize the results .
0	We review a theoretical perspective of the dynamics of glass forming liquids and the glass transition .	It is a perspective we have developed with our collaborators during this decade .	It is based upon the structure of trajectory space .	This structure emerges from spatial correlations of dynamics that appear in disordered systems as they approach non-ergodic or jammed states .	It is characterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity , facilitation and excitation lines .
3	In contrast to previous work , we show that observed spiral arm pitch angles are similar when measured in the optical ( at 0.4 um ) and the near-infrared ( at 2.1 um ) with a mean difference of 2.3+/-2.7 degrees .	We investigate the use of spiral arm pitch angles as a probe of disk galaxy mass profiles .	We confirm our previous result that spiral arm pitch angles ( P ) are well-correlated with the rate of shear ( S ) in disk galaxy rotation curves , by using a much larger sample ( 51 galaxies ) than used previously ( 17 galaxies ) .	We use this correlation to argue that imaging data alone can provide a powerful probe of galactic mass distributions out to large lookback times .	This is then used to strengthen the known correlation between P and S using B-band images .
4	The distinction between single and binary stars is not clear cut , except for the colliding wind system HD 152248 .	Based on a deep XMM-Newton observation of the young open cluster NGC 6231 , we derive the main X-ray properties of its early-type star population .	Among the 610 X-ray sources detected in the field , 42 are associated with early-type stars .	We investigate their $ L_\mathrm { X } / L_\mathrm { bol } $ relationship and we confirm the clear dichotomy between O- and B-type stars .	The cut-off line between the two behaviours occurs at $ L_\mathrm { bol } \sim 10^ { 38 } $ erg s $ ^ { -1 } $ as previously proposed by \citet { BSC97 } .
2	This scenario is known as physical layer multicasting to multiple co-channel groups .	Linear precoding exploits the spatial degrees of freedom offered by multi-antenna transmitters to serve multiple users over the same frequency resources .	The present work focuses on simultaneously serving multiple groups of users , each with its own channel , by transmitting a stream of common symbols to each group .	Extending the current state of the art in multigroup multicasting , the practical constraint of a maximum permitted power level radiated by each antenna is tackled herein .	The considered per antenna power constrained system is optimized in a maximum fairness sense .
1	Important representatives of these symmetry classes are random hopping models on bipartite lattices at the band center .	Field-theoretical approach to Anderson localization in 2D disordered fermionic systems of chiral symmetry classes ( BDI , AIII , CII ) is developed .	As was found by Gade and Wegner two decades ago within the sigma-model formalism , quantum interference effects in these classes are absent to all orders of perturbation theory .	We demonstrate that the quantum localization effects emerge when the theory is treated non-perturbatively .	Specifically , they are controlled by topological vortex-like excitations of the sigma models .
4	Thus to provide benefits , the quantum protocol requires more complex economic scenarios such as maintaining privacy of bids over a series of related auctions or involving allocative externalities .	We describe human-subject laboratory experiments on probabilistic auctions based on previously proposed auction protocols involving the simulated manipulation and communication of quantum states .	These auctions are probabilistic in determining which bidder wins , or having no winner , rather than always having the highest bidder win .	Comparing two quantum protocols in the context of first-price sealed bid auctions , we find the one predicted to be superior by game theory also performs better experimentally .	We also compare with a conventional first price auction , which gives higher performance .
4	Motors are represented individually as bipolar springs governed by rate-based rules for attachment , detachment and unidirectional motion of motor heads along the filament contour .	Active gels are a class of biologically-relevant material containing embedded agents that spontaneously generate forces acting on a sparse filament network .	In vitro experiments of protein filaments and molecular motors have revealed a range of non- equilibrium pattern formation resulting from motor motion along filament tracks , and there are a number of hydrodynamic models purporting to describe such systems .	Here we present results of extensive simulations designed to elucidate the microscopic basis underpinning macroscopic flow in active gels .	Our numerical scheme includes thermal fluctuations in filament positions , excluded volume interactions , and filament elasticity in the form of bending and stretching modes .
4	In the bulk of the paper , we describe in detail the technical approaches that we have adopted to attain the desired performance .	Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope ( LCOGT ) is a young organization dedicated to time-domain observations at optical and ( potentially ) near-IR wavelengths .	To this end , LCOGT is constructing a world-wide network of telescopes , including the two 2m Faulkes telescopes , as many as 17 x 1m telescopes , and as many as 23 x 40cm telescopes .	These telescopes initially will be outfitted for imaging and ( excepting the 40cm telescopes ) spectroscopy at wavelengths between the atmospheric UV cutoff and the roughly 1-micron limit of silicon detectors .	Since the first of LCOGT 's 1m telescopes are now being deployed , we lay out here LCOGT 's scientific goals and the requirements that these goals place on network architecture and performance , we summarize the network 's present and projected level of development , and we describe our expected schedule for completing it .
1	The expression for the Euler characteristic , through the Gauss- Bonnet integral , and the one for the entropy of gravitational instantons are proposed in a form which makes the relation between them self-evident .	In this work a deep relation between topology and thermodynamical features of manifolds with boundaries is shown .	A generalization of Bekenstein-Hawking formula , in which entropy and Euler characteristic are related in the form $ S=\chi A/8 $ , is obtained .	This formula reproduces the correct result for extreme black hole , where the Bekenstein-Hawking one fails ( $ S=0 $ but $ A \neq 0 $ ) .	In such a way it recovers a unified picture for the black hole entropy law .
2	Then we prove that the existence region for the analytic solutions can be extended to a larger region which depends only on the validity of the apriori estimates for the Weyl equations , associated to the `` Bel-Robinson norms '' .	The main goal of this work consists in showing that the analytic solutions for a class of characteristic problems for the Einstein vacuum equations have an existence region larger than the one provided by the Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem due to the intrinsic hyperbolicity of the Einstein equations .	To prove this result we first describe a geometric way of writing the vacuum Einstein equations for the characteristic problems we are considering , in a gauge characterized by the introduction of a double null cone foliation of the spacetime .	In particular if the initial data are sufficiently small we show that the analytic solution is global .	Before showing how to extend the existence region we describe the same result in the case of the Burger equation , which , even if much simpler , nevertheless requires analogous logical steps required for the general proof .
3	Substitution of Se by Te in the FeSe superconductor results in an enhancement of Tc up to 14.5 K and superconductivity can persist over a large composition range in the Fe ( Se , Te ) system .	The FeSe superconductor and its related systems have attracted much attention in the iron-based superconductors owing to their simple crystal structure and peculiar electronic and physical properties .	The bulk FeSe superconductor has a superconducting transition temperature ( Tc ) of ~8 K ; it can be dramatically enhanced to 37 K at high pressure .	On the other hand , its cousin system , FeTe , possesses a unique antiferromagnetic ground state but is non-superconducting .	Intercalation of the FeSe superconductor leads to the discovery of the AxFe2-ySe2 ( A=K , Cs and Tl ) system that exhibits a Tc higher than 30 K and a unique electronic structure of the superconducting phase .
4	Our main approach is to show that the shortest curves with bounded curvature and C^1 boundary conditions in R^n contain CLC ( circle-line-circle ) curves , if they do not have constant maximal curvature .	Relatively extremal knots are the relative minima of the ropelength functional in C^1 topology .	On the set curves of fixed length , they are the relative maxima of thickness ( normal injectivity radius ) functional , including the ideal knots .	We prove that a C^ { 1,1 } relatively extremal knot in R^n has thickness equal to half of the minimal double critical distance unless it has constant maximal ( generalized ) curvature .	This result also applies to links since our method is local .
4	The vertical roughness of the step grows linearly in time , while horizontally the fingers coarsen proportional to $ t^ { 0.33 } $ .	We consider a simple model for the growth of isolated steps on a vicinal crystal surface .	It incorporates diffusion and drift of adatoms on the terrace , and strong step and kink edge barriers .	Using a combination of analytic methods and Monte Carlo simulations , we study the morphology of growing steps in detail .	In particular , under typical Molecular Beam Epitaxy conditions the step morphology is linearly unstable in the model and develops fingers separated by deep cracks .
0	Context .	The discovery of about 700 extrasolar planets , so far , has lead to the first statistics concerning extrasolar planets .	The presence of giant planets seems to depend on stellar metallicity and mass .	For example , they are more frequent around metal-rich stars , with an exponential increase in planet occurrence rates with metallicity.Aims .	We analyzed two samples of metal-poor stars ( -2.0 \leq [ Fe/H ] \leq 0.0 ) to see if giant planets are indeed rare around these objects .
2	Nevertheless , a disordered solid is evidently different in that pinning barriers of particles are due to neighbors that are also subject to motion .	When a disordered solid is sheared , yielding is followed by the onset of intermittent response that is characterized by slip in local regions usually labeled shear-transformation zones ( STZ ) .	Such intermittent response resembles the behavior of earthquakes or contact depinning , where a well-defined landscape of pinning disorder prohibits the deformation of an elastic medium .	Microscopic yielding leads to destruction of the local microstructure and local heating .	It is natural to assume that locally a liquid emerges for a finite timescale before cooling down to a transformed configuration .
0	Early optical afterglows have been observed from GRB 990123 , GRB 021004 , and GRB 021211 , which reveal rich emission features attributed to reverse shocks .	It is expected that Swift will discover many more early afterglows .	Here we investigate in a unified manner both the forward and the reverse external shock emission components , and introduce a straightforward recipe for directly constraining the initial Lorentz factor of the fireball using early optical afterglow data .	The scheme is largely independent of the shock microphysics .	We identify two types of combinations of the reverse and forward shock emission , and explore their parameter regimes .
1	The turbulence is statistically homogeneous , isotropic , and mirror -- symmetric .	We study numerically the dependence of the critical magnetic Reynolds number Rmc for the turbulent small-scale dynamo on the hydrodynamic Reynolds number Re .	We are interested in the regime of low magnetic Prandtl number Pm=Rm/Re & lt ; 1 , which is relevant for stellar convective zones , protostellar disks , and laboratory liquid-metal experiments .	The two asymptotic possibilities are Rmc- & gt ; const as Re- & gt ; infinity ( a small-scale dynamo exists at low Pm ) or Rmc/Re=Pmc- & gt ; const as Re- & gt ; infinity ( no small-scale dynamo exists at low Pm ) .	Results obtained in two independent sets of simulations of MHD turbulence using grid and spectral codes are brought together and found to be in quantitative agreement .
2	Our algorithm for the edge-weighted case computes a matching whose weight is at least $ ( 1-\eps ) $ times the optimal in $ \log ( \min\ { 1/\wmin , n/\eps\ } ) ^ { O ( 1/\eps ) } \cdot ( \Delta^ { O ( 1/\eps ) } +\log^* ( n ) ) $ rounds for edge-weights in $ [ \wmin,1 ] $ .	We present deterministic distributed algorithms for computing approximate maximum cardinality matchings and approximate maximum weight matchings .	Our algorithm for the unweighted case computes a matching whose size is at least $ ( 1-\eps ) $ times the optimal in $ \Delta^ { O ( 1/\eps ) } + O\left ( \frac { 1 } { \eps^2 } \right ) \cdot\log^* ( n ) $ rounds where $ n $ is the number of vertices in the graph and $ \Delta $ is the maximum degree .	The best previous algorithms for both the unweighted case and the weighted case are by Lotker , Patt-Shamir , and Pettie~ ( SPAA 2008 ) .	For the unweighted case they give a randomized $ ( 1-\eps ) $ -approximation algorithm that runs in $ O ( ( \log ( n ) ) /\eps^3 ) $ rounds .
3	An unusual property of high level ( x=10 % ) doped samples is a possibility of extraordinarily large and fast oxygen exchange with ambient atmosphere at not very high temperatures ( 100-200 C ) .	Solid state synthesis and physical mechanisms of electrical conductivity variation in polycrystalline , strontium doped indium oxide In2O3 : ( SrO ) x were investigated for materials with different doping levels at different temperatures ( T=20-300 C ) and ambient atmosphere content including humidity and low pressure .	Gas sensing ability of these compounds as well as the sample resistance appeared to increase by 4 and 8 orders of the magnitude , respectively , with the doping level increase from zero up to x=10 % .	The conductance variation due to doping is explained by two mechanisms : acceptor-like electrical activity of Sr as a point defect and appearance of an additional phase of SrIn2O4 .	This peculiarity is explained by friable structure of crystallite surface .
1	Given that $ B_ { 1 } , B_ { 2 } $ are binet matrices we examine the $ k $ -sums of network and binet matrices .	Seymour 's famous decomposition theorem for regular matroids states that any totally unimodular ( TU ) matrix can be constructed through a series of composition operations called $ k $ -sums starting from network matrices and their transposes and two compact representation matrices $ B_ { 1 } , B_ { 2 } $ of a certain ten element matroid .	It is shown that the $ k $ -sum of a network and a binet matrix is a binet matrix , but binet matrices are not closed under this operation for $ k=2,3 $ .	A new class of matrices is introduced the so called { \em tour matrices } , which generalises network , binet and totally unimodular matrices .	For any such matrix there exists a bidirected graph such that the columns represent a collection of closed tours in the graph .
3	Normalized projectiles lightest fragments ( proton ) are strongly correlated with compound particles , shower particles and heavy ionizing charge particles .	The present article significantly investigated projectiles lightest fragments ( proton ) multiplicity distribution and probability distribution with 84Kr36 emulsion collision at around 1 A GeV .	The multiplicity and normalized multiplicity of projectiles lightest fragments ( proton ) is correlated with the compound particles , shower particles , black particles , grey particles , helium fragments particles and heavily ionizing charged particles .	It is found that projectiles lightest fragments ( proton ) are strongly correlated with compound particles and shower particles rather than other particles and the average multiplicity of projectiles lightest fragments ( proton ) increases with increasing compound , shower and heavy ionizing particles .	The multiplicity distribution of the projectiles lightest fragments ( proton ) emitted in the 84Kr36 + emulsion interaction at around 1 A GeV with different target has well explained by KNO scaling .
3	Simultaneously , the variations in time kinetics for the POE in nanosecond time regime were explored .	IR induced piezo optic effect ( POE ) in PbTe : Ca crystals was found under the influence of nanosecond pulse CO2 laser with a wavelength of 10.6 micro meters .	It was shown that addition of Ca leads to an increase of the POE tensor coefficient .	This indicates the appearance of enhanced IR induced static dipole moments caused predominately by Ca impurities .	A substantial role of electron phonon subsystem in the observed POE effect was demonstrated .
0	The $ \pi $ -calculus is a process algebra where agents interact by sending communication links to each other via noiseless communication channels .	Taking into account the reality of noisy channels , an extension of the $ \pi $ -calculus , called the $ \pi_N $ -calculus , has been introduced recently .	In this paper , we present an early transitional semantics of the $ \pi_N $ -calculus , which is not a directly translated version of the late semantics of $ \pi_N $ , and then extend six kinds of behavioral equivalences consisting of reduction bisimilarity , barbed bisimilarity , barbed equivalence , barbed congruence , bisimilarity , and full bisimilarity into the $ \pi_N $ -calculus .	Such behavioral equivalences are cast in a hierarchy , which is helpful to verify behavioral equivalence of two agents .	In particular , we show that due to the noisy nature of channels , the coincidence of bisimilarity and barbed equivalence , as well as the coincidence of full bisimilarity and barbed congruence , in the $ \pi $ -calculus does not hold in $ \pi_N $ .
1	As a candidate , we consider Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati two-brane model with the Goldberger-Wise radion stabilization .	We discuss whether or not bigravity theory can be embedded into the braneworld setup .	We will show that we can construct a ghost free model whose low energy spectrum is composed of a massless graviton and a massive graviton with a small mass .	As is expected , the behavior of this effective theory is shown to be identical to de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley bigravity .	Unfortunately , this correspondence breaks down at a relatively low energy due to the limitation of the adopted stabilization mechanism .
3	The surprising result is that some problems can be solved faster in the Quasi-Bayesian framework than within usual Bayesian theory .	Quasi-Bayesian theory uses convex sets of probability distributions and expected loss to represent preferences about plans .	The theory focuses on decision robustness , i.e. , the extent to which plans are affected by deviations in subjective assessments of probability .	The present work presents solutions for plan generation when robustness of probability assessments must be included : plans contain information about the robustness of certain actions .	We investigate this on the planning to observe problem , i.e. , an agent must decide whether to take new observations or not .
2	Such quantities are obtained directly from the spherical harmonic coefficients ( alm ) of the map .	A method to compute several scalar quantities of Cosmic Microwave Background maps on the sphere is presented .	We consider here four type of scalars : the Hessian matrix scalars , the distortion scalars , the gradient related scalars and the curvature scalars .	We also study the probability density function of these quantities for the case of a homogeneous and isotropic Gaussian field , which are functions of the power spectrum of the initial field .	From these scalars it is posible to construct a new set of scalars which are independent of the power spectrum of the field .
3	Also we have shown the natures of $ G $ and $ \Lambda $ over the total age of the Universe .	In this paper we have considered the Universe to be filled with Modified Gas and the Cosmological Constant $ \Lambda $ to be time-dependent with or without the Gravitational Constant $ G $ to be time-dependent .	We have considered various phenomenological models for $ \Lambda $ , viz. , $ \Lambda\propto\rho , \Lambda\propto\frac { \dot { a } ^ { 2 } } { a^ { 2 } } $ and $ \Lambda\propto\frac { \ddot { a } } { a } $ .	Using these models it is possible to show the accelerated expansion of the Universe at the present epoch .	Using the statefinder parameters we have shown the diagramamtical representation of the evolution of the Universe starting from radiation era to $ \Lambda $ CDM model .
4	The ratio $ \Lambda/\pi $ at mid-rapidity and in 4 $ \pi $ has a maximum around 40 A $ \cdot $ GeV .	In this paper we present recent results from the NA49 experiment for $ \Lambda $ and $ \bar { \Lambda } $ hyperons produced in central Pb+Pb collisions at 40 , 80 and 158 A $ \cdot $ GeV .	Transverse mass spectra and rapidity distributions for $ \Lambda $ are shown for all three energies .	The shape of the rapidity distribution becomes flatter with increasing beam energy .	The multiplicities at mid-rapidity as well as the total yields are studied as a function of collision energy including AGS measurements .
0	We examine thermal transport in graphene supported on SiO2 using molecular dynamics simulations .	Coupling to the substrate reduces the thermal conductivity ( TC ) of supported graphene by an order of magnitude , due to damping of the flexural acoustic ( ZA ) phonons .	However , increasing the strength of the graphene-substrate interaction enhances the TC of supported graphene , contrary to expectations .	The enhancement is due to the coupling of graphene ZA modes to the substrate Rayleigh waves , which linearizes the dispersion and increases the group velocity of the hybridized modes .	These findings suggest that the TC of two-dimensional supported graphene is tunable through surface interactions , providing a novel possibility for controlled energy flow in nanomaterials .
4	The effect of correlations in one dimension manifests in the increased tendency to particle chaining in the substrate .	We present results of a new model of sequential adsorption in which the adsorbing particles are correlated with the particles attached to the substrate .	The strength of the correlations is measured by a tunable parameter $ \sigma $ .	The model interpolates between free ballistic adsorption in the limit $ \sigma\to\infty $ and a strongly correlated phase , appearing for $ \sigma\to0 $ and characterized by the emergence of highly ordered structures .	The phenomenon is manifested through the analysis of several magnitudes , as the jamming limit and the particle-particle correlation function .
2	This characterization defines a mapping from an infinitely divisible distribution with finite log-moment to a semi-selfdecomposable distribution .	In this paper , three topics on semi-selfdecomposable distributions are studied .	The first one is to characterize semi-selfdecomposable distributions by stochastic integrals with respect to Levy processes .	The second one is to introduce and study a Langevin type equation and the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbecktype process whose limiting distribution is semi-selfdecomposable .	Also , semi-stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type processes with semi-selfdecomposable distributions are constructed .
2	In view of this situation , the status of the many `solutions ' in the literature which prescribe a contact angle in potential flows comes into question .	We show that in general , the specification of a contact angle condition at the contact line in inviscid fluid motions is incompatible with the classical field equations and boundary conditions generally applicable to them .	The limited conditions under which such a specification is permissible are derived ; however , these include cases where the static meniscus is not flat .	We suggest that these solutions which attempt to incorporate a phenomenological , but incompatible , condition are in some , imprecise sense `weak-type solutions ' ; they satisfy or are likely to satisfy , at least in the limit , the governing equations and boundary conditions everywhere except in the neighbourhood of the contact line .	We discuss the implications of the result for the analysis of inviscid flows with free surfaces .
2	As the initial distance between the tracer and the path of the swimmer $ \rho $ decreases , the tracer is displaced a small distance backwards ( relative to the direction of the swimmer velocity ) .	We discuss the path of a tracer particle as a microswimmer moves past on an infinite straight trajectory .	If the tracer is sufficiently far from the path of the swimmer it moves in a closed loop .	For much smaller tracer-swimmer separations , however , the tracer displacement becomes positive and diverges as $ \rho \to 0 $ .	To quantify this behaviour we calculate the Darwin drift , the total volume swept out by a material sheet of tracers , initially perpendicular to the swimmer path , during the swimmer motion .
0	We present an analysis of X-ray colour maps of the cores of clusters of galaxies , formed from the ratios of counts in different X-ray bands .	Our technique groups pixels lying between contours in an adaptively-smoothed image of a cluster .	We select the contour levels to minimize the uncertainties in the colour ratios , whilst preserving the structure of the object .	We investigate the spatial distributions of cooling gas and absorbing material for a sample of 33 X-ray bright clusters , many containing strong cooling flows , in archival ROSAT PSPC data .	We present colour maps of a sample of the clusters , in addition to adaptively-smoothed images in different bands .
1	The text of the book includes definition of geometrical object , concept of reference frame , geometry of metric-affinne manifold .	I tell about different mathematical tool that is important in general relativity .	Using this concept I learn few physical applications : dynamics and Lorentz transformation in gravitational fields , Doppler shift .	A reference frame in event space is a smooth field of orthonormal bases .	Every reference frame is equipped by anholonomic coordinates .
0	We present the generalized Scherk-Schwarz reduction ansatz for the full supersymmetric exceptional field theory in terms of group valued twist matrices subject to consistency equations .	With this ansatz the field equations precisely reduce to those of lower-dimensional gauged supergravity parametrized by an embedding tensor .	We explicitly construct a family of twist matrices as solutions of the consistency equations .	They induce gauged supergravities with gauge groups SO ( p , q ) and CSO ( p , q , r ) .	Geometrically , they describe compactifications on internal spaces given by spheres and ( warped ) hyperboloides $ H^ { p , q } $ , thus extending the applicability of generalized Scherk-Schwarz reductions beyond homogeneous spaces .
4	Interestingly , the final state is not characterized by the equality of the temperatures of the subsystems but by the cooling rates being the same .	Two granular gases separated by an adiabatic piston and initially in the same macroscopic state are considered .	It is found that a phase transition with an spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs .	When the mass of the piston is increased beyond a critical value , the piston moves to a stationary position different from the middle of the system .	The transition is accurately described by a simple kinetic model that takes into account the velocity fluctuations of the piston .
0	We report first principles calculations on the electronic and structural properties of chemically functionalized adamantane molecules , either in isolated or crystalline forms .	Boron and nitrogen functionalized molecules , aza- , tetra-aza- , bora- , and tetra-bora-adamantane , were found to be very stable in terms of energetics , consistent with available experimental data .	Additionally , a hypothetical molecular crystal in a zincblende structure , involving the pair tetra-bora-adamantane and tetra-aza-adamantane , was investigated .	This molecular crystal presented a direct and large electronic bandgap and a bulk modulus of 20 GPa .	The viability of using those functionalized molecules as fundamental building blocks for nanostructure self-assembly is discussed .
0	In order to explain cosmic acceleration without invoking `` dark '' physics , we consider $ f ( R ) $ modified gravity models , which replace the standard Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity with a higher derivative theory .	We use data from the WiggleZ Dark Energy survey to probe the formation of structure on large scales which can place tight constraints on these models .	We combine the large-scale structure data with measurements of the cosmic microwave background from the Planck surveyor .	After parameterising the modification of the action using the Compton wavelength parameter $ B_0 $ , we constrain this parameter using ISiTGR , assuming an initial non-informative log prior probability distribution of this cross-over scale .	We find that the addition of the WiggleZ power spectrum provides the tightest constraints to date on $ B_0 $ by an order of magnitude , giving $ { \rm log } _ { 10 } ( B_0 ) & lt ; -4.07 $ at 95 % confidence limit .
3	We show that the temperature and the condensate mass fractions are fully determined by the total number of particles in each component and the initial total energy .	We study the formation of large-scale coherent structures ( a condensate ) for a system of two weakly interacting classical waves .	Using the coupled defocusing nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger ( NLS ) equations as a representative model , we focus on condensation in the phase mixing regime .	We employ weak turbulence theory to provide a complete thermodynamic description of the classical condensation process .	Moreover , we find that , at higher energies , condensation can occur in only one component .
4	This includes a splitting due to coupling between orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum .	A new set of vector solutions to Maxwell 's equations based on solutions to the wave equation in spheroidal coordinates allows laser beams to be described beyond the paraxial approximation .	Using these solutions allows us to calculate the complete first-order corrections in the short-wavelength limit to eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies in a Fabry-Perot resonator with perfectly conducting mirrors .	Experimentally relevant effects are predicted .	Modes which are degenerate according to the paraxial approximation are split according to their total angular momentum .
1	Considering two transitions the \nu_1 - & gt ; \nu_2 and \nu_2 - & gt ; \nu_3 we obtain two oscillation lengths L_ { 12 } =4960.8 m , L_ { 23 } =198.4 m , two absorption probabilities P_ { 12 } ^ { abs .	We calculate the absorption probability of photons radiated from the surface of the Sun by a left-handed neutrino with definite mass and a typical momentum for which we choose |p_1|=0.2 MeV , producing a heavier right-handed antineutrino .	} =2.5 10^ { -67 } , P_ { 23 } ^ { abs .	} =1.2 10^ { -58 } and the two absorption ranges R_ { 12 } ^ { abs .	} =4.47 10^4 R_ { \odot } =208.0 au , R_ { 23 } ^ { abs .
4	For intermediate coupling and charging energy smaller than the superconducting gap , the current-voltage characteristic is dominated by Andreev reflection and Coulomb blockade produces an effect only near zero bias .	Semiconductor nanowires provide promising low-dimensional systems for the study of quantum transport phenomena in combination with superconductivity .	Here we investigate the competition between the Coulomb blockade effect , Andreev reflection , and quantum interference , in InAs and InP nanowires connected to aluminum-based superconducting electrodes .	We compare three limiting cases depending on the tunnel coupling strength and the characteristic Coulomb interaction energy .	For weak coupling and large charging energy , negative differential conductance is observed as a direct consequence of the BCS density of states in the leads .
2	Such a strong Coulomb repulsion implies a very narrow hole wave function localized around the defect , which is manifested by a large Stokes shift .	The exciton-exciton interaction energy of Tellurium doped CdSe colloidal quantum dots is experimentally investigated .	The dots exhibit a strong Coulomb repulsion between the two excitons , which results in a huge measured biexciton blue shift of up to 300 meV .	Moreover , we show that the biexciton blue shift increases linearly with the Stokes shift .	This result is highly relevant for the use of colloidal QDs as optical gain media , where a large biexciton blue shift is required to obtain gain in the single exciton regime .
3	The average deficit in UV absorption amounts to 43 % for Arcturus whereas it is 9 % for the Sun .	A brief overview of the results of the investigations of the red giant star Arcturus is given .	One-dimensional LTE modeling of the atmospheres of Arcturus and the Sun as a star is carried out on the basis of synthesis of the extended wings of the H and K Ca II lines .	It is found that the local continuum in this spectral region is underestimated by an average of 12 % in the atlases of Arcturus .	For Arcturus the correction factor to the continuum opacity at the wavelengths of 390.0 , 392.5 , 395.0 , 398.0 , and 400.0 nm equals 2.20 , 1.90 , 1.70 , 1.55 , and 1.45 .
2	In this paper we further investigate this indicator , introduce a multiplicative version of it and are able to show many properties .	Belinschi and Nica introduced a composition semigroup on the set of probability measures .	Using this semigroup , they introduced a free divisibility indicator , from which one can know whether a probability measure is freely infinitely divisible or not .	Specifically , on the first half of the paper , we calculate how the indicator changes with respect to free and Boolean powers ; we prove that free and Boolean 1/2-stable laws have free divisibility indicators equal to infinity ; we derive an upper bound of the indicator in terms of Jacobi parameters .	This upper bound is achieved only by free Meixner distributions .
3	An estimate of the increase in anisotropy expected from initial-geometry modification due to gluon saturation effects and initial-geometry fluctuations is insufficient to account for this discrepancy .	We have measured the azimuthal anisotropy of pi0 's for 1 & lt ; pT & lt ; 18 GeV/c for Au+Au collisions at sqrt s_NN = 200 GeV .	The observed anisotropy shows a gradual decrease in 3 & lt ; pT & lt ; 7 - 10 GeV/c , but remains positive beyond 10 GeV/c .	The magnitude of this anisotropy is under-predicted , up to at least 10 GeV/c , by current perturbative QCD ( pQCD ) energy-loss model calculations .	Calculations which implement a path length dependence steeper than what is implied by current pQCD energy-loss models , show reasonable agreement with the data .
2	By comparing with the theoretical framework that we have for the inclusive deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering and the one-dimensional imaging of the nucleon , we summarize what we need to do in order to construct such a comprehensive theoretical framework for semi-inclusive processes in terms of three dimensional gauge invariant parton distributions .	We present a short overview on the studies of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions of the nucleon .	The aim of such studies is to provide a three dimensional imagining of the nucleon and a comprehensive description of semi-inclusive high energy reactions .	After that , we present an overview of what we have already achieved with emphasize on the theoretical framework for semi-inclusive reactions in leading order perturbative QCD but with leading and higher twist contributions .	We summarize in particular the results for the differential cross section and the azimuthal spin asymmetries in terms of the gauge invariant transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions .
0	We investigate the spectral and localization properties of unmagnetized Heisenberg-Mattis spin glasses , in space dimensionalities $ d=2 $ and 3 , at T=0 .	We use numerical transfer-matrix methods combined with finite-size scaling to calculate Lyapunov exponents , and eigenvalue-counting theorems , coupled with Gaussian elimination algorithms , to evaluate densities of states .	In $ d=2 $ we find that all states are localized , with the localization length diverging as $ \omega^ { -1 } $ , as energy $ \omega \to 0 $ .	Logarithmic corrections to density of states behave in accordance with theoretical predictions .	In $ d=3 $ the density-of-states dependence on energy is the same as for spin waves in pure antiferromagnets , again in agreement with theoretical predictions , though the corresponding amplitudes differ .
2	For optimized ALD process it can reach the level of 10^15 cm-3 , while mobility of electrons is between 20 and 50 cm2/Vs .	The paper presents results for zinc oxide films grown at low temperature regime by Atomic Layer Deposition ( ALD ) .	We discuss electrical properties of such films and show that low temperature deposition results in oxygen-rich ZnO layers in which free carrier concentration is very low .	Electrical parameters of ZnO films deposited by ALD at low temperature regime are appropriate for constructing of the ZnO-based p-n and Schottky junctions .	We demonstrate that such junctions are characterized by the rectification ratio high enough to fulfill requirements of 3D memories and are deposited at temperature 100degC which makes them appropriate for deposition on organic substrates .
2	In applications where the inverse solution is subject to further analysis procedures , this can be a significant advantage .	Solving ill-posed inverse problems by Bayesian inference has recently attracted considerable attention .	Compared to deterministic approaches , the probabilistic representation of the solution by the posterior distribution can be exploited to explore and quantify its uncertainties .	Alongside theoretical progress , various new computational techniques allow to sample very high dimensional posterior distributions : In [ Lucka2012 ] , a Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) posterior sampler was developed for linear inverse problems with $ \ell_1 $ -type priors .	In this article , we extend this single component Gibbs-type sampler to a wide range of priors used in Bayesian inversion , such as general $ \ell_p^q $ priors with additional hard constraints .
2	This work increases the radial extent of reported OSIRIS/Keck measurements by more than a factor of 3 from 4 '' to 14 '' ( 0.16 pc to 0.56 pc ) , along the projected disk of young stars .	We present new high angular resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the Milky Way 's central supermassive black hole .	Using the integral-field spectrograph OSIRIS on Keck II behind the laser-guide-star adaptive optics system , this spectroscopic survey enables us to separate early-type ( young , 4-6 Myr ) and late-type ( old , & gt ; 1 Gyr ) stars with a completeness of 50 % down to K ' = 15.5 mag , which corresponds to ~10 \msun for the early-type stars .	For our analysis , we implement a new method of completeness correction using a combination of star-planting simulations and Bayesian inference .	We assign probabilities for the spectral type of every source detected in deep imaging down to K ' = 15.5 mag using information from spectra , simulations , number counts , and the distribution of stars .
3	We also investigated the dynamics of the system with numerical integration of the equations of motions using our result as an initial condition .	We determined the spatial orientation of the Algol AB close pair orbital plane using optical interferometry with the CHARA Array , and radio interferometry with the European VLBI Network ( EVN ) .	We found the longitude of the line of nodes for the close pair being $ \Omega_1=48\deg\pm2\deg $ and the mutual inclination of the orbital planes of the close and the wide pairs being $ 95\deg\pm3\deg $ .	This latter value differs by $ 5\deg $ from the formerly known $ 100\deg $ which would imply a very fast inclination variation of the system , not supported by the photometric observations .	We found large variations in the inclination of the close pair ( its amplitude $ \sim 170\deg $ ) with a period of about 20 millenia .
0	Yukawa potentials may be long ranged when the Debye screening length is large .	In computer simulations , such long ranged potentials have to be taken into account with convenient algorithms to avoid systematic bias in the sampling of the phase space .	Recently , we have provided Ewald sums for quasi-two dimensional systems with Yukawa interaction potentials [ M. Mazars , { \it J. Chem.Phys .	} , { \bf 126 } , 056101 ( 2007 ) and M. Mazars , { \it Mol.Phys . } , Paper I ] .	Sometimes , Lekner sums are used as an alternative to Ewald sums for Coulomb systems .
3	Twenty-two members in this sample are identified as probable [ WR ] s ; the remaining 10 appear to be WELS .	We present spectra of 32 previously unpublished confirmed and candidate Wolf-Rayet ( [ WR ] ) and weak emission-line ( WELS ) central stars of planetary nebulae ( CSPNe ) .	Eighteen stars have been discovered in the Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg H-Alpha ( MASH ) PN survey sample , and we have also uncovered 14 confirmed and candidate [ WR ] s and WELS among the CSPNe of previously known PNe .	Spectral classifications have been undertaken using both the Acker & amp ; Neiner and Crowther , De Marco & amp ; Barlow schemes .	Observations undertaken as part of the MASH spectroscopic survey have now increased the number of known [ WR ] s by ~30 per cent .
2	When optimizing first , the asymptotic problem is usually referred to as a mean-field game .	We discuss and compare two methods of investigations for the asymptotic regime of stochastic differential games with a finite number of players as the number of players tends to the infinity .	These two methods differ in the order in which optimization and passage to the limit are performed .	Otherwise , it reads as an optimization problem over controlled dynamics of McKean-Vlasov type .	Both problems lead to the analysis of forward-backward stochastic differential equations , the coefficients of which depend on the marginal distributions of the solutions .
2	It is thus of great interest to understand what properties of $ f $ and $ g $ affect the communication complexity of $ ( f \comp g^n ) $ , and in what way .	A well-studied class of functions in communication complexity are composed functions of the form $ ( f \comp g^n ) ( x , y ) =f ( g ( x^1 , y^1 ) , ... , g ( x^n , y^n ) ) $ .	This is a rich family of functions which encompasses many of the important examples in the literature .	Recently , Sherstov \cite { She09b } and independently Shi-Zhu \cite { SZ09b } developed conditions on the inner function $ g $ which imply that the quantum communication complexity of $ f \comp g^n $ is at least the approximate polynomial degree of $ f $ .	We generalize both of these frameworks .
4	We compute such a volume approximation based on a new method for medial axis simplification guided by Hausdorff errors .	Volume approximation is an important problem found in many applications of computer graphics , vision , and image processing .	The problem is about computing an accurate and compact approximate representation of 3D volumes using some simple primitives .	In this study , we propose a new volume representation , called medial meshes , and present an efficient method for its computation .	Specifically , we use the union of a novel type of simple volume primitives , which are spheres and the convex hulls of two or three spheres , to approximate a given 3D shape .
4	To reproduce the Andromeda Giant Southern Stream and the stellar shells at the east and west sides of M31 , we find the sufficient condition for the power-law index $ \alpha $ of the outer density distribution of the dark matter halo .	The cold dark matter ( CDM ) cosmology , which is the standard theory of the structure formation in the universe , predicts that the outer density profile of dark matter halos decreases with the cube of distance from the center .	However , so far not much effort has examined this hypothesis .	In the halo of the Andromeda galaxy ( M31 ) , large-scale stellar structures detected by the recent observations provide a potentially suitable window to investigate the mass -- density distribution of the dark matter halo .	We explore the density structure of the dark matter halo in M31 using an N-body simulation of the interaction between an accreting satellite galaxy and M31 .
3	When those $ t $ -matrices are separable , the evaluation requires the folding of a form factor , depending on one momentum variable , with a momentum space partial-wave Coulomb function , which has a singular behavior at the external momentum $ q $ .	The repulsive Coulomb force poses severe challenges when describing $ ( d , p ) $ reactions for highly charged nuclei as a three-body problem .	Casting Faddeev-AGS equations in a Coulomb basis avoids introducing screening of the Coulomb force .	However , momentum space partial-wave $ t $ -matrix elements need to be evaluated in this basis .	We developed an improved regularization scheme to calculate Coulomb distorted form factors as the integral over the Coulomb function and complex nuclear form factors .
1	45 ( 2012 ) , 405301 , 13 pages ] have given a number of distinct sets of three-qubit observables , each furnishing a proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem .	Recently Waegell and Aravind [ J. Phys.A : Math.Theor .	Here it is demonstrated that two of these sets/configurations , namely the $ 18_ { 2 } - 12_ { 3 } $ and $ 2_ { 4 } 14_ { 2 } - 4_ { 3 } 6_ { 4 } $ ones , can uniquely be extended into geometric hyperplanes of the split Cayley hexagon of order two , namely into those of types $ { \cal V } _ { 22 } ( 37 ; 0 , 12 , 15 , 10 ) $ and $ { \cal V } _ { 4 } ( 49 ; 0 , 0 , 21 , 28 ) $ in the classification of Frohardt and Johnson [ Comm .	Algebra 22 ( 1994 ) , 773-797 ] .	Moreover , employing an automorphism of order seven of the hexagon , six more replicas of either of the two configurations are obtained .
0	The performance of cloud radio access network ( C-RAN ) is constrained by the limited fronthaul link capacity under future heavy data traffic .	To tackle this problem , extensive efforts have been devoted to design efficient signal quantization/compression techniques in the fronthaul to maximize the network throughput .	However , most of the previous results are based on information-theoretical quantization methods , which are hard to implement due to the extremely high complexity .	In this paper , we consider using practical uniform scalar quantization in the uplink communication of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( OFDMA ) based C-RAN system , where the mobile users are assigned with orthogonal sub-carriers for multiple access .	In particular , we consider joint wireless power control and fronthaul quantization design over the sub-carriers to maximize the system end-to-end throughput .
1	The width of $ P $ is defined as $ w ( P ) =min\ { x\in \mathbb { Z } ^n\setminus\ { 0\ } : \ : max_ { x \in P } x^\top u - min_ { x \in P } x^\top v \ } $ .	Let $ A $ be an $ ( m \times n ) $ integral matrix , and let $ P=\ { x : A x \leq b\ } $ be an $ n $ -dimensional polytope .	Let $ \Delta ( A ) $ and $ \delta ( A ) $ denote the greatest and the smallest absolute values of a determinant among all $ r ( A ) \times r ( A ) $ sub-matrices of $ A $ , where $ r ( A ) $ is the rank of a matrix $ A $ .	We prove that if every $ r ( A ) \times r ( A ) $ sub-matrix of $ A $ has a determinant equal to $ \pm \Delta ( A ) $ or $ 0 $ and $ w ( P ) \ge ( \Delta ( A ) -1 ) ( n+1 ) $ , then $ P $ contains $ n $ affine independent integer points .	Also we have similar results for the case of \emph { $ k $ -modular } matrices .
2	They include novel engines without traditional feedback control mechanisms , as well as versions which also include them .	We introduce quantum information engines that extract work from quantum states and a single thermal reservoir .	They may operate under three general conditions : i/ Unitarily Steered evolution ( US ) ; ii/ Irreversible Thermalization ( IT ) and iii/ Isothermal Relaxation ( IR ) , and hence are called USITIR machines .	Explicit constructions of USITIR engines are presented for one- and two-qubit states and their maximum extractable work is computed , which is optimal .	Optimality is achieved when the notions of controllable thermalizability and density matrix controllability are fullfilled .
4	Furthermore , the new model also gives a decelerated universe in the future .	The recent observations of type Ia supernovae strongly support that the universe is accelerating now and decelerated in the recent past .	This may be the evidence of the breakdown of the standard Friedmann equation .	Instead of a linear function of the matter density , we consider a general function of the matter density to modify the Freidmann equation .	We propose a new model which explains the recent acceleration and the past deceleration .
4	Moreover , $ f $ behaves like a monomial within each of these annuli and the orbits of points in $ U $ settle in the long term at particular `levels ' within the annuli , determined by the function $ h $ .	The dynamical behaviour of a transcendental entire function in any periodic component of the Fatou set is well understood .	Here we study the dynamical behaviour of a transcendental entire function $ f $ in any multiply connected wandering domain $ U $ of $ f $ .	By introducing a certain positive harmonic function $ h $ in $ U $ , related to harmonic measure , we are able to give the first detailed description of this dynamical behaviour .	Using this new technique , we show that , for sufficiently large $ n $ , the image domains $ U_n=f^n ( U ) $ contain large annuli , $ C_n $ , and that the union of these annuli acts as an absorbing set for the iterates of $ f $ in $ U $ .
0	Previously ( A. Akhmeteli , J.Math .	Phys. , v. 52 , p. 082303 ( 2011 ) ) , the Dirac equation in an arbitrary electromagnetic field was shown to be generally equivalent to a fourth-order equation for just one component of the four-component Dirac spinor function .	This was done for a specific ( chiral ) representation of gamma-matrices and for a specific component .	In the current work , the result is generalized for a general representation of gamma-matrices and a general component ( satisfying some conditions ) .	The resulting equivalent of the Dirac equation is also manifestly relativistically covariant and should be useful in applications of the Dirac equation .
1	In this paper the shape of such droplets is investigated within the spherical model of a lattice gas .	Various substances in the liquid state tend to form droplets .	We show that in this case the droplet boundary is always diffusive , as opposed to sharp , and find the corresponding density profiles ( droplet shapes ) .	Translation-invariant versions of the spherical model do not fix the spatial location of the droplet , hence lead to mixed phases .	To obtain pure macroscopic states ( which describe localized droplets ) we use generalized quasi-averaging .
3	Following Beig and Schmidt we treat relativistic elasticity as a Lagrangian field theory .	There are many different formulations of relativistic elasticity .	Most of them are only concerned with formal questions rather than questions regarding the PDE point of view .	The aim of this thesis is to obtain various local existence results for dynamical scenarios involving elastic matter .	The basic unknowns are mappings between spacetime and an abstract material manifold .
2	In contrast with the classical bistable interior reaction model , its behavior at the side of the invading state is of power type , while at the side of the invaded state its decay is exponential .	We prove the existence and uniqueness of a traveling front and of its speed for the homogeneous heat equation in the half-plane with a Neumann boundary reaction term of non-balanced bistable type or of combustion type .	We also establish the monotonicity of the front and , in the bistable case , its behavior at infinity .	These decay results rely on the construction of a family of explicit bistable traveling fronts .	Our existence results are obtained via a variational method , while the uniqueness of the speed and of the front rely on a comparison principle and the sliding method .
2	Second , we apply a hierarchical clustering method .	We present a new method for clustering based on compression .	The method does n't use subject-specific features or background knowledge , and works as follows : First , we determine a universal similarity distance , the normalized compression distance or NCD , computed from the lengths of compressed data files ( singly and in pairwise concatenation ) .	The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a specific application area , and works across application area boundaries .	A theoretical precursor , the normalized information distance , co-developed by one of the authors , is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of Kolmogorov complexity .
4	When the branes are moving , the effective Newtonian constant on the brane is shown to depend both on the distance between the branes and on their velocity .	Extending the analysis of hep-th/0504128 , we obtain a formal expression for the coupling between brane matter and the radion in a Randall-Sundrum braneworld .	This effective theory is correct to all orders in derivatives of the radion in the limit of small brane separation , and , in particular , contains no higher than second derivatives .	In the case of cosmological symmetry the theory can be obtained in closed form and reproduces the five-dimensional behaviour .	Perturbations in the tensor and scalar sectors are then studied .
0	We study the warm-tachyon inflationary universe model with viscous pressure in high-dissipation regime .	General conditions which are required for this model to be realizable are derived in the slow-roll approximation .	We present analytic expressions for density perturbation and amplitude of tensor perturbation in longitudinal gauge .	Expressions of tensor-to-scalar ratio , scalar spectral index and its running are obtained .	We develop our model by using exponential potential , the characteristics of this model are calculated for two specific cases in great details : 1- Dissipative parameter $ \Gamma $ and bulk viscous parameter $ \zeta $ are constant parameters .
2	This feature of the transmission line can be used to perform phase matching in a degenerate four-wave mixing process which can be utilized for parametric amplification of a weak signal in the presence of a strong pump .	A traveling wave parametric amplifier ( TWPA ) composed of a transmission line made up of a chain of coupled asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices ( SQUIDs ) is proposed .	The unique nature of this transmission line is that its nonlinearity can be tuned with an external magnetic flux and can even change sign .	Numerical simulations of the TWPA design have shown that with tuning , phase matching can be achieved and an exponential gain as a function of the transmission line length can be realized .	The flexibility of the proposed design can realize : compact TWPAs with less than 211 unit cells , signal gains greater than 20 dB , 3 dB bandwidth greater than 5.4 GHz , and saturation powers up to -98 dBm .
3	In addition we show that the axial U ( 1 ) anomaly becomes invisible in susceptibilities of scalar and pseudo scalar mesons , suggesting that the 2nd order chiral phase transition with the O ( 4 ) scaling is not realized in 2 flavor QCD .	We reconsider constraints on the eigenvalue density of the Dirac operator in the chiral symmetric phase of 2 flavor QCD at finite temperature .	To avoid possible ultra-violet ( UV ) divergences , we work on a lattice , employing the overlap Dirac operator , which ensures the exact `` chiral '' symmetry at finite lattice spacings .	Studying multi-point correlation functions in various channels and taking their thermodynamical limit ( and then taking the chiral limit ) , we obtain stronger constraints than those found in the previous studies : both the eigenvalue density at the origin and its first and second derivatives vanish in the chiral limit of 2 flavor QCD .	Possible lattice artifacts when non-chiral lattice Dirac operator is employed are briefly discussed .
0	High precision astrometry , space missions and certain tests of General Relativity , require the knowledge of the metric tensor of the solar system , or more generally , of a gravitational system of N extended bodies .	Presently , the metric of arbitrarily shaped , rotating , oscillating and arbitrarily moving N bodies of finite extension is only known for the case of slowly moving bodies in the post-Newtonian approximation , while the post-Minkowskian metric for arbitrarily moving celestial objects is known only for pointlike bodies with mass-monopoles and spin-dipoles .	As one more step towards the aim of a global metric for a system of N arbitrarily shaped and arbitrarily moving massive bodies in post-Minkowskian approximation , two central issues are on the scope of our investigation : ( i ) We first consider one extended body with full multipole structure in uniform motion in some suitably chosen global reference system .	For this problem a co-moving inertial system of coordinates can be introduced where the metric , outside the body , admits an expansion in terms of Damour-Iyer moments .	A Poincare transformation then yields the corresponding metric tensor in the global system in post-Minkowskian approximation .
2	Using the mentioned estimate we show that , unlike the Hofer norm , the spectral norm is C^0-continuous on surfaces .	In this article we study the behavior of the Oh-Schwarz spectral invariants under C^0-small perturbations of the Hamiltonian flow .	We obtain an estimate , which under certain assumptions , relates the spectral invariants of a Hamiltonian to the C^0-distance of its flow from the identity .	We also present applications of the above results to the theory of Calabi quasimorphisms and improve a result of Entov , Polterovich and Py .	In the final section of the paper we use our results to answer a question of Y.-G. Oh about spectral Hamiltonian homeomorphisms .
1	Occupancy and activity are two important aspects , which need to be correctly estimated for optimal HVAC control .	Much of the energy consumption in buildings is due to HVAC systems , which has motivated several recent studies on making these systems more energy- efficient .	However , state-of-the-art methods to estimate occupancy and classify activity require infrastructure and/or wearable sensors which suffers from lower acceptability due to higher cost .	Encouragingly , with the advancement of the smartphones , these are becoming more achievable .	Most of the existing occupancy estimation tech- niques have the underlying assumption that the phone is always carried by its user .
2	Algorithms combining soft thresholding with gradient descent are proposed for minimizing this new functional .	We consider a modification of the OMM energy functional which contains an $ \ell^1 $ penalty term in order to find a sparse representation of the low-lying eigenspace of self-adjoint operators .	We analyze the local minima of the modified functional as well as the convergence of the modified functional to the original functional .	Numerical tests validate our approach .	As an added bonus , we also prove the unanticipated and remarkable property that every local minimum the OMM functional without the $ \ell^1 $ term is also a global minimum .
0	The focused organization theory of social ties proposes that the structure of human social networks can be arranged around extra-network foci , which can include shared physical spaces such as homes , workplaces , restaurants , and so on .	Until now , this has been difficult to investigate on a large scale , but the huge volume of data available from online location-based social services now makes it possible to examine the friendships and mobility of many thousands of people , and to investigate the relationship between meetings at places and the structure of the social network .	In this paper , we analyze a large dataset from Foursquare , the most popular online location-based social network .	We examine the properties of city-based social networks , finding that they have common structural properties , and that the category of place where two people meet has very strong influence on the likelihood of their being friends .	Inspired by these observations in combination with the focused organization theory , we then present a model to generate city-level social networks , and show that it produces networks with the structural properties seen in empirical data .
4	The function is also close to an exponential when beta is near unity , irrespective of alpha .	A simple relaxation function I ( t/tauzero ; alpha , beta ) unifying the stretched exponential with the compressed hyperbola is obtained , and its properties studied .	The scaling parameter tauzero has dimensions of time , whereas the shape-determining parameters alpha and beta are dimensionless , both taking values between 0 and 1 .	For short times , the relaxation function is always exponential , with time constant tauzero .	For small values of alpha , the function is close to exponential for all times , irrespective of beta .
1	None of the stellar binaries currently known to host planets has a period shorter than 7 days , despite the large number of eclipsing binaries found in the Kepler target list with periods shorter than a few days .	The discovery of transiting circumbinary planets by the Kepler mission suggests that planets can form efficiently around binary stars .	These compact binaries are believed to have evolved from wider orbits into their current configurations via the so-called Lidov-Kozai migration mechanism , in which gravitational perturbations from a distant tertiary companion induce large-amplitude eccentricity oscillations in the binary , followed by orbital decay and circularization due to tidal dissipation in the stars .	Here we explore the orbital evolution of planets around binaries undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism .	We show that planets may survive and become misaligned from their host binary , or may develop erratic behavior in eccentricity , resulting in their consumption by the stars or ejection from the system as the binary decays .
1	The observation of UHE photons would extend the observed electromagnetic spectrum to highest energy and open a new channel for multimessenger observations in the universe .	The composition of ultra-high energy ( UHE ) cosmic rays E & gt ; 10^17 eV is still unknown .	Current limits on the photon flux already constrain `` exotic '' scenarios where a large number of photons is expected by the decay products of supermassive X-particles .	Motivated by the growing exposure of UHE cosmic ray experiments - like the Pierre Auger Observatory - the observation of conventionally produced GZK photons may be in reach in the near future .	We investigate UHE particle propagation using the Monte Carlo code CRPropa .
0	We propose a new method of unifying gravity and the Standard Model by introducing a spin-foam model .	We realize a unification between an SU ( 2 ) Yang-Mills interaction and 3D general relativity by considering a Spin ( 4 ) Plebanski action .	The theory is quantized a la spin-foam by implementing the analogue of the simplicial constraints for the broken phase of the Spin ( 4 ) SO ( 4 ) symmetry .	A natural 4D extension of the theory is shown .	We also present a way to recover 2-point correlation functions between the connections as a first way to implement scattering amplitudes between particle states , aiming to connect Loop Quantum Gravity to new physical predictions .
3	A complete optical multi-color afterglow light curve of XRF020903 obtained from archived data and photometric results in literature showed an achromatic brightening around 0.7 days .	We verified the off-axis jet model of X-ray flashes ( XRFs ) and examined a discovery of off-axis orphan gamma-ray burst ( GRBs ) afterglows .	The XRF sample was selected on the basis of the following three factors : ( 1 ) a constraint on the lower peak energy of the prompt spectrum $ E^ { src } _ { obs } $ , ( 2 ) redshift measurements , and ( 3 ) multi-color observations of an earlier ( or brightening ) phase .	XRF020903 was the only sample selected basis of these criteria .	An off-axis jet model with a large observing angle ( 0.21 rad , which is twice the jet opening half-angle , $ \theta_ { jet } $ ) can naturally describe the achromatic brightening and the prompt X-ray spectral properties .
1	We find that one of the hole-like Fermi surfaces is missing around the Gamma point compared to the case of LaFeAsO .	We have performed the first-principles electronic structure calculation for the novel superconductor Ca4Al2O6Fe2As2 which has the smallest a lattice parameter and the largest As height from the Fe plane among the Fe-As superconductors .	Analysis using the maximally-localized-Wannier-function technique indicates that the xy orbital becomes more localized as the As-Fe-As angle decreases .	This induces rearrangement of bands , which results in the change of the Fermi-surface topology of Ca4Al2O6Fe2As2 from that of LaFeAsO .	The strength of electron correlation is also evaluated using the constraint RPA method , and it turns out that Ca4Al2O6Fe2As2 is more correlated than LaFeAsO .
3	We also measure the polar and azimuthal anchoring strengths in nematic liquid crystal ( NLC ) cells aligned by the azo-dye films and derive the anchoring strengths as functions of the dichroic ratio .	We study both theoretically and experimentally anchoring properties of photoaligning azo-dye films in contact with a nematic liquid crystal depending on photoinduced ordering of azo-dye molecules .	In the mean field approximation , we found that the bare surface anchoring energy linearly depends on the azo-dye order parameter and the azimuthal anchoring strength decays to zero in the limit of vanishing photoinduced ordering .	From the absorption dichroism spectra measured in the azo-dye films that are prepared from the azo-dye derivative with polymerizable terminal groups ( SDA-2 ) we obtain dependence of the dichroic ratio on the irradiation dose .	Though linear fitting of the experimental data for both anchoring strengths gives reasonably well results , it , in contradiction with the theory , predicts vanishing of the azimuthal anchoring strength at certain nonzero value of the azo-dye order parameter .
2	This approach allows us to select optimized cut-off functions and to improve the accuracy of the critical exponents $ \nu $ and $ \eta $ .	We study the optimization of nonperturbative renormalization group equations truncated both in fields and derivatives .	On the example of the Ising model in three dimensions , we show that the Principle of Minimal Sensitivity can be unambiguously implemented at order $ \partial^2 $ of the derivative expansion .	The convergence of the field expansion is also analyzed .	We show in particular that its optimization does not coincide with optimization of the accuracy of the critical exponents .
1	Today this system is controversial due to choices that can be done in the orbital determination .	We have done a new analysis of the available observations for the GJ581 exoplanetary system .	The main ones are the ocurrence of aliases and the additional bodies - the planets f and g - announced in Vogt et al.2010 .	Any dynamical study of exoplanets requires the good knowledge of the orbital elements and the investigations involving the planet g are particularly interesting , since this body would lie in the Habitable Zone ( HZ ) of the star GJ581 .	This region , for this system , is very attractive of the dynamical point of view due to several resonances of two and three bodies present there .
0	We study the phase structure of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R^3XS^1 , with massive gauginos , periodic around the S^1 , with Sp ( 2N ) ( N & gt ; =2 ) , Spin ( N ) ( N & gt ; =5 ) , G_2 , F_4 , E_6 , E_7 , E_8 gauge groups .	As the gaugino mass m is increased , with S^1 size and strong coupling scale fixed , we find a first-order phase transition both for theories with and without a center .	This semiclassically calculable transition is driven , as in SU ( N ) and G_2 , arxiv.org/abs/1205.0290 and arxiv.org/abs/1212.1238 , by a competition between monopole-instantons and exotic topological `` molecules '' -- - '' neutral '' or `` magnetic '' bions .	We compute the trace of the Polyakov loop and its two-point correlator near the transition .	We find a behavior similar to the one observed near the thermal deconfinement transition in the corresponding pure Yang-Mills ( YM ) theory in lattice studies ( whenever available ) .
2	Special emphasis is placed in the most relevant mathematical aspects of the theoretical derivation of the final equations , as well as in the results regarding the existence and uniqueness of their solutions .	We present here a review of the fundamental topics of Hartree-Fock theory in Quantum Chemistry .	From the molecular Hamiltonian , using and discussing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation , we arrive to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations for the electronic problem .	All Hartree-Fock versions with different spin restrictions are systematically extracted from the general case , thus providing a unifying framework .	Then , the discretization of the one-electron orbitals space is reviewed and the Roothaan-Hall formalism introduced .
0	Anomalies can be viewed as arising from the cohomology of the Lie algebra of the group of gauge transformations and also from the topological cohomology of the group of connections modulo gauge transformations .	We show how these two approaches are unified by the transgression map .	We discuss the geometry behind the current commutator anomaly and the Faddeev- Mickelsson anomaly using the recent notion of a gerbe .	Some anomalies ( notably 3-cocycles ) do not have such a geometric origin .	We discuss one example and a conjecture on how these may be related to geometric anomalies .
3	We point out that general N=4 superconformal field theories admit two inequivalent flavour current multiplets and show that the three-point function of each of them is determined by one tensor structure .	We study implications of N=4 superconformal symmetry in three dimensions , thus extending our earlier results in arXiv:1503.04961 devoted to the N=1,2,3 cases .	We show that the three-point function of the supercurrent in N=4 superconformal field theories contains two linearly independent forms .	However , only one of these structures contributes to the three-point function of the energy-momentum tensor and the other one is present in those N=4 superconformal theories which are not invariant under the mirror map .	As an example , we compute the two- and three-point functions of the conserved currents in N=4 superconformal models of free hypermultiplets .
3	By using the above information theoretic observables it is possible to detect changes in the spatial structure of the ground states as the critical point is approached .	The information theoretic observables entropy ( a measure of disorder ) , excess entropy ( a measure of complexity ) and multi information are used to analyze ground-state spin configurations for disordered and frustrated model systems in 2D and 3D .	For both model systems , ground-state spin configurations can be obtained in polynomial time via exact combinatorial optimization algorithms , which allowed us to study large systems with high numerical accuracy .	Both model systems exhibit a continuous transition from an ordered to a disordered ground state as a model parameter is varied .	It is further possible to quantify the scaling behavior of the information theoretic observables in the vicinity of the critical point .
1	We extend previous models by implementing feedback in gravitationally bound clouds : momentum is injected at a rate proportional to the star formation rate .	We include feedback in global hydrodynamic simulations in order to study the star formation properties , and gas structure and dynamics , in models of galactic disks .	This mechanical energy disperses cloud gas back into the surrounding ISM , truncating star formation in a given cloud , and raising the overall level of ambient turbulence .	Propagating star formation can however occur as expanding shells collide , enhancing the density and triggering new cloud and star formation .	By controlling the momentum injection per massive star and the specific star formation rate in dense gas , we find that the negative effects of high turbulence outweigh the positive ones , and in net feedback reduces the fraction of dense gas and thus the overall star formation rate .

This paper demonstrates theoretical and experimental results of one of the secure multi-party computation protocols proposed by Shukla et al .	Data outflow probability is computed by changing parameters .
2	The temperature structure in the hot gas suggests the presence of a bubble or cavity around the fading AGN ( $ \mbox { E $ _ { \rm bub } $ } \sim 10^ { 54 } - 10^ { 55 } $ erg ) .	We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of the core of IC 2497 , the galaxy associated with Hanny 's Voorwerp and hosting a fading AGN .	We find extended soft X-ray emission from hot gas around the low intrinsic luminosity ( unobscured ) AGN ( $ L_ { \rm bol } \sim 10^ { 42 } -10^ { 44 } $ erg s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) .	A possible scenario is that this bubble is inflated by the fading AGN , which after changing accretion state is now in a kinetic mode .	Other possibilities are that the bubble has been inflated by the past luminous quasar ( $ L_ { \rm bol } \sim 10^ { 46 } $ erg s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) , or that the temperature gradient is an indication of a shock front from a superwind driven by the AGN .
4	So one finds that all the respective elements are troubled by insurmountable defects .	In spite \smallskip of their popularity the \QTR { bf } { H } eisenberg 's ( `` uncertainty '' ) \QTR { bf } { R } elations ( HR ) still generate controversies .	The \QTR { bf } { T } raditional \QTR { bf } { I } nterpretation of HR ( TIHR ) dominate our days science , although over the years a lot of its defects were signaled .	These facts justify a reinvestigation of the questions connected with the interpretation / significance of HR .	Here it is developped such a reinvestigation starting with a revaluation of the main elements of TIHR .
0	Aim of this work is to calculate explicitly the result of the experiment of superposition of a mirror in the Michelson photon cavities interferometric device proposed by Marshall , Simon , Penrose and Bownmeester , as expected within a recently proposed model of non-unitary self-gravity inducing localization .	As for other proposals of modifications of Quantum Mechanics in a non-unitary sense , aimed to account for both unitary evolution and irreversible collapse , like in the famous Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber and Pearle 's models , it turns out that , for the experimental parameters proposed , no effect is detectable at all .	It is pointed out that the enhancing properties of matter granularity does not substantially change this conclusion .	Parameters have also been exploratively varied in a certain range beyond the proposed values .	It is shown that within `sensible ' parameters , that are not yet attainable within current technology , the model exhibits a peculiar signature with respect to other collapse models as far as parameters space is explored .
3	We interpret it as HI Lyman break at z = 2.067+/-0.025 indicating the presence of a cloud with a HI column density log ( HI ) & gt ; 18 on the line-of-sight to the OT .	We present HST/STIS observations of the optical counterpart ( OT ) of the gamma-ray burster GRB 000301C obtained on 2000 March 6 , five days after the burst .	CCD clear aperture imaging reveals a R ~ 21.50+/-0.15 source with no apparent host galaxy .	An 8000 s , 1150 & lt ; lambda/A & lt ; 3300 NUV-MAMA prism spectrum shows a relatively flat continuum ( in f_lambda ) between 2800 and 3300 A , with a mean flux 8.7 ( +0.8 , -1.6 ) +/- 2.6 10^ ( -18 ) ergs/s/cm^2/A , and a sharp break centered at 2797+/-25 A .	This value is conservatively a lower limit to the GRB redshift .
0	Nonequilibrium , `` fast switching '' estimates of equilibrium free energy differences , Delta F , are often plagued by poor convergence due to dissipation .	We propose a method to improve these estimates by generating trajectories with reduced dissipation .	Introducing an artificial flow field that couples the system coordinates to the external parameter driving the simulation , we derive an identity for Delta F in terms of the resulting trajectories .	When the flow field effectively escorts the system along a near-equilibrium path , the free energy estimate converges efficiently and accurately .	We illustrate our method on a model system , and discuss the general applicability of our approach .
4	Different approaches to the calculation of Casimir energy of a dielectric ball are reviewed .	General formalism of quantum field theory and addition theorem for Bessel functions are applied to derive formula for Casimir-Polder energy of interaction between a polarizable particle and a dilute dielectric ball .	The equivalence of dipole-dipole interaction and Casimir energy for dilute homogeneous dielectrics is shown .	A novel method is used to derive Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball without divergences in calculations .	Physically realistic model of a dilute ball is discussed .
3	The pairing interaction ( ICP ) alone leads to a finite transition rate .	We study the response of isovector orbital magnetic dipole ( IOMD ) transitions to the quadrupole-quadrupole ( $ Q \cdot Q $ ) interaction , to the isospin-conserving pairing interaction ( ICP ) and to combinations of both .	We find qualitatively different behaviours for transitions in which the final isospin differs from the initial isospin versus cases where the two isospins are the same .	For $ N=Z $ even-even nuclei with $ J^ { \pi } =0^+ , T=0 $ ground states such as $ ^8Be $ and $ ^ { 20 } Ne $ , the summed $ T=0 \to T=1 $ IOMD from the ground state to all the $ J=1 , T=1 $ states in the $ 0 \hbar \omega $ space does not vanish when the $ Q \cdot Q $ interaction is turned off .	For nuclei with $ J=0^+ , T=1 $ ground states such as $ ^ { 10 } Be $ and $ ^ { 22 } Ne $ , the summed $ T=1 \to T=1 $ IOMD $ does $ vanish when the $ Q \cdot Q $ interaction is turned off , as is expected in a good scissors-mode behaviour .
1	The semifluxon spontaneously appears at the $ \pi $ discontinuity of the Josephson phase artificially created by means of two tiny current injectors .	We demonstrate a high-frequency generator operating at ~200GHz based on flipping a semifluxon in a Josephson junction of moderate normalized length .	The radiation is detected by an on-chip detector ( tunnel junction ) .	The estimated radiation power ( at the detector ) is ~8nW and should be compared with the dc power of ~100nW consumed by the generator .	The measured radiation linewidth , as low as 1.1MHz , is typical for geometrical ( Fiske ) resonances although we tried to suppress such resonances by placing well-matched microwave transformers at its both ends .
3	The world function $ \sigma $ of this model has the form $ \sigma =\sigma_E+\sigma_ { 0 } $ , $ \sigma_E & gt ; \sigma_ { 0 } $ , where \sigma_E is the world function of the pseudo-Euclidean space , \sigma_0 is a constant responsible for quantum effects .	A class of homogeneous isotropic space-time models including pseudo-Euclidean space as a special case is considered .	Such a model is chosen , where the particle motion is described in the most adequate way .	It means that the world tubes of all free particles ( both classical and quantal ) are characteristic geometrical structures of the space-time .	It is proportional to Planck 's constant \hbar .
0	Auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo methods for Hubbard models are generally based on a Hubbard-Stratonovitch transformation where the field couples to the z-component of the spin .	This transformation breaks SU ( 2 ) spin invariance .	The symmetry is restored only after summation over the auxiliary fields .	Here , we analyze an alternative decomposition , which conserves SU ( 2 ) spin invariance , but requires the use of complex numbers .	We show that this algorithm gets rid of the very large fluctuations observed in imaginary time displaced correlation functions of quantities which do not commute with the z-component of the total spin .
2	The phases and phase transitions are worked out for finite and infinite short-distance cutoffs .	We perform a global renormalization group study of O ( N ) symmetric Wess-Zumino theories and their phases in three euclidean dimensions .	At infinite N the theory is solved exactly .	A distinctive new feature arises at strong coupling , where the effective superfield potential becomes multi-valued , signalled by divergences in the fermion-boson interaction .	Our findings resolve the long-standing puzzle about the occurrence of degenerate O ( N ) symmetric phases .
1	Our treatment uses third order perturbation theory including off-diagonal hyperfine interactions not considered in earlier treatments .	We present a new theoretical analysis of the strongly suppressed F- and M-dependent Stark shifts of the Cs ground state hyperfine structure .	A numerical evaluation of the perturbation sum using bound states up to n=200 yields ground state tensor polarizabilities which are in good agreement with experimental values , thereby bridging the 40-year-old gap between experiments and theory .	We have further found that the tensor polarizabilities of the two ground state hyperfine manifolds have opposite signs , in disagreement with an earlier derivation .	This sign error has a direct implication for the precise evaluation of the blackbody radiation shift in primary frequency standards .
3	We detected the CO line in only Mrk 109 .	We report on observations of CO ( 1-0 ) emission from the chemically young starburst galaxy Mrk 109 .	These observations were part of a study to constrain the O2/CO ratio in metal-deficient galaxies , which were motivated by theoretical work that suggests the possible enhancement of the O2/CO ratio in chemically young systems .	Five low metallicity ( Z & lt ; 0.5 Z ( solar ) ) IRAS galaxies at redshifts z & gt ; 0.02 ( required to shift the 118.75 GHz O2 line away from the atmospheric line ) were searched for CO emission .	From O2 observations of Mrk 109 , we achieved an upper limit for the O2 column density abundance ratio of N ( O2 ) /N ( CO ) & lt ; 0.31 .
1	For a vacant benzene dicarboxylate ligand , the lowest energy charge capping mechanism involves acetic acid or Cl-/H2O .	We report an investigation of the `` missing-linker phenomenon '' in the Zr-based metal-organic framework UiO-66 using atomistic forcefield and quantum chemical methods .	The calculated defect free energy of formation is remarkably low , consistent with the high defect concentrations reported experimentally .	A dynamic structural instability is identified for certain higher defect concentrations .	In addition to the changes in material properties upon defect formation , we assess the formation of molecular aggregates , which provide an additional driving force for ligand loss .
2	For the case of LuRh2Si2 - the non-magnetic reference compound of YbRh2Si2 - the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient is described quantitatively to arise from two hole-like bands .	We report experimental and theoretical investigations of the Hall effect in YbRh2Si2 and its reference compounds LuRh2Si2 and YbIr2Si2 .	Based on band-structure calculations we identify two bands dominating the Hall coefficient in all these compounds .	For YbIr2Si2 and YbRh2Si2 , renormalized band calculations yield two bands of opposite character .	In YbRh2Si2 these two bands almost compensate each other .
1	More precisely , the assumption of Del Popolo and Eksi that the surface density in planetesimals is proportional to that of gas is released .	In this paper , we further develop the model for the migration of planets introduced in Del Popolo , Gambera and Ercan , and extended to time-dependent planetesimal accretion disks in Del Popolo and Eksi .	Indeed , the evolution of the radial distribution of solids is governed by many processes : gas-solid coupling , coagulation , sedimentation , evaporation/condensation , so that the distribution of planetesimals emerging from a turbulent disk does not necessarily reflect that of gas .	In order to describe this evolution we use a method developed in Stepinski and Valageas which , using a series of simplifying assumptions , is able to simultaneously follow the evolution of gas and solid particles for up to $ 10^7 { \rm yr } $ .	Then , the distribution of planetesimals obtained after $ 10^7 { \rm yr } $ is used to study the migration rate of a giant planet through the migration model introduced in \cite { DP1 } .
4	In addition , we develop an algorithm to directly simulate the asymptotically strong magnetic field limit of QCD .	Lattice simulations have demonstrated that a background ( electro ) magnetic field reduces the chiral/deconfinement transition temperature of quantum chromodynamics for eB & lt ; 1 GeV^2 .	On the level of observables , this reduction manifests itself in an enhancement of the Polyakov loop and in a suppression of the light quark condensates ( inverse magnetic catalysis ) in the transition region .	In this paper , we report on lattice simulations of 1+1+1-flavor QCD at an unprecedentedly high value of the magnetic field eB = 3.25 GeV^2 .	Based on the behavior of various observables , it is shown that even at this extremely strong field , inverse magnetic catalysis prevails and the transition , albeit becoming sharper , remains an analytic crossover .
4	This method provides the only way to study the up/down asymmetry beyond Multi-GeV region which is yet to be measured experimentally .	We discuss a possible test of neutrino oscillation hypothesis by proposing the combined analysis of high energy atmospheric neutrino induced muon events that have been detected around horizontal direction in the Kolar Gold Field ( KGF ) underground site and below the horizontal direction by many large detectors such as Super-Kamiokande and MACRO .	Up/down asymmetry obtained using contained events recorded by detectors at Kamioka site probes low energy region of atmospheric neutrino whereas , the suggested method probes high energy neutrinos .	It mainly depends on the observations and it is free of uncertainties in neutrino flux , interaction cross section etc .	In this paper we demonstrate that the method is sensitive to a region of oscillation parameter space that explains all the features of atmospheric neutrino data in the Super-Kamiokande detector ; the limiting factor being the statistical strength of the KGF observations .
2	We point out that there is no obvious contradiction with experiment if { \it coherent } collections of particles with bulk energy of order $ E_P $ do indeed display Planckian behavior , a possibility that would open a new experimental window .	In quantum gravity theories Planckian behavior is triggered by the energy of { \it elementary } particles approaching the Planck energy , $ E_P $ , but it 's also possible that anomalous behavior strikes systems of particles with total energy near $ E_P $ .	This is usually perceived to be pathological and has been labelled `` the soccer ball problem '' .	Unfortunately field theory realizations of deformed special relativity never exhibit a `` soccer ball problem '' ; we present several formulations where this is undeniably true .	Upon closer scrutiny we discover that the only chance for Planckian behavior to be triggered by large coherent energies involves the details of second quantization .
4	We study the full range of alpha , both in the positive and negative sectors .	We find the static spherically symmetric solutions ( with vanishing shift function ) of the complete nonprojectable Horava theory explicitly , writing the space-time metrics as explicit tensors in local coordinate systems .	This completes previous works of other authors that have studied the same configurations .	The solutions depend on the coupling constant alpha of the ( partial_i ln N ) ^2 term .	The lambda = 1/3 case of the theory does not possess any extra mode , hence the range of alpha is in principle not limited by the linear stability of any extra mode .
3	The proof is based on a representation of surfaces in 4-space by marked graphs , links with double intersections in 3-space .	The hexabasic book is the cone of the 1-dimensional skeleton of the union of two tetrahedra glued along a common face .	The universal 3-dimensional polyhedron UP is the product of a segment and the hexabasic book .	We show that any 2-dimensional link in 4-space is isotopic to a surface in UP .	We construct a finitely presented semigroup whose central elements uniquely encode all isotopy classes of 2-dimensional links .
2	We explore the physically motivated conditions that give rise to the observed steep disc-reflection emissivity profiles .	X-ray reflection off the accretion disc surrounding a black hole , together with the associated broad iron K $ \alpha $ line , has been widely used to constrain the innermost accretion-flow geometry and black hole spin .	Some recent measurements have revealed steep reflection emissivity profiles in a number of active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries .	We perform a set of simulations based on the configuration of a possible future high-resolution X-ray mission .	Computations are carried out for typical X-ray bright Seyfert-1 galaxies .
3	We present the mass matrices for quarks including heavy KK modes and discuss the neutral and charged currents involving light and heavy fields .	We present the electroweak and flavour structure of a model with a warped extra dimension and the bulk gauge group SU ( 3 ) x SU ( 2 ) _L x SU ( 2 ) _R x P_LR x U ( 1 ) _X .	The presence of SU ( 2 ) _R implies an unbroken custodial symmetry in the Higgs system allowing to eliminate large contributions to the T parameter , whereas the P_LR symmetry and the enlarged fermion representations provide a custodial symmetry for flavour diagonal and flavour changing couplings of the SM Z boson to left-handed down-type quarks .	We diagonalise analytically the mass matrices of charged and neutral gauge bosons including the first KK modes .	We give the corresponding complete set of Feynman rules in the unitary gauge .
2	This is very different from the behavior in continuum .	Rotation of atoms in a lattice is studied using a Hubbard model .	It is found that the atoms are still contained in the trap even when the rotation frequency is larger than the trapping frequency .	Bragg scattering and coupling between angular and radial motion are believed to make this stability possible .	In this regime , density depletion at the center of the trap can be developed for spin polarized fermions .
2	For each channel , we take into account of the interaction between the external particle and every possible charmed baryon in the triplet , sextet , and excited sextet .	We have systematically calculated the pseudoscalar Goldstone boson and charmed baryon scattering lengths to the third order with heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory .	The scattering lengths can reveal the interaction of $ K \Lambda_c $ , $ K \Sigma_c $ , $ \pi \Omega_c $ etc .	We use dimensional regularization and modified minimal subtraction to get rid of the divergences in the loop-diagram corrections .	We notice that the convergence of chiral expansion for most of the channels becomes better after we let the low energy constants absorb the analytic contributions of the loop-diagram corrections and keep the nonanalytic terms only .
1	Three models distinguished by dipole vectors which have one , two or three components are studied by computer simulation .	This letter addresses basic questions concerning ferroelectric order in positionally disordered dipolar materials .	Randomly frozen and dynamically disordered media are considered .	It is shown that ferroelectric order is possible in spatially random systems , but that its existence is very sensitive to the dipole vector dimensionality and the motion of the medium .	A physical analysis of our results provides significant insight into the nature of ferroelectric transitions .
1	The ground state of this model features two spins out ( /in ) and one spin in ( /out ) on each triangle , and leads to a macroscopic ground state degeneracy .	We study a local ferromagnetic Ising model for classical spins on the trillium lattice .	Our Monte Carlo simulations find a ground state entropy intermediate to that of spin ice on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices , suggesting that trillium spin ice is highly frustrated .	To motivate the search for trillium spin ice , we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and structure factor .	We note the qualitative resemblance of the susceptibility to previously published work on EuPtSi , which features local moments on the trillium lattice .
1	The single-species model belongs to the directed percolation ( DP ) universality class .	We study the effects of hard core ( HC ) interactions between different species of particles on two-species branching annihilating random walks with one offspring ( BAW $ _2 $ ( 1 ) ) .	In the BAW $ _2 $ ( 1 ) model , a particle creates one particle of the same species in its neighborhood with the probability $ \sigma ( 1-p ) $ and of the different species with $ ( 1-\sigma ) ( 1-p ) $ , where $ p $ is the hopping probability .	Without HC interactions , this model always exhibits the DP-type absorbing transition for all $ \sigma $ .	Even with HC interactions , the nature of the phase transitions does not change except near $ \sigma=0 $ , where the HC interaction destabilizes and completely wipes away the absorbing phase .
0	For almost 35 years , Sch { \ '' o } nhage-Strassen 's algorithm has been thefastest algorithm known for multiplying integers , with a time complexity $ O ( n \cdot \log n \cdot \log \relax \log n ) $ for multiplying $ n $ -bit inputs .	In 2007 , F { \ '' u } rer proved that there exists $ K\textgreater { } 1 $ and an algorithm performing thisoperation in $ O ( n \cdot \log n \cdot K^ { \log^* n } ) $ .	Recent work by Harvey , van der Hoeven , and Lecerf showed that this complexity estimate can be improved in order to get $ K=8 $ , andconjecturally $ K=4 $ .	We obtain here the same result $ K=4 $ using simplemodular arithmetic as a building block , and a careful complexityanalysis .	We obtain a similar result $ K=4 $ using an alternative somewhat simpler algorithm , which relies on arithmetic modulo generalized Fermat primes .
4	In turn , second order convergence in both time and space is established in a discrete L^\infty ( 0 , T ; H^3 ) norm .	In this paper we provide a detailed convergence analysis for an unconditionally energy stable , second-order accurate convex splitting scheme for the Modified Phase Field Crystal equation , a generalized damped wave equation for which the usual Phase Field Crystal equation is a special degenerate case .	The fully discrete , fully second-order finite difference scheme in question was derived in a recent work [ 2 ] .	An introduction of a new variable \psi , corresponding to the temporal derivative of the phase variable \phi , could bring an accuracy reduction in the formal consistency estimate , because of the hyperbolic nature of the equation .	A higher order consistency analysis by an asymptotic expansion is performed to overcome this difficulty .
1	We show that as a result of this qualitative difference from single-layer graphene , short-range ( or screened Coulomb ) interactions are marginally relevant .	Low-energy electronic structure of ( unbiased ) bilayer graphene is made of two Fermi points with quadratic dispersions , if trigonal-warping and other high order contributions are ignored .	We use renormalization group to study their effects on low-energy properties of the system , and show that the two quadratic Fermi points spontaneously split into four Dirac points , at zero temperature .	This results in a nematic state that spontaneously breaks the six-fold lattice rotation symmetry ( combined with layer permutation ) down to a two-fold one , with a finite transition temperature .	Critical properties of the transition and effects of trigonal warping are also discussed .
2	We have also discovered a new group at ( U , V ) = ( 92 , -22 ) km/s in the Solar neighbourhood and confirmed the significance of other previously found groups .	We analyse the kinematics of disc stars observed by the RAVE survey in and beyond the Solar neighbourhood.We detect significant overdensities in the velocity distributions using a technique based on the wavelet transform.We find that the main local kinematic groups are large scale features , surviving at least up to ~1 kpc from the Sun in the direction of anti-rotation , and also at ~700 pc below the Galactic plane.We also find that for regions located at different radii than the Sun , the known groups appear shifted in the velocity plane .	For example , the Hercules group has a larger azimuthal velocity for regions inside the Solar circle and a lower value outside .	Some of these trends detected for the first time are consistent with dynamical models of the effects of the bar and the spiral arms .	More modelling is required to definitively characterise the non-axisymmetric components of our Galaxy using these groups .
4	Both scenarios predict a high energy cut-off in the gamma-ray energy spectrum , but with different cut-off sharpness .	My thesis deals with a fundamental question of high energy gamma-ray astronomy .	Namely , I studied the cut-off shape of the Crab pulsar spectrum to distinguish between the leading scenarios for the pulsar models .	Pulsars are celestial objects , which emit periodic pulsed electromagnetic radiation ( pulsation ) from radio to high energy gamma-rays .	Two major scenarios evolved in past 40 years to explain the pulsation mechanism : the inner magnetosphere scenario and the outer magnetosphere scenario .
3	We also find that , when expressed in units of the dynamical length scale of the theory , the dimensionful coupling g^2 is proportional to 1/N at large N. We confirm that these theories are indeed confining in the limit N \to \infty .	We compare the mass spectra and string tensions of SU ( 2 ) , SU ( 3 ) and SU ( 4 ) gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions .	We find that the ratios of masses are , to a first approximation , independent of N and that the remaining dependence can be accurately reproduced by a simple O ( 1/N^2 ) correction .	This provides us with a prediction of these mass ratios for all SU ( N ) theories in 2+1 dimensions and demonstrates that these theories are `close ' to N=\infty for N\geq 2 .	We describe preliminary calculations in 3+1 dimensions which indicate that the same will be true there .
1	Practical considerations , usually locate the knee region between 70-90 % of the theoretical maximum utilization .	Performance curves of queuing systems can be analyzed by separating them into three regions : the flat region , the knee region , and the exponential region .	However , there is not a clear agreement about where the boundaries between regions are , and where exactly the utilization knee is located .	An open debate about knees in performance curves was undertaken at least 20 years ago .	This historical debate is mainly divided between those who claim that a knee in the curve is not a well-defined term in mathematics , or it is a subjective and not really meaningful concept , and those who define knees mathematically and consider their relevance and application .
4	We develop the algorithm for this shower including scale choices and angular ordering .	We present a new algorithm for an analytic parton shower .	While the algorithm for the final-state shower has been known in the literature , the construction of an initial-state shower along these lines is new .	The aim is to have a parton shower algorithm for which the full analytic form of the probability distribution for all branchings is known .	For these parton shower algorithms it is therefore possible to calculate the probability for a given event to be generated , providing the potential to reweight the event after the simulation .
2	The targets are mostly { } `` Canada-France Redshift Survey '' emission-line galaxies , with the addition of field galaxies randomly selected behind lensing clusters .	We present the spectrophotometric properties of a sample of 141 emission-line galaxies at redshifts in the range $ 0.2 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.0 $ with a peak around $ z\in [ 0.2,0.4 ] $ .	The analysis is based on medium resolution ( $ R\_ { \mathrm { s } } =500-600 $ ) , optical spectra obtained at VLT and Keck .	We complement this sample with galaxy spectra from the { } `` Gemini Deep Deep Survey '' public data release .	We have computed absolute magnitudes of the galaxies and measured the line fluxes and equivalent widths of the main emission/absorption lines .
3	We study the parameter- and moduli- space perturbatively .	We examine the weak coupling limit of Euclidean SU ( n ) gauge theory in covariant gauges .	Following an earlier suggestion , an equivariant BRST-construction is used to define the continuum theory on a finite torus .	The equivariant gauge fixing introduces constant ghost fields as moduli of the model .	For $ n_f \leq n $ quark flavors , the moduli flow to a non-trivial fixed point in certain critical covariant gauges and the one-loop effective potential indicates that the global SU ( n ) color symmetry of the gauge fixed model is spontaneously broken to $ U ( 1 ) ^ { n-1 } $ .
2	Here we include beneficial mutations and obtain exact expressions for the frequency distribution at all times using an eigenfunction expansion method .	We study a continuous time model for the frequency distribution of an infinitely large asexual population in which both beneficial and deleterious mutations occur and the fitness is additive .	When beneficial mutations are ignored , the exact solution for the frequency distribution is known to be a Poisson distribution .	We find that the stationary distribution is non-Poissonian and related to the Bessel function of the first kind .	We also provide suitable approximations for the stationary distribution and the time to relax to the steady state .
3	FN marks or drops packets at fairly regular intervals to avoid long intermarking intervals and clustered packet marks or drops .	Fast Congestion Notification ( FN ) is one of the proactive queue management mechanisms that practices congestion avoidance to help avoid the beginning of congestion by marking or dropping packets before the routers queue gets full ; and exercises congestion control , when congestion avoidance fails , by increasing the rate of packet marking or dropping .	Technically , FN avoids the queue overflows by controlling the instantaneous queue size below the optimal queue size , and control congestion by keeping the average arrival rate close to the outgoing link capacity .	Upon arrival of each packet , FN uses the instantaneous queue size and the average arrival rate to calculate the packet marking or dropping probability .	Too many marked or dropped packets close together can cause global synchronization , and also too long packet intermarking times between marked or dropped packets can cause large queue sizes and congestion .
1	The agents are represented by a cell of $ L \times L $ square lattice .	The Prisoner 's Dilemma ( PD ) deals with the cooperation/defection conflict between two agents .	The agents are initially randomly distributed according to a certain proportion $ \rho_c ( 0 ) $ of cooperators .	Each agent does not have memory of previous behaviors and plays the PD with eight nearest neighbors and then copies the behavior of who had the greatest payoff for next generation .	This system shows that , when the conflict is established , cooperation among agents may emerge even for reasonably high defection temptation values .
4	The KamLAND monitoring system consists of various network , LON , 1-Wire , and TCP/IP , and these are indispensable for continuous experimental data acquisition .	In January 22 , 2002 , KamLAND started the data-taking .	The KamLAND detector is a complicated system which consists of liquid scintillator , buffer oil , spherical balloon and so on .	In order to maintain the detector safety , we constructed monitoring system which collect detector status information such as balloon weight , liquid scintillator oil level and so on .	In addition , we constructed continuous Rn monitoring system for the $ ^7 $ Be solar neutrino detection .
1	The strongly correlated f-electrons of Ce are described by a Hubbard-type on-site Coulomb repulsion parameter .	Structural and electronic properties of the alpha- and gamma-phases of cerium sesquisulfide , Ce2S3 , are examined by first-principles calculations using the GGA+U extension of density functional theory .	A single parameter of $ U^/prime $ =4 eV yields excellent results for crystal structures , band gaps , and thermodynamic stability for both Ce2S3 allotropes .	This approach gives insights in the difference in color of brownish-black alpha-Ce2S3 and dark red gamma-Ce2S3 .	The calculations predict that both Ce2S3 modifications are insulators with optical gaps of 0.8 eV ( alpha-phase ) and 1.8 eV ( gamma-phase ) .
2	The polarization transfer observables are used to deduce the spin-longitudinal cross section , $ ID_q $ , and spin-transverse cross sections , $ ID_p $ and $ ID_n $ .	Differential cross sections and complete sets of polarization observables are presented for the Gamow-Teller $ ^ { 12 } { \rm C } ( \vec { p } , \vec { n } ) ^ { 12 } { \rm N } ( { \rm g.s .	} ,1^+ ) $ reaction at a bombarding energy of 296 MeV with momentum transfers $ q $ of 0.1 to $ 2.2 { \rm fm } ^ { -1 } $ .	The data are compared with calculations based on the distorted wave impulse approximation ( DWIA ) using shell-model wave functions .	Significant differences between the experimental and theoretical results are observed for all three spin-dependent $ ID_i $ at momentum transfers of $ q \gtrsim 0.5 { \rm fm } ^ { -1 } $ , suggesting the existence of nuclear correlations beyond the shell model .
0	We present the characteristics of the X-ray variability of stars in the cluster NGC2516 as derived from XMM-Newton/EPIC/pn data .	The X-ray variations on short ( hours ) , medium ( months ) , and long ( years ) time scales have been explored .	We detected 303 distinct X-ray sources by analysing six EPIC/pn observations ; 194 of them are members of the cluster .	Stars of all spectral types , from the early-types to the late-M dwarfs , were detected .	The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test applied to the X-ray photon time series shows that , on short time scales , only a relatively small fraction ( ranging from 6 % to 31 % for dG and dF , respectively ) of the members of NGC2516 are variable with a confidence level $ \geq $ 99 % ; however , it is possible that the fraction is small only because of the poor statistics .
1	In order to exploit the beneficial tunability of quantum dots for highly efficient devices , optimization and determination of the performance limit are of crucial importance .	Colloidal quantum dots are promising next-generation phosphors to enhance the color rendition of light-emitting devices ( LEDs ) while minimizing the brightness drop .	In this work , a facile preparation process of red-emission quantum dot films and simulation algorithm for fitting this film with two commercial LED flat lamps to the optimized performance are developed .	Based on the algorithm , one lamp improves from cold-white light ( 8669 K ) with poor color rendition ( $ R_ { a } =72 $ ) and luminous efficacy ( 85 lm/W ) to warm-white light ( 2867 K ) with $ R_ { a } =90.8 $ and $ R_ { 9 } =74.9 $ , and the other reaches $ R_ { a } =93\sim95 $ .	Impressively , the brightness drop is only about $ 15\sim20\ % $ .
2	Einstein equations result , according to that formalism , in a coupled elliptic-hyperbolic system .	Bonazzola , Gourgoulhon , Grandcl\'ement , and Novak [ Phys.Rev .	D { \bf 70 } , 104007 ( 2004 ) ] proposed a new formulation for 3+1 numerical relativity .	We have carried out a preliminary analysis of the mathematical structure of that system , in particular focusing on the equations governing the evolution for the deviation of a conformal metric from a flat fiducial one .	The choice of a Dirac 's gauge for the spatial coordinates guarantees the mathematical characterization of that system as a ( strongly ) hyperbolic system of conservation laws .
3	For cycles we give a full trichotomy -- all such problems are in L , NP-complete or Pspace-complete .	We initiate the study of constraint satisfaction problems ( CSPs ) in the presence of counting quantifiers , which may be seen as variants of CSPs in the mould of quantified CSPs ( QCSPs ) .	We show that a single counting quantifier strictly between exists^1 : =exists and exists^n : =forall ( the domain being of size n ) already affords the maximal possible complexity of QCSPs ( which have both exists and forall ) , being Pspace-complete for a suitably chosen template .	Next , we focus on the complexity of subsets of counting quantifiers on clique and cycle templates .	For cliques we come close to a similar trichotomy , but one case remains outstanding .
3	Indeed , the practical problem in uncovering an underlying discrete scale invariance is that standard ensemble averaging procedures destroy it as if it was pure noise .	Discrete scale invariance , which corresponds to a partial breaking of the scaling symmetry , is reflected in the existence of a hierarchy of characteristic scales l0 , c l0 , c^2 l0 , ... where c is a preferred scaling ratio and l0 a microscopic cut-off .	Signatures of discrete scale invariance have recently been found in a variety of systems ranging from rupture , earthquakes , Laplacian growth phenomena , `` animals '' in percolation to financial market crashes .	We believe it to be a quite general , albeit subtle phenomenon .	This is due to the fact , that while c only depends on the underlying physics , l0 on the contrary is realisation-dependent .
2	A shock front appears during its initial collapse , moving outward as ambient gas accretes towards cluster center .	Evolutions of X-ray clusters of galaxies are studied by N-body ( shell model ) + mesh code ( TVD ) simulations on the assumption of spherical symmetry .	We consider a density perturbation of $ 10^ { 15 } M_ { \odot } $ composed of dark matter and gas in cold dark matter dominated universe with the cosmological density parameter , $ \Omega_0 = 1 $ or $ 0.2 $ .	The shock front separates the inner X-ray emitting , hot region , where gas is almost in hydrostatic equilibrium but with small radial infall ( $ \sim 100 $ km s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) being left , from the outer cool region .	Gas inside the shock is strongly compressed and heated by shock so that X-ray luminosity rapidly rises in the early stage .
2	This alters the behaviour of the model considerably .	We present a two-dimensional lattice gas with anisotropic interactions which model the known properties of the surface reconstructions of CdTe and ZnSe .	In constrast to an earlier publication [ 12 ] , the formation of anion dimers is considered .	We determine the phase diagram of this model by means of transfer matrix calculations and Monte Carlo simulations .	We find qualitative agreement with the results of various experimental investigations .
3	Also , 10-fold cross-validation and sets of performance metrics were used to evaluate the baseline predictive performance of the classifiers .	A lot of time is spent searching for the most performing data mining algorithms applied in clinical diagnosis .	The study set out to identify the most performing predictive data mining algorithms applied in the diagnosis of Erythemato-squamous diseases .	The study used Naive Bayes , Multilayer Perceptron and J48 decision tree induction to build predictive data mining models on 366 instances of Erythemato-squamous diseases datasets .	The comparative analysis shows that the Naive Bayes performed best with accuracy of 97.4 % , Multilayer Perceptron came out second with accuracy of 96.6 % , and J48 came out the worst with accuracy of 93.5 % .
4	Numerical results will also indicate that the new constructed codebook is optimal in terms of coding rate .	Signal-time coding , which combines the traditional encoding/modulation mode in the signal domain with signal pulse phase modulation in the time domain , was proposed to improve the information flow rate in relay networks .	In this paper , we mainly focus on the efficient signal-time coding design .	We first derive an explicit iterative algorithm to estimate the maximum number of available codes given the code length of signal-time coding , and then present an iterative construction method of codebooks .	It is shown that compared with conventional computer search , the proposed iterative construction method can reduce the complexity greatly .
2	We provide a control algorithm that combines the two hybrid controllers to accomplish the stabilization task .	The problem of robustly , asymptotically stabilizing a point ( or a set ) with two output-feedback hybrid controllers is considered .	These control laws may have different objectives , e.g. , the closed-loop systems resulting with each controller may have different attractors .	The algorithm consists of a hybrid supervisor that , based on the values of plant 's outputs and ( norm ) state estimates , selects the hybrid controller that should be applied to the plant .	The accomplishment of the stabilization task relies on an output-to-state stability property induced by the controllers , which enables the construction of an estimator for the norm of the plant 's state .
2	The strong interaction leads to significant renormalization of the gap between adiabatic levels .	We introduce the Global Spin Model to study the static and dynamic properties of the ultracold fermionic gas near the broad Feshbach resonance .	We show that the problem of molecular production , in a single-mode approximation , is reduced to the linear Landau-Zener problem for operators .	In contrast to static problem the close vicinity of exact resonance does not play substantial role .	Two main physical results of our theory is the high sensitivity of molecular production to the initial value of magnetic field and generation of a large BCS condensate distributed over a broad range of momenta in a wide range of parameters .
4	Further , stain and intrinsic electric field can be used to tune the electronic structure and enhance the energy gap .	Quantum spin Hall ( QSH ) insulators possess edge states that are topologically protected from backscattering .	However , known QSH materials ( e.g.HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb quantum wells ) exhibit very small energy gap and only work at low temperature , hindering their applications for room temperature devices .	Based on the first-principles calculations , we predict a novel family of QSH insulators in monolayer tantalum carbide halide TaCX ( X = Cl , Br , and I ) with unique rectangular lattice and large direct energy gaps larger than 0.2 eV , accurately , 0.23 $ - $ 0.36 eV .	The mechanism for 2D QSH effect in this system originates from a intrinsic d $ - $ d band inversion , different from conventional QSH systems with band inversion between s $ - $ p or p $ - $ p orbitals .
3	We find two distinct condensate regimes : one where the condensate is gaussian distributed and the particle number fluctuations scale normally as $ L^ { 1/2 } $ where $ L $ is the system size , and a second regime where the particle number fluctuations become anomalously large and the condensate peak is non-gaussian .	We study the phenomenon of real space condensation in the steady state of a class of mass transport models where the steady state factorises .	The grand canonical ensemble may be used to derive the criterion for the occurrence of a condensation transition but does not shed light on the nature of the condensate .	Here , within the canonical ensemble , we analyse the condensation transition and the structure of the condensate , determining the precise shape and the size of the condensate in the condensed phase .	Our results are asymptotically exact and can also be interpreted within the framework of sums of random variables .
3	Using $ ( k , m ) $ -CDS can tolerate the failure of $ \min\ { k-1 , m-1\ } $ nodes .	Using connected dominating set ( CDS ) to serve as a virtual backbone in a wireless networks can save energy and reduce interference .	Since nodes may fail due to accidental damage or energy depletion , it is desirable that the virtual backbone has some fault-tolerance .	A $ k $ -connected $ m $ -fold dominating set ( $ ( k , m ) $ -CDS ) of a graph $ G $ is a node set $ D $ such that every node in $ V\setminus D $ has at least $ m $ neighbors in $ D $ and the subgraph of $ G $ induced by $ D $ is $ k $ -connected .	In this paper , we study Minimum Weight $ ( 1 , m ) $ -CDS problem ( $ ( 1 , m ) $ -MWCDS ) , and present an $ ( H ( \delta+m ) +2H ( \delta-1 ) ) $ -approximation algorithm , where $ \delta $ is the maximum degree of the graph and $ H ( \cdot ) $ is the Harmonic number .
3	We prove a recursive formula for spin Hurwitz numbers , which then gives the dimension zero GW invariants of Kahler surfaces with positive geometric genus .	The classical Hurwitz numbers which count coverings of a complex curve have an analog when the curve is endowed with a theta characteristic .	These `` spin Hurwitz numbers '' , recently studied by Eskin , Okounkov and Pandharipande , are interesting in their own right .	By the authors ' previous work , they are also related to the Gromov-Witten invariants of Kahler surfaces .	The proof uses a degeneration of spin curves , an invariant defined by the spectral flow of certain anti-linear deformations of the d-bar operator , and an interesting localization phenomenon for eigenfunctions that shows that maps with even ramification points cancel in pairs .
3	Due to the 't Hooft term , it has a strong influence on the light quarks at all temperatures for small magnetic fields and for temperatures close to the transition temperature at zero magnetic field and above for strong magnetic fields .	Using the Polyakov -- Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio model the strange quark chiral phase transition and the effect of its current mass on a hot magnetized three flavor quark matter at zero chemical potential is investigated .	The impact of the 't Hooft mixing term on the restoration of the chiral symmetry on the light and strange sectors is studied and the critical temperature dependence on the magnetic field strength of the chiral strange transition is analyzed .	It is shown that the s quark is much less sensitive to the magnetic field than the light quarks .	In particular , the large mass of the s quark makes the chiral transition of the light sector smoother and shifted to larger temperatures .
0	We explore the usefulness of future gravitational microlensing surveys in the study of binary properties such as the binary fraction and the distributions of binary separation and mass ratio by using the binary sample detectable through a channel of repeating events .	For this , we estimate the rate of repeating microlensing eventstoward the Galactic bulge field based on standard models of dynamical and physical distributions of Galactic matter combined with models of binary separation and mass function .	From this , we find that the total number of repeating events expected to be detected from $ \sim 4 $ -year space-based surveys will be $ \sim 200 $ -- 400 , that is $ \sim 40 $ -- 50 times higher than the rate of current surveys .	We find that the high detection rate is due to the greatly improved sensitivity to events associated with faint source stars and low-magnification events .	We find that the separation range of the binaries to be covered by the repeating events will extend up to 100 AU .
0	When the right and the left handed Weyl points are separated in energy , they give rise to a non-dissipative charge current along the direction of a uniform applied magnetic field , even in the absence of an external electric field .	This effect is known as the chiral magnetic effect and is a hallmark of the underlying chiral anomaly of the Weyl fermions .	According to the linearized continuum theory of Weyl fermions , the induced current is proportional to the magnetic field strength and the energy separation with a universal coefficient $ e^2/h^2 $ .	By considering a generic tight binding model for the cubic noncentrosymmetric metals , we show that such a system naturally supports a set of Weyl points , which are separated in energies .	We also show the existence of the chiral magnetic effect for generic band parameters , and recover the universal result of the continuum Weyl fermions for a restricted parameter regime .
0	We consider duality between type 0B string theory on $ AdS_5\times S^5 $ and the planar CFT on $ N $ electric D3-branes coincident with $ N $ magnetic D3-branes .	It has been argued that this theory is stable up to a critical value of the `t Hooft coupling but is unstable beyond that point .	We suggest that from the gauge theory point of view the development of instability is associated with singularity in the dimension of the operator corresponding to the tachyon field via the AdS/CFT map .	Such singularities are common in large $ N $ theories because summation over planar graphs typically has a finite radius of convergence .	Hence we expect transitions between stability and instability for string theories in AdS backgrounds that are dual to certain large $ N $ gauge theories : if there are tachyons for large AdS radius then they may be stabilized by reducing the radius below a critical value of order the string scale .
4	The Riks method available in Abaqus/Standard , coupled with the Concrete Damaged Plasticity ( CDP ) model is used to simulate the degradation of concrete surrounding both DTR the traditional cylindrical dowels .	This study examines the performance of traditional round dowels in concrete floors and attempts to optimize the design of dowels through Finite Element ( FE ) analysis .	A new type of Double-Tapered Round ( DTR ) dowels is proposed , and the performance of DTR dowels is compared to that of traditional cylindrical dowels .	Linear Elastic ( LE ) analysis are performed in Abaqus ( v-6.11 ) order to identify the optimized geometry of DTR dowels that would achieve ( 1 ) highest load transfer across adjacent slabs through shear action , and ( 2 ) lowest bearing stresses on the concrete .	LE analyses are complemented by nonlinear FE analysis .
3	An emergent algebra A over a uniform idempotent right quasigroup X is a collection of operations such that each operation emerges from X , meaning that it can be realized as a combination of the operations of the uniform irq X , possibly by taking limits which are uniform with respect to a set of parameters .	Inspired from research subjects in sub-riemannian geometry and metric geometry , we propose uniform idempotent right quasigroups and emergent algebras as an alternative to differentiable algebras .	Idempotent right quasigroups ( irqs ) are related with racks and quandles , which appear in knot theory ( the axioms of a irq correspond to the first two Reidemeister moves ) .	To any uniform idempotent right quasigroup can be associated an approximate differential calculus , with Pansu differential calculus in sub-riemannian geometry as an example .	Two applications are considered : we prove a bijection between contractible groups and distributive uniform irqs ( uniform quandles ) and that some symmetric spaces in the sense of Loos may be seen as uniform quasigroups with a distributivity property .
2	In this partially ordered set , Truth value assignment that is false in each clauses become simply connected space .	This article describes the solvability of HornSAT and CNFSAT .	Unsatisfiable HornCNF have partially ordered set that is made by causation of each clauses .	Therefore , if we reduce CNFSAT to HornSAT , we must make such partially ordered set in HornSAT .	But CNFSAT have correlations of each clauses , the partially ordered set is not in polynomial size .
3	Under an infinite sequence of generalized local linear growth and Lipschitz conditions , the well-posedness of an adapted 4-tuple strong solution is proved over a suitably constructed topological space .	We study four systems and their interactions .	First , we formulate a unified system of coupled forward-backward stochastic partial differential equations ( FB-SPDEs ) with Levy jumps , whose drift , diffusion , and jump coefficients may involve partial differential operators .	A solution to the FB-SPDEs is defined by a 4-tuple general dimensional random vector-field process evolving in time together with position parameters over a domain ( e.g. , a hyperbox or a manifold ) .	Second , we consider a unified system of FB-SDEs , a special form of the FB-SPDEs , however , with skew boundary reflections .
3	All fields including the gravitational field are initially simplified by expanding each in terms of the respective homogeneity or inhomogeneity .	A simple model for the reheating of the universe after inflation is studied in which an essentially inhomogeneous scalar field representing matter is coupled to an essentially homogeneous scalar inflaton field .	Through this coupling , the potential determining the evolution of the inflaton field is made time-dependent .	Due to this the frequency of parametric resonance becomes time dependent , making the reheating process especially effective .	Employing only the lowest order of this expansion , we space-average , and introduce all independent averages as new variables .
3	When q = e^ { 2 pi i/ ( N+K ) } , the observables of the 2d U ( N ) qYM theory can be expressed as a sum over a finite subset of U ( N ) representations .	We study the WZW , Chern-Simons , and 2d qYM theories with gauge group U ( N ) .	The U ( N ) WZW model is only well-defined for odd level K , and this model is shown to exhibit level-rank duality in a much simpler form than that for SU ( N ) .	The U ( N ) Chern-Simons theory on Seifert manifolds exhibits a similar duality , distinct from the level-rank duality of SU ( N ) Chern-Simons theory on S^3 .	When N and K are odd , the qYM theory exhibits N & lt ; -- & gt ; K duality , provided q = e^ { 2 pi i/ ( N+K ) } and theta = 0 mod 2 pi / ( N+K ) .
2	In the present study we show evidence of QW resonance states in Fe QW up to12 nmthick and at room temperature in fully epitaxial doubleMgAlOxbarrier magnetic tunnel junctions .	Double barrier heterostructures are model systems for the study of electron tunneling and discrete energy levels in a quantum well ( QW ) .	Until now resonant tunneling phenomena in metallicQW have been observed for limited thicknesses ( 1-2 nm ) under which electron phase coherence is conserved .	The electron phase coherence displayed in this QWis of unprecedented quality because ofa homogenous interface phase shift due to the small lattice mismatch at the Fe/MgAlOx interface .	The physical understanding of the critical role of interface strain on QW phase coherence will greatly promote the development of the spin-dependent quantum resonant tunneling applications .
1	In this limit , the M-branes are well described , via the AdS/CFT correspondence , in terms of classical solutions to the eleven dimensional supergravity equations of motion .	We consider the low energy limit of a stack of N M-branes at finite temperature .	We calculate Minkowski space two-point functions on these M-branes in the long-distance , low-frequency limit , i.e.the hydrodynamic limit , using the prescription of Son and Starinets [ hep-th/0205051 ] .	From these Green 's functions for the R-currents and for components of the stress-energy tensor , we extract two kinds of diffusion constant and a viscosity .	The N dependence of these physical quantities may help lead to a better understanding of M-branes .
2	However , garbage collectors collect only those dead objects that are not reachable from any program variable .	Scheme uses garbage collection for heap memory management .	Ideally , garbage collectors should be able to reclaim all dead objects , i.e.objects that will not be used in future .	Dead objects that are reachable from program variables are not reclaimed .	In this paper we describe our experiments to measure the effectiveness of garbage collection in MIT/GNU Scheme .
3	We create synthetic color-magnitude diagrams matching the fundamental parameters of NGC 1818 , with different binary fractions and mass-ratio distributions .	We use high-resolution { \sl Hubble Space Telescope } imaging observations of the young ( $ \sim 15-25 $ Myr-old ) star cluster NGC 1818 in the Large Magellanic Cloud to derive an estimate for the binary fraction of F stars ( $ 1.3 & lt ; M_\star/M_\odot & lt ; 1.6 $ ) .	This study provides the strongest constraints yet on the binary fraction in a young star cluster in a low-metallicity environment ( $ { [ Fe/H ] } \sim -0.4 $ dex ) .	Employing artificial-star tests , we develop a simple method that can efficiently measure the probabilities of stellar blends and superpositions from the observed stellar catalog .	We find that this method is sensitive to binaries with mass ratios , $ q \ga 0.4 $ .
2	We study this transition in detail and find universal qualitative features for the above class of theories which has holographic dual descriptions .	Using the Ryu-Takayanagi conjectured formula for entanglement entropy in the context of gauge-gravity duality , we investigate properties of mutual information between two disjoint rectangular sub-systems in finite temperature relativistic conformal field theories in d-spacetime dimensions and non-relativistic scale-invariant theories in some generic examples .	In all these cases mutual information undergoes a transition beyond which it is identically zero .	We also obtain analytical results for mutual information in the specific regime of the parameter space .	This demonstrates that mutual information contains the quantum entanglement part of the entanglement entropy , which is otherwise dominated by the thermal entropy at large temperatures .
3	An explicit computation demonstrates that the regularized Jacobian $ Tr\ \Delta J\exp -\cR /M^2 $ for $ M^2\rightarrow \infty $ is the variation of a local counterterm , which we give .	The Jacobian for infinitesimal BRST transformations of path integrals for pure Yang-Mills theory , viewed as a matrix $ \unity +\Delta J $ in the space of Yang-Mills fields and ( anti ) ghosts , contains off-diagonal terms .	Naively , the trace of $ \Delta J $ vanishes , being proportional to the trace of the structure constants .	However , the consistent regulator $ \cR $ , constructed from a general method , also contains off-diagonal terms .	This is a direct proof at the level of path integrals that there is no BRST anomaly .
3	The limit metric gives rise to a tree structure decomposition , where each node in the tree represents a limit metric of a subsequence at that stage while the edge of the tree structure represents the neck on the process of blowing up .	In this paper , we study the weak compactness of the set of conformal metrics in any Riemann surface without boundary whose Calabi energy and area are uniformly bounded .	We prove that for any sequence of such metrics , there alwasy exists a subsequence which converges in H\sp { 2,2 } _\sb { loc } everywhere except a finite number of bubble points .	Blowup analysis near bubble shows that the bubble on bubble phenomenon occurs .	We also show that the number of the nodes which have more than three edges attached is finite .
3	Although protons show a typical `` back-to-back '' correlations , a `` side-by-side '' correlation is observed for positive pions , which increases both with target mass and with impact parameter of a collision .	Results on the target mass dependence of proton and pion pseudorapidity distributions and of their azimuthal correlations in the target rapidity range $ -1.73 \le \eta \le 1.32 $ are presented .	The data have been taken with the Plastic-Ball detector set-up for 4.9 GeV p + Au collisions at the Berkeley BEVALAC and for 200 $ A\cdot $ GeV/ $ c $ p- , O- , and S-induced reactions on different nuclei at the CERN-SPS .	The yield of protons at backward rapidities is found to be proportional to the target mass .	The data can consistently be described by assuming strong rescattering phenomena including pion absorption effects in the entire excited target nucleus .
1	The standard hadronization models based upon the colour neutralization mechanism appear to underestimate the rate of slow proton production on hydrogen .	The semi-inclusive cross section for producing slow protons in charged current deep inelastic ( anti- ) neutrino scattering on protons and neutrons is calculated as a function of the Bjorken $ x $ and the proton momentum .	The presence of the virtual mesons ( pions ) in the nucleon leads to an additional mechanism for proton production , referred to as spectator process .	It is found that at low proton momenta both mechanisms compete , whereas the spectator mechanism dominates at very small momenta , while the color neutralization mechanism dominates at momenta larger than 1-2 \ , GeV $ /c $ .	The results of the calculations are compared with the CERN bubble chamber ( BEBC ) data .
4	We hope that these techniques will generalize to higher-rank cluster varieties .	We generalize the standard combinatorial techniques of toric geometry to the study of log Calabi-Yau surfaces .	The character and cocharacter lattices are replaced by certain integral linear manifolds described by Gross , Hacking , and Keel , and monomials on toric varieties are replaced with the canonical theta functions which GHK defined using ideas from mirror symmetry .	We describe the tropicalizations of theta functions and use them to generalize the dual pairing between the character and cocharacter lattices .	We use this to describe generalizations of dual cones , Newton and polar polytopes , Minkowski sums , and finite Fourier series expansions .
4	The SMC attenuation curve is consistent with the IRX and the UV slope $ \beta = -1.4^ { +0.2 } _ { -0.2 } $ of our stacked LAE , while the Meurer 's relation ( Calzetti curve ) predicts a 3.8 times higher IRX ; we also discuss the validity of PACS-based $ L_ { \rm TIR } ^ { 3\sigma } $ allowing the Meurer 's relation .	By stacking publicly available deep Spitzer/MIPS 24 $ \mu $ m and Herschel/PACS images for 213 $ z \simeq 2.18 $ Ly $ \alpha $ Emitters ( LAEs ) in GOODS-South , we obtain a strong upper limit to the IR luminosity of typical LAEs and discuss their attenuation curve for the first time .	The $ 3\sigma $ upper limit $ L_ { \rm TIR } ^ { 3\sigma } = 1.1 \times 10^ { 10 } L_\odot $ , determined from the MIPS data providing the lowest limit , gives $ IRX \equiv L_ { \rm TIR } /L_ { \rm UV } \leq 2.2 $ .	Here we assume that the local calibration between the 8 $ \mu $ m emission and the dust SED shape and metallicity applies at high redshifts and that our LAEs have low metallicities as suggested by previous studies .	The inferred escape fractions of Ly $ \alpha $ , $ 16 $ -- $ 37 % $ , and UV continuum , $ \ge 44 % $ , are higher than the cosmic averages at the same epoch .
0	We present a computer simulation model that is a one-to-one copy of a quantum eraser experiment with photons ( P. D. D. Schwindt { \sl et al . } , Phys.Rev .	A 60 , 4285 ( 1999 ) ) .	The model is solely based on experimental facts , satisfies Einstein 's criterion of local causality and does not require knowledge of the solution of a wave equation .	Nevertheless , the simulation model reproduces the averages as obtained from the wave mechanical description of the quantum eraser experiment , proving that it is possible to give a particle-only description of quantum eraser experiments with photons .	We demonstrate that although the visibility can be used as a measure for the interference , it can not be used to quantify the wave character of a photon .
1	In the high temperature regime the temperature change on adiabatic demagnetization was found to be consistent with previously published entropy versus temperature curves .	The magnetocaloric effect of polycrystalline samples of pure and Y-doped dipolar spin ice Dy2Ti2O7 was investigated at temperatures from nominally 0.3 K to 6 K and in magnetic fields of up to 2 T. As well as being of intrinsic interest , it is proposed that the magnetocaloric effect may be used as an appropriate tool for the qualitative study of slow relaxation processes in the spin ice regime .	At low temperatures ( T & lt ; 0.4 K ) cooling by adiabatic demagnetization was followed by an irreversible rise in temperature that persisted after the removal of the applied field .	The relaxation time derived from this temperature rise was found to increase rapidly down to 0.3 K. The data near to 0.3 K indicated a transition into a metastable state with much slower relaxation , supporting recent neutron scattering results .	In addition , magnetic dilution of 50 % concentration was found to significantly prolong the dynamical response in the milikelvin temperature range , in contrast with results reported for higher temperatures at which the spin correlations are suppressed .
1	D { \bf80 } , 056004 ( 2009 ) ] particularly on the $ \bar { D } D^ { * } $ molecular state to investigate that the possibility of the newly observed $ Z_ { c } ( 3900 ) $ as a $ S $ -wave $ \bar { D } D^ { * } $ molecular state .	In the framework of QCD sum rules , we present an improved study of our previous work [ Phys.Rev .	To ensure the quality of QCD sum rule analysis , contributions of up to dimension nine are calculated to test the convergence of operator product expansion ( OPE ) .	We find that the two-quark condensate $ & lt ; \bar { q } q & gt ; $ is very large and makes the standard OPE convergence ( i.e.the perturbative at least larger than each condensate contribution ) happen at very large values of Borel parameters .	By releasing the rigid OPE convergence criterion , one could find that the OPE convergence is still under control .
3	From a purely observational point of view , we show that is not possible to discard values of the coupling constant in the unphysical region $ \epsilon & lt ; 0 $ .	In this work we investigate the interaction between dark matter and dark energy for a coupling that obeys the Wang-Meng decaying law , $ \rho_ { { \rm DM } } \propto ( 1+z ) ^ { 3-\epsilon } $ , and the Barboza-Alcaniz dark energy parametric model , $ w=w_0+w'_0z ( 1+z ) / ( 1+z^2 ) $ .	Theoretically , we show that the coupling constant , $ \epsilon $ , should satisfy the physical constraint $ \epsilon\ge0 $ .	We use the most recent data of type Ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations , cosmic microwave background and the Hubble expansion rate function to constrain the free parameters of the model .	We show that the uncoupled case , $ \epsilon=0 $ , is in better agreement with the data than any of coupled models in the physical region .
3	Traditional sine-fitting periodograms use a generative model to find the frequency of a sinusoid that best describes the data .	From pulsating stars to transiting exoplanets , the search for periodic signals in K2 data , Kepler 's 2-wheeled extension , is relevant to a long list of scientific goals .	Systematics affecting K2 light curves due to the decreased spacecraft pointing precision inhibit the easy extraction of periodic signals from the data .	We here develop a method for producing periodograms of K2 light curves that are insensitive to pointing-induced systematics ; the Systematics-Insensitive Periodogram ( SIP ) .	We extend this principle by including systematic trends , based on a set of 'Eigen light curves ' , following Foreman-Mackey et al .
1	A common approach for characterizing the syntax of these complex syllable sequences is to use transition probabilities between the syllables .	Songs of many songbird species consist of variable sequences of a finite number of syllables .	This is equivalent to the Markov model , in which each syllable is associated with one state , and the transition probabilities between the states do not depend on the state transition history .	Here we analyze the song syntax in a Bengalese finch .	We show that the Markov model fails to capture the statistical properties of the syllable sequences .
2	9.4 keV and 32.1 keV transitions from decaying 83Krm nuclei are detected through liquid xenon scintillation and ionization .	We report the testing of a charcoal-based Kr-83m source for use in calibrating a low background two-phase liquid xenon detector .	Kr-83m atoms produced through the decay of Rb-83 are introduced into a xenon detector by flowing xenon gas past the Rb-83 source .	The characteristics of the Kr-83m source are analyzed and shown to be appropriate for a low background liquid xenon detector .	Introduction of Kr-83m allows for quick , periodic calibration of low background noble liquid detectors at low energy .
4	This is analogous to the famous Gittins index for the discounted multi-armed bandit problem .	In the budgeted learning problem , we are allowed to experiment on a set of alternatives ( given a fixed experimentation budget ) with the goal of picking a single alternative with the largest possible expected payoff .	Approximation algorithms for this problem were developed by Guha and Munagala by rounding a linear program that couples the various alternatives together .	In this paper we present an index for this problem , which we call the ratio index , which also guarantees a constant factor approximation .	Index-based policies have the advantage that a single number ( i.e.the index ) can be computed for each alternative irrespective of all other alternatives , and the alternative with the highest index is experimented upon .
0	Majorana fermions are promising candidates for storing and processing information in topological quantum computation .	The ability to control such individual information carriers in trapped ultracold atomic Fermi gases is a novel theme in quantum information science .	However , fermionic atoms are neutral and thus are difficult to manipulate .	Here , we theoretically investigate the control of emergent Majorana fermions in one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled atomic Fermi gases .	We discuss ( i ) how to move Majorana fermions by increasing or decreasing an effective Zeeman field , which acts like a solid state control voltage gate ; and ( ii ) how to create a pair of Majorana fermions by adding a magnetic impurity potential .
2	In practice this involves the approximation of measures defined on sequences of spaces of increasing dimension .	The computational complexity of MCMC methods for the exploration of complex probability measures is a challenging and important problem .	A challenge of particular importance arises in Bayesian inverse problems where the target distribution may be supported on an infinite dimensional space .	Motivated by an elliptic inverse problem with non-Gaussian prior , we study the design of proposal chains for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with dimension independent performance .	Dimension-independent bounds on the Monte-Carlo error of MCMC sampling for Gaussian prior measures have already been established .
2	2 ) The holder 's right to make an arbitrary number of those adjustments without penalizing costs .	In this work we present a new family of options ( mirror options ) specially crafted to satisfy the necessities of aggressive speculators .	The main ideas behind mirror options are : 1 ) A product that can be adjusted by the holder to agree with his/her market view at any time during its life .	After defining mirror options as `super-versions ' of standard options we derive general formulae for their value in the case where the payoff is a monotonic function of the underlying ( which is the case in calls , puts , futures , spreads etc . ) .	We briefly discuss also their valuation for general payoffs and the American case .
0	We seek to derive star formation rates ( SFR ) and stellar masses ( M_star ) in distant galaxies and to quantify the main uncertainties affecting their measurement .	We explore the impact of the assumptions made in their derivation with standard calibrations or through a fitting process , as well as the impact of the available data , focusing on the role of IR emission originating from dust .	We build a sample of galaxies with z & gt ; 1 , all observed from the UV to the IR ( rest frame ) .	The data are fitted with the code CIGALE , which is also used to build and analyse a catalogue of mock galaxies .	Models with different SFHs are introduced .
1	Strong magnetic activity is expected for the late-type component ( a G dwarf star and post-T Tauri Star candidate ) .	We report on a large X-ray flare from the Lindroos binary system HD 560 during a pointed ROSAT PSPC observation .	The system is unresolved in the ROSAT image .	Therefore , although not expected from a theoretical point of view , it can not be excluded that the flare has erupted on the primary , a late-B type star .	We discuss the luminosity and temperature evolution comparing the quiescent and the flare state of HD 560 , and present arguments for the G star as host of the flare .
2	Our analysis lets us derive a simple , yet effective algorithm to robustify the SIM and make it applicable to realistic scenarios where the data is corrupted by noise .	The Shape Interaction Matrix ( SIM ) is one of the earliest approaches to performing subspace clustering ( i.e. , separating points drawn from a union of subspaces ) .	In this paper , we revisit the SIM and reveal its connections to several recent subspace clustering methods .	We justify our method by intuitive examples and the matrix perturbation theory .	We then show how this approach can be extended to handle missing data , thus yielding an efficient and general subspace clustering algorithm .
2	In this regime the screening mass of the mediator is proportional to the number density of the gas , hence we refer to this phenomenon as `` the adaptive screening mechanism '' .	We describe how known matter effects within a well-motivated particle physics framework can explain the dark energy component of the Universe .	By considering a cold gas of particles which interact via a vector mediator , we show that there exists a regime where the gas reproduces the dynamics of dark energy .	As an example , we argue that such screening mass can result from strong localization of the vector mediators .	The proposed dark energy mechanism could be experimentally verified through cosmological observations by the Euclid experiment , as well as by studying properties of dark photons and sterile neutrinos .
0	Let $ H $ be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space .	We show that there exists a subspace of $ B ( H ) $ which is isometric to $ \ell_2 $ and completely isometric to its antidual in the sense of the theory of operator spaces recently developed by Blecher-Paulsen and Effros-Ruan .	Moreover this space is unique up to a complete isometry .	We denote it by $ OH $ .	This space has several remarkable properties in particular with respect to the complex interpolation method .
1	A comparison between the predicted and the observed number of lensed radio sources allows a determination of the current value of Omega-Lambda .	We calculate the expected number of strongly lensed radio sources in a sample of 6500 sources observed with the Very Large Array as part of the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey ( CLASS ) during the first two sessions of its observations .	If there are six strongly lensed sources in this sample , our 95 % confidence upper limit on Lambda in a flat universe is 0.79 .	Instead of considering a simple cosmological constant , we also consider the possibility of a quintessence scalar field responsible for the additional energy density of the universe .	We present our constraints on the Omega_x-w plane .
3	It is shown by Brillouin light scattering microscopy ( BLS ) that the domain structure in the remanence state has a strong influence on the spin-wave excitation and propagation .	The interaction of propagating dipolar spin waves with magnetic domain walls is investigated in square-shaped microstructures patterned from the Heusler compound Co $ _2 $ Mn $ _ { 0.6 } $ Fe $ _ { 0.4 } $ Si .	Using magnetic force microscopy , the reversible preparation of a Landau state with four magnetic domains separated by N\'eel domain walls is confirmed .	A local spin-wave excitation using a microstructured antenna is realized in one of the domains .	The domain walls strongly reflect the spin waves and can be used as spin-wave reflectors .
1	For the MRI to operate the ionization degree must be sufficiently high and the magnetic pressure must be sufficiently lower than the gas pressure .	We examine whether the magnetorotational instability ( MRI ) can serve as a mechanism of angular momentum transport in circumplanetary disks .	We calculate the spatial distribution of the ionization degree and search for the MRI-active region where the two criteria are met .	We find that there can be thin active layers at the disk surface depending on the model parameters , however , we find hardly any region which can sustain well-developed MRI turbulence ; when the magnetic field is enhanced by MRI turbulence at the disk surface layer , a magnetically dominated atmosphere encroaches on a lower altitude and a region of well-developed MRI turbulence becomes smaller .	We conclude that if there are no angular momentum transfer mechanisms other than MRI in gravitationally stable circumplanetary disks , gas is likely to pile up until disks become gravitationally unstable , and massive disks may survive for a long time .
1	In this sense , it can be called the quantum central processing unit ( QCPU ) .	An universal quantum network which can implement a general quantum computing is proposed .	For a given quantum computing , its realization of QCPU is just its quantum network .	QCPU is standard and easy-assemble because it only has two kinds of basic elements and two auxiliary elements .	QCPU and its realizations are scalable , that is , they can be connected together , and so they can construct the whole quantum network to implement the general quantum algorithm and quantum simulating procedure .
0	To explore the properties of extreme outer stellar disks , we obtained ultra-deep V and GALEX UV images of 4 dwarf irregular galaxies and one Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy and ultra-deep B images of 3 of these .	Our V-band surface photometry extends to 29.5 magnitudes arcsec^-2 .	We convert the FUV and V-band photometry , along with Halpha photometry , into radial star formation rate profiles that are sensitive to timescales from 10 Myrs to the lifetime of the galaxy .	We also compare the stellar distributions , surface brightness profiles , and star formation rate profiles to HI-line emission maps , gas surface density profiles , and gas kinematics .	Our data lead us to two general observations : First , the exponential disks in these irregular galaxies are extraordinarily regular .
2	This opens the possibilities to study magnetic dipole-dipole interactions ( MDDI ) in BECs , where the novel physics resulting from long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions can be explored .	The s-wave interaction is usually the dominant form of interactions in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates ( BECs ) .	Recently , Feshbach resonances have been employed to reduce the strength of the s-wave interaction in many atomic speicies .	Using a variational method , we study the effect of MDDI on the statics and dynamics of atomic BECs with tunable s-wave interactions .	We benchmark our calculation against previously observed MDDI effects in $ ^ { 52 } $ Cr with excellent agreement , and predict new effects that should be promising to observe experimentally .
0	We consider the problem of optimally allocating a given total storage budget in a distributed storage system .	A source has a data object which it can code and store over a set of storage nodes ; it is allowed to store any amount of coded data in each node , as long as the total amount of storage used does not exceed the given budget .	A data collector subsequently attempts to recover the original data object by accessing each of the nodes independently with some constant probability .	By using an appropriate code , successful recovery occurs when the total amount of data in the accessed nodes is at least the size of the original data object .	The goal is to find an optimal storage allocation that maximizes the probability of successful recovery .
4	The dusty warm absorber solution to this discrepancy is discussed and photoionization models of such warm absorbers are constructed .	We present a multiwaveband spectroscopic study of the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15 .	New optical spectra from the Anglo-Australian Telescope are presented which clearly show the effects of dust extinction/reddening on both the emission line spectrum and the non-stellar AGN continuum .	The reddening is constrained to be in the range E ( B-V ) =0.61-1.09 .	Spectroscopy in the X-ray band , with both ROSAT and ASCA , reveal absorption by the warm absorber but little or no neutral absorption expected to accompany the dust responsible for the optical reddening .
2	As an example , we find that , at $ z=0 $ , the { \em intrinsic } ( B $ _ { f435w } - $ V $ _ { f606w } $ ) colour can be used to determine the intrinsic rest-frame $ V $ -band stellar mass-to-light ratio ( $ \log_ { 10 } \Gamma_ { V } =\log_ { 10 } [ ( M/M_ { \odot } ) / ( L_ { V } /L_ { V\odot } ) ] $ ) with a precision of $ \sigma_ { lg\Gamma } \simeq 0.06 $ when the initial mass function and redshift are known beforehand .	Accurate galaxy stellar masses are crucial to better understand the physical mechanisms driving the galaxy formation process .	We use synthetic star formation and metal enrichment histories predicted by the { \sc galform } galaxy formation model to investigate the precision with which various colours $ ( m_ { a } -m_ { b } ) $ can alone be used as diagnostics of the stellar mass-to-light ratio .	While the presence of dust , assuming a universal attenuation curve , can have a systematic effect on the inferred mass-to-light ratio using a single-colour relation , this is typically small as it is often possible to choose a colour for which the dust reddening vector is approximately aligned with the $ ( m_ { a } -m_ { b } ) -\log_ { 10 } \Gamma_ { V } $ relation .	The precision with which the stellar mass-to-light ratio can be recovered using a single colour diagnostic rivals implementations of SED fitting using more information but in which simple parameterisations of the star formation and metal enrichment histories are assumed .
4	Assuming that transmitters and receivers are equipped with $ M , N $ antennas , respectively , new DoF inner bounds are proposed , outperforming the existing ones for $ \rho = \frac { M } { N } & gt ; 2.6413 $ .	The degrees of freedom ( DoF ) of the multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) Interference Broadcast Channel ( IBC ) with 2 cells and 2 users per cell are investigated when only delayed channel state information is available at the transmitter side ( delayed CSIT ) .	Retrospective Interference Alignment has shown the benefits in terms of DoF of exploiting delayed CSIT for interference , broadcast and also for the IBC .	However , previous works studying the IBC with delayed CSIT do not exploit the fact that the users of each cell are served by a common transmitter .	This work presents a four-phase precoding strategy taking this into consideration .
4	The result can be therefore interpret as a globalization theorem for $ \mathsf { CD } ( K , N ) $ for this class of optimal transportation , or as a `` self-improving property '' for $ \mathsf { CD } ^ { * } ( K , N ) $ .	We will prove a decomposition for Wasserstein geodesics in the following sense : let $ ( X , d , m ) $ be a non-branching metric measure space verifying $ \mathsf { CD } _ { loc } ( K , N ) $ or equivalently $ \mathsf { CD } ^ { * } ( K , N ) $ .	We prove that every geodesic $ \mu_ { t } $ in the $ L^ { 2 } $ -Wasserstein space , with $ \mu_ { t } \ll m $ , is decomposable as the product of two densities , one corresponding to a geodesic with support of codimension one verifying $ \mathsf { CD } ^ { * } ( K , N-1 ) $ , and the other associated with a precise one dimensional measure , provided the length map enjoys local Lipschitz regularity .	The motivation for our decomposition is in the use of the component evolving like $ \mathsf { CD } ^ { * } $ in the globalization problem .	For a particular class of optimal transportation we prove the linearity in time of the other component , obtaining therefore the global $ \mathsf { CD } ( K , N ) $ for $ \mu_ { t } $ .
3	Contrary to this expectation , a bright electromagnetic transient can occur in the final moments before merger as long as the neutron star is highly magnetized .	Direct detection of black hole-neutron star ( BHNS ) pairs is anticipated with the advent of aLIGO .	Electromagnetic counterparts may be crucial for a confident gravitational-wave detection as well as for extraction of astronomical information .	Yet BHNS star pairs are notoriously dark and so inaccessible to telescopes .	The orbital motion of the neutron star magnet creates a Faraday flux and corresponding power available for luminosity .
3	The latter is attractive for graphene-based field effect transistors .	Graphene has a multitude of striking properties that make it an exceedingly attractive material for various applications , many of which will emerge over the next decade .	However , one of the most promising applications lie in exploiting its peculiar electronic properties which are governed by its electrons obeying a linear dispersion relation .	This leads to the observation of half integer quantum hall effect and the absence of localization .	However , if graphene is to be the material for future electronics , then significant hurdles need to be surmounted , namely , it needs to be mass produced in an economically viable manner and be of high crystalline quality with no or virtually no defects or grains boundaries .
2	We study quantum transport through such nanostructures with an almost degenerate spectrum .	Geometric symmetries cause orbital degeneracies in a molecule 's spectrum .	In a single-molecule junction , these degeneracies are lifted by various symmetry-breaking effects .	We show that the master equation for the reduced density matrix must be derived within the singular-coupling limit as opposed to the conventional weak-coupling limit .	This results in signatures of the density matrix 's off-diagonal elements in the transport characteristics .
3	Distributed over five months , the RXTE observations were designed to search for long X-ray modulations over a few months .	HD 110432 ( BZ Cru ; B1Ve ) is the brightest member of a small group of `` gamma Cas analogs '' that emit copious hard X-ray flux , punctuated by ubiquitous `` flares . ''	To characterize the X-ray time history of this star , we made a series of six RXTE multi-visit observations in 2010 and an extended observation with the XMM-Newton in 2007 .	We analyzed these new light curves along with three older XMM-Newton observations from 2002 -- 2003 .	These observations indeed suggest the presence of a long cycle with P = 226 days and an amplitude of a factor of two .
4	With this , we are able to obtain mass ejection rates of the central engine which are injected at the base of the jet , and oscillation frequencies of the flow , amongst other physical parameters .	A physical description of the formation and propagation of the working surface inside the relativistic jet of the Blazar PKS 1510-089 are used to model its gamma-ray variability light curve using FERMI-LAT data from 2008 to 2012 .	The physical model is based on conservation laws of mass and momentum at the working surface as explained by Mendoza et al . ( 2009 ) .	The hydrodynamical description of the working surface is parametrised by the initial velocity and mass injection rate at the base of the jet .	We show that periodic variations on the injected velocity profiles are able to account for the observed luminosity .
0	We discuss the role of a class of higher dimensional operators in 4D N=1 supersymmetric effective theories .	The Lagrangian in such theories is an expansion in momenta below the scale of `` new physics '' ( $ \Lambda $ ) and contains the effective operators generated by integrating out the `` heavy states '' above $ \Lambda $ present in the UV complete theory .	We go beyond the `` traditional '' leading order in this momentum expansion ( in $ \partial/\Lambda $ ) .	Keeping manifest supersymmetry and using superfield { \it constraints } we show that the corresponding higher dimensional ( derivative ) operators in the sectors of chiral , linear and vector superfields of a Lagrangian can be `` unfolded '' into second-order operators .	The `` unfolded '' formulation has only polynomial interactions and additional massive superfields , some of which are ghost-like if the effective operators were { \it quadratic } in fields .
2	We find that the term $ R_ { \mu\nu } \ , \Box^ { -2 } R^ { \mu\nu } $ does not give a viable background evolution .	Recent work has shown that modifications of General Relativity based on the addition to the action of a non-local term $ R\ , \Box^ { -2 } R $ , or on the addition to the equations of motion of a term involving $ ( g_ { \mu\nu } \Box^ { -1 } R ) $ , produce dynamical models of dark energy which are cosmologically viable both at the background level and at the level of cosmological perturbations .	We explore a more general class of models based on the addition to the action of terms proportional to $ R_ { \mu\nu } \ , \Box^ { -2 } R^ { \mu\nu } $ and $ C_ { \mu\nu\rho\sigma } \ , \Box^ { -2 } C^ { \mu\nu\rho\sigma } $ , where $ C_ { \mu\nu\rho\sigma } $ is the Weyl tensor .	The non-local Weyl-square term , in contrast , does not contribute to the background evolution but we find that , at the level of cosmological perturbations , it gives instabilities in the tensor sector .	Thus , only non-local terms which depend just on the Ricci scalar $ R $ appear to be cosmologically viable .
2	The leading order of $ \T $ is proportional to the identity operator .	A certain operator $ \T=\int_ { \SL } \dd g\ , Y^ { \dagger } gY $ can be found in various Lorentzian EPRL calculations .	The properties of this operator has been studied here in large $ j $ limit .	Knowing the operator $ \T $ one can renormalize spin-foam 's edge self-energy by computing the amplitude of sum of a series of edges with increasing number of vertices and bubbles .	This amplitude is calculated and is shown to be convergent .
2	However , a systematic study of the ice phases in nanoconfinement is hampered by the computational cost of simulations at very low temperatures .	Bulk water presents a large number of crystalline and amorphous ices .	Hydrophobic nanoconfinement is known to affect the tendency of water to form ice and to reduce the melting temperature .	Here we develop a coarse-grained model for a water monolayer in hydrophobic nanoconfinement and study the formation of ice by Mote Carlo simulations .	We find two ice phases : low-density-crystal ice at low pressure and high-density hexatic ice at high pressure , an intermediate phase between liquid and high-density-crystal ice .
2	Naturally , the Gaussian model is one of the possibilities .	In this paper we present a novel methodology to perform Bayesian model selection in linear models with heavy-tailed distributions .	The new method considers a finite mixture of distributions to model a latent variable where each component of the mixture corresponds to one possible model within the symmetrical class of normal independent distributions .	This allows a simultaneous analysis based on the posterior probability of each model .	Inference is performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo - a Gibbs sampler with Metropolis-Hastings steps for a class of parameters .
1	Starting at the closed string vacuum , we argue that a finite temperature leads to the reappearance of open string degrees of freedom .	We consider D-brane/anti-D-brane systems at T & gt ; 0 .	We also show that , at a sufficiently large temperature , the open string vacuum becomes stable .	Building upon this observation and previous work by Horowitz , Maldacena and Strominger , we formulate a microscopic brane-antibrane model for the non-extremal black three-brane in ten dimensions ( as well as for the black two- and five-branes in eleven dimensions ) .	Under reasonable assumptions , and using known results from the AdS/CFT correspondence , the microscopic entropy agrees with the supergravity result up to a factor of 2^ ( p/p+1 ) , with p the dimension of the brane .
3	Specailly we predict the possibility of large direct CP violation effects in $ B^0 \to \pi^ { + } \pi^ { - } $ $ ( 23\pm7 % ) $ and $ B^0\to K^ { + } \pi^ { - } $ $ ( -17\pm5 % ) $ .	We discuss the perturbative QCD approach for the exclusive two body B-meson decays to light mesons .	We briefly review its ingredients and some important theoretical issues on factorization approach .	We show numerical results which are compatible with present experimantal data for the charmless B-meson decays .	In the last section we investigate two methods to determine the weak phases $ \phi_2 $ and $ \phi_3 $ from $ B \to \pi\pi , K\pi $ processes .
3	As an example we formulate the similarity principle which is the central reason why a pseudoanalytic function and as a consequence a spinor field depending on two space variables share many of the properties of analytic functions .	In the present work we establish a simple relation between the Dirac equation with a scalar and an electromagnetic potentials in a two-dimensional case and a pair of decoupled Vekua equations .	In general these Vekua equations are bicomplex .	However we show that the whole theory of pseudoanalytic functions without modifications can be applied to these equations under a certain not restrictive condition .	One of the surprising consequences of the established relation with pseudoanalytic functions consists in the following result .
4	We consider the problem of deciding the winner in counter reachability games and show that , in most cases , it has the same complexity under all semantics .	Counter reachability games are played by two players on a graph with labelled edges .	Each move consists in picking an edge from the current location and adding its label to a counter vector .	The objective is to reach a given counter value in a given location .	We distinguish three semantics for counter reachability games , according to what happens when a counter value would become negative : the edge is either disabled , or enabled but the counter value becomes zero , or enabled .
4	within the kernel reaches a preset value .	An efficient algorithm for adaptive kernel smoothing ( AKS ) of two-dimensional imaging data has been developed and implemented using the Interactive Data Language ( IDL ) .	The functional form of the kernel can be varied ( top-hat , Gaussian etc . )	to allow different weighting of the event counts registered within the smoothing region .	For each individual pixel the algorithm increases the smoothing scale until the signal-to-noise ratio ( s.n.r . )
2	{ Further , } the framework uses pmf approximation arguments instead of counting and typicality .	This paper introduces a new and ubiquitous framework for establishing achievability results in \emph { network information theory } ( NIT ) problems .	The framework uses random binning arguments and is based on a duality between channel and source coding problems .	This allows for proving coordination and \emph { strong } secrecy problems where certain statistical conditions on the distribution of random variables need to be satisfied .	These statistical conditions include independence between messages and eavesdropper 's observations in secrecy problems and closeness to a certain distribution ( usually , i.i.d .
4	The fluctuation is expanded in terms of more and more complex excitations .	A statistical theory of the mean field is developed .	It is based on the proposition that the mean field can be obtained as an energy average .	Moreover , it is assumed that the matrix elements of the residual interaction , obtained after the average interaction is removed , are random with the average value of zero .	With these two assumptions one obtains explicit expressions for the mean field and the fluctuation away from the average .
0	A local hidden-variable model based on `isolato ' hypothesis of the EPR -- Bohm Gedanken experiment is presented .	The `isolato ' hypothesis states that one of a pair of spin- $ { 1 } / { 2 } $ particles can be in `isolato ' mode in which the spin- $ { 1 } / { 2 } $ particle shuts itself from any external interactions , and hence it can never be detected .	As a result of this , data rejection is made ; Bell 's inequality is violated , although the model is genuinely local .	In this model , $ 2/\pi $ ( $ \simeq $ 63.6 % ) of the initially prepared ensemble of pairs of spin- $ { 1 } / { 2 } $ particles are detected as a pair of particles , and others are detected as a single particle .	This does not disagree with the results of the experiments performed before , since these single spin- $ { 1 } / { 2 } $ particles were regarded as noise .
0	The ATLAS detector at CERN has completed its first full year of recording collisions at 7 TeV , resulting in billions of events and petabytes of data .	At these scales , physicists must have the capability to read only the data of interest to their analyses , with the importance of efficient selective access increasing as data taking continues .	ATLAS has developed a sophisticated event-level metadata infrastructure and supporting I/O framework allowing event selections by explicit specification , by back navigation , and by selection queries to a TAG database via an integrated web interface .	These systems and their performance have been reported on elsewhere .	The ultimate success of such a system , however , depends significantly upon the efficiency of selective event retrieval .
3	Using daily price changes instead , we find evidence of a significant GARCH component .	We simulate a series of daily returns from intraday price movements initiated by microstructure elements .	Significant evidence is found that daily returns and daily return volatility exhibit first order autocorrelation , but trading volume and daily return volatility are not correlated , while intraday volatility is .	We also consider GARCH effects in daily return series and show that estimates using daily returns are biased from the influence of the level of prices .	These results suggest that microstructure elements have a considerable influence on the return generating process .
4	Orbital ordering is concomitant with magnetism and produces the large zx orbital weight seen at Gamma in photoemission experiments .	We examine the magnetic phase diagram of iron pnictides using a five band model .	For the intermediate values of the interaction expected to hold in the iron pnictides , we find a metallic low moment state characterized by antiparallel orbital magnetic moments .	The anisotropy of the interorbital hopping amplitudes is the key to understanding this low moment state .	This state accounts for the small magnetization measured in undoped iron pnictides and leads to the strong exchange anisotropy found in neutron experiments .
2	Recently , Dasgupta and Spiess proved the order of vanishing part of Gross 's conjecture under certain conditions .	We introduce the notion of Shintani data , which axiomatizes algebraic aspects of Shintani zeta functions .	We develop the general theory of Shintani data , and show that the order of vanishing part of Gross 's conjecture follows from the existence of a Shintani datum .	We give an alternative proof of their result by constructing a certain Shintani datum .	We also propose a refinement of Gross 's leading term conjecture by using the theory of Shintani data .
4	During Phase 3 , both transmitters use delayed CSIT to send linear combinations of past transmissions such that each receiver receives a superposition of desired message data and known interference , thus simultaneously serving both receivers .	We study the degrees of freedom ( DoF ) of the multiple-input multiple-output X-channel ( MIMO XC ) with delayed channel state information at the transmitters ( delayed CSIT ) , assuming linear coding strategies at the transmitters .	We present two results : 1 ) the linear sum DoF for MIMO XC with general antenna configurations , and 2 ) the linear DoF region for MIMO XC with symmetric antennas .	The converse for each result is based on developing a novel rank-ratio inequality that characterizes the maximum ratio between the dimensions of received linear subspaces at the two multiple-antenna receivers .	The achievability of the linear sum DoF is based on a three-phase strategy , in which during the first two phases only the transmitter with fewer antennas exploits delayed CSIT in order to minimize the dimension of its signal at the unintended receiver .
3	We studied transport coefficients of a single crystal of bismuth up to 33 tesla , which is deep in this ultraquantum limit .	Because of the long Fermi wavelength of itinerant electrons , the quantum limit of elemental bismuth ( unlike most metals ) can be attained with a moderate magnetic field .	The quantized orbits of electrons shrink with increasing magnetic field .	Beyond the quantum limit , the circumference of these orbits becomes shorter than the Fermi wavelength .	The Nernst coefficient presents three unexpected maxima that are concomitant with quasi-plateaus in the Hall coefficient .
0	We calculate the so-called hard spectator corrections in $ { \cal O } ( \alpha_s ) $ in the leading-twist approximation to the decay widths for $ B \to K^ { * } \gamma $ and $ B \to \rho \gamma $ decays and their charge conjugates , using the Large Energy Effective Theory ( LEET ) techniques .	Combined with the hard vertex and annihilation contributions , they are used to compute the branching ratios for these decays in the next-to-leading order ( NLO ) in the strong coupling $ \alpha_s $ and in leading power in $ \Lambda_ { \rm QCD } /M_B $ .	These corrections are found to be large , leading to the inference that the theoretical branching ratios for the decays $ B \to K^* \gamma $ in the LEET approach can be reconciled with current data only for significantly lower values of the form factors than their estimates in the QCD sum rule and Lattice QCD approaches .	However , the form factor related uncertainties mostly cancel in the ratios $ { \cal B } ( B \to \rho \gamma ) / { \cal B } ( B \to K^* \gamma ) $ and $ \Delta = ( \Delta^ { +0 } + \Delta^ { -0 } ) /2 $ , where $ \Delta^ { \pm 0 } = \Gamma ( B^\pm \to \rho^\pm \gamma ) / [ 2 \Gamma ( B^0 ( \bar B^0 ) \to \rho^0 \gamma ) ] - 1 $ , and hence their measurements will provide quantitative information on the standard model parameters , in particular the ratio of the CKM matrix elements $ | V_ { td } /V_ { ts } | $ and the inner angle $ \alpha $ of the CKM-unitarity triangle .	We also calculate direct CP asymmetries for the decays $ B^\pm \to \rho^\pm \gamma $ and $ B^0/\bar B^0 \to \rho^0 \gamma $ and find , in conformity with the observations made in the existing literature , that the hard spectator contributions significantly reduce the asymmetries arising from the vertex corrections .
3	As a main r esult the formation of a pseudogap in the level density near the critical temper ature of the pairing phase transition has been found .	Low-density nuclear matter at finite temperature is considered representing the strong coupling situation of a highly correlated fermion system .	One-particle se lf-energies and the density of states in the vicinity of the pairing transition point are presented .	Within the Green function approach model calculations are p erformed using the thermodynamic $ T $ matrix in ladder approximation .	It is shown that compared to mean field , the picture of the onset of the pairing transition is essentially changed if correlations are taken into account .
3	In this paper we calculate the mean square of weighted multiplicities for some surfaces associated to congruence subgroups of the unit group of a rational quaternion algebra , in particular for congruence subgroups of the modular group .	We define a weighted multiplicity function for closed geodesics of given length on a finite area Riemann surface .	These weighted multiplicities appear naturally in the Selberg trace formula , and in particular their mean square plays an important role in the study of statistics of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the surface .	In the case of the modular domain , E. Bogomolny , F. Leyvraz and C. Schmit gave a formula for the mean square , which was rigorously proved by M. Peter .	Remarkably , the result turns out to be a rational multiple of the mean square for the modular domain .
1	We call such transformation $ m $ -transformation .	We consider a transformation of a normalized measure space such that the image of any point is a finite set .	In this case the orbit of any point looks like a tree .	In the study of $ m $ -transformations we are interested in the properties of the trees .	An $ m $ -transformation generates a stochastic kernel and a new measure .
4	Here we show , using torque magnetometry that diamagnetism ( hence Cooper pairing ) persists above HK , and well beyond 32 T. The feature at HK signals a cross-over between two distinct vortex-liquid states , and is rapidly thermally broadened at finite temperature T ( hence not part of a mean-field Hc2 ( T ) ) .	Resonant x-ray scattering has shown that the superconducting state in YBa2Cu3Oy competes with a charge-density-wave ( CDW ) state [ 1 ] .	The fluctuating signal is enhanced in a magnetic field H [ 2-4 ] .	Recently , a feature was detected in the thermal conductivity at a field 22 T ( called HK here ) and interpreted as the low-T limit of a mean-field Hc2 ( T ) curve [ 5 ] .	Whether the state above HK involves Cooper pairing is currently a major issue in cuprates .
2	To show this , we recreate the ionizing flux in 47 Tuc , following randomly generated stars through their AGB , post-AGB and white dwarf evolution .	UV radiation from white dwarfs can efficiently clear Galactic globular clusters ( GCs ) of their intra-cluster medium ( ICM ) .	This solves the problem of the missing ICM in clusters , which is otherwise expected to build up to easily observable quantities .	Each white dwarf can ionize all the material injected into the cluster by stellar winds for ~3 Myr of its evolution : ~40 such white dwarfs exist at any point .	Every GC 's ICM should be ionized .
1	Rev A \textbf { 59 } , 1829 ( 1999 ) ] .	In this article we present a general security strategy for quantum secret sharing ( QSS ) protocols based on the HBB scheme presented by Hillery , Bu\v { z } ek and Berthiaume [ Phys .	We focus on a generalization of the HBB protocol to $ n $ communication parties thus including $ n $ -partite GHZ states .	We show that the multipartite version of the HBB scheme is insecure in certain settings and impractical when going to large $ n $ .	To provide security for such QSS schemes in general we use the framework presented by some of the authors [ M. Huber , F. Minert , A. Gabriel , B. C. Hiesmayr , Phys.Rev.Lett .
0	Results are reported from a search for the pair production of top squarks , the supersymmetric partners of top quarks , in final states with jets and missing transverse momentum .	The data sample used in this search was collected by the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 18.9 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV produced by the LHC .	The search features novel background suppression and prediction methods , including a dedicated top quark pair reconstruction algorithm .	The data are found to be in agreement with the predicted backgrounds .	Exclusion limits are set in simplified supersymmetry models with the top squark decaying to jets and an undetected neutralino , either through an on-shell top quark or through a bottom quark and chargino .
4	In clusters with current particle injection , there is a power-law tail of higher energy electrons with an abundance determined by the current rate of injection .	Models for the evolution of the integrated energy spectrum of primary cosmic ray electrons in clusters of galaxies have been calculated , including the effects of losses due to inverse Compton ( IC ) , synchrotron , and bremsstrahlung emission , and Coulomb losses to the intracluster medium ( ICM ) .	The combined time scale for these losses reaches a maximum of ~3e9 yr for electrons with a Lorentz factor ~300 .	Only clusters in which there has been a substantial injection of relativistic electrons since z & lt ; ~ 1 will have any significant population of primary cosmic ray electrons at present .	In typical models , there is a broad peak in the electron energy distribution extending to gamma~300 , and a steep drop in the electron population beyond this .
1	The states of interest are excited ( in an atomic beam ) via an intermediate odd-parity state with a sequence of two laser pulses .	Electric polarizabilities of four low-J even-parity states and three low-J odd-parity states of atomic barium in the range $ 35,600 $ to $ 36,000\ $ cm $ ^ { -1 } $ are investigated .	The odd-parity states can be excited due to the Stark-induced mixing with even-parity states .	The polarizabilities are measured via direct spectroscopy on the second-stage transition .	Several states have tensor and scalar polarizabilities that exceed the values that might be expected from the known energy levels of barium by more than two orders of magnitude .
0	Register allocation has long been formulated as a graph coloring problem , coloring the conflict graph with physical registers .	Such a formulation does not fully capture the goal of the allocation , which is to minimize the traffic between registers and memory .	Linear scan has been proposed as an alternative to graph coloring , but in essence , it can be viewed as a greedy algorithm for graph coloring : coloring the vertices not in the order of their degrees , but in the order of their occurence in the program .	Thus it suffers from almost the same constraints as graph coloring .	In this article , I propose a new method of register allocation based on the ideas of model transformer semantics ( MTS ) and static cache replacement ( SCR ) .
3	Several Euro-VO projects have also provided direct support to selected developments and prototyping .	The European Virtual Observatory Euro-VO has been coordinating European VO activities through a series of projects co-funded by the European Commission over the last 15 years .	The bulk of VO work in Europe is ensured by the national VO initiatives and those of intergovernmental agencies .	VO activities at the European level coordinate the work in support of the three `` pillars '' of the Virtual Observatory : support to the scientific community , take-up by the data providers , and technological activities .	This paper explains the methodology used by Euro-VO over the years .
2	Sample points are roots of unity , a fact which allows explicit inversion formulas for resolution and overlapping kernel operators through the theory of Circulant Matrices and Rectangular Fourier Matrices .	Using coherent-state techniques , we prove a sampling theorem for Majorana 's ( holomorphic ) functions on the Riemann sphere and we provide an exact reconstruction formula as a convolution product of $ N $ samples and a given reconstruction kernel ( a sinc-type function ) .	We also discuss the effect of over- and under-sampling .	The case of band-limited functions on the Riemann sphere , with spins up to $ J $ , is also considered .	The connection with the standard Euler angle picture , in terms of spherical harmonics , is established through a discrete Bargmann transform .
3	The present paper presents an analysis of the correlation between the tumor motion and the diaphragm motion in order to evaluate the potential use of diaphragm as a surrogate for tumor motion .	Lung tumor motion due to respiration poses a challenge in the application of modern three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy .	Direct tracking of the lung tumor during radiation therapy is very difficult without implanted fiducial markers .	Indirect tracking relies on the correlation of the tumor 's motion and the surrogate 's motion .	We have analyzed the correlation between diaphragm motion and superior-inferior lung tumor motion in 32 fluoroscopic image sequences from 10 lung cancer patients .
1	We focus on the redshift range 0.7 $ \leq $ z $ \leq $ 1 , where these galaxies dominate the star formation activity and play a significant role in galaxy evolution .	We investigate the environment of infrared luminous galaxies ( L $ _ { IR } $ [ 8-1000 $ \mu $ m $ ] & gt ; 10^ { 11 } $ L $ _ { \sun } $ ) .	We employ MIPS 24 $ \mu $ m data to identify infrared galaxies in the Extended Groth Strip ( EGS ) .	We use a local density indicator to probe the environment on few Mpc scales and a group member catalog , both of which make use of the DEEP2 spectroscopic redshift catalog , to quantify the environment of these galaxies .	We find that the local environment of LIRGs and ULIRGs is intermediate between that of blue and red galaxies .
0	We study the quasi-normal modes ( QNM ) of electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole in an asymptotically Anti-de Sitter ( AdS ) spacetime .	Some of the electromagnetic modes do not oscillate , they only decay , since they have pure imaginary frequencies .	The gravitational modes show peculiar features : the odd and even gravitational perturbations no longer have the same characteristic quasinormal frequencies .	There is a special mode for odd perturbations whose behavior differs completely from the usual one in scalar and electromagnetic perturbation in an AdS spacetime , but has a similar behavior to the Schwarzschild black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime : the imaginary part of the frequency goes as 1/r+ , where r+ is the horizon radius .	We also investigate the small black hole limit showing that the imaginary part of the frequency goes as r+^2 .
0	We report the $ ^ { 23 } $ Na and $ ^ { 75 } $ As NMR studies on NaFeAs single crystals .	The structure transition temperature $ T_S $ ( 55 K ) and the spin density wave ( SDW ) transition temperature $ T_ { SDW } $ ( 40.5 K ) are determined by the NMR line splits .	The spin-lattice relaxation rates indicate that the spin fluctuations are strongly enhanced just below $ T_S $ and drive a second order SDW transition .	A fluctuating feature of the SDW ordering is also seen below the $ T_ { SDW } $ .	We further performed high-pressure NMR studies on NaFeAs , and found that the $ T_ { SDW } $ increases by $ \sim $ 7 K and the magnetic moment increases by 30 % under 2.5 GPa pressure .
0	We have observed and spatially resolved a set of seven A-type stars in the nearby Ursa Major moving group with the Classic , CLIMB , and PAVO beam combiners on the CHARA Array .	At least four of these stars have large rotational velocities ( $ v \sin i $ $ \gtrsim $ 170 $ \mathrm { km~s^ { -1 } } $ ) and are expected to be oblate .	These interferometric measurements , the stars ' observed photometric energy distributions , and $ v \sin i $ values are used to computationally construct model oblate stars from which stellar properties ( inclination , rotational velocity , and the radius and effective temperature as a function of latitude , etc . )	are determined .	The results are compared with MESA stellar evolution models ( Paxton et al .
2	A visualization scheme of boolean functions is proposed .	The relation between the boolean functions and Bell inequalities for qubits is analyzed .	The connection between the maximal quantum violation of a Bell inequality and the nonlinearity of the corresponding boolean function is discussed .	An attempt to classify Bell inequalities for qubits is made , a weaker result ( classification with respect to Jevons group ) is obtained .	The fractal structure of the classification is shown .
2	As a result , a time-domain , unconditionally stable , and highly efficient numerical algorithm is obtained for the propagation and scattering of broad-band electromagnetic pulses in dispersive and absorbing media .	Maxwell 's equations are cast in the form of the Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation .	The Lanczos propagation method is used in combination with the fast Fourier pseudospectral method to solve the initial value problem .	As compared to conventional finite-difference time-domain methods , an important advantage of the proposed algorithm is a dynamical control of accuracy : Variable time steps or variable computational costs per time step with error control are possible .	The method is illustrated with numerical simulations of extraordinary transmission and reflection in metal and dielectric gratings with rectangular and cylindrical geometry .
1	Therefore , in a fundamental de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave quantum field theory ( valid before and after the Higgs condensation ) , position beables should be attributed to massless fermions .	In the standard model of particle physics , all fermions are fundamentally massless and only acquire their effective bare mass when the Higgs field condenses .	In our endeavour to build a pilot-wave theory of massless fermions , which would be relevant for the study of quantum non-equilibrium in the early universe , we are naturally led to Weyl spinors and to particle trajectories which give meaning to the `zig-zag ' picture of the electron discussed recently by Penrose .	We show that a positive-energy massive Dirac electron of given helicity can be thought of as a superposition of positive and negative energy Weyl particles of the same helicity and that a single massive Dirac electron can in principle move luminally at all times .	This is however not true for the many body situation required by quantum field theory and we conclude that a more natural theory arises from attributing beable status to the positions of massless Dirac particles instead of to Weyl particles .
1	The Kondo effect is ascribed to a singlet-triplet transition in the ground state of the dot .	We report a strong Kondo effect ( Kondo temperature ~ 4K ) at high magnetic field in a selective area growth semiconductor quantum dot .	At the transition , the low-temperature conductance approaches the unitary limit .	Away from the transition , for low bias voltages and temperatures , the conductance is sharply reduced .	The observed behavior is compared to predictions for a two-stage Kondo effect in quantum dots coupled to single-channel leads .
2	The largest size reached is $ M \times N=64\times 10^6 $ .	Using the bond-propagation algorithm , we study the Ising model on a rectangle of size $ M \times N $ with free boundaries .	For five aspect ratios $ \rho=M/N=1,2,4,8,16 $ , the critical free energy , internal energy and specific heat are calculated .	The accuracy of the free energy reaches $ 10^ { -26 } $ .	Basing on these accurate data , we determine exact expansions of the critical free energy , internal energy and specific heat .
0	This brief paper describes the single-player card game called `` Perpetual Motion '' and reports on a computational analysis of the game 's outcome .	The analysis follows a Monte Carlo methodology based on a sample of 10,000 randomly generated games .	The key result is that 54.55 % +/- 0.89 % of games can be completed ( by a patient player ! )	but that the remaining 45.45 % result in non-terminating cycles .	The lengths of these non-terminating cycles leave some outstanding questions .
0	We analyze the exclusive pseudoscalar $ D_ { [ s ] } ^+D_ { [ s ] } ^- $ pair production in $ e^+e^- $ annihilations at $ \sqrt { s } =10.6 $ GeV using a non-factorized PQCD with the light-front wave function that goes beyond the peaking approximation .	We compare our non-factorized analysis with the usual factorized analysis based on the peaking approximation in the calculation of the cross section for the heavy meson pair production .	We also discuss the higher helicity contribution to the cross section .	Our analysis provides a constraint on the size of quark transverse momentum inside the $ D $ meson from the recent Belle data , $ \sigma_ { \rm Exp .	} ( e^+e^-\to D^+D^- ) & lt ; 0.04 $ .
4	Finally , we show that naive use of communication may not improve , and might even harm system efficiency .	We study the process of multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of load balancing in a distributed system , without use of either central coordination or explicit communication .	We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing , important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents .	Given this framework , we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency .	We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations , and address the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context .
4	The thermal effects are elucidated as well as the above finite-size effects .	We investigate the properties of nuclear matter at the first-order phase transitions such as liquid-gas phase transition and hadron-quark phase transition .	As a general feature of the first-order phase transitions of matter consisting of many species of charged particles , there appears a mixed phases with geometrical structures called `` pasta '' due to the balance of the Coulomb repulsion and the surface tension between two phases .	The equation of state ( EOS ) of mixed phase is different from the one obtained by a bulk application of the Gibbs conditions or by the Maxwell construction due to the effects of the non-uniform structure .	We show that the charge screening and strong surface tension make the EOS close to that of the Maxwell construction .
4	We apply the general scheme for the principal and homogeneous realizations of the loop algebra $ sl_3 ( \R ) \otimes { \cal P } ( \lambda , \lambda^ { -1 } ) $ .	A construction of integrable hamiltonian systems associated with different graded realizations of untwisted loop algebras is proposed .	Such systems have the form of Euler - Arnold equations on orbits of loop algebras .	The proof of completeness of the integrals of motion is carried out independently of the realization of the loop algebra .	The hamiltonian systems obtained are shown to coincide with hierarchies of higher stationary equations for some nonlinear PDE 's integrable by inverse scattering method .
2	In the ordinary case , we give necessary conditions in order to obtain such symmetries .	In this article , we introduce the notion of stochastic symmetry of a differential equation .	It consists in a stochastic flow that acts over a solution of a differential equation and produces another solution of the same equation .	These conditions involve the infinitesimal generator of the flow and the coefficients of the equation .	Moreover , we show how to obtain necessary conditions in order to find an application that transforms a stochastic differential equation that one would like to solve into a target equation that one previously know how to solve .
2	In addition to atomic-like states , we find novel `` molecular-like '' phases .	We present excitation energy spectra of few-electron vertically coupled quantum dots for strong and intermediate inter-dot coupling .	By applying a magnetic field , we induce ground state transitions and identify the corresponding quantum numbers by comparison with few-body calculations .	The isospin index characterizes the nature of the bond of the artificial molecule and this we control .	Like spin in a single quantum dot , transitions in isospin leading to full polarization are observed with increasing magnetic field .
3	The effectiveness of the mapping is explored , and we show that all considered quantities are in qualitative , and in some cases quantitative , agreement .	We present a study of the one-dimensional S=1 antiferromagnetic spin chain with large easy plane anisotropy , with special emphasis on field-induced quantum phase transitions .	Temperature and magnetic field dependence of magnetization , specific heat , and thermal conductivity is presented using a combination of numerical methods .	In addition , the original S=1 model is mapped into the low-energy effective S=1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain , a model which is exactly solvable using the Bethe ansatz technique .	The thermal conductivity of the considered S=1 model is found to be strongly influenced by the underlying effective description .
4	We then give purely combinatorial proofs of several numerical results involving the $ K $ -theory and real geometry of $ S ( \lambda_\bullet ) $ .	We establish a combinatorial connection between the real geometry and the $ K $ -theory of complex Schubert curves $ S ( \lambda_\bullet ) $ , which are one-dimensional Schubert problems defined with respect to flags osculating the rational normal curve .	In a previous paper , the second author showed that the real geometry of these curves is described by the orbits of a map $ \omega $ on skew tableaux , defined as the commutator of jeu de taquin rectification and promotion .	In particular , the real locus of the Schubert curve is naturally a covering space of $ \mathbb { RP } ^1 $ , with $ \omega $ as the monodromy operator .	We provide a local algorithm for computing $ \omega $ without rectifying the skew tableau , and show that certain steps in our algorithm are in bijective correspondence with Pechenik and Yong 's genomic tableaux , which enumerate the $ K $ -theoretic Littlewood-Richardson coefficient associated to the Schubert curve .
3	Depending on the form of $ g $ one arrives at two different NC versions of the NCGSG $ _ { 1,2 } $ /NCGMT $ _ { 1,2 } $ correspondence .	Some properties of the correspondence between the non-commutative versions of the ( generalized ) sine-Gordon ( NCGSG $ _ { 1,2 } $ ) and the massive Thirring ( NCGMT $ _ { 1,2 } $ ) models are studied .	Our method relies on the master Lagrangian approach to deal with dual theories .	The master Lagrangians turn out to be the NC versions of the so-called affine Toda model coupled to matter fields ( NCATM $ _ { 1,2 } $ ) , in which the Toda field $ g $ belongs to certain subgroups of $ GL ( 3 ) $ , and the matter fields lie in the higher grading directions of an affine Lie algebra .	In the NCGSG $ _ { 1,2 } $ sectors , through consistent reduction procedures , we find NC versions of some well-known models , such as the NC sine-Gordon ( NCSG $ _ { 1,2 } $ ) ( Lechtenfeld et al .
1	The inverse see-saw mechanism is an interesting alternative to the canonical one once it leads to tiny neutrino masses with the advantage of being testable at TeV scale .	The common lore in the literature of neutrino mass generation is that the canonical see-saw mechanism beautifully offers an explanation for the tiny neutrino mass but at the cost of introducing right-handed neutrinos at a scale that is out of range for the current experiments .	However , this last mechanism suffers from an issue of naturalness concerning the scale responsible for such small masses , namely , the parameter $ \mu $ that is related to lepton number violation and is supposed to be at the keV scale , much lower than the electroweak one .	However , no theoretical framework was built that offers an explanation for obtaining this specific scale .	In this work we propose a variation of the inverse see-saw mechanism by assuming a minimal scalar and fermionic set of singlet fields , along with a $ Z_5\otimes Z_2 $ symmetry , that allows a dynamical explanation for the smallness of $ \mu $ , recovering the neat canonical see-saw formula and with right-handed ( RH ) neutrinos free to be at the electroweak scale , thus testable at LHC and current neutrino experiments .
4	However , those features fit very well together with the properties of the relevant field theories , and subsequently yielded the known dualities .	Dualities between certain supersymmetric gauge field theories in three and four dimensions have been studied in considerable detail recently , by realizing them as geometric manipulations of configurations of extended objects in type II string theory .	These extended objects include `D-branes ' and `NS- ( five ) branes ' .	In constructing the brane configurations which realize dualities for orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups , an `orientifold ' was introduced , which results in non-orientable string sectors .	Certain features of orientifolded NS-branes -such as their existence- were assumed in the original construction , which have not been verified directly .
4	Investigation of the physics related to the symmetry breaking sector both in $ W $ and $ Z $ pair production is given and contrasted with what we expect to obtain in the \epm mode and at the LHC .	The main attractions of studying the bosonic sector of the electroweak standard model and its extensions at a future high energy photon collider are reviewed .	A presentation of the laser scheme for obtaining such a collider is given where we emphasize the importance of polarised \gag spectra .	The need for { \em measuring } the differential luminosities is stressed .	We show that , in a large variety of processes , the yield of weak vector bosons is much higher than at the \epm mode but unfortunately , the cross sections are dominated by the transverse modes .
1	We reveal the intimate connection between Green 's function and the theory of exact stopping rules for random walks on graphs .	The discrete Green 's function ( without boundary ) $ \mathbb { G } $ is a pseudo-inverse of the combinatorial Laplace operator of a graph $ G= ( V , E ) $ .	We give an elementary formula for Green 's function in terms of state-to-state hitting times of the underlying graph .	Namely , $ \mathbb { G } ( i , j ) = \pi_j \left ( \sum_ { k \in V } \pi_k H ( k , j ) - H ( i , j ) \right ) $ where $ \pi_i $ is the stationary distribution at vertex $ i $ and $ H ( i , j ) $ is the expected hitting time for a random walk starting from vertex $ i $ to first reach vertex $ j $ .	This formula also holds for the digraph Laplace operator .
2	Entropy production retains its usual form as a sum of products of fluxes and forces and Onsager 's symmetry principle is proven to hold for the average nanosystem if it is valid for the macroscopic ensemble , by two methods .	Entropy production for a system not in the thermodynamic limit is formulated using Hill 's nanothermodynamics , in which a macroscopic ensemble of such systems is considered .	External influence of the environment on the average nanosystem is connected to irreversible work with an explicit formula based on Jarzynsky equality .	The first one provides expressions that relate the coefficients of the two systems .	The second gives a general condition for a system under a external force to preserve Onsager 's symmetry .
1	When any of these hold then questions of null space and range are subordinated to the same questions for the factors , or certain compositions thereof .	For linear operators which factor with suitable assumptions concerning commutativity of the factors , we introduce several notions of a decomposition .	When the factors are polynomial in other commuting operators then we show that , in a suitable sense , generically factorisations algebraically yield decompositions .	In the case of operators on a space over an algebraically closed field this boils down to elementary algebraic geometry arising from the polynomial formula for the orginal operator .	Applied to operators P polynomial in single other operator D this shows that the solution space for P decomposes directly into a sum of generalised eigenspaces for D. We give universal formulae for the projectors administering the decomposition .
4	In the rapid-thermalization limit , a closed solution is possible in the general case .	We discuss the calculation of the linear conductance through a Coulomb-blockade quantum dot in the presence of interactions beyond the charging energy .	In the limit where the temperature is large compared with a typical tunneling width , we use a rate-equations approach to describe the transitions between the corresponding many-body states .	We discuss both the elastic and rapid-thermalization limits , where the rate of inelastic scattering in the dot is either small or large compared with the elastic transition rate , respectively .	In the elastic limit , we find several cases where a closed solution for the conductance is possible , including the case of a constant exchange interaction .
4	In the first one the limit distribution is robustly reproduced up to a scaling , while in the second one the quantum features of the walk , exemplified by enhanced diffusion rate , are washed out and Gaussian asymptotics prevail .	We investigate a novel quantum random walk ( QRW ) model , possibly useful in quantum algorithm implementation , that achieves a quadratically faster diffusion rate compared to its classical counterpart .	We evaluate its asymptotic behavior expressed in the form of a limit probability distribution of a double horn shape .	Questions of robustness and control of that limit distribution are addressed by introducing a quantum optical cavity in which a resonant Jaynes-Cummings type of interaction between the quantum walk coin system realized in the form of a two-level atom and a laser field is taking place .	Driving the optical cavity by means of the coin-field interaction time and the initial quantum coin state , we determine two types of modification of the asymptotic behavior of the QRW .
3	This is a further study of the results in Shao [ 17 ] and Jing , Shao and Wang [ 10 ] where at most finite third moment is assumed .	In this paper , we study the self-normalized moderate deviations for centered independent random variables with finite third or higher moments .	With these moment conditions , we obtain the exact self-normalized tail probabilities for $ x $ up to $ x=o ( n^ { 1/4 } ) $ .	Consequently under some conditions for the third moment , the self-normalized moderate deviation probabilities in ( 2 ) hold uniformly in a $ x $ range which is related to the moments with order between 3 and 4 .	We also show the necessity of the third moment conditions in obtaining the self-normalized moderate deviation probabilities in ( 2 ) for $ x $ outside the range of $ [ 0 , o ( n^ { 1/6 } ) ] $ .
2	In the framework of the conventional approach to the description of kinetic evolution the mean-field asymptotics of the quantum BBGKY hierarchy solution is constructed .	In the paper we discuss possible approaches to the problem of the rigorous derivation of quantum kinetic equations from underlying many-particle dynamics .	For the description of a many-particle evolution we construct solutions of the Cauchy problems of the BBGKY hierarchy and the dual BBGKY hierarchy in suitable Banach spaces .	We develop also alternative approaches .	One method is based on the construction of the solution asymptotics of the initial-value problem of the quantum dual BBGKY hierarchy .
4	This generalized error exponent criterion provides insights that are not available from asymptotic consistency or central limit theorem analysis .	The small sample universal hypothesis testing problem is investigated in this paper , in which the number of samples $ n $ is smaller than the number of possible outcomes $ m $ .	The goal of this work is to find an appropriate criterion to analyze statistical tests in this setting .	A suitable model for analysis is the high-dimensional model in which both $ n $ and $ m $ increase to infinity , and $ n=o ( m ) $ .	A new performance criterion based on large deviations analysis is proposed and it generalizes the classical error exponent applicable for large sample problems ( in which $ m=O ( n ) $ ) .
3	It has remained an open problem to describe such a correspondence for other classical groups .	We study the Delta-filtered modules for the Auslander algebra of k [ T ] /T^n\rtimes C_2 where C_2 is the cyclic group of order two .	The motivation for this is the bijection between parabolic orbits in the nilradical of a parabolic subgroup of SL_n and certain Delta-filtered modules for the Auslander algebra of k [ T ] /T^n as found by Hille and Roehrle and Bruestle et al .	Under this bijection , the Richardson orbit ( i.e.the dense orbit ) corresponds to the Delta-filtered module without self-extensions .	In this paper , we establish the Auslander algebra of k [ T ] /T^n\rtimes C_2 as the right candidate for the orthogonal groups .
1	This is very challenging because the person 's appearance usually undergoes significant variations due to changes in illumination , camera angle and view , background clutter , and occlusion over the camera network .	In this paper , we address the problem of person re-identification problem , i.e. , retrieving instances from gallery which are generated by the same person as the given probe image .	In this paper , we assume that the matched gallery images should not only be similar to the probe , but also be similar to each other , under suitable metric .	We express this assumption with a fully connected CRF model in which each node corresponds to a gallery and every pair of nodes are connected by an edge .	A label variable is associated with each node to indicate whether the corresponding image is from target person .
2	Entanglement and dissonance , whose definition is introduced here , jointly belong to what is known as quantum discord .	We discuss the problem of the separation of total correlations in a given quantum state into entanglement , dissonance , and classical correlations using the concept of relative entropy as a distance measure of correlations .	This allows us to put all correlations on an equal footing .	Our methods are completely applicable for multipartite systems of arbitrary dimensions .	We investigate additivity relations between different correlations and show that dissonance may be present in pure multipartite states .
2	We discuss possible detection of these effects by Gaia .	We study the photocenter position variability due to variations in the quasar inner structure .	We consider variability in the accretion disk emissivity and torus structure variability due to different illumination by the central source .	Observations of the photocenter variability in two AGNs , SDSS J121855+020002 and SDSS J162011+1724327 have been reported and discussed .	With investigation of the variations in the quasar inner structure we explore how much this effect can affect the position determination and whether it can be ( or not ) detected with Gaia mission .
4	Uncertainties in stellar convection , quantified in terms of uncertainties in the value of the mixing length parameter , cause the most significant errors in the estimates of stellar properties .	Accurate and precise values of radii and masses of stars are needed to correctly estimate properties of extrasolar planets .	We examine the effect of uncertainties in stellar model parameters on estimates of the masses , radii and average densities of solar-type stars .	We find that in the absence of seismic data on solar-like oscillations , stellar masses can be determined to a greater accuracy than either stellar radii or densities ; but to get reasonably accurate results the effective temperature , log g and metallicity must be measured to high precision .	When seismic data are available , stellar density is the most well determined property , followed by radius , with mass the least well determined property .
3	In case ( ii ) all the moments of the distributions can be explicitly computed in terms of periodic orbit theory , and are system-dependent , non-universal , functions .	We investigate the probability distribution of the quantum fluctuations of thermodynamic functions of finite , ballistic , phase-coherent Fermi gases .	Depending on the chaotic or integrable nature of the underlying classical dynamics , on the thermodynamic function considered , and on temperature , we find that the probability distributions are dominated either ( i ) by the local fluctuations of the single-particle spectrum on the scale of the mean level spacing , or ( ii ) by the long-range modulations of that spectrum produced by the short periodic orbits .	In case ( i ) the probability distributions are computed using the appropriate local universality class , uncorrelated levels for integrable systems and random matrix theory for chaotic ones .	The dependence on temperature and number of particles of the fluctuations is explicitly computed in all cases , and the different relevant energy scales are displayed .
2	Investigating four different popular potentials in detail , we show that the predictions of the spherical collapse model depend on the potential used .	We study the spherical collapse model in dark energy cosmologies , in which dark energy is modelled as a minimally coupled scalar field .	We first follow the standard assumption that dark energy does not cluster on the scales of interest .	We also investigate the dependence on the initial conditions .	Secondly , we investigate in how far perturbations in the quintessence field affect the predictions of the spherical collapse model .
4	Additionally , we apply a more physical approach and model the irradiation of the accretion disk directly from the lamp post geometry .	We report on the analysis of the broad Fe Kalpha line feature of Cygnus X-1 in the spectra of four simultaneous hard intermediate state observations made with the X-ray Multiple Mirror mission ( XMM-Newton ) , the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) , and the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory ( INTEGRAL ) .	The high quality of the XMM-Newton data taken in the Modified Timing Mode of the EPIC-pn camera provides a great opportunity to investigate the broadened Fe Kalpha reflection line at 6.4keV with a very high signal to noise ratio .	The 4-500keV energy range is used to constrain the underlying continuum and the reflection at higher energies .	We first investigate the data by applying a phenomenological model that consists of the sum of an exponentially cutoff power law and relativistically smeared reflection .
2	The optical sample contains 208 ACO clusters within redshift , $ z \leq 0.25 $ .	We have made a comparative study of morphological evolution in simulated DM halos and X-ray brightness distribution , and in optical clusters .	Samples of simulated clusters include star formation with supernovae feedback , radiative cooling , and simulation in the adiabatic limit at three different redshifts , z = 0.0 , 0.10 , and 0.25 .	Cluster morphology , within 0.5 and 1.0 h $ ^ { -1 } $ Mpc from cluster center , is quantified by multiplicity and ellipticity .	We find that the distribution of the dark matter halos in the adiabatic simulation appear to be more elongated than the galaxy clusters .
4	Furthermore , the isentropes obtained with the renormalization group are completely smooth at the crossover transition and do not in any way reflect the proximity of the CEP .	Isentropic trajectories crossing the chiral phase transition near the critical endpoint ( CEP ) are studied for two light quark flavors .	The calculations are performed within an effective chiral model with quark-meson interactions , belonging to the same universality class as QCD .	We confront mean-field thermodynamics with the functional renormalization group approach , where fluctuations are properly taken into account .	We establish a connection between modifications of the isentropic trajectories found in mean-field calculations at the crossover transition near the CEP and the order of the phase transition in the chiral limit .
2	The mathematical representation of an idealized waywiser consists of a choice of symmetric space called a { \em model space } and represents the `wheel ' of the idealized waywiser .	The primary aim of this paper is to provide a simple and concrete interpretation of Cartan geometry in terms of the mathematics of idealized waywisers .	Waywisers , also called hodometers , are instruments traditionally used to measure distances .	The geometry of a manifold is then completely characterized by a pair of variables $ \ { V^A ( x ) , A^ { AB } ( x ) \ } $ , each of which admit simple interpretations : $ V^A $ is the point of contact between the waywiser 's idealized wheel and the manifold whose geometry one wishes to characterize , and $ A^ { AB } =A_\mu^ { \phantom { \mu } AB } dx^\mu $ is a connection one-form dictating how much the idealized wheel of the waywiser has rotated when rolled along the manifold .	The familiar objects from differential geometry ( e.g.metric $ g_ { \mu\nu } $ , affine connection $ \Gamma^\rho_ { \mu\nu } $ , co-tetrad $ e^I $ , torsion $ T^I $ , spin-connection $ \omega^ { IJ } $ , Riemannian curvature $ R^ { IJ } $ ) can be seen as compound objects made out of the waywiser variables $ \ { V^A , A^ { AB } \ } $ .
0	We tackle the change-point problem with data belonging to a general set .	We build a penalty for choosing the number of change-points in the kernel-based method of Harchaoui and Capp { \'e } ( 2007 ) .	This penalty generalizes the one proposed by Lebarbier ( 2005 ) for one-dimensional signals .	We prove a non-asymptotic oracle inequality for the proposed method , thanks to a new concentration result for some function of Hilbert-space valued random variables .	Experiments on synthetic data illustrate the accuracy of our method , showing that it can detect changes in the whole distribution of data , even when the mean and variance are constant .
0	For the integrable higher-spin XXX and XXZ spin chains we present multiple-integral representations for the correlation function of an arbitrary product of Hermitian elementary matrices in the massless ground state .	We give a formula expressing it by a single term of multiple integrals .	In particular , we explicitly derive the emptiness formation probability ( EFP ) .	We assume $ 2s $ -strings for the ground-state solution of the Bethe ansatz equations for the spin- $ s $ XXZ chain , and solve the integral equations for the spin- $ s $ Gaudin matrix .	In terms of the XXZ coupling $ \Delta $ we define $ \zeta $ by $ \Delta=\cos \zeta $ , and put it in a region $ 0 \le \zeta & lt ; \pi/2s $ of the gapless regime : $ -1 & lt ; \Delta \le 1 $ ( $ 0 \le \zeta & lt ; \pi $ ) , where $ \Delta=1 $ ( $ \zeta=0 $ ) corresponds to the antiferromagnetic point .
2	We propose that a massive outflow/jets mediated by magnetic fields might remove energy and angular momentum from the accretion disk to allow such high accretion rate flows .	Energetic outflows from main sequence stars accreting mass at very high rates might account for the powering of some eruptive objects , such as merging main sequence stars , major eruptions of luminous blue variables , e.g. , the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae , and other intermediate luminosity optical transients ( ILOTs ; Red Novae ; Red Transients ) .	These powerful outflows could potentially also supply the extra energy required in the common envelope process and in the grazing envelope evolution of binary systems .	By examining the possible activity of the magnetic fields of accretion disks we conclude that indeed main sequence stars might accrete mass at very high rates , up to ~0.01 Mo/yr for solar type stars , and up to ~1 Mo/yr for very massive stars .	We speculate that magnetic fields amplified in such extreme conditions might lead to the formation of massive bipolar outflows that can remove most of the disk 's energy and angular momentum .
4	This includes : $ gg \to Q \bar Q $ , $ \gamma g \to Q \bar Q $ , $ g \gamma \to Q \bar Q $ , $ \gamma \gamma \to Q \bar Q $ .	At high-energies the gluon-gluon fusion is the dominant mechanism of $ c \bar c $ production .	This process was calculated in the NLO collinear as well as in the k $ _t $ -factorization approaches in the past .	We show that the present knowledge of gluon distributions does not allow to make a precise predictions for $ c \bar c $ production at LHC , in particular at forward rapidities .	In this paper we study production of $ c \bar c $ pairs including several subleading mechanisms .
4	From this , all dynamical degrees can be readily computed ( given enough book-keeping and computing time ) .	The dynamical degrees of a rational map $ f : X\dashrightarrow X $ are fundamental invariants describing the rate of growth of the action of iterates of $ f $ on the cohomology of $ X $ .	When $ f $ has nonempty indeterminacy set , these quantities can be very difficult to determine .	We study rational maps $ f : X^N\dashrightarrow X^N $ , where $ X^N $ is isomorphic to the Deligne-Mumford compactification $ \overline { \mathcal M } _ { 0 , N+3 } $ .	We exploit the stratified structure of $ X^N $ to provide new examples of rational maps , in arbitrary dimension , for which the action on cohomology behaves functorially under iteration .
1	We have performed experiments with single-file motion of bicycles and compare the results with previous studies for car and pedestrian motion in similar setups .	The relation between flow and density is an essential quantitative characteristic to describe the efficiency of traffic systems .	In the space-time diagrams we observe three different states of motion ( free flow state , jammed state and stop-and-go waves ) in all these systems .	Despite of their obvious differences they are described by a universal fundamental diagram after proper rescaling of space and time which takes into account the size and free velocity of the three kinds of agents .	This indicates that the similarities between the systems go deeper than expected .
0	We study augmented quasiclassical equations of superconductivity with the Lorentz force , which is missing from the standard Ginzburg-Landau and Eilenberger equations .	It is shown that the magnetic Lorentz force on equilibrium supercurrents induces finite charge distribution and the resulting electric field to balance the Lorentz force .	An analytic expression is obtained for the corresponding Hall coefficient of clean type-II superconductors with simultaneously incorporating the Fermi-surface and gap anisotropies .	It has the same sign and magnitude at zero temperature as the normal state for an arbitrary pairing , having no temperature dependence specifically for the s-wave pairing .	The gap anisotropy may bring a considerable temperature dependence in the Hall coefficient and can lead to its sign change as a function of temperature , as exemplified for a model d-wave pairing with a two-dimensional Fermi surface .
3	The lift of a Jordan domain in a Riemann surface to its universal cover $ \mathbb { D } $ is always uniformly separated in modulus and this allows us to apply these results in the theory of Riemann surfaces to identify an interesting link between the support of the high distortion of a map and topology of the surface - again with explicit and good estimates .	For a self mapping $ f : \mathbb { D } \to \mathbb { D } $ of the unit disk in $ \mathbb { C } $ which has finite distortion , we give a separation condition on the components of the set where the distortion is large - say greater than a given constant - which implies that $ f $ extends homeomorphically and quasisymetrically to the boundary $ \mathbb { S } $ and thus $ f $ shares its boundary values with a quasiconformal mapping whose distortion can be explicitly estimated in terms of the data .	This result holds more generally .	This condition , uniformly separated in modulus , allows the set where the distortion is large to accumulate densely on the boundary but does not allow a component to run out to the boundary .	As part of our investigations we study mappings $ \varphi : \mathbb { S } \to\mathbb { S } $ which are the germs of a conformal mapping and give good bounds on the distortion of a quasiconformal extension of $ \varphi $ .
0	We believe that one can have serious reservations as to whether heavy ion collisions ( e.g.100 GeV/n Au + 100 GeV/n Au ) can lead to Thermal and Chemical equilibrium over large regions ( particularly if it is assumed this happens whenever QGP is produced at RHIC-that is if it is produced ) .	It is at present not clear that the collision dynamics and times available will lead to this .	An alternate scenario proposed by Van Hove where localized in rapidity bubbles of plasma may well be more probable , and may well occur at least some of the time , and some of the time mainly survive to the final state .	If this occurs we have developed a series of event generators to extend and describe these phenomena .	A Van Hove type [ 6,7 ] spherical bubble at eta=0 is embedded in a resonable event generator in qualitative agreement with Hijing etc [ 12 ] .
2	This Lasso-type approach for GLMMs should be mainly used as variable screening method to reduce the number of variables below the sample size .	We propose an L1-penalized algorithm for fitting high-dimensional generalized linear mixed models .	Generalized linear mixed models ( GLMMs ) can be viewed as an extension of generalized linear models for clustered observations .	We then suggest a refitting by maximum likelihood based on the selected variables only .	This is an effective correction to overcome problems stemming from the variable screening procedure which are more severe with GLMMs .
1	This data is represented by a set of nodes and a set of relations ( edges ) .	Social media provides a rich source of networked data .	It is often possible to obtain or infer multiple types of relations from the same set of nodes , such as observed friend connections , inferred links via semantic comparison , or relations based off of geographic proximity .	These edge sets can be represented by one multi-layer network .	In this paper we review a method to perform community detection of multilayer networks , and illustrate its use as a visualization tool for analyzing different community partitions .
4	These are consistent with density functional theory calculations , which reveal that correlations in the Fe -- Se sheets of Ce $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 2 } $ FeSe $ _ { 2 } $ are weak .	The discovery of superconductivity in the 122 iron selenide materials above 30 K necessitates an understanding of the underlying magnetic interactions .	We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetic and semiconducting Ce $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 2 } $ FeSe $ _ { 2 } $ composed of chains of edge-linked iron selenide tetrahedra .	The combined neutron diffraction and inelastic scattering study and density functional calculations confirm the ferromagnetic nature of nearest-neighbour Fe -- Se -- Fe interactions in the ZrCuSiAs-related iron oxyselenide Ce $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 2 } $ FeSe $ _ { 2 } $ .	Inelastic measurements provide an estimate of the strength of nearest-neighbor Fe -- Fe and Fe -- Ce interactions .
1	An analogy is that a deck of cards is ordered within the pack , but before a game of poker or solitaire the deck is shuffled to create a random permutation .	Frequently , randomly organized data is needed to avoid an anomalous operation of other algorithms and computational processes .	Shuffling is used to assure that an aggregate of data elements for a sequence S is randomly arranged , but avoids an ordered or partially ordered permutation .	Shuffling is the process of arranging data elements into a random permutation .	The sequence S as an aggregation of N data elements , there are N !
2	We also prove that the Macdonald scalar product coincides with the abstract Kashiwara form .	In the basic representation of $ U_q ( \hat { sl } ( 2 ) ) $ realized via the algebra of symmetric functions we compare the canonical basis with the basis of Macdonald polynomials with $ q=t^2 $ .	We show that the Macdonald polynomials are invariant with respect to the bar involution defined abstractly on the representations of quantum groups .	This implies , in particular , that the Macdonald polynomials form an intermediate basis between the canonical basis and the dual canonical basis , and the coefficients of the transition matrix are necessarily bar invariant .	We also discuss the positivity and integrality of these coefficients .
0	We present a new proxy for the overdensity peak height for which the large-scale clustering of haloes of a given mass does not vary significantly with the assembly history .	The peak height , usually taken to be well represented by the virial mass , can instead be approximated by the mass inside spheres of different radii , which in some cases can be larger than the virial radius and therefore include mass outside the individual host halo .	The sphere radii are defined as r = $ a $ delta_t + $ b $ log_10 ( M_vir/M_nl ) , where delta_t is the age relative to the typical age of galaxies hosted by haloes with virial mass M_vir , M_nl is the non-linear mass , and $ a $ =0.2 and $ b $ =-0.02 are the free parameters adjusted to trace the assembly bias effect .	Note that $ r $ depends on both halo mass and age .	In this new approach , some of the objects which were initially considered low-mass peaks belong to regions with higher overdensities .
1	The physical interpretation of the Riemann hypothesis equivalent formulation is given in the framework of quantum theory terminology .	An equivalent formulation of the Riemann hypothesis is given .	One more power series related to the Riemann Xi function and the Riemann hypothesis is considered .	Some roots of the polynomial connected with the power series are studied .	It is shown that the Riemann hypothesis is true .
3	Second , we need to identify and characterize the coverage in the parameter space of the models ( i.e.the combinations of input parameters that yield meaningful models ) and the different sources of systematic errors .	In this contribution we investigate how to describe the results and usage of evolutionary synthesis models .	In particular , we look for an explicit and quantitative description of the parameter space of synthesis models and the evaluation of their associated uncertainties and dispersion .	First , we need to understand what synthesis models actually compute : we show that a synthetic stellar population with fixed physical parameters ( age , metallicity , star formation history , initial mass function and size of the system ) can only be described in terms of probability distributions ( i.e.there is an intrinsic dispersion in any model ) .	Third , we need a way to describe quantitatively the intrinsic dispersion , the systematic error and the parameter space coverage of the models .
3	Hence \theta is universal .	The local persistence R ( t ) , defined as the proportion of the system still in its initial state at time t , is measured for the Bak -- Sneppen model .	For 1 and 2 dimensions , it is found that the decay of R ( t ) depends on one of two classes of initial configuration .	For a subcritical initial state , R ( t ) \sim t^ { -\theta } , where the persistence exponent \theta can be expressed in terms of a known universal exponent .	Conversely , starting from a supercritical state , R ( t ) decays by the anomalous form 1-R ( t ) \sim t^ { \tau_ { \rm ALL } } until a finite time t_ { 0 } , where \tau_ { \rm ALL } is also a known exponent .
0	We explore the physical properties of a unified microscopic theory for the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides .	In the case of particle-hole symmetry the elementary particles are Dirac fermions at the nodes of the charge density wave gap .	When particle-hole symmetry is broken electron ( hole ) pockets are formed around the Fermi surface .	The superconducting ground state emerges from the pairing of nodal quasi-particles mediated by acoustic phonons via a piezoelectric coupling .	We calculate several properties in the s-wave superconducting phase , including specific heat , ultra-sound absorption , nuclear magnetic relaxation , thermal , and optical conductivities .
4	We re-analyze Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data to measure { \delta } Cephei 's parallax ( $ \varpi = 4.09 \pm 0.16 $ mas ) and find tentative evidence for an orbital signature , although we can not claim detection .	Classical Cepheid variable stars are crucial calibrators of the cosmic distance scale thanks to a relation between their pulsation periods and luminosities .	Their archetype , { \delta } Cephei , is an important calibrator for this relation .	In this paper , we show that { \delta } Cephei is a spectroscopic binary based on newly-obtained high-precision radial velocities .	We combine these new data with literature data to determine the orbit , which has period 2201 days , semi-amplitude 1.5 km/s , and high eccentricity ( e = 0.647 ) .
3	Mean-field approximation is employed to estimate their Curie temperature , which exceeds room temperature for the alloy with Sb .	Electronic structure calculations from first-principles are employed to design some new half-metallic fully-compensated ferrimagnets ( or as they are widely known half-metallic antiferromagnets ) susceptible of finding applications in spintronics .	Cr $ _2 $ MnZ ( Z= P , As , Sb , Bi ) compounds have 24 valence electrons per unit cell and calculations show that their total spin moment is approximately zero for a wide range of lattice constants in agreement with the Slater-Pauling behavior for ideal half-metals .	Simultaneously , the spin magnetic moments of Cr and Mn atoms are antiparallel and the compounds are ferrimagnets .	Our findings suggest that Cr $ _2 $ MnSb is the compound of choice for further experimental investigations .
1	This kinematic information is connected to dynamical aspects in the formation and evolution of the Milky Way , such as the passage of satellites and vertical resonance and determines whether the warp is a long-lived or a transient feature .	We derive the vertical velocities of disk stars in the range of Galactocentric radii of R=5-16 kpc within 2 kpc in height from the Galactic plane .	We used the proper motions of the PPMXL survey , correcting of systematic errors with the reference of quasars .	From the color-magnitude diagram K versus ( J-K ) we selected the standard candles corresponding to red clump giants and used the information of their proper motions to build a map of the vertical motions of our Galaxy .	We derived the kinematics of the warp both analytically and through a particle simulation to fit these data .
1	Together with theoretical Tight-Binding ( TB ) calculations , this technique can be used to understand the evolution of source-to-channel barrier height ( Eb ) and of active channel area ( S ) with gate bias ( Vgs ) .	Channel conductance measurements can be used as a tool to study thermally activated electron transport in the sub-threshold region of state-of-art FinFETs .	The quantitative difference between experimental and theoretical values that we observe can be attributed to the interface traps present in these FinFETs .	Therefore , based on the difference between measured and calculated values of ( i ) S and ( ii ) |dEb/dVgs| ( channel to gate coupling ) , two new methods of interface trap density ( Dit ) metrology are outlined .	These two methods are shown to be very consistent and reliable , thereby opening new ways of analyzing in situ state-of-the-art multi-gate FETs down to the few nm width limit .
1	This has been deduced from experimental low temperature data in the tunneling regime as well as from the vanishing isotope effect in diffusion in glasses and undercooled liquids .	The motion of the structure determining components is highly collective , both in amorphous solids and in undercooled liquids .	In molecular dynamics simulations of glasses one observes that both low frequency resonant vibrations and atomic jumps are centered on more than 10 atoms which , in densely packed materials , form chainlike structures .	With increasing temperature the number of atoms jumping collectively increases .	These chains of collectively jumping atoms are also seen in undercooled liquids .
4	The resulting secret-key involves contributions of both channel sequences and source sequences , with the contribution of the latter becoming dominant as the coherence period increases .	Fundamental limits of secret-key agreement over reciprocal wireless channels are investigated .	We consider a two-way block-fading channel where the channel gains in the forward and reverse links between the legitimate terminals are correlated .	The channel gains between the legitimate terminals are not revealed to any terminal , whereas the channel gains of the eavesdropper are revealed to the eavesdropper .	We propose a two-phase transmission scheme , that reserves a certain portion of each coherence block for channel estimation , and the remainder of the coherence block for correlated source generation .
3	Interestingly , an almost scale-invariant power spectrum predicted in the modulated reheating mechanism gives a better fit to the observation in the presence of the extra radiation .	We show that the modulated reheating mechanism can naturally account for dark radiation , whose existence is hinted by recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the primordial Helium abundance .	In this mechanism , the inflaton decay rate depends on a light modulus which acquires almost scale-invariant quantum fluctuations during inflation .	We find that the light modulus is generically produced by the inflaton decay and therefore a prime candidate for the dark radiation .	We discuss the production mechanism of the light modulus in detail taking account of its associated isocurvature fluctuations .
1	Eilenberger theory extended to a multiband superconductor is utilized to describe the detailed vortex lattice properties , such as the flux line form factors , the vortex lattice anisotropy and magnetic torques .	We investigate the mixed state properties in a type II multiband superconductor with uniaxial anisotropy under the Pauli paramagnetic effects .	We apply this theory to Sr $ _2 $ RuO $ _4 $ to analyze those physical quantities obtained experimentally , focusing on the interplay between the strong two-dimensional anisotropy and the Pauli paramagnetic effects .	This study allows us to understand the origin of the disparity between the vortex lattice anisotropy ( $ \sim $ 60 ) and the $ H_ { \rm c2 } $ anisotropy ( $ \sim $ 20 ) .	Among the three bands ; $ \gamma $ with the effective mass anisotropy $ \sim $ 180 , $ \alpha $ with $ \sim $ 120 , and $ \beta $ with $ \sim $ 60 , the last one is found to be the major band , responsible for various magnetic responses while the minor $ \gamma $ band plays an important role in the vortex formation .
1	Motivated by the recent discoveries in chromatin folding that interphase chromosomes have territorial organization with signatures pointing to metastability , we analyzed the biomolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank and found that the intrachain contact probabilities , $ P ( s ) $ as a function of the arc length $ s $ , decay in power-law $ \sim s^ { -\gamma } $ over the intermediate range of $ s $ , $ 10\lesssim s\lesssim 110 $ .	Although both RNA and proteins have densely packed native structures , chain organizations of these two biopolymers are fundamentally different .	We found that the contact probability scaling exponent is $ \gamma\approx 1.11 $ for large RNA ( $ N & gt ; 110 $ ) , $ \gamma\approx 1.41 $ for small sized RNA ( $ N & lt ; 110 $ ) , and $ \gamma\approx 1.65 $ for proteins .	Given that Gaussian statistics is expected for a fully equilibrated chain in polymer melts , the deviation of $ \gamma $ value from $ \gamma=1.5 $ for the subchains of large RNA in the native state suggests that the chain configuration of RNA is not fully equilibrated .	It is visually clear that folded structures of large sized RNA ( $ N\gtrsim 110 $ ) adopt crumpled structures , partitioned into modular multi-domains assembled by proximal sequences along the chain , whereas the polypeptide chain of folded proteins looks better mixed with the rest of the structure .
3	We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for two such irreducible Virasoro modules to be isomorphic .	We use Block 's results to classify irreducible modules over the differential operator algebra $ \mathbb { C } [ t , t^ { -1 } , \frac d { dt } ] $ .	From this classification and using `` the twisting technique '' we construct a lot of new irreducible modules over the Virasoro algebra .	These new irreducible Virasoro modules are generally not weight modules .	Many examples for such irreducible Virasoro modules with different features are provided at the end of the paper .
0	We present a one-loop calculation of a gauge invariant QCD beta function .	Using both momentum and temperature renormalization group equations we investigate the running coupling in the magnetic sector as a function of temperature and momentum scale .	At fixed momentum scale we find that , in contrast to $ \lambda\phi^4 $ or QED , high-temperature QCD is strongly coupled , even after renormalization group improvement .	However , if the momentum scale is changed simultaneously with temperature in a specified manner , the coupling decreases .	We also point out in what regime dimensional reduction occurs .
3	Usually one measures an unknown frequency or phase shift using a system prepared in a known quantum state .	We consider how the conventional spectroscopic and interferometric schemes can be rearranged to serve for reconstructing quantum states of physical systems possessing SU ( 2 ) symmetry .	The discussed systems include a collection of two-level atoms , a two-mode quantized radiation field with a fixed total number of photons , and a single laser-cooled ion in a two-dimensional harmonic trap with a fixed total number of vibrational quanta .	In the proposed rearrangement , the standard spectroscopic and interferometric experiments are inverted .	Our aim is just the inverse one , i.e. , to use a well-calibrated apparatus with known transformation parameters to measure unknown quantum states .
4	We will show advances in these three directions .	A fundamental step in the classification of finite-dimensional complex pointed Hopf algebras is the determination of all finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of braided vector spaces arising from groups .	The most important class of braided vector spaces arising from groups is the class of braided vector spaces ( CX , c^q ) , where C is the field of complex numbers , X is a rack and q is a 2-cocycle on X with values in C^* .	Racks and cohomology of racks appeared also in the work of topologists .	This leads us to the study of the structure of racks , their cohomology groups and the corresponding Nichols algebras .
0	I review measurements of element abundances in different components of the high redshift universe , including the Lyman alpha forest , damped Lyman alpha systems , and Lyman break galaxies .	Although progress is being made in all three areas , recent work has also produced some surprises and shown that established ideas about the nature of the damped Lyman alpha systems in particular may be too simplistic .	Overall , our knowledge of metal abundances at high z is still very sketchy .	Most significantly , there seems to be an order of magnitude shortfall in the comoving density of metals which have been measured up to now compared with those produced by the star formation activity seen in Lyman break galaxies .	At least some of the missing metals are likely to be in hot gas in galactic halos and proto-clusters .
3	This technology is the first of its kind and will eliminate the need for cable around personal computers , docking stations , and other consumer electronic devices .	The Wireless Gigabit Alliance ( WiGig ) and IEEE 802.11ad are developing a multigigabit wireless personal and local area network ( WPAN/WLAN ) specification in the 60 GHz millimeter wave band .	Chipset manufacturers , original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) , and telecom companies are also assisting in this development .	60 GHz millimeter wave transmission will scale the speed of WLANs and WPANs to 6.75 Gbit/s over distances less than 10 meters .	High-definition multimedia interface ( HDMI ) , display port , USB 3.0 , and peripheral component interconnect express ( PCIe ) 3.0 cables will all be eliminated .
1	The large imaginary parts of the forward kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes and the decay width difference $ \Delta\Gamma $ prevent a sizable enhancement of the $ K_L\to K_S $ transition probability .	We study the effects of periodic matter in kaon regeneration , motivated by the possibility of parametric resonance in neutrino oscillations .	However , some interesting effects can be produced using regenerators made of alternating layers of two different materials .	Despite the fact that the regenerator has a fixed length one can obtain different values for the probability distribution of the $ K_L $ decay into a final state .	Using a two-arm regenerator set up it is possible to measure the imaginary parts of the $ K^0 ( \bar { K } ^0 ) $ -nucleon scattering amplitudes in the correlated decays of the $ \phi $ -resonance .
1	The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs .	We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD 70573 .	We carried out spectroscopic observations of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla .	Our spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about 100 Myrs .	Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored since December 2003 until January 2007 .
0	It is demonstrated by SQUID magnetization measurements that ( Ga , Mn ) As films can exhibit rich characteristics of magnetic anisotropy depending not only to the epitaxial strain but being strongly influenced by the hole and Mn concentration , and temperature .	This behavior reflects the spin anisotropy of the valence subbands and corroborates predictions of the mean field Zener model of the carrier mediated ferromagnetism in III-V diluted magnetic semiconductors with Mn .	At the same time the existence of in-plane uniaxial anisotropy with [ 110 ] the easy axis is evidenced .	This is related to the top/bottom symmetry breaking , resulting in the lowering of point symmetry of ( Ga , Mn ) As to the C_ { 2v } symmetry group .	The latter mechanism coexists with the hole-induced cubic anisotropy , but takes over close to T_C .
0	Quasar accretion disks are believed to form stars by self-gravity .	Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei ( LLAGN ) are much dimmer galactic centers , and are often believed to be quasars that ran out of gaseous fuel .	LLAGN accretion disks should thus co-exist with thousands to millions of stars or proto-stars left from the previous stronger accretion activity .	In principle , these stars may produce several important effects : ( i ) contribute to the optical/UV spectra of some LLAGN ; ( ii ) reprocessing of the stellar radiation in the dusty disks could dominate the LLAGN infra-red spectra ; ( iii ) deplete the ( accretion ) gas disk much faster than it can accrete onto the supper-massive black hole ( SMBH ) ; ( iv ) stars , individually or in groups , may slow down and modulate the accretion flow significantly due to their inertia .	In this way they may produce the LLAGN cut-off disks ; ( v ) alternatively , frequent enough stellar collisions and resulting stellar disruptions could keep the inner disk empty .
1	In relativistic heavy ion ( RHI ) collisions , it is likely that jets will be much more complicated with an even longer and more difficult learning curve .	Jets in hadron collisions are very complicated with a long learning curve replete with errors .	Hard scattering is more easily observed via single particle and few particle correlation measurements .	The main advantage of jets is higher rate at large $ p_T $ , plus the possibility of detailed studies of soft fragmentation if the soft fragments can be separated from the background .	A critical review of the possibility of using jets as a probe of hard-scattering in RHI collisions is presented along with other probes and measurements which the author considers much more likely to reveal the interesting physics in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC .
3	This scenario , called internal shock model , is thought to be at the origin of the gamma-rays observed in gamma-ray bursts and can work even better in blazars .	The radiation observed by blazars is believed to originate from the transformation of bulk kinetic energy of relativistic jets into random energy .	A simple way to achieve this is to have an intermittent central power source , producing shells of plasma with different bulk Lorentz factors .	These shells will collide at some distance from the center , producing shocks and then radiation .	It accounts for the observed key characteristics of these objects , including the fact that radiation must be preferentially produced at a few hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the center , but continues to be produced all along the jet .
0	We investigate the collective electron dynamics in a recently proposed graphene-based terahertz emitter under the influence of the radiative damping effect , which is included self-consistently in a molecular dynamics approach .	We show that under appropriate conditions synchronization of the dynamics of single electrons takes place , leading to a rise of the oscillating component of the charge current .	The synchronization time depends dramatically on the applied dc electric field and electron scattering rate , and is roughly inversely proportional to the radiative damping rate that is determined by the carrier concentration and the geometrical parameters of the device .	The emission spectra in the synchronized state , determined by the oscillating current component , are analyzed .	The effective generation of higher harmonics for large values of the radiative damping strength is demonstrated .
0	The present paper deals with the quantum coordinates of an event in space-time , individuated by a quantum object .	It is known that these observables can not be described by self-adjoint operators or by the corresponding spectral projection-valued measure .	We describe them by means of a positive-operator-valued ( POV ) measure in the Minkowski space-time , satisfying a suitable covariance condition with respect to the Poincare ' group .	This POV measure determines the probability that a measurement of the coordinates of the event gives results belonging to a given set in space-time .	We show that this measure must vanish on the vacuum and the one-particle states , which can not define any event .
0	Vapor sensors based on functionalized carbon nanotubes ( NTs ) have shown great promise , with high sensitivity conferred by the reduced dimensionality and exceptional electronic properties of the NT .	Critical challenges in the development of NT-based sensor arrays for chemical detection include the demonstration of reproducible fabrication methods and functionalization schemes that provide high chemical diversity to the resulting sensors .	Here , we outline a scalable approach to fabricating arrays of vapor sensors consisting of NT field effect transistors functionalized with single-stranded DNA ( DNA-NT ) .	DNA-NT sensors were highly reproducible , with responses that could be described through equilibrium thermodynamics .	Target analytes were detected even in large backgrounds of volatile interferents .
2	These paired electrons perform disorderly zero-point oscillations and there are no force of attraction in their ensemble .	Currently there is a common belief that the explanation of superconductivity phenomenon lies in understanding the mechanism of the formation of electron pairs .	Paired electrons , however , can not form a superconducting condensate spontaneously .	In order to create a unified ensemble of particles , the pairs must order their zero-point fluctuations so that an attraction between the particles appears .	As a result of this ordering of zero-point oscillations in the electron gas , superconductivity arises .
4	In addition , some of the objects may be embedded in , and interacting with , the extended neutral and ionised gas filaments of the Magellanic Stream .	We use a new , improved version of the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey to search for HI emission from nine new , ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxy candidates recently discovered in data from the Dark Energy Survey .	None of the candidates is detected in HI , implying upper limits for their HI masses of typically several hundred to a few thousand solar masses .	The resulting upper limits on M_HI / L_V and M_HI / M_star suggest that at least some of the new galaxy candidates are HI deficient .	This finding is consistent with the general HI deficiency of satellite galaxies located within the Milky Way 's virial radius and supports the hypothesis that gas is being removed from satellites by tidal and ram-pressure forces during perigalactic passages .
1	Single electron spins in gallium arsenide are a leading candidate among solid- state implementations , however strong coupling to nuclear spins in the substrate hinders this approach .	Controlling decoherence is the most challenging task in realizing quantum information hardware .	To realize spin qubits in a nuclear-spin-free system , intensive studies based on group-IV semiconductor are being pursued .	In this case , the challenge is primarily control of materials and interfaces , and device nanofabrication .	We report important steps toward implementing spin qubits in a predominantly nuclear-spin-free system by demonstrating state preparation , pulsed gate control , and charge-sensing spin readout of confined hole spins in a one-dimensional Ge/Si nanowire .
4	In particular , we provide details and proofs-of-concept about a novel set of vulnerabilities CUDA architectures are subject to , that could be exploited to cause severe information leak .	Graphics Processing Units ( GPUs ) are deployed on most present server , desktop , and even mobile platforms .	Nowadays , a growing number of applications leverage the high parallelism offered by this architecture to speed-up general purpose computation .	This phenomenon is called GPGPU computing ( General Purpose GPU computing ) .	The aim of this work is to discover and highlight security issues related to CUDA , the most widespread platform for GPGPU computing .
0	We study four-dimensional N=1 gauge theories which arise from D3-brane probes of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds .	There are some standing paradoxes in the literature regarding relations among ( p , q ) -webs , toric diagrams and various phases of the gauge theories , we resolve them by proposing and carefully distinguishing between two kinds of ( p , q ) -webs : toric and quiver ( p , q ) -webs .	The former has a one to one correspondence with the toric diagram while the latter can correspond to multiple gauge theories .	The key reason for this ambiguity is that a given quiver ( p , q ) -web can not capture non-chiral matter fields in the gauge theory .	To support our claim we analyse families of theories emerging from partial resolution of Abelian orbifolds using the Inverse Algorithm of hep-th/0003085 as well as ( p , q ) -web techniques .
0	To formulate our results let $ f $ be a continuous map from $ \mathbb R^n $ to $ 2^ { \mathbb R^n } $ and $ k $ a natural number such that $ |f ( x ) |\leq k $ for all $ x $ .	We prove that $ f $ is fixed-point free if and only if its continuous extension $ \tilde f : \beta \mathbb R^n\to 2^ { \beta \mathbb R^n } $ is fixed-point free .	If one wishes to stay within metric terms , the result can be formulated as follows : $ f $ is fixed-point free if and only if there exists a continuous fixed-point free extension $ \bar f : b\mathbb R^n\to 2^ { b\mathbb R^n } $ for some metric compactificaton $ b\mathbb R^n $ of $ \mathbb R^n $ .	Using the classical notion of colorablity , we prove that such an $ f $ is always colorable .	Moreover , a number of colors sufficient to paint the graph can be expressed as a function of $ n $ and $ k $ only .
2	We present analytic derivation of the canonical partition functions and Lee-Yang zeros for this type of free energy using the saddle point approximation .	Canonical partition functions and Lee-Yang zeros of QCD at finite density and high temperature are studied .	Recent lattice simulations have confirmed that the free energy of QCD is a quartic function of quark chemical potential at temperature slightly above pseudo-critical temperature $ T_c $ , as in the case with a gas of free massless fermions .	We also perform lattice QCD simulation in a canonical approach using the fugacity expansion of the fermion determinant , and carefully examine its reliability .	By comparing the analytic and numerical results , we conclude that the canonical partition functions follow the Gaussian distribution of the baryon number , and the accumulation of Lee-Yang zeros of these canonical partition functions exhibit the first-order Roberge-Weiss phase transition .
2	Therefore it is reasonable to start by investigating - at first - the possibility of a gauge-invariant description of local instability .	It is tempting to raise the issue of ( metric ) chaos in general relativity since the Einstein equations are a set of highly nonlinear equations which may exhibit dynamically very complicated solutions for the space-time metric .	However , in general relativity it is not easy to construct indicators of chaos which are gauge-invariant .	In this paper we examine an approach which aims at describing the dynamics in purely geometrical terms .	The dynamics is formulated as a geodesic flow through the Maupertuis principle and a criterion for local instability of the trajectories may be set up in terms of curvature invariants ( e.g.the Ricci scalar ) of the manifold on which geodesic flow is generated .
0	Analysis of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake on 26.12.2004 ( M = 9 ) has allowed us to identify two non- trivial properties of the dynamics of aftershocks .	First , the strongest aftershock ( M = 7.2 ) was likely triggered by the round-the-world seismic echo of the main shock .	The idea is that the surface waves propagating outwards from the main shock return back to the vicinity of the epicenter after having made a complete revolution around the Earth and induce there the aftershock .	The second property is the modulation of the aftershock sequence by the fundamental oscillation of the Earth 0S2 excited by the main shock .	Both results are supported by analysis of the Tohoku earthquake ( 11.03.2011 , M = 9 ) , as well as by the statistical analysis of the USGS earthquake catalog .
4	Our findings show that the choice of modeling can have a huge impact on integral experimental covariance matrices .	In this manuscript we study the modeling of experimental data and its impact on the resulting integral experimental covariance and correlation matrices .	By investigating a set of three low enriched and water moderated UO2 fuel rod arrays we found that modeling the same set of data with different , yet reasonable assumptions concerning the fuel rod composition and its geometric properties leads to significantly different covariance matrices or correlation coefficients .	Following a Monte Carlo sampling approach , we show for nine different modeling assumptions the corresponding correlation coefficients and sensitivity profiles for each pair of the effective neutron multiplication factor keff .	Within the 95 % confidence interval the correlation coefficients vary from 0 to 1 , depending on the modeling assumptions .
0	An automorphism of a graph $ G= ( V , E ) $ is a bijective map $ \phi $ from $ V $ to itself such that $ \phi ( v_i ) \phi ( v_j ) \in E $ $ \Leftrightarrow $ $ v_i v_j\in E $ for any two vertices $ v_i $ and $ v_j $ .	Denote by $ \mathfrak { G } $ the group consisting of all automorphisms of $ G $ .	Apparently , an automorphism of $ G $ can be regarded as a permutation on $ [ n ] =\ { 1 , \ldots , n\ } $ , provided that $ G $ has $ n $ vertices .	For each permutation $ \sigma $ on $ [ n ] $ , there is a natural action on any given vector $ \boldsymbol { u } = ( u_1 , \ldots , u_n ) ^t\in \mathbb { C } ^n $ such that $ \sigma\boldsymbol { u } = ( u_ { \sigma^ { -1 } 1 } , u_ { \sigma^ { -1 } 2 } , \ldots , u_ { \sigma^ { -1 } n } ) ^t $ , so $ \sigma $ can be viewed as a linear operator on $ \mathbb { C } ^n $ .	Accordingly , one can formulate a characterization to the automorphisms of $ G $ , { \it i.e. , } $ \sigma $ is an automorphism of $ G $ if and only if every eigenspace of $ \mathbf { A } ( G ) $ is $ \sigma $ -invariant , where $ \mathbf { A } ( G ) $ is the adjacency matrix of $ G $ .
3	Write $ n $ in its binary representation $ n= ( b_i b_ { i-1 } ... b_1 b_0 ) _2 $ and set $ S_M ( n ) = \sum_ { t=0 } ^i t^ { \bar { M } } b_t 2^t $ .	This paper studies three types of functions arising separately in the analysis of algorithms that we analyze exactly using similar Mellin transform techniques .	The first is the solution to a Multidimensional Divide-and-Conquer ( MDC ) recurrence that arises when solving problems on points in $ d $ -dimensional space .	The second involves weighted digital sums .	We analyze the average $ TS_M ( n ) = \frac { 1 } { n } \sum_ { j & lt ; n } S_M ( j ) $ .
2	The depth of VIDEO allows us to study very low accretion rates and/or lower-mass black holes , and 26 per cent of the candidate quasar sample has been spectroscopically confirmed .	Understanding the interplay between black-hole accretion and star formation , and how to disentangle the two , is crucial to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .	To investigate , we use a combination of optical and near-infrared photometry to select a sample of 74 quasars from the VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations ( VIDEO ) Survey , over 1 deg $ ^2 $ .	We use a radio-stacking technique to sample below the nominal flux-density threshold using data from the Very Large Array at 1.4 GHz and find , in agreement with other work , that a power-law fit to the quasar-related radio source counts is inadequate at low flux density .	By comparing with a control sample of galaxies ( where we match in terms of stellar mass ) , and by estimating the star formation rate , we suggest that this radio emission is predominantly caused by accretion activity rather than star-formation activity .
3	On the other hand , the velocity field shows a more complex structure which is a genuine expression of a non-equilibrium steady state and which can be compared to a recent fluctuating hydrodynamic theory with non-equilibrium noise .	Velocity and density structure factors are measured over a hydrodynamic range of scales in a horizontal quasi-2d fluidized granular experiment , with packing fractions $ \phi\in [ 10 % ,40 % ] $ .	The fluidization is realized by vertically vibrating a rough plate , on top of which particles perform a Brownian-like horizontal motion in addition to inelastic collisions .	On one hand , the density structure factor is equal to that of elastic hard spheres , except in the limit of large length-scales , as it occurs in the presence of an effective interaction .	The temporal decay of velocity modes autocorrelations is compatible with linear hydrodynamic equations with rates dictated by viscous momentum diffusion , corrected by a typical interaction time with the thermostat .
4	Indeed , the science period of the GP-B mission amounts to almost one year .	The possibility of analyzing the node Omega of the GP-B satellite in order to measure also the Lense-Thirring effect on its orbit is examined .	This feature is induced by the general relativistic gravitomagnetic component of the Earth gravitational field .	The GP-B mission has been launched in April 2004 and is aimed mainly to the measurement of the gravitomagnetic precession of four gyroscopes carried onboard at a claimed accuracy of 1 % or better .	The aliasing effect of the solid Earth and ocean components of the solar K_1 tidal perturbations would make the measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect on the orbit unfeasible .
3	We describe models of the thermal structure of the envelopes of neutron stars with magnetic fields up to 10^ { 14 } G. Unlike earlier work , we infer the properties of envelope models in two dimensions and precisely account for the quantization of the electron phase space .	Recently launched x-ray telescopes have discovered several candidate isolated neutron stars .	The thermal radiation from these objects may potentially constrain our understanding of nuclear physics in a realm inaccessible to terrestrial experiments .	To translate the observed fluxes from neutron stars into constraints , one needs precise calculations of the heat transfer through the thin insulating envelopes of neutron stars .	Both dipole and uniformly magnetized envelopes are considered .
4	The Schiff and octupole moments induce atomic electric dipole moments ( EDM ) and P , T -odd interactions in molecules which are measured in numerous experiments to test CP-violation theories .	Parity ( P ) and time reversal ( T ) violating nuclear forces create P , T -odd moments in expansion of the nuclear electrostatic potential .	We derive expression for the nuclear electric octupole field which includes the electron screening correction ( similar to the screening term in the Schiff moment ) .	Then we calculate the Z alpha corrections to the Schiff moment which appear due to the finite nuclear size .	Such corrections are important in heavy atoms with nuclear charge Z & gt ; 50 .
4	Our results can partly explain the large scatter between published estimates of the power spectrum and number counts .	The strong dependence of the mass variance parameter , sigma_8 , on the adopted cluster mass-temperature relation is explored .	A recently compiled X-ray cluster catalog and various mass-temperature relations are used to derive the corresponding values of sigma_8 .	Calculations of the power spectrum of the CMB anisotropy induced by the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and cluster number counts are carried out in order to assess the need for a consistent choice of the mass-temperature scaling and the parameter sigma_8 .	We find that the consequences of inconsistent choice of the mass-temperature relation and sigma_8 could be quite substantial , including a considerable mis-estimation of the magnitude of the power spectrum and cluster number counts .
1	The goals of the survey are to calibrate the luminosity function of OH megamasers to the low-redshift galaxy merger rate ( 0.1 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.2 ) , and to use the enhanced sample of OH megamasers provided by the survey to study OH megamaser environments , engines , lifetimes , and structure .	We present the preliminary results of a survey for OH megamasers underway at the Arecibo Observatory .	The survey should double the known OH megamaser sample to roughly 100 objects .	Survey results will be presented in installments to facilitate community access to the data .	Here we report the discovery of 11 OH megamasers and one OH absorber , and include upper limits on the isotropic 1667 MHz OH line luminosity of 53 other luminous infrared galaxies at z & gt ; 0.1 .
3	By contrast , we then show how the notion of 'active information ' in the Bohm interpretation provides a coherent explanation of the phenomena shown in these experiments .	We look at certain thought experiments based upon the 'delayed choice ' and 'quantum eraser ' interference experiments , which present a complementarity between information gathered from a quantum measurement and interference effects .	It has been argued that these experiments show the Bohm interpretation of quantum theory is untenable .	We demonstrate that these experiments depend critically upon the assumption that a quantum optics device can operate as a measuring device , and show that , in the context of these experiments , it can not be consistently understood in this way .	We then examine the relationship between information and entropy .
4	We find that the enhancement of the cluster lensing cross sections for long and thin arcs due to the presence of a massive cD at the cluster centre is typically less than 100 % , depending on the model used for the cD galaxy and its orientation .	We perform ray-tracing simulations evaluating the effect of a cD galaxy on the strong lensing properties of five galaxy cluster halos obtained from N-body simulations .	The cD galaxy is modelled using both axially symmetric and elliptical models and assuming several masses for its dark matter halo .	The effect of the cD orientation with respect to the mass distribution of the host galaxy cluster is also investigated .	The simulations are carried out in an open and a flat model universe with cosmological constant .
0	We introduce a new information-theoretic complexity measure $ IC_\infty $ for 2-party functions which is a lower-bound on communication complexity , and has the two leading lower-bounds on communication complexity as its natural relaxations : ( external ) information complexity ( $ IC $ ) and logarithm of partition complexity ( $ \text { prt } $ ) which have so far appeared conceptually quite different from each other .	$ IC_\infty $ is an external information complexity based on R\'enyi mutual information of order infinity .	In the definition of $ IC_\infty $ , relaxing the order of R\'enyi mutual information from infinity to 1 yields $ IC $ , while $ \log \text { prt } $ is obtained by replacing protocol transcripts with what we term `` pseudotranscripts , '' which omits the interactive nature of a protocol , but only requires that the probability of any transcript given the inputs $ x $ and $ y $ to the two parties , factorizes into two terms which depend on $ x $ and $ y $ separately .	Further understanding $ IC_\infty $ might have consequences for important direct-sum problems in communication complexity , as it lies between communication complexity and information complexity .	We also show that applying both the above relaxations simultaneously to $ IC_\infty $ gives a complexity measure that is lower-bounded by the ( log of ) relaxed partition complexity , a complexity measure introduced by Kerenidis et al . ( FOCS 2012 ) .
1	\ ] After the work of Ancona where the universal lower bound 1/16 was obtained , there has been a substantial interest on computing or estimating the Hardy constant of planar domains .	The Hardy constant of a simply connected domain $ \Omega\subset\mathbf { R } ^2 $ is the best constant for the inequality \ [ \int_ { \Omega } |\nabla u|^2dx \geq c\int_ { \Omega } \frac { u^2 } { { \rm dist } ( x , \partial\Omega ) ^2 } \ , dx \ ; , \ ; \ ; \quad u\in C^ { \infty } _c ( \Omega ) .	In \cite { BT } we have determined the Hardy constant of an arbitrary quadrilateral in the plane .	In this work we continue our investigation and we compute the Hardy constant for other non-convex planar domains .	In all cases the Hardy constant is related to that of a certain infinite sectorial region which has been studied by E.B.Davies .
0	The superfluid -- Mott insulator phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate of neutral atoms with doubly degenerate internal ground states in an optical lattice is theoretically investigated .	The optical lattice is created by two counterpropagating linearly polarized laser beams with the angle $ \theta $ between the polarization vectors ( lin-angle-lin configuration ) .	The phase diagram of the system and the critical values of the parameters are worked out .	It is shown that the sign of the detuning plays an important role and that there is a strong suppression of the Mott transition in the case of blue detuning .	Varying the laser intensity and/or the angle $ \theta $ one can manipulate the Mott-insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition as well as prepare the condensate in physically distinguishable `` ferromagnetic '' and `` antiferromagnetic '' superfluid states .
3	With increasing temperature , the width of the spectral functions gets larger and larger making the approximation of quasi-particle less accurate .	Spectral , optical and transport properties of an anisotropic three-dimensional Holstein model are studied within the adiabatic approximation .	The parameter regime is appropriate for organic semiconductors used in single crystal based field effect transistors .	Different approaches have been used to solve the model : self-consistent Born approximation valid for weak electron-phonon coupling , coherent potential approximation exact for infinite dimensions , and numerical diagonalization for finite lattices .	On the contrary , their peak positions are never strongly renormalized in comparison with the bare ones .
0	The article describes the potential application of thermodynamic simulation to forecast chemical aging and relevant color changes in painting .	Qualitative and numerical results were obtained by applying the method to various mixtures of pigments without and with atmospheric components .	The results were compared to the legendary recommendations on incompatible pigment mixtures with about an 80 percent match regarding potential color changes in the aged mixtures .	Results for the cadmium yellow-lead white and cadmium lemon-emerald green mixtures are illustrated by pictures , gradually showing color changes caused by the aging .	The method of thermodynamic simulation can be a powerful tool to investigate old masterpieces , in developing new materials , and to forecast some aspects of the aging of real masterpieces .
3	We investigate the effectiveness of separator reconnection as a particle acceleration mechanism for electrons and protons .	While the exact acceleration mechanism of energetic particles during solar flares is ( as yet ) unknown , magnetic reconnection plays a key role both in the release of stored magnetic energy of the solar corona and the magnetic restructuring during a flare .	Recent work has shown that special field lines , called separators , are common sites of reconnection in 3D numerical experiments .	To date , 3D separator reconnection sites have received little attention as particle accelerators .	We study the particle acceleration using a relativistic guiding-centre particle code in a time-dependent kinematic model of magnetic reconnection at a separator .
3	The HII region luminosity functions have standard slopes at the luminous end .	We present first results of the study of a set of exceptional HI sources identified in the 40 % ALFALFA extragalactic HI survey catalog alpha.40 as being both HI massive ( M_HI & gt ; 10^10 Msun ) and having high gas fractions for their stellar masses : the HIghMass galaxy sample .	We analyze UV- and optical-broadband and Halpha images to understand the nature of their relatively underluminous disks in optical and to test whether their high gas fractions can be tracked to higher dark matter halo spin parameters or late gas accretion .	Estimates of their star formation rates ( SFRs ) based on SED-fitting agree within uncertainties with the Halpha luminosity inferred SFRs .	The global SFRs demonstrate that the HIghMass galaxies exhibit active ongoing star formation ( SF ) with moderate SF efficiency , but relative to normal spirals , a lower integrated SFR in the past .
0	Let $ X $ be an analytic space over a non-Archimedean , complete field $ k $ and let $ ( f_1 , ... , f_n ) $ be a family of invertible functions on $ X $ .	Let $ \phi $ the morphism $ X\to G_m^n $ induced by the $ f_i $ 's , and let $ t $ be the map $ X\to ( R^*_+ ) ^n $ induced by the norms of the $ f_i $ 's .	Let us recall two results .	1 ) The compact set $ t ( X ) $ is a polytope of the $ R $ -vector space $ ( R^*_+ ) ^n $ ( we use the multiplicative notation ) ; this is due to Berkovich in the locally algebraic case , and has been extended to the general case by the author .	2 ) If moreover $ X $ is Hausdorff and $ n $ -dimensional , then the pre-image under $ \phi $ of the skeleton $ S_n $ of $ G_m^n $ has a piecewise-linear structure making $ \phi^ { -1 } ( S_n ) \to S_n $ a piecewise immersion ; this is due to the author .
2	Here we elaborate on the `` stick versus carrot '' dilemma by studying the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public goods game , where besides the traditional cooperators and defectors , rewarding cooperators supplement the array of possible strategies .	The promise of punishment and reward in promoting public cooperation is debatable .	While punishment is traditionally considered more successful than reward , the fact that the cost of punishment frequently fails to offset gains from enhanced cooperation has lead some to reconsider reward as the main catalyst behind collaborative efforts .	The latter are willing to reward cooperative actions at a personal cost , thus effectively downgrading pure cooperators to second-order free-riders due to their unwillingness to bear these additional costs .	Consequently , we find that defection remains viable , especially if the rewarding is costly .
1	The analysis is classically performed in a Hilbert space $ H $ .	For the minimization of a nonlinear cost functional $ j $ under convex constraints the relaxed projected gradient process $ \varphi_ { k+1 } = \varphi_ { k } + \alpha_k ( P_H ( \varphi_ { k } -\lambda_k \nabla_H j ( \varphi_ { k } ) ) -\varphi_ { k } ) $ is a well known method .	We generalize this method to functionals $ j $ which are differentiable in a Banach space .	Thus it is possible to perform e.g.an $ L^2 $ gradient method if $ j $ is only differentiable in $ L^\infty $ .	We show global convergence using Armijo backtracking in $ \alpha_k $ and allow the inner product and the scaling $ \lambda_k $ to change in every iteration .
1	We evidence several relaxation regimes .	We study the emission properties of confined polariton states in shallow zero-dimensional traps under non-resonant excitation .	For slightly negative photon-exciton detuning , we observe a nonlinear increase of the emission intensity , characteristic of carrier-carrier scattering assisted relaxation under strong-coupling regime .	This demonstrates the efficient relaxation towards a confined state of the system .	For slightly positive detuning , we observe the transition from strong to weak coupling regime and then to single-mode lasing .
4	Next , we infer listing quality from the pixel-level information of listed images as quality features .	Online retail is a visual experience- Shoppers often use images as first order information to decide if an item matches their personal style .	Image characteristics such as color , simplicity , scene composition , texture , style , aesthetics and overall quality play a crucial role in making a purchase decision , clicking on or liking a product listing .	In this paper we use a set of image features that indicate quality to predict product listing popularity on a major e-commerce website , Etsy .	We first define listing popularity through search clicks , favoriting and purchase activity .
0	We define and study an equivariant version of Farber 's topological complexity for spaces with a given compact group action .	This is a special case of the equivariant sectional category of an equivariant map , also defined in this paper .	The relationship of these invariants with the equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is given .	Several examples and computations serve to highlight the similarities and differences with the non-equivariant case .	We also indicate how the equivariant topological complexity can be used to give estimates of the non-equivariant topological complexity .
3	Volumes and descriptive measures ( such as means and variances ) for each subject and the pooled distances provide the morphometric differences between diagnostic groups , but they do not reveal all the morphometric information contained in LCDM distances .	Shape differences are manifested in cortical structures due to neuropsychiatric disorders .	Such differences can be measured by labeled cortical distance mapping ( LCDM ) which characterizes the morphometry of the laminar cortical mantle of cortical structures .	LCDM data consist of signed distances of gray matter ( GM ) voxels with respect to GM/white matter ( WM ) surface .	To extract more information from LCDM data , censoring of the distances is introduced .
3	We then analyze the class of locally analytic representations with the property that their associated modules are annihilated by an ideal of finite codimension in the universal enveloping algebra of G , showing under some hypotheses on G that they are sums of representations of the form $ X\otimes Y $ , with X finite dimensional and Y smooth .	In this paper we continue the study of locally analytic representations of a $ p $ -adic Lie group $ G $ in vector spaces over a spherically complete non-archimedean field $ K $ , building on the algebraic approach to such representations introduced in our paper `` Locally analytic distributions and p-adic representation theory , with applications to GL_2 . ''	In that paper we associated to a representation $ V $ a module $ M $ over the ring $ D ( G , K ) $ of locally analytic distributions on $ G $ and described an admissibility condition on $ V $ in terms of algebraic properties of $ M $ .	In this paper we determine the relationship between our admissibility condition on locally analytic modules and the traditional admissibility of Langlands theory .	The irreducible representations of this type are obtained when X and Y are irreducible .
4	New techniques of preprocessing the flux time series are applied to eliminate false positive triples and to enhance the ETV curves .	We produce and analyze eclipse time variation ( ETV ) curves for some 2600 Kepler binaries .	We find good to excellent evidence for a third body in 222 systems via either the light-travel-time ( LTTE ) or dynamical effect delays .	Approximately half of these systems have been discussed in previous work , while the rest are newly reported here .	Via detailed analysis of the ETV curves using high-level analytic approximations , we are able to extract system masses and information about the three-dimensional characteristics of the triple for 62 systems which exhibit both LTTE and dynamical delays ; for the remaining 160 systems we give improved LTTE solutions .
2	The first type is characterized by a nonzero TKNN invariant or Chern number [ 1 ] which is directly related to the quantization of Hall conductance in the integer quantum Hall effect .	The study of topological property of band insulators is an interesting branch of condensed matter physics .	Two types of topologically nontrivial insulators have been extensively studied .	Haledane propose a model with this type of band structure even in the absence of a macroscopic magnetic field [ 2 ] .	We refer to such materials `` Chern insulator '' .
3	Based on a second order explicit method in time , a completely discrete scheme is examined and optimal error estimates are established with a mild condition on the space and time discretizing parameters .	In this paper , both semidiscrete and completely discrete finite volume element methods ( FVEMs ) are analyzed for approximating solutions of a class of linear hyperbolic integro- differential equations in a two-dimensional convex polygonal domain .	The effect of numerical quadrature is also examined .	In the semidiscrete case , optimal error estimates in L^ { \infty } ( L2 ) and L^ { \infty } ( H1 ) - norms are shown to hold with minimal regularity assumptions on the initial data , whereas quasi-optimal estimate in derived in L^ { \infty } ( L^ { \infty } ) -norm under higher regularity on the data .	Finally , some numerical experiments are conducted which confirm the theoretical order of convergence .
4	At full resolution ( ~ 15 h^-1 kpc ) , this technique is capable of identifying almost all self-bound dark matter subhaloes with M & gt ; 10^12 h^-1 M_sun .	In this paper , we undertake a study to determine what insight can be reliably gleaned from the comparison of the X-ray and the weak lensing mass maps of galaxy clusters .	We do this by investigating the 2D substructure within three high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters .	Our main results focus on non-radiative gas dynamics , but we also consider the effects of radiative cooling at high redshift .	For our analysis , we use a novel approach , based on unsharp-masking , to identify substructures in 2D surface mass density and X-ray surface brightness maps .
3	A mechanical version of the second law , which takes the form of an energy imbalance accounting for all power expenditures ( including those due to the atomic diffusion and phase separation ) , is used to derive restrictions on the constitutive equations .	We develop a theoretical framework for the diffusion of a single unconstrained species of atoms on a crystal lattice that provides a generalization of the classical theories of atomic diffusion and diffusion-induced phase separation to account for constitutive nonlinearities , external forces , and the deformation of the lattice .	In this framework , we regard atomic diffusion as a microscopic process described by two independent kinematic variables : ( i ) the atomic flux , which reckons the local motion of atoms relative to the motion of the underlying lattice , and ( ii ) the time-rate of the atomic density , which encompasses nonlocal interactions between migrating atoms and characterizes the kinematics of phase separation .	We introduce generalized forces power-conjugate to each of these rates and require that these forces satisfy ancillary microbalances distinct from the conventional balance involving the forces that expend power over the rate at which the lattice deforms .	With these restrictions , the microbalance involving the forces conjugate to the atomic flux provides a generalization of the usual constitutive relation between the atomic flux and the gradient of the diffusion potential , a relation that in conjunction with the atomic balance yields a generalized Cahn-Hilliard equation .
3	These results applied to the number partitioning problem as a special case are compared with those which were previously obtained by a different method .	We study statistical properties of an NP-complete problem , the subset sum , using the methods and concepts of statistical mechanics .	The problem is a generalization of the number partitioning problem , which is also an NP-complete problem and has been studied in the physics literature .	The asymptotic expressions for the number of solutions are obtained .	We discuss the limit of applicability of the techniques of statistical mechanics to the present problem .
3	These Maxwell Times have a fundamental role in determining the type of hydrodynamic motion that the system would display in the given condition and constraints .	A family of the so-called Maxwell times which arises in the contexto of Higher-Order Generalized Hydrodynamics ( also called Mesoscopic Hydro-Thermodynamics ) is evidenced .	This is done in the framework of a HOGH build within a statistical foundation in terms of a Non-Equilibrium Statistical Ensemble Formalism .	It consists in a description in terms of the densities of particles and energy and their fluxes of all orders , with the motion described by a set of coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations involving them .	The different types of motion are well described by contractions of the full description done in terms of a reduced number of fluxes up to a certain order .
2	Bounds that do not rely on any modeling of astrophysical objects may be derived both from laboratory experiments and certain kinds of astrophysical observations .	The strongest bounds on some forms of Lorentz and CPT violation come from astrophysical data , and placing such bounds may require understanding and modeling distant sources of radiation .	However , it is also desirable to have bounds that do not rely on these kinds of detailed models .	The strongest such bounds on isotropic modifications of electron , positron , and photon dispersion relations of the form E^2 = p^2 + m^ 2 + epsilon p^3 come from data on cosmological birefringence , the absence of photon decay , and radiation from lepton beams .	The bounds range in strength from the 4 x 10^ ( -13 ) to 6 x 10^ ( -33 ) ( GeV ) ^ ( -1 ) levels .
4	Those are the unique compact components in relative character varieties of $ \text { PSL } ( 2 , \mathbb R ) $ .	We study a particular class of representations from the fundamental groups of punctured spheres $ \Sigma_ { 0 , n } $ to the group $ \text { PSL } ( 2 , \mathbb R ) $ ( and their moduli spaces ) , that we call \emph { super-maximal } .	Super-maximal representations are shown to be \emph { totally non hyperbolic } , in the sense that every simple closed curve is mapped to a non hyperbolic element .	They are also shown to be \emph { geometrizable } ( appart from the reducible super-maximal ones ) in the following very strong sense : for any element of the Teichm\ '' uller space $ \mathcal T_ { 0 , n } $ , there is a unique holomorphic equivariant map with values in the lower half-plane $ \mathbb H^- $ .	In the relative character variety , the components of super-maximal representations are shown to be compact , and symplectomorphic ( with respect to the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman symplectic structure ) to the complex projective space of dimension $ n-3 $ equipped with a certain multiple of the Fubiny-Study form that we compute explicitly ( this generalizes a result of Benedetto -- Goldman for the sphere minus four points ) .
2	As a function of this polarization angle we present the scattering results in both the threshold and semi-classical regimes .	We study two body dipolar scattering in two dimensions with a tilted polarization axis .	This tilt reintroduces the anisotropic interaction in a controllable manner .	We find a series of resonances as a function of the angle which allows the scattering to be tuned .	However the character of the resonances varies strongly as a function angle .
1	The data consist of events with an energetic electron or muon , missing transverse energy , and three or more hadronic jets , at least one of which is identified as a b-quark jet by reconstructing a secondary vertex .	We report a measurement of the ttbar production cross section using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron .	The background fraction is determined from a fit of the transverse energy of the leading jet .	Using 162+-10 /pb of data , the total cross section is found to be 6.0+-1.6 ( stat. ) +-1.2 ( syst . )	pb , which is consistent with the Standard Model prediction .
1	The comparison is carried out on the finite volume Global Circulation Model ( fvGCM ) with 72 grid points zonally , 46 grid points meridionally and 55 vertical levels .	This paper explores the potential of Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter ( LETKF ) by comparing the performance of LETKF with an operational 3D-Var assimilation system , Physical-Space Statistical Analysis System ( PSAS ) , under a perfect model scenario .	With only forty ensemble members , LETKF obtains an analysis and forecasts with lower RMS errors than those from PSAS .	The performance of LETKF is further improved , especially over the oceans , by assimilating simulated temperature observations from rawinsondes and conventional surface pressure observations instead of geopotential heights .	An initial decrease of the forecast errors in the NH observed in PSAS but not in LETKF suggests that the PSAS analysis is less balanced .
4	The spectral function of quarkonium is calculated for this case and found to be in remarkable agreement with the corresponding results for an isotropic medium .	We reconsider a plasma with an anisotropy imposed on the momentum distribution of the system and study the real time static potential for quarkonia .	The distribution function is normalised so as to preserve the particle number in an ideal gas , as required in the Keldysh-Schwinger formalism .	In contrast to recent findings without this normalisation , a weak anisotropy does not lead to an increase in the melting temperature for bound states .	To test for the maximal effect , we also investigate a gluonic medium in the limit of an asymptotically strong anisotropy .
0	In this work , we study the $ U ( 1 ) /Z_2 $ Dicke model at a finite $ N $ by using the $ 1/J $ expansion and exact diagonization .	This model includes the four standard quantum optics model as its various special limits .	The $ 1/J $ expansions is complementary to the strong coupling expansion used by the authors in arXiv:1512.08581 to study the same model in its dual $ Z_2/U ( 1 ) $ representation .	We identify 3 regimes of the system 's energy levels : the normal , $ U ( 1 ) $ and quantum tunneling ( QT ) regime .	The system 's energy levels are grouped into doublets which consist of scattering states and Schrodinger Cats with even ( e ) and odd ( o ) parities in the $ U ( 1 ) $ and quantum tunneling ( QT ) regime respectively .
3	The extension to non-smooth functions and the uniformity of the estimates in various ( physical ) parameters rest on recent advances by one of the authors ( AVS ) .	We consider non-smooth functions of ( truncated ) Wiener -- Hopf type operators on the Hilbert space $ L^2 ( \mathbb R^d ) $ .	Our main results are uniform estimates for trace norms ( $ d\ge 1 $ ) and quasiclassical asymptotic formulas for traces of the resulting operators ( $ d=1 $ ) .	Here , we follow Harold Widom 's seminal ideas , who proved such formulas for smooth functions decades ago .	We use our results to obtain the large-scale behaviour of the local entropy and the spatially bipartite entanglement entropy ( EE ) of thermal equilibrium states of non-interacting fermions in position space $ \mathbb R^d $ ( $ d\ge 1 $ ) at positive temperature , $ T & gt ; 0 $ .
1	We detect 72 % of Class 0 objects from this sample and 31 % of Class I objects .	We present deep radio continuum observations of the cores identified as deeply embedded young stellar objects in the Perseus molecular cloud by the Spitzer c2d programme at a wavelength of 1.8 cm with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array ( AMI-LA ) .	No starless cores are detected .	We use the flux densities measured from these data to improve constraints on the correlations between radio luminosity and bolometric luminosity , infrared luminosity and , where measured , outflow force .	We discuss the differing behaviour of these objects as a function of protostellar class and investigate the differences in radio emission as a function of core mass .
3	Kinematic and topological properties including decay angular distributions are used to discriminate between signal and background .	Results are presented from a search for a narrow , spin-2 resonance decaying into a pair of Z bosons , with one Z-boson decaying into leptons ( e+e- or mu+mu- ) and the other into jets .	An example of such a resonance is the Kaluza -- Klein graviton , G [ KK ] , predicted in Randall -- Sundrum models .	The analysis is based on a 4.9 inverse femtobarn sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV , collected with the CMS detector at the LHC .	No evidence for a resonance is observed , and upper limits on the production cross sections times branching fractions are set .
4	We follow a blackbox approach in which we consider components that perform operations on the biometric data they contain and where only the input/output behavior of these components is analyzed .	In this paper we analyze different biometric authentication protocols considering an internal adversary .	Our contribution takes place at two levels .	On the one hand , we introduce a new comprehensive framework that encompasses the various schemes we want to look at .	On the other hand , we exhibit actual attacks on recent schemes such as those introduced at ACISP 2007 , ACISP 2008 , and SPIE 2010 , and some others .
3	Relations between these manifolds and Grassmann manifolds have been established .	In this paper we study regular irreducible algebraic monoids over $ \fldc $ equipped with the euclidean topology .	It is shown that , in such monoids , the Green classes and the spaces of idempotents in the Green classes all have natural manifold structures .	The interactions of these manifold structures and the semigroup structures in these monoids have been investigated .	A generalisation of a result on the dimension of the manifold of rank $ k $ idempotents in the semigroup of linear endomorphisms over $ \fldc $ has been proved .
3	The resulting gold nanoparticles are homogeneous in size and shape and , depending on synthesis temperature , the size ranges from 10 to 20 nm , as revealed by TEM .	Gold nanoparticles have been synthesized inside ethosomes , vesicles composed of phospholipid , ethanol and water , which could be very efficient not only in delivery probes to the skin but also as diagnostic and therapeutic multimodal agents .	High efficiency encapsulation of gold nanoparticles is achieved by a simple strategy : the nanoparticles synthesis occurs simultaneously with the ethosomes formation , in the absence of any undesirable reducing agents .	A three-dimensional reconstruction of a gold-embedded ethosome generated by cryoelectron tomography reveals that the gold particle is localized inside the lipid bilayer , leaving the ethosome surface and core free for further functionalization .	The ethosome-nanoparticles hybrids size has been investigated by means of dynamic light scattering and has been found to vary with temperature and gold salt concentration from 700 to 400 nm .
3	The PNR { \rho } _n showed that although D2 absorption occurred throughout the samples , absorption in the multilayer stack was modest ( 0.02 D per Pd atom ) and thus did not expand .	The effects of hydrogen ( H2 ) and deuterium ( D2 ) absorption were studied in two Co/Pd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( PMA ) using polarized neutron reflectivity ( PNR ) .	PNR was measured in an external magnetic field H applied in the plane of the sample with the magnetization M confined in the plane for { \mu } _o H= 6.0 T and partially out of plane at 0.65 T. Nominal thicknesses of the Co and Pd layers were 2.5 { \AA } and 21 { \AA } , respectively .	Because of these small values , the actual layer chemical composition , thickness , and interface roughness parameters were determined from the nuclear scattering length density profile ( { \rho } _n ) and its derivative obtained from both x-ray reflectivity and PNR , and uncertainties were determined using Monte Carlo analysis .	Direct magnetometry showed that H2 absorption decreased the total M at saturation and increased the component of M in the plane of the sample when not at saturation .
0	Basic concepts of quantum integrable systems ( QIS ) are presented stressing on the unifying structures underlying such diverse models .	Variety of ultralocal and nonultralocal models is shown to be described by a few basic relations defining novel algebraic entries .	Such properties can generate and classify integrable models systematically and also help to solve exactly their eigenvalue problem in an almost model-independent way .	The unifying thread stretches also beyond the QIS to establish its deep connections with statistical models , conformal field theory etc .	as well as with abstract mathematical objects like quantum group , braided or quadratic algebra
0	We examine the oblique correction phenomenology of one-family Technicolor with light pseudo-Goldstone bosons .	From loop calculations based on a gauged chiral lagrangian for Technicolor , we are lead to conclude that even though loops with light Goldstone bosons give a negative contribution to $ S $ measured at the $ Z $ -pole , this effect is not sufficiently large to unambiguously counter the `S-argument ' against one-family Technicolor .	This result can not be guessed \apriori , but must be explicitly calculated .	Our analysis entails an extended version of the $ STU $ oblique parametrization of Peskin and Takeuchi .	In principle , this extended formalism ( $ STUVWX $ ) must be used when there are light new particles in loops .
3	We are able to quantify not only some global network properties such as assortativity , clustering coefficient , and degree and strength distributions , but also its subgraph structure and dynamics by using community detection techniques .	Economic systems , traditionally analyzed as almost independent national systems , are increasingly connected on a global scale .	Only recently becoming available , the World Input-Output Database ( WIOD ) is one of the first efforts to construct the multi-regional input-output ( MRIO ) tables at the global level .	By viewing the world input-output system as an interdependent network where the nodes are the individual industries in different economies and the edges are the monetary goods flows between industries , we study the network properties of the so-called world input-output network ( WION ) and document its evolution over time .	Over time , we detect a marked increase in cross-country connectivity of the production system , only temporarily interrupted by the 2008-2009 crisis .
1	The participants met to address the following questions .	We report the outcome of a 3-day workshop on the Hubble constant ( H_0 ) that took place during February 6-8 2012 at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology , on the campus of Stanford University .	Are there compelling scientific reasons to obtain more precise and more accurate measurements of H_0 than currently available ?	If there are , how can we achieve this goal ?	The answers that emerged from the workshop are ( 1 ) better measurements of H_0 provide critical independent constraints on dark energy , spatial curvature of the Universe , neutrino physics , and validity of general relativity , ( 2 ) a measurement of H_0 to 1 % in both precision and accuracy , supported by rigorous error budgets , is within reach for several methods , and ( 3 ) multiple paths to independent determinations of H_0 are needed in order to access and control systematics .
4	This article provides a first overview of the typologies and characteristics of popular science web videos .	The creation of popular science web videos on the Internet has increased in recent years .	The diversity of formats , genres , and producers makes it difficult to formulate a universal definition of science web videos since not every producer considers him- or herself to be a science communicator in an institutional sense , and professionalism and success on video platforms no longer depend exclusively on technical excellence or production costs .	Entertainment , content quality , and authenticity have become the keys to community building and success .	The democratization of science video production allows a new variety of genres , styles , and forms .
4	Extending concepts from epidemiological modelling , we define a basic reproduction number $ R_0 $ for the linear threshold ABM and apply it to predict ABM behaviour on empirical networks .	We study a linear threshold agent-based model ( ABM ) for the spread of political revolutions on social networks using empirical network data .	We propose new techniques for building a hierarchy of simplified ordinary differential equation ( ODE ) based models that aim to capture essential features of the ABM , including effects of the actual networks , and give insight in the parameter regime transitions of the ABM .	We relate the ABM and the hierarchy of models to a population-level compartmental ODE model that we proposed previously for the spread of political revolutions [ 1 ] , which is shown to be mathematically consistent with the proposed ABM and provides a way to analyze the global behaviour of the ABM .	This consistency with the linear threshold ABM also provides further justification a posteriori for the compartmental model of [ 1 ] .
1	In $ d=1 $ exact results demonstrate that $ T_ { dyn } =T_c $ , the static glass transition temperature , and that the dynamical exponent changes from $ z ( T ) =2 + 2 ( T_c/T ) ^2 $ at high temperature to $ z ( T ) = 4 T_c/T $ in the glass phase .	A particle in a random potential with logarithmic correlations in dimensions $ d=1,2 $ is shown to undergo a dynamical transition at $ T_ { dyn } & gt ; 0 $ .	The same formulae are argued to hold in $ d=2 $ .	Dynamical freezing is also predicted in the 2D random gauge XY model and related systems .	In $ d=1 $ a mapping between dynamics and statics is unveiled and freezing involves barriers as well as valleys .
0	We construct models describing the velocity field in the infall regions of clusters .	The velocity field is the superposition of a systematic component and a `` noise '' component accounting for the effects of small scale substructure and observational errors .	This procedure results in models which resemble the observations ( redshifts and angular separations of galaxies surrounding clusters ) quite well .	We demonstrate , on simulated data , that it is possible to estimate correctly the parameters of the systematic velocity component , knowledge of which allows determination of the mass profile of a cluster .	To avoid systematic effects when analyzing real data , observations from a number of clusters should be combined .
2	on an electrode of a novel photovoltaic device as Ag deposition under light illumination , in which the wavelength of incident light is longer than the long-wavelength cutoff of the materials composing the device.Naruse et al .	We study a stochastic model for the self-controlled particle-deposition process induced by optical near-fields .	This process was experimentally realized by Yukutake et al .	introduced a stochastic cellular automaton model to simulate underlying nonequilibrium processes which are necessary to formulate unique granular Ag film in this deposition process .	In the present paper , we generalize their model and clarify the essential role of optical near-fields generated on the electrode surface .
4	We also consider enumeration problems and the relation to the theory of codes .	We investigate Abelian primitive words , which are words that are not Abelian powers .	We show that unlike classical primitive words , the set of Abelian primitive words is not context-free .	We can determine whether a word is Abelian primitive in linear time .	Also different from classical primitive words , we find that a word may have more than one Abelian root .
0	Seismic waves sensitive to the outermost part of the Earth 's liquid core seem to be affected by a stably stratified layer at the core-mantle boundary .	Such a layer could have an observable signature in both long-term and short-term variations of the magnetic field of the Earth , which are used to probe the flow at the top of the core .	Indeed , with the recent SWARM mission , it seems reasonable to be able to identify waves propagating in the core with period of several months , which may play an important role in the large-scale dynamics .	In this paper , we characterize the influence of a stratified layer at the top of the core on deep quasi-geostrophic ( Rossby ) waves .	We compute numerically the quasi-geostrophic eigenmodes of a rapidly rotating spherical shell , with a stably stratified layer near the outer boundary .
3	This resolution allowed us to detect a richer spectrum of BPs in the QS .	Since photospheric bright points ( BPs ) were first observed , there has been a question as to how are they structured .	Are they just single flux tubes or a bundle of the flux-tubes ?	Surface photometry of the quiet Sun ( QS ) has achieved resolution close to 0.1 '' with the New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory .	The smallest BPs we observed with TiO 705.68 nm were 0.13 '' , and we were able to resolve individual components in some of the BPs clusters and ribbons observed in the QS , showing that they are composed of the individual BPs .
4	We also apply our approach to the special case of detecting shifts in the mean of independent normal observations .	In the sequential change-point detection literature , most research specifies a required frequency of false alarms at a given pre-change distribution $ f_ { \theta } $ and tries to minimize the detection delay for every possible post-change distribution $ g_ { \lambda } $ .	In this paper , motivated by a number of practical examples , we first consider the reverse question by specifying a required detection delay at a given post-change distribution and trying to minimize the frequency of false alarms for every possible pre-change distribution $ f_ { \theta } $ .	We present asymptotically optimal procedures for one-parameter exponential families .	Next , we develop a general theory for change-point problems when both the pre-change distribution $ f_ { \theta } $ and the post-change distribution $ g_ { \lambda } $ involve unknown parameters .
2	In fact , our studies mimic the current investigations concerning the integrability properties of this gauge theory .	We study the perturbative integrability of the planar sector of a massive SU ( N ) matrix quantum mechanical theory with global SO ( 6 ) invariance and Yang-Mills-like interaction .	This model arises as a consistent truncation of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a three-sphere to the lowest modes of the scalar fields .	Like in the field theory we can prove the planar integrability of the SO ( 6 ) model at first perturbative order .	At higher orders we restrict ourselves to the widely studied SU ( 2 ) subsector spanned by two complexified scalar fields of the theory .
4	We also point out the approximately 20 % sensitivity of the asymmetry depending on which set of values for the B meson production fractions is used : as measured at the Z pole or at the Tevatron .	The existing predictions for the like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry at the Tevatron are expressed in terms of parameters related to B mesons ' mixing and inclusive production fractions .	We show that in the realistic case when phase-space cuts are applied , the asymmetry depends also on the details of the production mechanism for the B mesons .	In particular , it is sensitive to the difference in the fragmentation functions of B^0_d and B^0_s mesons .	We estimate these fragmentation effects and find that they shift the theory prediction for this observable by approximately 10 % .
2	Stellar interactions with the accretion flows around the supermassive black hole play a role in that an flying-by star may cool a hot accretion disk as a result of Comptonization .	If a supermassive black hole resides in the centers of galaxies , there are several effects expected to be observed .	It is likely that accretion disks are around the supermassive black hole .	It is shown that the Comptonization of the stellar emission will take place in a hot accretion disk such as the ADAFs around the supermassive black hole and become a relatively important source of the accretion disk cooling when the mass accretion rate is low , and stars are passing outer parts of the hot accretion disk .	We suggest that such a stellar cooling can be observed in the radio frequency regime since synchrotron luminosity of the ADAFs depends strongly on the electron temperature and occurs much more frequently than a tidal disruption event .
2	It is not even known whether this sector contains topologically nontrivial solutions , at all .	Recently it has been shown that there exists a sector within the Faddeev-Niemi model for which the equations of motion may be reduced to first order equations .	However , no solutions to that sector have been given .	Here , we show that two models with analytically known Hopf solitons , namely the Nicole and the Aratyn-Ferreira-Zimerman models , possess sectors which can be integrated to first order partial differential equations .	The main result is that these sectors are topologically nontrivial .
1	The wavelet transform is a hierarchical technique designed to separate data sets into sets representing local averages and local differences .	The wavelet transform , a family of orthonormal bases , is introduced as a technique for performing multiresolution analysis in statistical mechanics .	Although one-to-one transformations of data sets are possible , the advantage of the wavelet transform is as an approximation scheme for the efficient calculation of thermodynamic and ensemble properties .	Even under the most drastic of approximations , the resulting errors in the values obtained for average absolute magnetization , free energy , and heat capacity are on the order of 10 % , with a corresponding computational efficiency gain of two orders of magnitude for a system such as a $ 4\times 4 $ Ising lattice .	In addition , the errors in the results tend toward zero in the neighborhood of fixed points , as determined by renormalization group theory .
1	The `` coined '' walk uses discrete time steps , and contains , besides the particle making the walk , a second quantum system , the coin , that determines the direction in which the particle will move .	There are presently two models for quantum walks on graphs .	The continuous walk operates with continuous time .	Here a third model for a quantum walk is proposed , which is based on an analogy to optical interferometers .	It is a discrete-time model , and the unitary operator that advances the walk one step depends only on the local structure of the graph on which the walk is taking place .
3	A collision between a WIMP and a gas molecule results in a nuclear recoil of 1-2 mm .	Directional detection can provide unambiguous observation of Dark Matter interactions even in presence of insidious backgrounds .	The DM-TPC collaboration is developing a detector with the goal of measuring the direction and sense of nuclear recoils produced in Dark Matter interactions .	The detector consists of a Time Projection Chamber with optical readout filled with CF $ _4 $ gas at low pressure .	The measurement of the energy loss along the recoil allows us to determine the sense and the direction of the recoil .
2	For the finite-dimensional case we study the vanishing-viscosity limit of doubly nonlinear equations given in terms of a differentiable energy functional and a dissipation potential which is a viscous regularization of a given rate-independent dissipation potential .	In the nonconvex case solutions of rate-independent systems may develop jumps as a function of time .	To model such jumps , we adopt the philosophy that rate independence should be considered as limit of systems with smaller and smaller viscosity .	The resulting definition of 'BV solutions ' involves , in a nontrivial way , both the rate-independent and the viscous dissipation potential , which play a crucial role in the description of the associated jump trajectories .	We shall prove a general convergence result for the time-continuous and for the time-discretized viscous approximations and establish various properties of the limiting BV solutions .
0	We make a search for Halpha emitting galaxies at z=0.24 in the Subaru Deep Field ( SDF ) using the archival data set obtained with the Subaru Telescope .	We carefully select Halpha emitters in the narrowband filter NB816 , using B , V , Rc , i ' , and z ' broad-band colors .	We obtain a sample of 258 emitting galaxies with observed equivalent widths of ( Halpha+ [ NII ] 6548,6584 ) greater than 12 angstrom .	We also analyze a sample of Halpha emitters taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) to constrain the luminous end of Halpha luminosity function .	Using the same selection criteria as for the SDF , and after excluding AGNs , we obtain 317 Halpha emitting star-forming galaxies .
4	This discrepancy indicates a fundamental problem in one of the two techniques , or a significant error in polarization transfer or cross section measurements .	Several experiments have extracted proton electromagnetic form factors from elastic cross section measurements using the Rosenbluth technique .	Global analyses of these measurements indicate approximate scaling of the electric and magnetic form factors ( mu_p*G_E/G_M = 1 ) , in contrast to recent polarization transfer measurements from Jefferson Lab .	We present here a global reanalysis of the cross section data aimed at understanding the disagreement between the Rosenbluth extraction and the polarization transfer data .	We find that the individual cross section measurements are self-consistent , and that the new global analysis yields results that are still inconsistent with polarization measurements .
0	Estimating the spectral characteristics of a nonstationary random process is an important but challenging task , which can be facilitated by exploiting structural properties of the process .	In certain applications , the observed processes are underspread , i.e. , their time and frequency correlations exhibit a reasonably fast decay , and approximately time-frequency sparse , i.e. , a reasonably large percentage of the spectral values is small .	For this class of processes , we propose a compressive estimator of the discrete Rihaczek spectrum ( RS ) .	This estimator combines a minimum variance unbiased estimator of the RS ( which is a smoothed Rihaczek distribution using an appropriately designed smoothing kernel ) with a compressed sensing technique that exploits the approximate time-frequency sparsity .	As a result of the compression stage , the number of measurements required for good estimation performance can be significantly reduced .
1	We initially detect 7 candidate sources with signal-to-noise ratios ( SNRs ) between 3.0 and 3.5 and 4 candidate sources with SNR & gt ; 3.5 .	We present an 850-micron map and list of candidate sources in a 70 arcmin^2 sub-area of the Groth Strip observed using SCUBA .	Simulations suggest that on average in a map this size one expects 1.6 false positive sources for SNR & gt ; 3.5 and 4.5 for 3 & lt ; SNR & lt ; 3.5 .	Flux boosting in maps is a well known effect and we have developed a simple Bayesian prescription for estimating the unboosted flux distribution and used this method to determine the best flux estimates of our sources .	This method is easily adapted for any other modest signal-to-noise survey in which there is prior knowledge of the source counts .
2	Two of these turned out to be hot emission-line stars , of which one is a definite B [ e ] star .	We present an empirical determination of the mass-loss rate as a function of stellar luminosity and effective temperature , for oxygen-rich dust-enshrouded Asymptotic Giant Branch stars and red supergiants .	To this aim we obtained optical spectra of a sample of dust-enshrouded red giants in the Large Magellanic Cloud , which we complemented with spectroscopic and infrared photometric data from the literature .	The mass-loss rates were measured through modelling of the spectral energy distributions .	We thus obtain the mass-loss rate formula log Mdot = -5.65 + 1.05 log ( L / 10,000 Lsun ) -6.3 log ( Teff / 3500 K ) , valid for dust-enshrouded red supergiants and oxygen-rich AGB stars .
1	It is of particular interest to verify the observability of the phase in which the object is rapidly accreting while not yet igniting the fusion of hydrogen that marks the arrival on the ZAMS .	Determining the timeline for the formation of massive YSOs requires the identification and characterisation of all the phases that a massive forming YSO undergoes .	One of the candidate prototypical objects for this phase is Mol160/IRAS23385+6053 , which previous studies suggest it could be in a pre-Hot Core stage .	We further investigate this issue by means of Spitzer imaging and spectroscopy in the 5-70 micron range .	The dense core of Mol160/IRAS23385+6053 , which up to now had only been detected at submm and mm wavelenghts has been revealed for the first time at 24 and 70 micron by Spitzer .
0	Neutrino reactions on $ ^ { 40 } $ Ar via charged and neutral currents for detecting solar and core collapsing supernovae ( SNe ) neutrinos and the Gamow Teller strength are calculated by considering the high-lying excited states up to a few tens of MeV region .	The nucleus was originally exploited to identify the solar neutrino emitted from $ ^ { 8 } $ B produced in the pp-chains on the Sun .	With the higher energy neutrinos emitted from the core collapsing SNe , contributions from higher multi-pole transitions including the spin dipole resonances ( SDR ) as well as the Gamow Teller ( GT ) and Fermi transitions are shown to be important ingredients for understanding reactions induced by the SNe as well as solar neutrinos .	In this work , we focused on the role of high-lying excited states which are located beyond a few low-lying states known in the experiment .	Expected large difference between the cross sections of $ \nu_e $ and $ { \bar \nu_e } $ reactions on $ ^ { 40 } $ Ar , which difference has been anticipated in previous calculations because of the large Q value in the $ { \bar \nu } _e $ reaction , is significantly diminished .
2	This question has been resolved ( at least for $ H^1 $ data ) if $ M [ u ] E [ u ] \leq M [ Q ] E [ Q ] $ , where $ M [ u ] $ and $ E [ u ] $ denote the mass and energy of $ u $ , and $ Q $ denotes the ground state solution to $ -Q+\Delta Q +|Q|^2Q=0 $ .	We consider solutions $ u $ to the 3d nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger equation $ i\partial_t u + \Delta u + |u|^2u=0 $ .	In particular , we are interested in finding criteria on the initial data $ u_0 $ that predict the asymptotic behavior of $ u ( t ) $ , e.g. , whether $ u ( t ) $ blows-up in finite time , exists globally in time but behaves like a linear solution for large times ( scatters ) , or exists globally in time but does not scatter .	Here , we prove a new sufficient condition for blow-up using an interpolation type inequality and the virial identity that is applicable to certain initial data satisfying $ M [ u ] E [ u ] & gt ; M [ Q ] E [ Q ] $ .	Our condition is similar to one obtained by Lushnikov ( 1995 ) but our method allows for an adaptation to radial , infinite-variance initial data that can be stated conceptually : for real initial data , if a certain fraction of the mass is contained in the unit ball , then blow-up occurs .
3	The maximal figure of merit $ ZT $ of BP is found to be 0.72 at $ 800\ , \mathrm { K } $ that could be enhanced to 0.87 by exerting an appropriate strain , revealing BP could be a potential medium-high temperature TE material .	We systematically investigated the geometric , electronic and thermoelectric ( TE ) properties of bulk black phosphorus ( BP ) under strain .	The hinge-like structure of BP brings unusual mechanical responses such as anisotropic Young 's modulus and negative Poisson 's ratio .	A sensitive electronic structure of BP makes it transform among metal , direct and indirect semiconductors under strain .	Such strain-induced enhancements of TE performance are often observed to occur at the boundary of the direct-indirect band gap transition , which can be attributed to the increase of degeneracy of energy valleys at the transition point .

In a recent letter [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	and challenging theoretical understanding to date .	At stake is the explanation of a low-temperature paramagnetic reentrance of order unity .	The authors claim to find a `significant paramagnetic effect ' which they strongly relate to the layout and findings of the experiment .
4	Using the methods of Tikhonov 's regularization and truncated integration , we construct the regularized solutions .	Let $ \Omega $ be a two-dimensional heat conduction body .	We consider the problem of determining the heat source $ F ( x , t ) =\varphi ( t ) f ( x , y ) $ with $ \varphi $ be given inexactly and $ f $ be unknown .	The problem is nonlinear and ill-posed .	By a specific form of Fourier transforms , we shall show that the heat source is determined uniquely by the minimum boundary condition and the temperature distribution in $ \Omega $ at the initial time $ t=0 $ and at the final time $ t=1 $ .
3	We prove , in this paper , the existence of excited state solutions in the symmetric case and of a ground state solution in the non-symmetric case for the soliton bag and the bag approximation models thanks to the concentration compactness method .	Quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) is the theory of strong interaction and accounts for the internal structure of hadrons .	Physicists introduced phe- nomenological models such as the M.I.T .	bag model , the bag approximation and the soliton bag model to study the hadronic properties .	We show that the energy functionals of the bag approximation model are Gamma -limits of sequences of soliton bag model energy functionals for the ground and excited state problems .
1	For IR-NTC systems based on { \em finite-length } codes ( with blocklength $ N $ ) and decoding attempts only at { \em certain specified decoding times } , this paper presents the asymptotic expansion achieved by random coding , provides rate-compatible sphere-packing ( RCSP ) performance approximations , and presents simulation results of tail-biting convolutional codes .	This paper explores feedback systems using incremental redundancy ( IR ) with noiseless transmitter confirmation ( NTC ) .	The information-theoretic analysis shows that values of $ N $ relatively close to the expected latency yield the same random-coding achievability expansion as with $ N = \infty $ .	However , the penalty introduced in the expansion by limiting decoding times is linear in the interval between decoding times .	For binary symmetric channels , the RCSP approximation provides an efficiently-computed approximation of performance that shows excellent agreement with a family of rate-compatible , tail-biting convolutional codes in the short-latency regime .
2	In this study , we will analyze the percolation properties of a realistic network model where dependency links follow certain network topology .	The robustness of complex networks with dependencies has been studied in recent years .	However , previous studies focused on the robustness of networks composed of dependency links without network topology .	We perform the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to show the critical effects of topology of dependency links on robustness of complex networks .	For Erd\ '' os-R\'enyi ( ER ) connectivity network , we find that the system with dependency of RR topology is more vulnerable than system with dependency of ER topology .

Visual and ultraviolet spatially resolved ( ~ 0 .	`` 1 ) spectra of SN 1987A obtained on days 3715 and 3743 with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope show that the high-velocity SN debris is colliding with circumstellar gas .	Very broad Ly-alpha emission with velocities extending to ~ +/- 20,000 km/s originates inside the inner circumstellar ring and appears to fill most of the surface area within 0 . `` 67 +/- 0 .	The observed Ly-alpha flux from the shocked ejecta is ( 1.85 +/- 0.53 ) 10^ { -13 } erg/cm2/s and ( 1.25 +/- 0.51 ) 10^ { -12 } erg/cm2/s after correcting for extinction .
0	Given a set of points that sample a shape , the Rips complex of the data points is often used in machine-learning to provide an approximation of the shape easily-computed .	It has been proved recently that the Rips complex captures the homotopy type of the shape assuming the vertices of the complex meet some mild sampling conditions .	Unfortunately , the Rips complex is generally high-dimensional .	To remedy this problem , it is tempting to simplify it through a sequence of collapses .	Ideally , we would like to end up with a triangulation of the shape .
2	Unlike most local giant HI galaxies , it is actively star forming .	HIZOA J0836-43is one of the most HI-massive galaxies in the local ( z & lt ; 0.1 ) Universe .	Not only are such galaxies extremely rare , but this `` coelacanth '' galaxy exhibits characteristics -- in particular its active , inside-out stellar disk-building -- that appear more typical of past ( z ~ 1 ) star formation , when large gas fractions were more common .	Moreover , the strong infrared emission is not induced by a merger event or AGN , as is commonly found in other local LIRGs .	The galaxy is suggestive of a scaled-up version of local spiral galaxies ; its extended star formation activity likely being fueled by its large gas reservoir and , as such , can aid our understanding of star formation in systems expected to dominate at higher redshifts .
1	It is shown explicitly that at any deviation from half-filling ( $ n \neq 1/2 $ ) the system is unstable with respect to phase separation into charge ordered regions with $ n = 1/2 $ and metallic regions with smaller electron or hole density .	A simple model of charge ordering is considered .	Possible structure of this phase-separated state ( metallic droplets in a charge-ordered matrix ) is discussed .	The model is extended to account for the strong Hund-rule onsite coupling and the weaker intersite antiferromagnetic exchange .	An analysis of this extended model allows us to determine the magnetic structure of the phase-separated state and to reveal the characteristic features of manganites and other substances with charge ordering .
