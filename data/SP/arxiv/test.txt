3	After a certain storage time we coherently convert the spin waves into the light in deterministic anti-Stokes scattering .	We apply collective Raman scattering to create , store and retrieve spatially multimode light in warm rubidium-87 vapors .	The light is created in a spontaneous Stokes scattering process .	This is accompanied by the creation of counterpart collective excitations in the atomic ensemble -- the spin waves .	The whole process can be regarded as a delayed four-wave mixing which produces pairs of correlated , delayed random images .
3	The most luminous sources , which we attribute to accreting black holes exhibit X-ray colors typical of a black body spectrum .	We present characteristics of the X-ray point source population in the M84 galaxy , observed by Chandra ACIS-S. We find an excess in the number of sources centered on M84 , with a spatial distribution closely corresponding to the M84 stellar light .	Given an absence of recent star-formation , accreting binaries are the only candidates for the M84 X-ray sources .	The majority of M84 sources ( with luminosities exceeding 10^38 ergs/s ) exhibit hardness ratios expected from multi-temperature black-body disk emission .	We also identify the sources whose X-ray colors match the expectations for constituents of the Cosmic X-ray Background .
2	Here we extend earlier implementations for Raman transitions to the case of Bragg diffraction .	The use of retro-reflection in light-pulse atom interferometry under microgravity conditions naturally leads to a double-diffraction scheme .	The two pairs of counterpropagating beams induce simultaneously transitions with opposite momentum transfer that , when acting on atoms initially at rest , give rise to symmetric interferometer configurations where the total momentum transfer is automatically doubled and where a number of noise sources and systematic effects cancel out .	In contrast with the single-diffraction case , the existence of additional off-resonant transitions between resonantly connected states precludes the use of the adiabatic elimination technique .	Nevertheless , we have been able to obtain analytic results even beyond the deep Bragg regime by employing the so-called `` method of averaging , '' which can be applied to more general situations of this kind .
4	However , population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems : animals migrate , bacteria run and tumble .	Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems .	Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic , non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations .	Such non-transitive relations lead to an evolution with central features represented by the `rock-paper-scissors ' game , where rock crushes scissors , scissors cut paper , and paper wraps rock .	In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations , this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity .
2	We classify SNe using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations , finding two of the three to be clearly of type SN Ia and the third probable .	Using three magnified Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) detected behind CLASH clusters , we perform a first pilot study to see whether standardizable candles can be used to calibrate cluster mass maps created from strong lensing observations .	Such calibrations will be crucial when next generation HST cluster surveys ( e.g.FRONTIER ) provide magnification maps that will , in turn , form the basis for the exploration of the high redshift Universe .	The SNe exhibit significant amplification , up to a factor of 1.7 at $ \sim5\sigma $ significance ( SN-L2 ) .	We conducted this as a blind study to avoid fine tuning of parameters , finding a mean amplification difference between SNe and the cluster lensing models of $ 0.09 \pm 0.09^ { stat } \pm 0.05^ { sys } $ mag .
2	They are likely to include a range of physical systems ; some may be common systems in unusual states : neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes ( BHs ) , or SNRs .	Chandra observations of nearby galaxies have revealed a number of X-ray sources characterized by high luminosities ( $ L_X & gt ; \sim10^ { 36 } $ erg s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) and $ k T $ in the range $ 100 - 350 $ eV .	These `` quasisoft X-ray sources '' ( QSSs ) are harder than luminous supersoft X-ray sources ( SSSs ) , whose characteristic temperatures are tens of eV , but , with little or no emission above 2 keV , they are significantly softer than most canonical X-ray sources .	Others may be accreting BHs of intermediate mass .	We have analyzed { \it Chandra } data from $ 19 $ near-by galaxies to identify QSSs with sufficiently high count rates to allow spectral fits .
3	Most of the previous works developed in SPEED2 at Dusseldorf were done in a plasma focus configuration for soft X-ray emission and the neutron emission from SPEED2 was not completely studied .	SPEED2 is a generator based on Marx technology and was designed in the University of Dusseldorf .	SPEED2 consists on 40 +/- Marx modules connected in parallel ( 4.1 mF equivalent Marx generator capacity , 300 kV , 4 MA in short circuit , 187 kJ , 400 ns rise time , dI/dt~1013 A/s ) .	Currently the SPEED2 is operating at the Comision Chilena de Energia Nuclear , CCHEN , Chile , being the most powerful and energetic device for dense transient plasma in the Southern Hemisphere .	The research program at CCHEN considers experiments in different pinch configurations ( plasma focus , gas puffed plasma focus , gas embedded Z-pinch , wire arrays ) at current of hundred of kiloamperes to mega-amperes , using the SPEED2 generator .
1	We therefore build and compare a semi-empirical model for AGN fueling which accounts for both merger and non-merger 'triggering . '	Recent observations have indicated that a large fraction of the low to intermediate luminosity AGN population lives in disk-dominated hosts , while the more luminous quasars live in bulge-dominated hosts , in conflict with some previous model predictions .	In particular , we show that the 'stochastic accretion ' model - in which fueling in disk galaxies is essentially a random process arising whenever dense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the present observations at low/intermediate luminosities .	However it falls short of the high-luminosity population .	We combine this with models for major merger-induced AGN fueling , which lead to rarer but more luminous events , and predict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated AGN host galaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift .
3	Here we adopt the more realistic approach of gradually reducing beta_ { cool } , as might correspond to changes in thermal regime due to secular changes in the disc density profile .	A number of previous studies of the fragmentation of self-gravitating protostellar discs have modeled radiative cooling with a cooling timescale ( t_ { cool } ) parameterised as a simple multiple ( beta_ { cool } ) of the local dynamical timescale .	Such studies have delineated the `fragmentation boundary ' in terms of a critical value of beta_ { cool } ( beta_ { crit } ) , where the disc fragments if beta_ { cool } & lt ; beta_ { crit } .	Such an approach however begs the question of how in reality a disc could ever be assembled with beta_ { cool } & lt ; beta_ { crit } .	We find that when beta_ { cool } is gradually reduced ( on a timescale longer than t_ { cool } ) , the disc is stabilised against fragmentation , compared with models in which beta_ { cool } is reduced rapidly .
4	We also propose a novel feature descriptor , Gradient Context , and apply bag-of-words model to represent regions with different scales .	Traditional approaches for handwritten Chinese character recognition suffer in classifying similar characters .	In this paper , we propose to discriminate similar handwritten Chinese characters by using weakly supervised learning .	Our approach learns a discriminative SVM for each similar pair which simultaneously localizes the discriminative region of similar character and makes the classification .	For the first time , similar handwritten Chinese character recognition ( SHCCR ) is formulated as an optimization problem extended from SVM .
3	Approximate pair correlation functions are obtained for single-slip systems with two types of dislocations and , subsequently , for general multiple-slip systems of both charges .	Due to recent successes of a statistical-based nonlocal continuum crystal plasticity theory for single-glide in explaining various aspects such as dislocation patterning and size-dependent plasticity , several attempts have been made to extend the theory to describe crystals with multiple slip systems using ad-hoc assumptions .	We present here a mesoscale continuum theory of plasticity for multiple slip systems of parallel edge dislocations .	We begin by constructing the Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Yvon-Kirkwood ( BBGYK ) integral equations relating different orders of dislocation correlation functions in a grand canonical ensemble .	The effect of the correlations manifests itself in the form of an entropic force in addition to the external stress and the self-consistent internal stress .
4	In this work , we propose another method for deriving differentiable surrogate losses that provably meet this requirement .	Often , the performance on a supervised machine learning task is evaluated with a emph { task loss } function that can not be optimized directly .	Examples of such loss functions include the classification error , the edit distance and the BLEU score .	A common workaround for this problem is to instead optimize a emph { surrogate loss } function , such as for instance cross-entropy or hinge loss .	In order for this remedy to be effective , it is important to ensure that minimization of the surrogate loss results in minimization of the task loss , a condition that we call emph { consistency with the task loss } .
2	Specifically , we consider optical character recognition ( OCR ) systems that can be bootstrapped by identifying a subset of correctly translated document words with very high precision .	We consider models for which it is important , early in processing , to estimate some variables with high precision , but perhaps at relatively low rates of recall .	If some variables can be identified with near certainty , then they can be conditioned upon , allowing further inference to be done efficiently .	This `` clean set '' is subsequently used as document-specific training data .	While many current OCR systems produce measures of confidence for the identity of each letter or word , thresholding these confidence values , even at very high values , still produces some errors .
2	Based on the abundance ratios of 14 elements , we use the chemical tagging method to identify the stars which have the same chemical composition , and thus , might have a common birthplace , such as a cluster .	The origin of a new kinematically identified metal-poor stellar stream , the KFR08 stream , has not been established .	We present stellar parameters , stellar ages , and detailed elemental abundances for Na , Mg , Al , Si , Ca , Sc , Ti , Cr , Ni , Zn , Sr , Y , Zr , Ba , La , and Eu for 16 KFR08 stream members based on analysis of high resolution spectra .	Although three stars were tagged with similar elemental abundances ratios , we find that , statistically , it is not certain that they originate from a dissolved star cluster .	This conclusion is consistent with the large dispersion of [ Fe/H ] ( $ \sigma_ { \rm { [ Fe/H ] } } = 0.29 $ ) among the 16 stream members .
2	In the gauge theory dyonic region the spectral expansions are divergent , and indeed are not Borel-summable , so they are more properly described by resurgent trans-series in which perturbative and non-perturbative effects are deeply entwined .	The Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit for the low-energy behavior of N=2 and N=2* supersymmetric SU ( 2 ) gauge theories is encoded in the spectrum of the Mathieu and Lam'e equations , respectively .	This correspondence is usually expressed via an all-orders Bohr-Sommerfeld relation , but this neglects non-perturbative effects , the nature of which is very different in the electric , magnetic and dyonic regions .	In the gauge theory electric region the spectral expansions are convergent , but nevertheless there are non-perturbative effects due to poles in the expansion coefficients , and which we associate with worldline instantons .	This provides a concrete analog of a phenomenon found recently by Drukker , Marino and Putrov in the large N expansion of the ABJM matrix model , in which non-perturbative effects are related to complex space-time instantons .
2	Effective gauge theories for the moduli fields are constructed on the four-dimensional world volume of vortices .	Non-Abelian vortices in six spacetime dimensions are obtained for a supersymmetric U ( N ) gauge theory with N hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation .	Massless ( moduli ) fields are identified and classified into Nambu-Goldstone and quasi-Nambu-Goldstone fields .	A systematic method to obtain the most general form of the effective Lagrangian consistent with symmetry is proposed .	The moduli space for the multi-vortices is found to be a vector bundle over the complex Grassmann manifold .
3	Using anatomical images , high speed videography , theoretical analysis and a physical simulacrum we show that this fast oscillatory motion is the result of an elastohydrodynamic instability driven by the interplay between the elasticity of oral papillae and the fast unsteady flow during squirting .	The rapid squirt of a proteinaceous slime jet endows the ancient velvet worms ( Onychophora ) with a unique mechanism for defense from predators and for capturing prey by entangling them in a disordered web that immobilizes their target .	However , to date neither qualitative nor quantitative descriptions have been provided for this unique adaptation .	Here we investigate the fast oscillatory motion of the oral papillae and the exiting liquid jet that oscillates with frequencies $ f\sim 30-60 $ Hz .	Our results demonstrate how passive strategies can be cleverly harnessed by organisms , while suggesting future oscillating micro-fluidic devices as well as novel ways for micro and nano fiber production using bioinspired strategies .
2	This implies non-trivial identities for non-planar diagrams as well as interesting relations between the N = 4 and N = 8 theories .	We define recursion relations for N = 8 supergravity amplitudes using a generalization of the on-shell diagrams developed for planar N = 4 super-Yang-Mills .	Although the recursion relations generically give rise to non-planar on-shell diagrams , we show that at tree-level the recursion can be chosen to yield only planar diagrams , the same diagrams occurring in the planar N = 4 theory .	We show that the on-shell diagrams of N = 8 supergravity obey equivalence relations analogous to those of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills , and we develop a systematic algorithm for reading off Grassmannian integral formulae directly from the on-shell diagrams .	We also show that the 1-loop 4-point amplitude of N = 8 supergravity can be obtained from on-shell diagrams .
3	This allows us to introduce a quantity , the fractional occupation , which gives insightful information on the crossover from a Lifshits to a Bose glass .	We investigate the interplay between disorder and interactions in a Bose gas on a lattice in presence of randomly localized impurities .	We compare the performance of two theoretical methods , the simple version of multi-orbital Hartree-Fock and the common Gross-Pitaevskii approach , showing how the former gives a very good approximation to the ground state in the limit of weak interactions , where the superfluid fraction is small .	We further prove rigorously that for this class of disorder the fractal dimension of the ground state d* tends to the physical dimension in the thermodynamic limit .	Finally , we compare temperature and interaction effects , highlighting similarities and intrinsic differences .
0	The definition of the classical transition state theory ( TST ) as a t= 0+ limit of the flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that simultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical process .	However , the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum mechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime impossible .	For this reason , quantum TST ( QTST ) has been generally accepted as any kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit , and there has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the properties of TST can be defined .	Hele and Althorpe ( HA ) [ J. Chem.Phys .	138 , 084108 ( 2013 ) ] recently suggested that a true QTST can be defined as the exact t=0+ limit of a certain kind of quantum flux-side time correlation function and that it is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics ( RPMD ) TST .
2	Unlike task scheduling based on time or cost before , aiming at the special reliability requirements in cloud computing , we propose a non-cooperative game model for reliability-based task scheduling approach .	Cloud computing is a newly emerging distributed system which is evolved from Grid computing .	Task scheduling is the core research of cloud computing which studies how to allocate the tasks among the physical nodes , so that the tasks can get a balanced allocation or each task 's execution cost decreases to the minimum , or the overall system performance is optimal .	This model takes the steady-state availability that computing nodes provide as the target , takes the task slicing strategy of the schedulers as the game strategy , then finds the Nash equilibrium solution .	And also , we design a task scheduling algorithm based on this model .
2	Only DFT+U calculations with explicit exchange corrections produce a balanced picture of electronic , magnetic and structural observables in agreement with experiment .	In low-temperature anti-ferromagnetic LaMnO $ _ { 3 } $ , strong and localized electronic interactions among Mn 3d electrons prevent a satisfactory description from standard local density and generalized gradient approximations in density functional theory calculations .	Here we show that the strong on-site electronic interactions are described well only by using direct and exchange corrections to the intra-orbital Coulomb potential .	To understand the reason , a rewriting of the functional form of the +U corrections is presented that leads to a more physical and transparent understanding of the effect of these correction terms .	The approach highlights the importance of Hund 's coupling ( intra-orbital exchange ) in providing anisotropy across the occupation and energy eigenvalues of the Mn d states .
4	We shall show this by answering this 'Comment ' point by point .	After our publication of the observed first indication for neutrinoless double beta decay in [ KK-Evid01 ] , a number of papers have been published [ KK-Sar_Evid01 , KK2-Sar_Evid01 , KK3-Sar_Evid01 , Ma02-Ev , Barg02-Ev , Ueh02-Ev , Mi n-Evid02 , Chat-Evid02 , Xing-Evid02 , Ham-Evid02 , Ahl-Kirch-Evid02 , Ma-Evid2-02 , Hab-Su z02 , Mohap02-Evid , Kays02-Evid , Fodor02-Evid , Pakv02-Evid , Rodej02-Evid , Kowal02 , Niel s02 , He02-Evid , Josh02-Evid , Bran02-Evid , Cheng02-Evid , Smirn02-Evid , Wiss-Evid02 ] discussing its implications .	In addition a 'Comment ' has been put to the Internet February 7 , 2002 , [ Comm-Evid02 ] ( { \it version 1 } ) critisizing our publication [ KK-Evid01 ] .	( Meanwhile six of the nine claims in the 'Comment ' have been withdrawn [ Comm-Evid02 ] ( { \it version 3 } ) . )	It is the purpose of this note to show that none of their claims is justified ( the same is true , from the same arguments , for the criticism raised recently in [ Harn-Id02 ] ) .
0	The primordial abundances of light elements produced in the standard theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis ( BBN ) depend only on the cosmic ratio of baryons to photons , a quantity inferred from observations of the microwave background .	The predicted primordial 7Li abundance is four times that measured in the atmospheres of Galactic halo stars .	This discrepancy could be caused by modification of surface lithium abundances during the stars ' lifetimes or by physics beyond the Standard Model that affects early nucleosynthesis .	The lithium abundance of low-metallicity gas provides an alternative constraint on the primordial abundance and cosmic evolution of lithium that is not susceptible to the in situ modifications that may affect stellar atmospheres .	Here we report observations of interstellar 7Li in the low-metallicity gas of the Small Magellanic Cloud , a nearby galaxy with a quarter the Sun 's metallicity .
1	We combine the hyper-netted chain approximation with mode-coupling theory to study the dynamic phase diagram of soft repulsive spheres interacting with a Hertzian potential , focusing on low temperatures and large densities .	We use theory and simulations to investigate the existence of amorphous glassy states in ultrasoft colloids .	At constant temperature , we find that an amorphous glassy state is entered upon compression , as in colloidal hard spheres , but the glass unexpectedly melts when density increases further .	We attribute this re-entrant fluid-glass transition to particle softness , and correlate this behaviour to previously reported anomalies in soft systems , thus emphasizing its generality .	The predicted fluid-glass-fluid sequence is confirmed numerically .
3	For these models , numerical calculations show that if a voltage is applied between the plates which minimizes the force , a residual electrostatic force persists , and that the minimizing potential varies with distance .	We present calculations of contact potential surface patch effects that simplify previous treatments .	It is shown that , because of the linearity of Laplace 's equation , the presence of patch potentials does not affect an electrostatic calibration ( of force and/or distance ) of a two-plate Casimir measurement apparatus .	Using models that include long-range variations in the contact potential across the plate surfaces , a number of experimental observations can be reproduced and explained .	The residual force can be described by a fit to a simple two-parameter function involving the minimizing potential and its variation with distance .
3	Setting the false positive rate to $ \varepsilon/L $ and performing $ L $ queries , Bloom filters yield a solution to this problem with space $ O ( n \lg ( L/\varepsilon ) ) $ bits , false positive probability bounded by $ \varepsilon $ for intervals of length up to $ L $ , using query time $ O ( L \lg ( L/\varepsilon ) ) $ .	This paper studies the \emph { $ \varepsilon $ -approximate range emptiness } problem , where the task is to represent a set $ S $ of $ n $ points from $ \ { 0 , \ldots , U-1\ } $ and answer emptiness queries of the form `` $ [ a ; b ] \cap S \neq \emptyset $ ? ''	with a probability of \emph { false positives } allowed .	This generalizes the functionality of \emph { Bloom filters } from single point queries to any interval length $ L $ .	Our first contribution is to show that the space/error trade-off can not be improved asymptotically : Any data structure for answering approximate range emptiness queries on intervals of length up to $ L $ with false positive probability $ \varepsilon $ , must use space $ \Omega ( n \lg ( L/\varepsilon ) ) - O ( n ) $ bits .
4	The derived X-ray light curves show strong variability on all timescales .	We present observations of the High Mass X-ray Binary GX 301-2 taken during the Galactic Plane Scan ( GPS ) with Integral following our RXTE observations ( Kreykenbohm et al.2004 ) .	The optical companion of GX 301-2 is the B1Ia+ hypergiant Wray 977 with a luminosity of 1.3 x 10^6 Lsun and a mass of ~48 Msun making the system one of the most massive X-ray binaries known .	The system was observed 24 times during the GPS thus covering many orbital phases including the pre-periastron flare .	The source is clearly detected in all Integral instruments in most pointings .
1	There is paucity of results under stress control .	Much of the progress achieved in understanding plasticity and failure in amorphous solids had been achieved using experiments and simulations in which the materials were loaded using strain control .	Here we present a new method that was carefully geared to allow loading under stress control either at $ T=0 $ or at any other temperature , using Monte-Carlo techniques .	The method is applied to a model perfect crystalline solid , to a crystalline solid contaminated with topological defects , and to a generic glass .	The highest yield stress belongs to the crystal , the lowest to the crystal with a few defects , with the glass in between .
2	Our images confirm the presence of at least three highly collimated outflows emanating from the central regions of GL 618 .	We present narrow-band H-alpha , [ S II ] , and [ O I ] Hubble Space Telescope images of the young planetary nebula GL 618 .	This object is a compact , bipolar nebula that is currently undergoing the transition from asymptotic giant branch star to planetary nebula .	We also detect H-alpha emission close to the central dust lane and in an extended scattered light halo .	The three outflows are occurring simultaneously in this object , as opposed to being the result of a precessing jet .
2	In that frame , we consider up-to-date atmospheric models of the giant exoplanet where we implement non-thermal line broadening to simulate the impact on the transit absorption of superthermal atoms ( HI , OI , and CII ) populating the upper layers of the nebula .	Stellar irradiation and particles forcing strongly affect the immediate environment of extrasolar giant planets orbiting near their parent stars .	Here , we use far-ultraviolet emission spectra from HD209458 in the wavelength range ( 1180-1710 ) A to bring new insight to the composition and energetic processes in play in the gas nebula around the transiting planetary companion .	Our sensitivity study shows that for all existing models , a significant line broadening is required for OI and probably for CII lines in order to fit the observed transit absorptions .	In that frame , we show that OI and CII are preferentially heated compared to the background gas with effective temperatures as large as T_ { OI } /T_B~10 for OI and T_ { CII } /T_B~5 for CII .
3	This amounts to finding a Fuchsian differential equation satisfied by the local inverses of a Shabat polynomial .	We state and solve a discrete version of the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem .	In particular , we associate a Riemann-Hilbert problem to every dessin d'enfants .	We show how to compute the solution for a dessin that is a tree .	We produce a universal annihilating operator for the inverses of a generic polynomial .
2	The spectrum obtained is compared with the mode spectrum determined using spatially filtered second order correlation functions .	We show how two level atoms can be used to determine the local time dependent spectrum .	The method is applied to a one dimensional cavity .	The spectra obtained using two level atoms give identical results with the mode spectrum .	One benefit of the method is that only one time averages are needed .
2	Therefore , there is an urgent need for developing solid methods for accurately measuring moods from large-scale social media data .	Online social networks have become a major communication platform , where people share their thoughts and opinions about any topic real-time .	The short text updates people post in these network contain emotions and moods , which when measured collectively can unveil the public mood at population level and have exciting implications for businesses , governments , and societies .	In this paper , we propose PANAS-t , which measures sentiments from short text updates in Twitter based on a well-established psychometric scale , PANAS ( Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ) .	We test the efficacy of PANAS-t over 10 real notable events drawn from 1.8 billion tweets and demonstrate that it can efficiently capture the expected sentiments of a wide variety of issues spanning tragedies , technology releases , political debates , and healthcare .
1	To every representation $ \rho\colon \GL ( r ) \lra \GL ( V ) $ of the complex general linear group on the finite dimensional complex vector space $ V $ which satisfies the assumption that there be an integer $ \alpha $ with $ \rho ( z \id_ { \C^r } ) =z^\alpha \id_V $ for all $ z\in\C^* $ we associate the problem of classifying triples $ ( E , L , \phi ) $ where $ E $ is a vector bundle of rank $ r $ on $ X $ , $ L $ is a line bundle on $ X $ , and $ \phi\colon E_\rho\lra L $ is a non trivial homomorphism .	Let $ X $ be a smooth projective curve over the complex numbers .	Here , $ E_\rho $ is the vector bundle of rank $ \dim V $ associated to $ E $ via $ \rho $ .	If we take , for example , the standard representation of $ \GL ( r ) $ on $ \C^r $ we have to classify triples $ ( E , L , \phi ) $ consisting of $ E $ as before and a non-zero homomorphism $ \phi\colon E\lra L $ which includes the so-called Bradlow pairs .	For the representation of $ \GL ( r ) $ on $ S^2\C^3 $ we find the conic bundles of Gomez and Sols .
1	We begin with a single renormalon chain which is a well defined and systematic way to specify the character of corrections in inverse powers of the total energy to observables directly in Minkowski space .	In two lectures , we overview the renormalon and renormalon-related techniques and their phenomenological applications .	Renormalons demonstrate also presence of nonperturbative contributions .	We proceed then to multirenormalon chains and argue that they are in fact not suppressed compared to a single chain .	On one hand , this phenomenon might be a mechanism for enhancement of power corrections .
2	The former were described in our previous papers in detail , and here we present the latter .	Recently we calculated relativistic recoil corrections to the energy levels of the low lying states in muonic hydrogen induced by electron vacuum polarization effects .	The results were obtained by Breit-type and Grotch-type calculations .	The Grotch equation was originally developed for pure Coulomb systems and allowed to express the relativistic recoil correction in order $ ( Z\alpha ) ^4m^2/M $ in terms of the relativistic non-recoil contribution $ ( Z\alpha ) ^4m $ .	Certain attempts to adjust the method to electronic vacuum polarization took place in the past , however , the consideration was incomplete and the results were incorrect .
4	AIDA , the last project , aims at building a framework reproducing the experimental running conditions where sets of ladders could be tested .	The development of ultra-light pixelated ladders is motivated by the requirements of the ILD vertex detector at ILC .	This paper summarizes three projects related to system integration .	The PLUME project tackles the issue of assembling double-sided ladders .	The SERWIETE project deals with a more innovative concept and consists in making single-sided unsupported ladders embedded in an extra thin plastic enveloppe .
4	This scheme has strong conceptual connections with optical pumping , and can be extended to load high-fidelity patterns of atoms .	We propose a fault tolerant loading scheme to produce an array of fermions in an optical lattice of the high fidelity required for applications in quantum information processing and the modelling of strongly correlated systems .	A cold reservoir of Fermions plays a dual role as a source of atoms to be loaded into the lattice via a Raman process and as a heat bath for sympathetic cooling of lattice atoms .	Atoms are initially transferred into an excited motional state in each lattice site , and then decay to the motional ground state , creating particle-hole pairs in the reservoir .	Atoms transferred into the ground motional level are no longer coupled back to the reservoir , and doubly occupied sites in the motional ground state are prevented by Pauli blocking .
3	Subjects like the layout of the magnetic circuit , the excitation coils , and the cooling circuits will be discussed .	The intention of this course is to provide guidance and tools necessary to carry out an analytical design of a simple accelerator magnet .	Basic concepts and magnet types will be explained as well as important aspects which should be considered before starting the actual design phase .	The central part of this course is dedicated to describing how to develop a basic magnet design .	A short introduction to materials for the yoke and coil construction and a brief summary about cost estimates for magnets will complete this topic .
2	For our analysis , we have selected a Lyman continuum window around 907 A , and the five Lyman lines : Ly5 ( 937.8 A ) , Ly7 ( 926.2 A ) , Ly9 ( 920.9 A ) , Ly11 ( 918.1 A ) , and Ly15 ( 915.3 A ) .	We have analyzed a time series of spectra in the hydrogen Lyman lines and the Lyman continuum obtained by the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation ( SUMER ) spectrometer on the SOlar Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) .	The time series of about 2 hours and 22 minutes was obtained on 1999 March 9 in a quiet region near the center of the solar disk .	A Fast Fourier analysis has been performed in the spatial domain , all along the slit length used , for all the spectra and for the total duration of the observations .	We have detected a significant periodic spatial variations with Fourier transform power peaks around 9-10 arcsec and at 4 arcsec .
0	We present findings for DoAr 24E , a binary system that includes a classical infrared companion .	We observed the DoAr 24E system with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph ( IRS ) , with high-resolution , near-infrared spectroscopy of CO vibrational transitions , and with mid-infrared imaging .	The source of high extinction toward infrared companions has been an item of continuing interest .	Here we investigate the disk structure of DoAr 24E using the column densities , temperature , and velocity profiles of two CO absorption features seen toward DoAr 24Eb .	We model the SEDs found using T-ReCS imaging , and investigate the likely sources of extinction toward DoAr 24Eb .
1	However , most bouncing models contain a contracting phase from a very large and rarefied state , where dark energy might have had an important role as it has today in accelerating our large Universe .	Bouncing models have been proposed by many authors as a completion , or even as an alternative to inflation for the description of the very early and dense Universe .	In that case , its presence can modify the initial conditions and evolution of cosmological perturbations , changing the known results already obtained in the literature concerning their amplitude and spectrum .	In this paper , we assume the simplest and most appealing candidate for dark energy , the cosmological constant , and evaluate its influence on the evolution of cosmological perturbations during the contracting phase of a bouncing model , which also contains a scalar field with a potential allowing background solutions with pressure and energy density satisfying p = w*rho , w being a constant .	An initial adiabatic vacuum state can be set at the end of domination by the cosmological constant , and an almost scale invariant spectrum of perturbations is obtained for w~0 , which is the usual result for bouncing models .
3	Some simple models and examples are given when nonperturbative beta function and alpha_s ( Q ) can be written explicitly .	It is shown that analytic properties of standard QCD perturbation theory contradict known spectral properties , and contain in particular IR generated ghost poles and cuts .	As an outcome the rigorous background perturbation theory is developed and its analytic properties are shown to be in agreement with general requirements .	In a limiting case of large Nc , when QCD amplitudes contain only pole singularities , the strong coupling constant alpha_s ( Q ) is shown to be also meromorfic function of external momenta .	General form of amplitudes at large Nc is given in the framework of background perturbation theory and its correspondence with standard perturbation theory at large momenta is demonstrated in the example of e^+e^- annihilation .
4	The required precision alignment and calibration at the picometer level also appear to be feasible .	The gravitational acceleration of antimatter , $ \bar { g } $ , has never been directly measured and could bear importantly on our understanding of gravity , the possible existence of a fifth force , and the nature and early history of the universe .	Three avenues appear feasible for such a measurement : antihydrogen , positronium , and muonium .	The muonium measurement requires a novel monoenergetic , low-velocity , horizontal muonium beam directed at an atom interferometer .	The precision three-grating interferometer can be produced in silicon nitride or ultrananocrystalline diamond using state-of-the-art nanofabrication .
4	However , we find that foreground removal lowers the observed contrast between the HII region and the IGM .	We assess the impact of Galactic synchrotron foreground removal on the observation of high-redshift quasar HII regions in redshifted 21-cm emission .	We consider the case where a quasar is observed in an intergalactic medium ( IGM ) whose ionisation structure evolves slowly relative to the light crossing time of the HII region , as well as the case where the evolution is rapid .	The latter case is expected towards the end of the reionisation era where the highest redshift luminous quasars will be observed .	In the absence of foregrounds the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM could be measured directly from the contrast between the HII region and surrounding IGM .
2	Consequently perturbative and non-perturbative issues of the theory can be studied .	We review some recent work on AdS/CFT duality involving the 3d O ( N ) Vector Model and AdS4 Higher Spin Gravity .	Our construction is based on bi-local collective field theory which provides an off-shell formulation of Higher Spin Gravity with G = 1/N playing the role of a coupling constant .	For the correspondence based on free CFT 's we discuss the nature of bulk 1/N interactions through an S-matrix which is argued to be equal to 1 ( Coleman-Mandula theorem ) .	As a consequence in this class of theories nonlinearities are removable , through a nonlinear field transformation which we show at the exact level .
2	A later , longer observation found the source in a high-intensity state and covered the uneclipsed through mid-eclipse phases .	We report on two ASCA observations of the high-mass X-ray binary pulsar OAO 1657-415 .	A short observation near mid-eclipse caught the source in a low-intensity state , with a weak continuum and iron emission dominated by the 6.4-keV fluorescent line .	In the high-intensity state , the non-eclipse spectrum has an absorbed continuum component due to scattering by material near the pulsar and 80 per cent of the fluorescent iron emission comes from less than 19 lt-sec away from the pulsar .	We find a dust-scattered X-ray halo whose intensity decays through the eclipse .
0	This paper settles the optimality of sorting networks given in The Art of Computer Programming vol .	3 more than 40 years ago .	The book lists efficient sorting networks with n & lt ; = 16 inputs .	In this paper we give general combinatorial arguments showing that if a sorting network with a given depth exists then there exists one with a special form .	We then construct propositional formulas whose satisfiability is necessary for the existence of such a network .
0	We present `` Diagrams of States '' , a way to graphically represent and analyze how quantum information is elaborated during the execution of quantum circuits .	This introductory tutorial illustrates the basics , providing useful examples of quantum computations : elementary operations in single-qubit , two-qubit and three-qubit systems , immersions of gates on higher dimensional spaces , generation of single and multi-qubit states , procedures to synthesize unitary , controlled and diagonal matrices .	To perform the analysis of quantum processes , we directly derive diagrams of states from physical implementations of quantum circuits associated to the processes .	Complete diagrams are then rearranged into simplified diagrams , to visualize the overall effects of computations .	Conversely , diagrams of states help to conceive new quantum algorithms , by schematically describing desired manipulations of quantum information with intuitive diagrams and then by guessing the equivalent complete diagrams , from which the corresponding quantum circuit is obtained effortlessly .
1	In previously published experimental results , change of conductivity by 10 or more orders of magnitude occurred both in the absence of external influences ( spontaneously ) , and under the influence of an applied electric field , as well as other initiating factors ( such as uniaxial pressure ) .	A qualitative model describing the `` anomalous '' features of the conductivity of polymer nanocomposites , in particular , switching to the conducting state in relatively thick ( tens of microns or more ) of flexible PVC films is considered .	In a model of hopping conduction mechanism it is shown , that switching in the conduction states under the action of external field significantly ( by orders of magnitude ) below threshold can be associated with a high-resistance state instability that results from the sequence of `` shorting '' ( reversible soft breakdown ) of narrow insulating gaps between regions with relatively high conductivity .	Increasing the field strength in the remaining insulating gaps ultimately leads to the formation of a conducting channel between the external electrodes and switching conductivity of the composite film sample in a state of high conductivity .	This cascade model is essentially based on the transition from the usual description of the charge tunneling through single independent insulating gap to take into account correlations between adjacent gaps .
3	We show that the tunneling effect exists in a wide class of spacetimes admitting weakly isolated horizons .	The tunneling effect near a weakly isolated horizon ( WIH ) has been studied .	By applying the null geodesic method of Parikh and Wilczek and Hamilton-Jacibi method of Angheben et al .	to a weakly isolated horizon , we recover the semiclassical emission rate in the tunneling process .	The general thermodynamic nature of WIH is then confirmed .
2	This also applies for a stiff equation of state ( $ k=1 $ ) or for a massless scalar field .	We provide precise constraints on the size of any black holes forming in the early Universe for a variety of formation scenarios .	In particular , we prove that the size of the apparent horizon of a primordial black hole formed by causal processes in a flat Friedmann universe is considerably smaller than the cosmological apparent horizon size for an equation of state $ p=k\rho $ ( $ 1/3 & lt ; k & lt ; 1 $ ) .	The apparent horizon of a primordial black hole formed through hydrodynamical processes is also considerably smaller than the cosmological apparent horizon for $ 0 & lt ; k\le 1 $ .	We derive an expression for the maximum size which an overdense region can have without being a separate closed universe rather than part of our own .
0	We study the complexity of functions computable by deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations in terms of the symmetries and the number of linear regions that they have .	Deep networks are able to sequentially map portions of each layer 's input-space to the same output .	In this way , deep models compute functions that react equally to complicated patterns of different inputs .	The compositional structure of these functions enables them to re-use pieces of computation exponentially often in terms of the network 's depth .	This paper investigates the complexity of such compositional maps and contributes new theoretical results regarding the advantage of depth for neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions .
0	The bisection width of interconnection networks has always been important in parallel computing , since it bounds the amount of information that can be moved from one side of a network to another , i.e. , the bisection bandwidth .	Finding its exact value has proven to be challenging for some network families .	For instance , the problem of finding the exact bisection width of the multidimensional torus was posed by Leighton and has remained open for almost 20 years .	In this paper we provide the exact value of the bisection width of the torus , as well as of several d-dimensional classical parallel topologies that can be obtained by the application of the Cartesian product of graphs .	To do so , we first provide two general results that allow to obtain upper and lower bounds on the bisection width of a product graph as a function of some properties of its factor graphs .
4	Besides , we analyze the propagation of a quantum field in an EIT medium sustaining dark state polaritons ( DSP ) in a quasi-particle picture .	In this thesis , after a brief review of some concepts of Quantum Optics , we analyze a three-level atomic system in the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency ( EIT ) , and we investigate the propagation of a gaussian pulse along a cigar-shaped cloud of both cold and hot atoms in EIT regime .	In particular , we show that it is possible to amplify a slow propagating pulse without population inversion .	We also analyze the regime of anomalous light propagation showing that it is possible to observe superluminal energy propagation .	In these conditions , it is possible to imprint reversibly ( 'write ' ) the information carried by the photons onto the atoms , specifically as a coherent pattern of atomic spins , and later the information stored in the atomic spins can be transferred back ( 'read ' ) to the light field , implementing in this way a quantum memory .
2	The lack of a spectral evolution accompanying the X-ray light-curve breaks shows that these breaks do not arise from the passage of a spectral break ( e.g.the cooling frequency ) either .	The power-law decay of the X-ray emission of GRB afterglows 050319 , 050401 , 050607 , 050713A , 050802 and 050922C exhibits a steepening at about 1 -- 4 hours after the burst which , surprisingly , is not accompanied by a break in the optical emission .	If it is assumed that both the optical and X-ray afterglows arise from the same outflow then , in the framework of the standard forward shock model , the chromaticity of the X-ray light-curve breaks indicates that they do not arise solely from a mechanism related to the outflow dynamics ( e.g.energy injection ) or the angular distribution of the blast-wave kinetic energy ( structured outflows or jets ) .	Under these circumstances , the decoupling of the X-ray and optical decays requires that the microphysical parameters for the electron and magnetic energies in the forward shock evolve in time , whether the X-ray afterglow is synchrotron or inverse-Compton emission .	For a steady evolution of these parameters with the Lorentz factor of the forward shock and an X-ray light-curve break arising from cessation of energy injection into the blast-wave , the optical and X-ray properties of the above six Swift afterglows require a circumburst medium with a r^ { -2 } radial stratification , as expected for a massive star origin for long GRBs .
3	We use large $ p_T $ jet production in $ \gamma \gamma $ collisions from TRISTAN to constrain $ g^\gamma $ .	We present new improved parton distributions for the photon .	We fit { \bf all } available data on the photon structure function , $ F^ { \gamma } _ { 2 } ( x , Q^2 ) $ , with $ Q^2\ge 3 $ GeV $ ^2 $ , in order to determine the quark distributions .	We also pay particular attention to the gluon distribution in the photon , $ g^ { \gamma } ( x , Q^2 ) $ , which has been poorly constrained in earlier analyses which only include structure function data .	We also see what information can be gleaned from $ \gamma p $ collisions at HERA on $ g^ { \gamma } $ and on the quark distributions at large $ x $ , where there are no structure function data .
4	In this scenario , no evolution of the scaling relations is predicted for the cases ( b_M=0 , a_M=1 ) and ( b_L=7/2 , a_L=-1 ) , respectively .	We introduce a generalized scaling law , M_tot = 10^K A^a B^b , to look for the minimum scatter in reconstructing the total mass of hydrodynamically simulated X-ray galaxy clusters , given gas mass M_gas , luminosity L and temperature T. We find a locus in the plane of the logarithmic slopes $ a $ and $ b $ of the scaling relations where the scatter in mass is minimized .	This locus corresponds to b_M = -3/2 a_M +3/2 and b_L = -2 a_L +3/2 for A=M_gas and L , respectively , and B=T .	Along these axes , all the known scaling relations can be identified ( at different levels of scatter ) , plus a new one defined as M_tot ~ ( LT ) ^ ( 1/2 ) .	Simple formula to evaluate the expected evolution with redshift in the self-similar scenario are provided .
2	A separable ( Hartree ) $ n $ -partite state $ | \phi & gt ; $ can be described by $ | \phi & gt ; = \otimes_ { k=1 } ^n | \phi^ { ( k ) } & gt ; $ with $ | \phi^ { ( k ) } & gt ; \in \HH_k $ .	A general $ n $ -partite state $ | \Psi & gt ; $ of a composite quantum system can be regarded as an element in a Hilbert tensor product space $ \HH = \otimes_ { k=1 } ^n \HH_k $ , where the dimension of $ \HH_k $ is $ d_k $ for $ k = 1 , ... , n $ .	Without loss of generality we may assume that $ d_1 \le ... \le d_n $ .	We show that $ \sigma : = \min \ { & lt ; \Psi | \phi_\Psi & gt ; : | \Psi & gt ; \in \HH , . $ $ .	& lt ; \Psi | \Psi & gt ; = 1\ } $ is a positive number , where $ | \phi_\Psi & gt ; $ is the nearest separable state to $ | \Psi & gt ; $ .
1	All the baryonic states belonging to the octet and decuplet flavor representations are generated in the isospin-symmetric case .	We apply the three-flavor ( Polyakov- ) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to generate baryons as quark-diquark bound states using many-body techniques at finite temperature .	For each state we extract the melting temperature at which the baryon may decay into a quark-diquark pair .	We seek for an evidence of the strangeness dependence of the baryon melting temperature as suggested by the statistical thermal models and supported by lattice-QCD results .	A clear and robust signal for this claim is found , pointing to a flavor dependence of the hadronic deconfinement temperature .
3	A 2-dimensional hydrodynamical model is used to study the stability of mass transfer in wind accreting symbiotic binary systems .	We study the dynamical effects of gravitational focusing by a binary companion on winds from late-type stars .	In particular , we investigate the mass transfer and formation of accretion disks around the secondary in detached systems consisting of an AGB mass-losing star and an accreting companion .	The presence of mass outflows is studied as a function of mass loss rate , wind temperature and binary orbital parameters .	In our simulations we use an adiabatic equation of state and a modified version of the isothermal approximation , where the temperature depends on the distance from the mass losing star and its companion .
1	In the optical range of spectrum we will consider two cases : first , the source has not eigenfrequency , and second , the source has eigenfrequency .	The purpose of this paper is to investigate the radiation process of the charged particle passing through an external periodic field in a dispersive medium .	In the first case , when the Cherenkov radiation occurs , the non-zero eigenfrequency produces a paradox for Doppler effect .	It is shown that the absence of the eigenfrequency solves the paradox known in the literature .	The question whether the process is normal ( i.e.hard photons are being radiated under the small angles ) or anomalous depends on the law of the medium dispersion .
4	The molecular mass calibration ratio , $ X_ { \rm CO } = N { \rm ( H_2 ) } /W_ { \rm CO } $ , is found to be about ( 0.6 -- 1.0 ) $ \times $ 10 $ ^ { 20 } $ H $ _2 $ -molecule cm $ ^ { -2 } $ ( K km s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) $ ^ { -1 } $ among the three regions , suggesting a variation of $ X_ { \rm CO } $ in the vicinity of the solar system .	We report an analysis of the interstellar gamma-ray emission from nearby molecular clouds Chamaeleon , R Coronae Australis ( R CrA ) , and Cepheus and Polaris flare regions with the { \it Fermi } Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) .	They are among the nearest molecular cloud complexes , within $ \sim $ 300 pc from the solar system .	The gamma-ray emission produced by interactions of cosmic-rays ( CRs ) and interstellar gas in those molecular clouds is useful to study the CR densities and distributions of molecular gas close to the solar system .	The obtained gamma-ray emissivities from 250 MeV to 10 GeV for the three regions are about ( 6 -- 10 ) $ \times $ 10 $ ^ { -27 } $ photons s $ ^ { -1 } $ sr $ ^ { -1 } $ H-atom $ ^ { -1 } $ , indicating a variation of the CR density by $ \sim $ 20 % even if we consider the systematic uncertainties .
0	We consider a general discrete-time branching random walk on a countable set X .	We relate local , strong local and global survival with suitable inequalities involving the first-moment matrix M of the process .	In particular we prove that , while the local behavior is characterized by M , the global behavior can not be completely described in terms of properties involving M alone .	Moreover we show that locally surviving branching random walks can be approximated by sequences of spatially confined and stochastically dominated branching random walks which eventually survive locally if the ( possibly finite ) state space is large enough .	An analogous result can be achieved by approximating a branching random walk by a sequence of multitype contact processes and allowing a sufficiently large number of particles per site .
0	A closed hyperbolic 3-manifold is exceptional if its shortest geodesic does not have an embedded tube of radius $ \ln ( 3 ) /2 $ .	D. Gabai , R. Meyerhoff and N. Thurston identified seven families of exceptional manifolds in their proof of the homotopy rigidity theorem .	They identified the hyperbolic manifold known as Vol3 in the literature as the exceptional manifold associated to one of the families .	It is conjectured that there are exactly 6 exceptional manifolds .	We find hyperbolic 3-manifolds , some from the SnapPea 's census of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds , associated to 5 other families .
3	The observed ultraviolet+optical spectral characteristics of the hot component in these systems can be explained by a white dwarf+accretion disc embedded in an envelope of wind from the M giant secondary .	Spectroscopic and photometric behaviour of the class of recurrent novae with giant secondaries ( T Coronae Borealis , RS Ophiuchi , V3890 Sagittarii and V745 Scorpii ) at quiescence are presented in this study .	The hot component in these systems is variable , with the variability manifesting as variability in the ultraviolet luminosity , the ultraviolet and optical emission line fluxes and in the UBV/visual magnitudes .	The variations are uncorrelated with the binary orbital motion .	We suggest the observed variations are a result of ( a ) fluctuations in the mass accretion rate ; ( b ) changes in the column density of the absorbing , optically thick , wind envelope .
2	The groups of University of Kanazawa and Pisa have produced by Lattice simulations many results supporting the idea that QCD vacuum is a dual superconductor .	The purpose of this study is to investigate the relations between instantons , monopoles , and Chiral symmetry breaking .	The monopoles are important topological configurations existing in QCD which are believed to produce colour confinement .	Instantons are related to Chiral symmetry breaking , as explained e.g.in the instanton liquid model of E. V. SHURYAK .	Clarifying quantitatively the relation between monopoles and instantons is not easy , also because monopoles are three dimensional objects , while instantons are four dimensional .
0	With the help of smart metering valuable information of the appliance usage can be retrieved .	In detail , non-intrusive load monitoring ( NILM ) , also called load disaggregation , tries to identify appliances in the power draw of an household .	In this paper an unsupervised load disaggregation approach is proposed that works without a priori knowledge about appliances .	The proposed algorithm works autonomously in real time .	The number of used appliances and the corresponding appliance models are learned in operation and are progressively updated .
0	Taking into account results obtained from models and analyses , we determined the nature and structures of V1003 Her .	We analysed the light curves obtained in this study together with the available radial velocity curve .	The analysis revealed that the inclination ( i ) of the system was found to be 45.82 ( 2.71 ) , while the semi-major axis ( a ) was computed as 2.925 ( 0.143 ) Rsun .	The mass of the primary component was found to be 1.204 ( 0.004 ) Msun , while it was obtained as 0.450 ( 0.006 ) Msun for the secondary component .	The radius of the primary component was computed as 1.424 ( 0.001 ) Rsun , while it was computed as 0.904 ( 0.001 ) Rsun for the secondary component .
2	This paper compares two analytic techniques to derive the patten dynamics from hydrodynamics , which are usually equivalent but lead to different results when applied to multiple homogeneous soft modes .	Patterns forming spontaneously in extended , three-dimensional , dissipative systems are likely to excite several homogeneous soft modes ( $ \approx $ hydrodynamic modes ) of the underlying physical system , much more than quasi one- and two-dimensional patterns are .	The reason is the lack of damping boundaries .	Dielectric electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals is introduced as a model for three-dimensional pattern formation .	The 3D pattern dynamics including soft modes are derived .
4	Hence we extend downwards the range over which the D coefficient could be used to explore time-violation from new physics .	In this paper we explore the time-reversal-odd triple-correlation coefficient in neutron beta decay , the so-called `` D coefficient '' , using heavy-baryon effective field theory with photon degrees of freedom .	We find that this framework allows us to reproduce the known results for the contribution which comes from final-state interactions , and also to discuss higher-order corrections .	In particular we are able to show that in the heavy-baryon limit all electromagnetic contributions vanish .	By calculating the leading correction to the known result , we give a final expression which is accurate to better than 1 % .
3	On the other hand , NIST SP800-22 does not cover some of the important laws for randomness .	NIST SP800-22 ( 2010 ) proposes the state of art testing suite for ( pseudo ) random generators to detect deviations of a binary sequence from randomness .	On the one hand , as a counter example to NIST SP800-22 test suite , it is easy to construct functions that are considered as GOOD pseudorandom generators by NIST SP800-22 test suite though the output of these functions are easily distinguishable from the uniform distribution .	Thus these functions are not pseudorandom generators by definition .	Two fundamental limit theorems about random binary strings are the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm ( LIL ) .
2	The most intense of these flares was observed by XRT with a flux & gt ; 500 the afterglow .	Observations of gamma ray bursts ( GRBs ) with Swift produced the initially surprising result that many bursts have large X-ray flares superimposed on the underlying afterglow .	These flares were sometimes intense , rapid , and late relative to the nominal prompt phase .	This burst then surprised observers by flaring again after & gt ; 10000 s. The intense flare can be most easily understood within the context of the standard fireball model , if the internal engine that powers the prompt GRB emission is still active at late times .	Recent observations indicate that X-ray flares are detected in ~1/3 of XRT detected afterglows .
4	We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through an extensive simulation study and apply it to a music annotation data set ( CAL500 ) , obtaining a sparse and interpretable graphical model relating the continuous features of the audio signal to categorical variables such as genre , emotions , and usage associated with particular songs .	While graphical models for continuous data ( Gaussian graphical models ) and discrete data ( Ising models ) have been extensively studied , there is little work on graphical models linking both continuous and discrete variables ( mixed data ) , which are common in many scientific applications .	We propose a novel graphical model for mixed data , which is simple enough to be suitable for high-dimensional data , yet flexible enough to represent all possible graph structures .	We develop a computationally efficient regression-based algorithm for fitting the model by focusing on the conditional log-likelihood of each variable given the rest .	The parameters have a natural group structure , and sparsity in the fitted graph is attained by incorporating a group lasso penalty , approximated by a weighted $ \ell_1 $ penalty for computational efficiency .
2	To obtain the phase structure we evaluate the minimum of the effective potential at finite temperature and chemical potential .	We investigate color superconducting phase at high density in the extended Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio model for the two flavor quarks .	Because of the non-renormalizability of the model , physical observables may depend on the regularization procedure , that is why we apply two types of regularization , the cut-off and the dimensional one to evaluate the phase structure , the equation of state and the relationship between the mass and the radius of a dense star .	The stress tensor is calculated to derive the equation of state .	Solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation , we show the relationship between the mass and the radius of a dense star .
3	The width also increases with the flow-rate as the fluid rheology shifts from Newtonian at low shear rates $ \dot \gamma $ towards a shear thinning behaviour at higher $ \dot \gamma $ values .	Flow and transport are studied in transparent model fractures with rough complementary self-affine walls with a relative shear displacement $ \vec { u } $ .	The aperture field is shown to display long range correlations perpendicular to $ \vec { u } $ : for flow in that direction , the width and geometry of the front of a dyed shear-thinning polymer solution displacing a transparent one have been studied as a function of the fluid rheology and flow rate .	The front width increases linearly with distance indicating a convection of the fluids with a low transverse mixing between the flow paths .	The width also increases with the polymer concentration at high flow-rates .
0	If supersymmetry is broken independently in multiple sectors with different scales , a number of goldstinos will be generated .	One linear combination of these goldstinos is massless and eaten by the gravitino , while the orthogonal combinations acquire a tree level mass and become the physical states named goldstini ( G ' ) .	Compared to the gravitino , such goldstini could couple more strongly to the visible fields and lead to some exotic phenomenology .	In this note we first check the goldstini couplings in some GMSB models and find that the goldstini-photon-neutralino interaction may be very small while the goldstini-Z-neutralino and goldstini-Higgs-neutralino interactions may be sizable .	This can induce a new decay mode for the Higgs boson : h- & gt ; G'+\chi - & gt ; Z+2G ' .
3	Comparing to RSXS measurements from stripe-ordered LBCO , we show that the two-peak structure observed near the O K edge can be understood as arising from dynamic nesting within the canonical cuprate band structure .	We present a microscopic theory of resonant soft x-ray scattering ( RSXS ) that accounts for the delocalized character of valence electrons .	Unlike past approaches defined in terms of form factors for atoms or clusters , we develop a functional determinant method that allows us to treat realistic band structures .	This method builds upon earlier theoretical work in mesoscopic physics and accounts for both excitonic effects as well as the orthogonality catastrophe arising from interaction between the core hole and the valence band electrons .	Our results provide evidence for reasonably well-defined , high-energy quasiparticles
4	In both cases we obtain bounds which are singly-exponential ( improving the known doubly-exponential bounds ) and which exhibit the natural asymptotic growth with respect to the degrees of the equations involved .	We prove analogs of the Bezout and the Bernstein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii theorems for systems of algebraic differential conditions over differentially closed fields .	Namely , given a system of algebraic conditions on the first $ l $ derivatives of an $ n $ -tuple of functions , which admits finitely many solutions , we show that the number of solutions is bounded by an appropriate constant ( depending singly-exponentially on $ n $ and $ l $ ) times the volume of the Newton polytope of the set of conditions .	This improves a doubly-exponential estimate due to Hrushovski and Pillay .	We illustrate the application of our estimates in two diophantine contexts : to counting transcendental lattice points on algebraic subvarieties of semi-abelian varieties , following Hrushovski and Pillay ; and to counting the number of intersections between isogeny classes of elliptic curves and algebraic varieties , following Freitag and Scanlon .
2	Remarkably similar properties were previously reported for the cluster compounds of Mo4 .	We present the results of the magnetic and specific heat measurements on V4 tetrahedral-cluster compound GaV4S8 between 2 to 300K .	We find two transitions related to a structural change at 42K followed by ferromagnetic order at 12K on cooling .	These compounds show an extremely high density of low energy excitations in their electronic properties .	We explain this behavior in a cluster compound as due to the reduction of coulomb repulsion among electrons that occupy highly degenerate orbits of different clusters .
4	This dynamic problem has been tackled in a recent paper by Singitham et al .	Modern text retrieval systems often provide a similarity search utility , that allows the user to find efficiently a fixed number k of documents in the data set that are most similar to a given query ( here a query is either a simple sequence of keywords or the identifier of a full document found in previous searches that is considered of interest ) .	We consider the case of a textual database made of semi-structured documents .	Each field , in turns , is modelled with a specific vector space .	The problem is more complex when we also allow each such vector space to have an associated user-defined dynamic weight that influences its contribution to the overall dynamic aggregated and weighted similarity .
1	This challenge is hereby addressed by a distributed approach that optimally solves the fundamental resource allocation problem of joint client association and relaying .	In millimeterWave wireless networks the rapidly varying wireless channels demand fast and dynamic resource allocation mechanisms .	The problem is posed as a multi assignment optimization , for which a novel solution method is established by a series of transformations that lead to a tractable minimum cost flow problem .	The method allows to design distributed auction solution algorithms where the clients and relays act asynchronously .	The computational complexity of the new algorithms is much better than centralized general-purpose solvers .
0	We study zero-temperature Hubbard chains with periodically modulated hopping at arbitrary filling n and magnetization m. We show that the magnetization curves have plateaux at certain values of m which depend on the periodicity p and the filling .	At commensurate filling n a charge gap opens and then magnetization plateaux correspond to fully gapped situations .	However , plateaux also arise in the magnetization curves at fixed n between the commensurate values and then the plateau-value of of m depends continuously on n and can thus also become irrational .	In particular for the case of dimerized hopping ( p=2 ) and fixed doping we find that a plateau appears at m=1-n .	In this case , there is still a gapless mode on the plateau leading to thermodynamic behavior which is different from a completely gapped situation .
4	Furthermore , we try to derive the main results of special relativity , especially , ( e ) the mass-energy relation , ( f ) the Lorentz transformation by this one `` relativistic '' postulate and some `` nonrelativistic '' knowledge .	After analyzing the implication of investigations on the C , P and T transformations since 1956 , we propose that there is a basic symmetry in particle physics .	The combined space-time inversion is equivalent to particle-antiparticle transformation , denoted by $ { \cal PT=C } $ .	It is shown that the relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory do contain this invariance explicitly or implicitly .	In particular , ( a ) the appearance of negative energy or negative probability density in single particle theory -- corresponding to the fact of existence of antiparticle , ( b ) spin- statistics connection , ( c ) CPT theorem , ( d ) the Feynman propagator are linked together via this symmetry .
1	The additional terms introduced into the Hamiltonian involve products of spin components related to three adjacent sites .	We consider a spin-1/2 XY chain in a transverse ( z ) field with multi-site interactions .	A Jordan-Wigner transformation leads to a simple bilinear Fermi form for the resulting Hamiltonian and hence the spin model admits a rigorous analysis .	We point out the close relationships between several variants of the model which were discussed separately in previous studies .	The ground-state phases ( ferromagnet and two kinds of spin liquid ) of the model are reflected in the dynamic structure factors of the spin chains , which are the main focus in this study .
0	We present and interpret observations of two morphologically homologous flares that occurred in active region ( AR ) NOAA 10501 on 20 November 2003 .	Both flares displayed four homologous H-alpha ribbons and were both accompanied by coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) .	The central flare ribbons were located at the site of an emerging bipole in the center of the active region .	The negative polarity of this bipole fragmented in two main pieces , one rotating around the positive polarity by ~ 110 deg within 32 hours .	We model the coronal magnetic field and compute its topology , using as boundary condition the magnetogram closest in time to each flare .
2	A Jaffe & amp ; Perola ( JP ) model fitted to the integrated spectrum of the source gives an asymptotic low-frequency index of $ \alpha_ { inj } =0.53_ { -0.02 } ^ { +0.01 } $ , while JP models fitted to the observed spectral index trend along the lobes allow us to estimate radiative ages of $ \sim29 $ Myr and $ \sim37 $ Myr for the west and east lobes respectively .	We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ( GMRT ) 240 MHz observations of the nearby luminous FR I radio source 3C 270 , in the group-central elliptical NGC 4261 .	Combining these data with reprocessed Very Large Array ( VLA ) 1.55 and 4.8 GHz observations , we produce spectral index maps that reveal a constant spectral index along the jets and a gradual steepening from the ends of the jets through the lobes towards the nucleus .	Our age estimates are a factor of two lower than the 75-Myr upper limit derived from X-ray data ( O'Sullivan et al.2011 ) .	We find unlikely the scenario of an early supersonic phase in which the lobe expanded into the ISM at approximately Mach 6 ( 3500 km s $ ^ { -1 } $ ) , and suggest that either the source underwent multiple AGN outbursts with possible large changes in jet power , or possibly that the source age that we find is due to a backflow that transports young electrons from the jet tips through the lobes toward the nucleus relatively quickly .
4	The method is applied to neutron rich Oxygen and Carbon isotopes and compared with similar previous works and available experimental data .	The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer ( BCS ) formalism is extended by including the single-particle continuum in order to analyse the evolution of pairing in an isotopic chain from stability up to the drip line .	We propose a continuum discretized generalized BCS based on single-particle pseudostates ( PS ) .	These PS are generated from the diagonalization of the single-particle Hamiltonian within a Transformed Harmonic Oscillator ( THO ) basis .	The consistency of the results versus the size of the basis is studied .
1	The robot 's action choices are reinforced by social feedback from the human in the form of visual attention and measures of behavioral synchronization .	In this article , an enactive architecture is described that allows a humanoid robot to learn to compose simple actions into turn-taking behaviors while playing interaction games with a human partner .	We demonstrate that the system can acquire and switch between behaviors learned through interaction based on social feedback from the human partner .	The role of reinforcement based on a short term memory of the interaction is experimentally investigated .	Results indicate that feedback based only on the immediate state is insufficient to learn certain turn-taking behaviors .
1	We explore two complementary cases , which has no or has an internal ( built-in ) cancellation mechanism in amplitudes .	We study the implications of the experimental results on the \mu - & gt ; e\gamma decay rate and the muon anomalous magnetic moment , on muonic lepton flavor violating processes , such as \mu - & gt ; 3 e and \mu N - & gt ; e N. We use a model independent approach in this analysis , where these processes are considered to be loop induced by exchanging spin 1/2 and spin 0 particles .	Our main results are as following .	( a ) Bounds from rates are used to constrain parameters , such as coupling constants and masses .	These constraints can be easily updated by simple scalings , if the experimental situations change .
0	Within the t-J model , the mechanism of superconductivity in doped cuprates is studied based on the partial charge-spin separation fermion-spin theory .	It is shown that dressed holons interact occurring directly through the kinetic energy by exchanging dressed spinon excitations , leading to a net attractive force between dressed holons , then the electron Cooper pairs originating from the dressed holon pairing state are due to the charge-spin recombination , and their condensation reveals the superconducting ground-state .	The electron superconducting transition temperature is determined by the dressed holon pair transition temperature , and is proportional to the concentration of doped holes in the underdoped regime .	With the common form of the electron Cooper pair , we also show that there is a coexistence of the electron Cooper pair and antiferromagnetic short-range correlation , and hence the antiferromagnetic short-range fluctuation can persist into the superconducting state .	Our results are qualitatively consistent with experiments .
4	We also obtain some partial results for general compact subgroups of O ( n ) .	In this work we are concerned with the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian in regions of Rn which are invariant under the natural action of a compact subgroup G of O ( n ) .	We give a partial positive answer ( in the Neumann case ) to a conjecture of V. Arnold [ 1 ] on the transversality of the transformation given by the Dirichlet integral to the stratification in the space of quadratic forms according to the multiplicities of the eigenvalues .	We show , for some classes of subgroups of O ( n ) that , generically in the set of G-invariant , C2-regions , the action is irreducible in each eigenspace .	These classes include finite subgroups with irreducible representations of dimension not greater than 2 and , in the case n=2 , any compact subgroup of O ( 2 ) .
1	We identify shadow removal as a critical step for improving object detection and tracking .	This paper presents a survey and a comparative evaluation of recent techniques for moving cast shadow detection .	The survey covers methods published during the last decade , and places them in a feature-based taxonomy comprised of four categories : chromacity , physical , geometry and textures .	A selection of prominent methods across the categories is compared in terms of quantitative performance measures ( shadow detection and discrimination rates , colour desaturation ) as well as qualitative observations .	Furthermore , we propose the use of tracking performance as an unbiased approach for determining the practical usefulness of shadow detection methods .
3	Thus , a generalization of the main result of Zhuang , Chen et al .	We study the Drazin inverses of the sum and product of two elements in a ring .	For Drazin invertible elements $ a $ and $ b $ such that $ a^2b=aba $ and $ b^2a=bab $ , it is shown that $ ab $ is Drazin invertible and that $ a+b $ is Drazin invertible if and only if $ 1+a^Db $ is Drazin invertible .	Moreover , the formulae of $ ( ab ) ^D $ and $ ( a+b ) ^D $ are presented .	( Linear Multilinear Algebra 60 ( 2012 ) 903-910 ) is given .
2	We have developed a prototype toolset that can assist the systems analyst or software engineer to select and verify terms relevant to a project .	We describe our ongoing research that centres on the application of natural language processing ( NLP ) to software engineering and systems development activities .	In particular , this paper addresses the use of NLP in the requirements analysis and systems design processes .	In this paper we describe the processes employed by the system to extract and classify objects of interest from requirements documents .	These processes are illustrated using a small example .
4	The quantum dynamics simulations show coherent dynamics of Frenkel and CT states in 50 fs after the optical excitation .	Charge transfer states in organic semiconductors play crucial roles in processes such as singlet fission and exciton dissociation at donor/acceptor interfaces .	Recently , a time-resolved spectroscopy study of dinaphtho [ 2,3-b:2'3'-f ] thieno [ 3,2-b ] -thiophene ( DNTT ) thin films provided evidence for the formation of mixed Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons after the photoexcitation .	Here we investigate optical properties and excitation dynamics of the DNTT thin films by combining ab initio calculations and a stochastic Schrodinger equation .	Our theory predicts that the low-energy Frenkel exciton band consists of 8 to 47 % CT character .
1	Here we review basic symmetry properties of the relativistic quantum theories for free electrons in ( 2+1 ) - and ( 1+1 ) -dimensional spacetime .	The most fundamental characteristics of a physical system can often be deduced from its behaviour under discrete symmetry transformations such as time reversal , parity and chirality .	Additional flavour degrees of freedom are necessary to properly define symmetry operations in ( 2+1 ) dimensions and are generally present in physical realisations of such systems , e.g. , in single sheets of graphite .	We find that there exist two possibilities for defining any flavour-coupling discrete symmetry operation of the two-flavour ( 2+1 ) -dimensional Dirac theory .	Physical implications of this previously unnoticed duplicity are discussed .
1	We consider and analyze published procedures , both randomized and deterministic , for selecting elements from these families that have been shown to ensure the rate of convergence in $ L_2 $ norm of order $ O ( 1/N ) $ , where $ N $ is the number of elements .	In this work we discuss the problem of selecting suitable approximators from families of parameterized elementary functions that are known to be dense in a Hilbert space of functions .	We show that both randomized and deterministic procedures are successful if additional information about the families of functions to be approximated is provided .	In the absence of such additional information one may observe exponential growth of the number of terms needed to approximate the function and/or extreme sensitivity of the outcome of the approximation to parameters .	Implications of our analysis for applications of neural networks in modeling and control are illustrated with examples .
0	Trigonometric parallax determinations are presented for 28 late type dwarfs and brown dwarfs , including eight M dwarfs with spectral types between M7 and M9.5 , 17 L dwarfs with spectral types between L0 and L8 , and three T dwarfs .	Broadband photometry at CCD wavelengths ( VRIz ) and/or near-IR wavelengths ( JHK ) are presented for these objects and for 24 additional late-type dwarfs .	Supplemented with astrometry and photometry from the literature , including ten L and two T dwarfs with parallaxes established by association with bright , usually HIPPARCOS primaries , this material forms the basis for studying various color-color and color-absolute magnitude relations .	The I-J color is a good predictor of absolute magnitude for late-M and L dwarfs .	M_J becomes monotonically fainter with I-J color and with spectral type through late-L dwarfs , then brightens for early-T dwarfs .
1	Many brain diseases are associated with altered topological patterns of brain connectivity .	Emerging brain network studies suggest that interactions between various distributed neuronal populations may be characterized by an organized complex topological structure .	Therefore , a key inquiry of connectivity analysis is to identify network-level differentially expressed connections that have low false positive rates , sufficient statistical power , and high reproducibility .	In this paper , we propose a novel statistical approach to fulfill this goal by leveraging the topological structure of differentially expressed functional connections or edges in a graphical representation .	We propose a new algorithm to automatically detect the latent topology of a k-partite graph structure , and we also provide statistical inferential techniques to test the detected topology .
2	A \emph { skew partition } of $ G $ is a partition of $ V ( G ) $ into 4 sets $ A , B , C , D $ such that there is no edge between $ A , B $ and every possible edge between $ C , D $ .	A \emph { self-complementary } graph is a graph isomorphic to its complement .	An isomorphism between $ G $ and its complement , viewed as a permutation of $ V ( G ) $ , is then called an \emph { antimorphism } .	A \emph { symmetric partition } of $ G $ is a partition of $ V ( G ) $ into 4 sets $ A , B , C , D $ such that there is no edge between $ A , D $ , no edge between $ B , C $ , every possible edge between $ A , B $ and every possible edge between $ C , D $ .	We give a new proof of a theorem of Gibbs saying that every self-complementary graph on $ 4k $ vertices has $ k $ disjoint paths on 4 vertices as induced subgraph .
3	It is shown that many of the features observed in these experiments can be reproduced by this generalized model that explicitly includes non-Boussinesq and mean flow effects .	Motivated by recent experimental studies of Bodenschatz et al .	[ E. Bodenschatz , J.R. de Bruyn , G. Ahlers and D.S.Cannell , Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 67 } , 3078 ( 1991 ) ] , we present a numerical study of a generalized two dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation to model pattern formation in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a non-Boussinesq fluid .	The spontaneous formation of hexagons , rolls , and a rotating spiral pattern is studied , as well as the transitions and competition among them .
3	The aim of this paper is to illustrate that the same coupling can be exploited to derive an exact representation for second-order parameter sensitivity .	This paper deals with the problem of estimating second-order parameter sensitivities for stochastic reaction networks , where the reaction dynamics is modeled as a continuous time Markov chain over a discrete state space .	Estimation of such second-order sensitivities ( the Hessian ) is necessary for implementing the Newton-Raphson scheme for optimization over the parameter space .	To perform this estimation , Wolf and Anderson have proposed an efficient finite-difference method , that uses a coupling of perturbed processes to reduce the estimator variance .	Furthermore with this representation one can construct an unbiased estimator which is easy to implement .
0	The brightness of the Sun varies on all time scales on which it has been observed , and there is increasing evidence that it has an influence on climate .	The amplitudes of such variations depend on the wavelength and possibly on the time scale .	Although many aspects of this variability are well established , the exact magnitude of secular variations ( going beyond a solar cycle ) and the spectral dependence of variations are under discussion .	The main drivers of solar variability are thought to be magnetic features at the solar surface .	The climate reponse can be , on a global scale , largely accounted for by simple energetic considerations , but understanding the regional climate effects is more difficult .
4	We compare and analyze the results of the FLHA with the results of a full MRCI ( SD ) ( multi-reference configuration interaction with single and double excitations ) calculation for two prototype model systems , ( H2 ) n ladders and H- ( Be ) n-H chains .	The frozen local hole approximation ( FLHA ) is an adiabatic approximation which is aimed to simplify the correlation calculations of valence and conduction bands of solids and polymers .	Within this approximation correlated local hole states ( CLHSs ) are explicitely generated by correlating local Hartree-Fock ( HF ) hole states .	The hole orbital and its occupancy is kept frozen during these correlation calculations .	Effective Hamilton matrix elements are then evaluated with the above CLHSs ; diagonalization finally yields the desired correlation corrections for the cationic hole states .
1	The electronic states and magnetic properties of hexagonal , triangular and circular GQRs with different sizes and zigzag edge terminations are studied .	The effect of electron-electron interaction on the electronic structure of Aharonov-Bohm ( AB ) graphene quantum rings ( GQRs ) is explored theoretically using the single-band tight-binding Hamiltonian and the mean-field Hubbard model .	The results show that , although the AB oscillations in the all types of nanoring are affected by the interaction , the spin splitting in the AB oscillations strongly depends on the geometry and the size of graphene nanorings .	We found that the total spin of hexagonal and circular rings is zero and therefore , no spin splitting can be observed in the AB oscillations .	However , the non-zero magnetization of the triangular rings breaks the degeneracy between spin-up and spin-down electrons , which produces spin-polarized AB oscillations .
0	Recent Spitzer observations of the globular cluster M15 detected dust associated with its intracluster medium .	Surprisingly , these observations imply that the dust must be very short-lived compared to the time since the last Galactic plane crossing of the cluster.Here we propose a simple mechanism to explain this short lifetime .	We argue that the kinetic energy of the material ejected during a stellar collision may be sufficient to remove the gas and dust entirely from a cluster , or to remove the gas as a wind , in addition to partially destroying the dust .	By calculating the rate of stellar collisions using an N-body model for the cluster , we find remarkable agreement between the average time between collisions and the inferred dust lifetime in this cluster , suggesting a possible close relation between the two phenomena .	Furthermore , we also obtain the birthrate of blue stragglers formed through collisions in M15 .
3	Next we initiate a systematic search for more Fano visitors .	In arXiv:1503.00125 , the authors proved that every complete intersection smooth projective variety $ Y $ is a Fano visitor , i.e.its derived category $ D^b ( Y ) $ is equivalent to a full triangulated subcategory of the derived category $ D^b ( X ) $ of a smooth Fano variety $ X $ , called a Fano host of $ Y $ .	They also introduced the notion of Fano dimension of $ Y $ as the smallest dimension of a Fano host $ X $ and obtained an upper bound for the Fano dimension of each complete intersection variety .	In this paper , we provide a Hodge-theoretic criterion for the existence of a Fano host which enables us to determine the Fano dimensions precisely for many interesting examples , such as low genus curves , quintic Calabi-Yau 3-folds and general complete intersection Calabi-Yau varieties .	We generalize the methods of arXiv:1503.00125 to prove that smooth curves of genus at most 4 are all Fano visitors and general curves of genus at most 9 are Fano visitors .
0	We interpret the large variety of redshift distributions of galaxies found by far-infrared and ( sub- ) millimeter deep surveys depending on their depth and wavelength using the B\'ethermin et al .	( 2012 ) phenomenological model of galaxy evolution .	This model reproduces without any new parameter tuning the observed redshift distributions from 100 $ \mu $ m to 1.4 mm , and especially the increase of the median redshift with survey wavelength .	This median redshift varies also significantly with the depth of the surveys , and deeper surveys do necessarily not probe higher redshifts .	Paradoxically , at fixed wavelength and flux limit , the lensed sources are not always at higher redshift .
4	The method may be applied to single-field or mosaiced observations , and proper account can be taken of non-coplanar baselines .	A maximum-likelihood method is presented for estimating the power spectrum of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) from interferometer observations .	The method calculates flat band-power estimates in separate bins in l-space , together with confidence intervals on the power in each bin .	For multifrequency data , the power spectrum of the other foreground components may also be recovered .	Advantage is taken of several characteristic properties of interferometer data , which together allow the fast calculation of the likelihood function .
3	At this transition temperature , the calculated multiplicity distributions broaden and become strongly super-Poissonian .	A method is presented that allows exact calculations of fragment multiplicity distributions for a canonical ensemble of non-interacting clusters .	Fragmentation properties are shown to depend on only a few parameters .	Fragments are shown to be copiously produced above the transition temperature .	This behavior is compared to predictions from a percolation model .
2	One of its predictions was that velocity of light decreased with the age of Universe .	Recently there has been a lot of intersest in the superluminal phenomena , and time varying velocity of light cosmological models .	More than two decades ago at Einstein centenary symposium , Nagpur I had put forward space-time interaction hypothesis .	In view of the profoundness of the hypothesis the original paper is reproduced here .	We also mention that in a paper `` Quasars , Tachyons and the early universe '' proc .
4	In this paper we discuss a particular member of the family , the Wigner-Yanase information .	In the search of appropriate riemannian metrics on quantum state space the concept of statistical monotonicity , or contraction under coarse graining , has been proposed by Chentsov .	The metrics with this property have been classified by Petz .	All the elements of this family of geometries can be seen as quantum analogues of Fisher information .	Although there exists a number of general theorems sheding light on this subject , many natural questions , also stemming from applications , are still open .
4	In agreement with previous theory analyses , the numeric simulations show that the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model exhibits three phases as increasing correlation effects : the topological band insulating phase with stable helical edges , the bulk paramagnetic phase with unstable edges , and the bulk antiferromagnetic phase .	We prove that the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model with purely imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hoppings has a particle-hole symmetry at half-filling .	Such a symmetry has interesting consequences including the absence of charge and spin currents along open edges , and the absence of the sign problem in the determinant quantum Monte-Carlo simulations .	Consequentially , the interplay between band topology and strong correlations can be studied at high numeric precisions .	The process that the topological band insulator evolves into the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator as increasing interaction strength is studied by calculating both the bulk and edge electronic properties .
2	This report ( 1 ) provides an overview of the method that DeepField Networks is using to measure the utilization of various interconnection links between content providers and ISPs or links over which traffic between content and ISPs flow ; and ( 2 ) surveys the findings from five months of Internet utilization data provided by seven participating ISPs -- -Bright House Networks , Comcast , Cox , Mediacom , Midco , Suddenlink , and Time Warner Cable -- -whose access networks represent about 50 % of all U.S. broadband subscribers .	Recent Internet interconnection disputes have sparked an in- creased interest in developing methods for gathering and collecting data about utilization at interconnection points .	One mechanism , developed by DeepField Networks , allows Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to gather and aggregate utilization information using network flow statistics , standardized in the Internet Engineering Task Force as IPFIX .	The dataset includes about 97 % of the paid peering , settlement-free peering , and ISP-paid transit links of each of the participating ISPs .	Initial analysis of the data -- -which comprises more than 1,000 link groups , representing the diverse and substitutable available routes -- -suggests that many interconnects have significant spare capacity , that this spare capacity exists both across ISPs in each region and in aggregate for any individual ISP , and that the aggregate utilization across interconnects interconnects is roughly 50 % during peak periods .
2	To compute the losses , a 2D Finite Element Method was applied to solve the H-formulation of Maxwell 's equations considering the nonlinear properties of both the superconducting material and its surrounding Ni matrix .	Hysteretic losses in MgB2 wound superconducting coils of a 500 kW synchronous hybrid generator were estimated as part of the European project SUPRAPOWER led by the Spanish company Tecnalia Research and Innovation .	Particular interest was given to the losses found in tapes in the superconducting rotor caused by the magnetic flux ripples originating from the conventional stator during nominal operation .	To be able to model all the different turns composing the winding of the superconducting rotor coils , three geometrical models of single tape cross section of decreasing complexity were studied : 1 ) the first model reproduced closely the actual cross section obtained from micrographs , 2 ) the second model was obtained from the computed elastoplastic deformation of a round Ni wire , 3 ) the last model was based on a simplified elliptic cross section .	The last geometry allowed validating the modeling technique by comparing numerical losses with results from well-established analytical expressions .
3	In fact , Teo , Sethuraman and Tan \cite { TST01 } , show that there is a polynomial time algorithm to obtain , for a given strategy ( the set of all lists ) $ Q $ and a woman $ w $ , the best partner attainable by changing her list .	In this article we study the stable marriage game induced by the men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm .	Our setting is standard : all the lists are complete and the matching mechanism is the men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm .	It is well known that in this setting , men can not cheat , but women can .	However , what if the resulting matching is not stable with respect to $ Q $ ?
0	We calculate the scalar , axial , and pseudoscalar charges of the quark in the Schwinger-Dyson formalism of Landau gauge QCD .	It is found that the dressed quark scalar density of the valence quark is significantly enhanced against the bare quark contribution , and the result explains qualitatively the phenomenologically known value of the pion-nucleon sigma term and also that given by lattice QCD .	Moreover , we show that the Richardson 's interquark potential suppresses the quark scalar density in the Higashjima-Miransky approximation .	This fact suggests that the quark scalar density is an observable that is sensitive to quark confinement .	For the quark axial charge , we find that it is suppressed due to the gluon dynamics .
1	Here , we report the measurement of state-resolved inelastic scattering cross sections for collisions between two open-shell molecules that are both prepared in a single quantum state .	Whereas atom-molecule collisions have been studied with complete quantum state resolution , interactions between two state-selected molecules have proven much harder to probe .	Stark-decelerated OH radicals were scattered with hexapole-focused NO radicals in a crossed beam configuration .	Rotationally and spin-orbit inelastic scattering cross sections were measured on an absolute scale for collision energies between 70 and 300 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ .	These cross sections show fair agreement with quantum coupled-channels calculations using a set of coupled model potential energy surfaces based on ab initio calculations for the long-range non-adiabatic interactions and a simplistic short-range interaction .
0	We consider a process to create quasi long-range quantum discord between the non-interacting end spins of a quantum spin chain , with the end spins weakly coupled to the bulk of the chain .	The process is not only capable of creating long-range quantum correlation but the latter remains frozen , when certain weak end-couplings are adiabatically varied below certain thresholds .	We term this phenomenon as adiabatic freezing of quantum correlation .	We observe that the freezing is robust to moderate thermal fluctuations and is intrinsically related to the cooperative properties of the quantum spin chain .	In particular , we find that the energy gap of the system remains frozen for these adiabatic variations , and moreover , considering the end spins as probes , we show that the interval of freezing can detect the anisotropy transition in quantum XY spin chains .
1	Over 1.5 million targets have been searched for pulsations with amplitudes greater than 0.5 millimagnitude .	We present the results of a survey using the WASP archive to search for high frequency pulsations in F- , A- and B-type stars .	We identify over 350 stars which pulsate with periods less than 30 min .	Spectroscopic follow-up of selected targets has enabled us to confirm 10 new rapidly oscillating Ap stars , 13 pulsating Am stars and the fastest known $ \delta $ Scuti star .	We also observe stars which show pulsations in both the high-frequency domain and in the low-frequency $ \delta $ Scuti range .
4	We confirm this strong dependence on the opening angle for many other materials featuring a wide variety in their dielectric response .	We theoretically investigate the dependence of the enhancement of optical near-fields at nanometric tips on the shape , size , and material of the tip .	We confirm a strong dependence of the field enhancement factor on the radius of curvature .	In addition , we find a surprisingly strong increase of field enhancement with increasing opening angle of the nanotips .	For gold and tungsten nanotips in the experimentally relevant parameter range ( radius of curvature $ \geq 5\ , $ nm at $ 800\ , $ nm laser wavelength ) , we obtain field enhancement factors of up to $ { \sim } 35 $ for Au and $ { \sim } 12 $ for W for large opening angles .
2	$ W_i $ corresponds to a pure i-dimensional $ X_i $ , and $ W_ { ij } $ presents an i- dimensional irreducible component $ X_ { ij } $ .	An irreducible algebraic decomposition $ \cup_ { i=0 } ^ { d } X_i=\cup_ { i=0 } ^ { d } ( \cup_ { j=1 } ^ { d_i } X_ { ij } ) $ of an affine algebraic variety X can be represented as an union of finite disjoint sets $ \cup_ { i=0 } ^ { d } W_i=\cup_ { i=0 } ^ { d } ( \cup_ { j=1 } ^ { d_i } W_ { ij } ) $ called numerical irreducible decomposition ( cf .	[ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ) .	Modifying this concepts by using partially Gr\ '' obner bases , local dimension , and the `` Zero Sum Relation '' we present in this paper an implementation in SINGULAR to compute the numerical irreducible decomposition .	We will give some examples and timings , which show that the modified algorithms are more efficient if the number of variables is not too large .
0	The Casimir force between parallel lines in a theory describing condensed vortices in a plane is determined .	We make use of the relation between a Chern-Simons-Higgs model and its dualized version , which is expressed in terms of a dual gauge field and a vortex field .	The dual model can have a phase of condensed vortices and , in this phase , there is a mapping to a model of two non-interacting massive scalar fields from which the Casimir force can readily be obtained .	The choice of boundary conditions required for the mapped scalar fields and their association with those for the vectorial field and the issues involved are discussed .	We also briefly discuss the implications of our results for experiments related to the Casimir effect when vortices can be present .
3	Linearity permits an explicit representation of such set , that we call $ \mathcal { S } $ .	This paper is devoted to the study of the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set of the minimum time function $ T $ under controllability conditions which do not imply the Lipschitz continuity of $ T $ .	We consider first the case of normal linear control systems with constant coefficients in $ \mathbb { R } ^N $ .	We characterize points around which $ T $ is not Lipschitz as those which can be reached from the origin by an optimal trajectory ( of the reversed dynamics ) with vanishing minimized Hamiltonian .	Furthermore , we show that $ \mathcal { S } $ is $ \mathcal { H } ^ { N-1 } $ -rectifiable with positive $ \mathcal { H } ^ { N-1 } $ -measure .
1	Using a sample of 1630 optical spectra of 255 SNe , based primarily on data from the CfA Supernova Program , we examine how the velocity evolution and line strengths of Si II 6355 and Ca II H & amp ; K are related to the B-V color at peak brightness .	To understand how best to use observations of Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) to obtain precise and accurate distances , we investigate the relations between spectra of SNe Ia and their intrinsic colors .	We find that the maximum-light velocity of Si II 6355 and Ca II H & amp ; K and the maximum-light pseudo-equivalent width of Si II 6355 are correlated with intrinsic color , with intrinsic color having a linear relation with the Si II 6355 measurements .	Ca II H & amp ; K does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color , but lower-velocity SNe tend to be intrinsically bluer .	Combining the spectroscopic measurements does not improve intrinsic color inference .
3	2~mmag on any of the timescales previously reported in the literature .	We report a time-series analysis of the O4 I ( n ) fp star zeta Pup , based on optical photometry obtained with the SMEI instrument on the Coriolis satellite , 2003 -- 2006 .	A single astrophysical signal is found , with P = ( 1.780938 \pm 0.000093 ) d and a mean semi-amplitude of ( 6.9 \pm 0.3 ) mmag .	There is no evidence for persistent coherent signals with semi-amplitudes in excess of ca .	In particular , there is no evidence for a signature of the proposed rotation period , ca .
0	We consider a system of gravitating bodies in Kaluza-Klein models with toroidal compactification of extra dimensions .	To simulate the astrophysical objects ( e.g. , our Sun and pulsars ) with the energy density much greater than the pressure , we suppose that these bodies are pressureless in the external/our space .	At the same time , they may have nonzero parameters \omega_ { ( \bar\alpha -3 ) } \ , ( \bar\alpha =4 , ... , D ) of the equations of state in the extra dimensions .	We construct the Lagrange function of this many-body system for any value of \Sigma =\sum_ { \bar\alpha } \omega_ { ( \bar\alpha -3 ) } .	Moreover , the gravitational tests ( PPN parameters , perihelion/periastron advance ) require negligible deviation from the latent soliton value \Sigma =- ( D-3 ) /2 .
0	A deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum has been developed for the study of neutron halos in deformed nuclei and the halo phenomenon in deformed weakly bound nuclei is investigated .	Magnesium and neon isotopes are studied and some results are presented for the deformed neutron-rich and weakly bound nuclei 44Mg and 36Ne .	The core of the former nucleus is prolate , but the halo has a slightly oblate shape .	This indicates a decoupling of the halo orbitals from the deformation of the core .	The generic conditions for the existence of halos in deformed nuclei and for the occurrence of this decoupling effect are discussed .
4	Our method is to construct a representation of DPic_k ( A ) on a certain infinite quiver .	Let A be an algebra over a field k , and denote by D^b ( Mod A ) the bounded derived category of left A-modules .	The derived Picard group DPic_k ( A ) is the group of triangle auto-equivalences of D^b ( Mod A ) induced by tilting complexes .	We study the group DPic_k ( A ) when A = k \Delta is the path algebra of a finite quiver \Delta .	We obtain general results on the structure of DPic_k ( A ) , as well as explicit calculations for many cases , including all finite and tame representation types .
0	In this paper we return to the study of the Watson kernel for the Abel summabilty of Jacobi polynomial series .	These estimates have been studied for over more than 30 years .	The main innovations are in the techniques used to get the estimates that allow us to handle the case 0 & lt ; \alpha as well as -1 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; 0 , with essentially the same method ; using an integral superposition of Poisson type kernel and Muckenhoupt A_p-weight theory .	We consider a generalization of a theorem due to Zygmund in the context to Borel measures .	The proofs are therefore different from the ones given in previous papers by several authors .
4	The turbulent flow in porous media is accounted for by a modified eddy-viscosity based turbulence model .	A sensitive porosity adjoint method ( SPAM ) for optimizing the topology of fluid machines has been proposed .	A sensitivity function with respect to the porosity has been developed .	In the first step of the optimization process , porous media are introduced into the flow regime according to the sensitivity function .	Then the optimized porous media are transformed to solid walls .
3	It is shown that , due to the unsymmetrical nature of the problem , the Mode III skew-symmetric weight function derived in Piccolroaz et al .	We consider the perturbation problem of a Mode III interfacial crack .	The perturbation is of geometrical type and can be both perturbation of the crack faces and perturbation of the interface , which can deviate from the initial straight line configuration .	Asymptotic formulae are derived for the first-order perturbation of the stress intensity factor .	( 2009 ) is essential for the derivation of the correct asymptotic formulae .
0	In this paper we deal with the noteworthy Sylvester 's determinantal identity and some of its generalizations .	We report the formulae due to Yakovlev , to Gasca , Lopez -- Carmona , Ramirez , to Beckermann , Gasca , M\ '' uhlbach , and to Mulders in a unified formulation which allows to understand them better and to compare them .	Then , we propose a different generalization of Sylvester 's classical formula .	This new generalization expresses the determinant of a matrix in relation with the determinant of the bordered matrices obtained adding more than one row and one column to the original matrix .	Sylvester 's identity is recovered as a particular case .
0	Modified Newtonian Dynamics ( MOND ) has been shown to be able to fit spiral galaxy rotation curves as well as giving a theoretical foundation for empirically determined scaling relations , such as the Tully - Fisher law , without the need for a dark matter halo .	As a complementary analysis , one should investigate whether MOND can also reproduce the dynamics of early - type galaxies ( ETGs ) without dark matter .	As a first step , we here show that MOND can indeed fit the observed central velocity dispersion $ \sigma_0 $ of a large sample of ETGs assuming a simple MOND interpolating functions and constant anisotropy .	We also show that , under some assumptions on the luminosity dependence of the Sersic n parameter and the stellar M/L ratio , MOND predicts a fundamental plane for ETGs : a log - linear relation among the effective radius $ R_ { eff } $ , $ \sigma_0 $ and the mean effective intensity $ \langle I_e \rangle $ .	However , we predict a tilt between the observed and the MOND fundamental planes .
0	We demonstrate the generation of an optical dipole wave suitable for the process of efficiently coupling single quanta of light and matter in free space .	We employ a parabolic mirror for the conversion of a transverse beam mode to a focused dipole wave and show the required spatial and temporal shaping of the mode incident onto the mirror .	The results include a proof of principle correction of the parabolic mirror 's aberrations .	For the application of exciting an atom with a single photon pulse we demonstrate the creation of a suitable temporal pulse envelope .	We infer coupling strengths of 89 % and success probabilities of up to 87 % for the application of exciting a single atom for the current experimental parameters .
3	In Part II , I show how the theorem provides a new method for finding tight Bell inequalities .	Specification of the strongest possible Bell inequalities for arbitrarily complicated physical scenarios -- any number of observers choosing between any number of observables with any number of possible outcomes -- is currently an open problem .	Here I provide a new set of tools , which I refer to as `` multideviations '' , for finding and analyzing these inequalities for the fully general case .	In Part I , I introduce the multideviation framework and then use it to prove an important theorem : the Bell distributions can be generated from the set of joint distributions over all observables by deeming specific degrees of freedom unobservable .	I then specify a set of new tight Bell inequalities for arbitrary event spaces -- the `` even/odd '' inequalities -- which have a straightforward interpretation when expressed in terms of multideviations .
2	The main idea behind this technique is to decompose a schedule into its components ( i.e.the allocated shift pattern of each nurse ) , and then to implement two evolutionary elimination strategies mimicking natural selection and natural mutation process on these components respectively to iteratively deliver better schedules .	Nurse rostering is a complex scheduling problem that affects hospital personnel on a daily basis all over the world .	This paper presents a new component-based approach with evolutionary eliminations , for a nurse scheduling problem arising at a major UK hospital .	The worthiness of all components in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated in order for them to remain there .	This demonstration employs an evaluation function which evaluates how well each component contributes towards the final objective .
0	In this paper we continue our study on the Cauchy problem for the two-dimensional Novikov-Veselov ( NV ) equation , integrable via the inverse scattering transform for the two dimensional Schr\ '' odinger operator at a fixed energy parameter .	This work is concerned with the case of positive energy .	For the solution of the linearized equation we derive smoothing and Strichartz estimates by combining two different frequency regimes .	At non-low frequencies we also derive improved smoothing estimates with gain of almost one derivative .	We combine the linear estimates with the Fourier decomposition method and $ X^ { s , b } $ spaces to obtain local well-posedness of NV at positive energy in $ H^s $ , $ s & gt ; \frac12 $ .
0	We have used a combination of density functional theory ( DFT ) and kinetic Monte Carlo ( KMC ) simulations to calculate the reaction rates for the selective oxidation of ammonia on RuO2 ( 110 ) .	We find that the overall energy barrier for NH3 + O - & gt ; NH + H2O is 0.56 eV , while that for N + N - & gt ; N2 , and N + O - & gt ; NO to be 0.27 , and 0.14 eV , respectively .	Our KMC calculations enable us to examine the kinetics not only of these mainline processes but also of additional 15 reactions among several intermediate species that illuminate the reactivity and selectivity of the former .	In agreement with previous studies , we find that the key role in high reactivity of RuO2 ( 110 ) in ammonia decomposition is played by the way in which , by promoting easier H abstraction , H bonding between ammonia and its intermediates with the adsorbate and substrate O converts NH decomposition into a non-activated ( spontaneous ) process .	Further , our findings confirm in detail what experiment and previous studies have suggested about NO and N2 formation rates , namely , that NO desorption is a rate-limiting process in that surface NO blocks reaction sites at lower temperatures .
4	It can be described as a set of `` q=0 '' ordered kagome planes separated by zero interstitial moments .	The rare earth pyrochlore material Gd2Ti2O7 is considered to be an ideal model frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet with additional dipolar interactions .	For this system there are several untested theoretical predictions of the ground state ordering pattern .	Here we establish the magnetic structure of isotopically enriched ( 160 ) Gd2Ti2O7 , using powder neutron diffraction at a temperature of 50 mK .	The magnetic structure at this temperature is a partially ordered , non-collinear antiferromagnetic structure , with propagation vector k= 1/2 1/2 1/2 .
1	The model is based on a neo-Schumpeterian framework operating in a Darwinian evolutionary environment .	The following note contains a computer simulation concerning the struggle between two companies : the first one is `` the biggest zaibatsu of all '' , while the second one is `` small , fast , ruthless '' .	After running the program a large number of times , two characteristics stand out : -- There is always a winner which takes it all , while the loser disappears .	-- The key to success is the ability to employ efficiently the technological innovations .	The topic of the present paper is strictly related with the content of the following notes : Michele Tucci , Evolution and Gravitation : a Computer Simulation of a Non-Walrasian Equilibrium Model ; Michele Tucci , Oligopolistic Competition in an Evolutionary Environment : a Computer Simulation .
0	This paper presents three objective Bayesian methods for analyzing bilateral data under Dallal 's model and the saturated model .	Three parameters are of interest , namely , the risk difference , the risk ratio , and the odds ratio .	We derive Jeffreys ' prior and Bernardo 's reference prior associated with the three parameters that characterize Dallal 's model .	We derive the functional forms of the posterior distributions of the risk difference and the risk ratio and discuss how to sample from their posterior distributions .	We demonstrate the use of the proposed methodology with two real data examples .
3	In this work by alternately using the technique of integration within normal , antinormal , and Weyl ordering of operators we not only derive some new operator ordering identities , but also deduce some useful integration formulas regarding to Laguerre and Hermite polynomials .	Dirac 's ket-bra formalism is the `` language '' of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.In Refs .	( Fan et al , Ann.Phys .	321 ( 2006 ) 480 ; 323 ( 2008 ) 500 ) we have reviewed how to apply Newton-Leibniz integration rules to Dirac 's ket-bra projectors .	This opens a new route of deriving mathematical integration formulas by virtue of the quantum mechanical operator ordering technique .
3	Despite the different methods used , there is virtually no difference between the two measurements for l & lt ; 700 ; the highest l 's are still compatible within 1-sigma errors .	We measure the angular power spectrum of the WMAP first-year temperature anisotropy maps .	We use SpICE ( Spatially Inhomogeneous Correlation Estimator ) to estimate Cl 's for multipoles l=2-900 from all possible cross-correlation channels .	Except for the map-making stage , our measurements provide an independent analysis of that by Hinshaw etal ( 2003 ) .	We use a novel intra-bin variance method to constrain Cl errors in a model independent way .
1	The emission is found to be composed of a compact structure most certainly originating from the magnetosphere of an underlying pre-main sequence star , and a low-brightness extension which may result from reconnection flares at the star-disk interface .	In this Letter , we present a series of seven observations of the compact , non-thermal radio source associated with T Tauri South made with the Very Long Baseline Array over the course of one year .	The accuracy of the absolute astrometry offered by the VLBA allows very precise determinations of the trigonometric parallax and proper motion of T Tau South .	The proper motion derived from our VLBA observations agrees with that measured with the VLA over a similar period to better than 2 mas yr $ ^ { -1 } $ , and is fully consistent with the infrared proper motion of T Tau Sb , the pre-main sequence M star with which the radio source has traditionally been associated .	The parallax , $ \pi $ = 7.07 $ \pm $ 0.14 mas , corresponds to a distance of 141.5 $ ^ { +2.8 } _ { -2.7 } $ pc .
3	The new expansion , both for a finite size system in the large time limit and at finite time in the large size limit , converges to to the exact solution as obtained in a numerical implementation using the Gillespie algorithm .	The well known van Kampen system size expansion , while of rather general applicability , is shown to fail to reproduce some qualitative features of the time evolution for systems with an absorbing state , apart from a transient initial time interval .	We generalize the van Kampen ansatz by introducing a new prescription leading to non-Gaussian fluctuations around the absorbing state .	The two expansion predictions are explicitly compared for the infinite range voter model with speciation as a paradigmatic model with an absorbing state .	Furthermore , the predicted lifetime distribution is shown to have the correct asymptotic behavior .
2	We calculate a lepton version of the invariant $ I^l $ for Dirac and Majorana neutrino cases and find that $ I^l $ can also be close to unity .	By using quark Yukawa matrices only , we can construct renormalization invariants that are exact at the one-loop level in the standard model .	One of them $ I^q $ is accidentally consistent with unity , even though quark masses are strongly hierarchical .	For the Dirac neutrino and inverted hierarchy case , if the lightest neutrino mass is 3.0 meV to 8.8 meV , an equality $ I^q=I^l $ can be satisfied .	These invariants are not changed even if new particles couple to the standard model particles , as long as those couplings are generation independent .
3	Rare K ( B ) meson decays into pi ( K ) l^+ l^- ( l = e , mu ) and pi ( K ) nu anti-nu are found to already place tight constraints on the size of Z-Z_d mixing .	General consequences of mass mixing between the ordinary Z boson and a relatively light Z_d boson , the `` dark '' Z , arising from a U ( 1 ) _d gauge symmetry , associated with a hidden sector such as dark matter , are examined .	New effects beyond kinetic mixing are emphasized .	Z-Z_d mixing introduces a new source of low energy parity violation well explored by possible future atomic parity violation and planned polarized electron scattering experiments .	Those sensitivities can be further improved with future dedicated searches at K and B factories as well as binned studies of existing data .
1	Buckling means a deformation process in which a large strain beyond a threshold causes an abrupt change in the strain energy vs. deformation profile .	The nonlinear mechanical response of carbon nanotubes , referred to as their `` buckling '' behavior , is a major topic in the nanotube research community .	Thus far , much effort has been devoted to analysis of the buckling of nanotubes under various loading conditions : compression , bending , torsion , and their certain combinations .	Such extensive studies have been motivated by ( i ) the structural resilience of nanotubes against buckling and ( ii ) the substantial influence of buckling on their physical properties .	In this contribution , I review the dramatic progress in nanotube buckling research during the past few years .
3	We found it impossible to construct an internally consistent set of values until we realized that two robust -- and in places competing -- conceptions of computer security were influencing our thinking .	This paper focuses on a tension we discovered in the philosophical part of our multidisciplinary project on values in web-browser security .	Our project draws on the methods and perspectives of empirical social science , computer science , and philosophy to identify values embodied in existing web-browser security and also to prescribe changes to existing systems ( in particular , Mozilla ) so that values relevant to web-browser systems are better served than presently they are .	The tension , which we had not seen explicitly addressed in any other work on computer security , emerged when we set out to extract from the concept of security the set values that ought to guide the shape of web-browser security .	We needed to pry these apart and make a primary commitment to one .
2	A \emph { $ k $ -independent set } is a set of vertices whose induced subgraph has maximum degree at most $ k $ .	The \emph { regular independence number } , introduced by Albertson and Boutin in 1990 , is the maximum cardinality of an independent set of $ G $ in which all vertices have equal degree in $ G $ .	Recently , Caro , Hansberg and Pepper introduced the concept of regular $ k $ -independence number , which is a natural generalization of the regular independence number .	The \emph { regular $ k $ -independence number } of $ G $ , denoted by $ \alpha_ { k-reg } ( G ) $ , is defined as the maximum cardinality of a $ k $ -independent set of $ G $ in which all vertices have equal degree in $ G $ .	In this paper , the exact values of the regular $ k $ -independence numbers of some special graphs are obtained .
0	Chiral perturbation theory is the effective field theory of the strong interactions at low energies .	We will give a short introduction to chiral perturbation theory for mesons and will discuss , as an example , the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the pion .	These have recently been extracted from an experiment on radiative $ \pi^+ $ photoproduction from the proton ( $ \gamma p\to \gamma \pi^+ n $ ) at the Mainz Microtron MAMI .	Next we will turn to the one-baryon sector of chiral perturbation theory and will address the issue of a consistent power counting scheme .	As examples of the heavy-baryon framework we will comment on the extraction of the axial radius from pion electroproduction and will discuss the generalized polarizabilities of the proton .
3	In the intermediate-frequency regime , the SWNT conductivity is very low , and the spontaneous decay rate is practically unaffected by the SWNT .	The spontaneous decay of an excited state of an emitter placed in the vicinity of a metallic single-wall carbon nanotube ( SWNT ) was examined theoretically .	The emitter-SWNT coupling strongly depends on the position of the emitter relative to the SWNT , the length of the SWNT , the dipole transition frequency and the orientation of the emitter .	In the high-frequency regime , dips in the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate exist at the resonance frequencies in the spectrum of the SWNT conductivity .	In the low-frequency regime , the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate contains resonances at the antennas resonance frequencies for surface-wave propagation in the SWNT .
4	Additionally , strain induced bond length modifications create a fictitious gauge field but with a coupling that is smaller than seen in related materials like graphene .	We present a model of the electronic properties of the monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides based on a tight binding approach which includes the effects of strain and curvature of the crystal lattice .	Mechanical deformations of the lattice offer a powerful route for tuning the electronic structure of the transition-metal dichalcogenides , as changes to bond lengths lead directly to corrections in the electronic Hamiltonian while curvature of the crystal lattice mixes the orbital structure of the electronic Bloch bands .	We first present an effective low energy Hamiltonian describing the electronic properties near the K point in the Brillouin zone , then present the corrections to this Hamiltonian due to arbitrary mechanical deformations and curvature in a way which treats both effects on an equal footing .	This analysis finds that local area variations of the lattice allow for tuning of the band gap and effective masses , where the application of uniaxial strain decreases the magnitude of the direct band gap at the K point .
4	We insist on the fact that these results could not have been obtained before 1975 as the corresponding tools were not known before and are still not known today by physicists .	We start recalling with critical eyes the mathematical methods used in gauge theory and prove that they are not coherent with continuum mechanics , in particular the analytical mechanics of rigid bodies or hydrodynamics , though using the same group theoretical methods and despite the well known couplings existing between elasticity and electromagnetism ( piezzoelectricity , photoelasticity , streaming birefringence ) .	The purpose of this paper is to avoid such contradictions by using new mathematical methods coming from the formal theory of systems of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups .	These results finally allow to unify the previous independent tentatives done by the brothers E. and F. Cosserat in 1909 for elasticity or H. Weyl in 1918 for electromagnetism by using respectively the group of rigid motions of space or the conformal group of space-time .	Meanwhile we explain why the Poincar\ ' { e } `` duality scheme '' existing between `` geometry `` and `` physics '' has to do with homological algebra and algebraic analysis .
4	The main topics , notions used are reviewed in an attempt to have the paper self contained .	Maximal entangled states ( MES ) provide a basis to two d-dimensional particles Hilbert space , d=prime $ \ne 2 $ .	The MES forming this basis are product states in the collective , center of mass and relative , coordinates .	These states are associated ( underpinned ) with lines of finite geometry whose constituent points are associated with product states carrying Mutual Unbiased Bases ( MUB ) labels .	This representation is shown to be convenient for the study of the Mean King Problem and a variant thereof , termed Tracking the King which proves to be a novel quantum communication channel .
3	A straightforward fitting of the two parameters , which statistically characterize the population growth rate , predicts a distribution of language sizes in excellent agreement with empirical data .	It is argued that the present log-normal distribution of language sizes is , to a large extent , a consequence of demographic dynamics within the population of speakers of each language .	A two-parameter stochastic multiplicative process is proposed as a model for the population dynamics of individual languages , and applied over a period spanning the last ten centuries .	The model disregards language birth and death .	Numerical simulations , and the study of the size distribution within language families , validate the assumptions at the basis of the model .
3	It is shown that the material coefficients of the half-space which has a clamped boundary have only quantitative influence on the surface waves and that the existence and absence of the possibility for the surface waves to be guided by the interface is determined by the material coefficients of the half-space which has a free boundary .	It is shown that surface waves with twelve different velocities in the cases of different magneto-electrical boundary conditions can be guided by the interface of two magneto-electro-elastic half-spaces .	The plane boundary of one of the half-spaces is clamped while the plane boundary of the other one is free of stresses .	The twelve velocities of propagation of these surface waves and the corresponding existence conditions are obtained in explicit forms .	The number of the possible different surface wave velocities decreases from 12 to 2 when the magneto-electro-elastic materials are changed to piezoelectric materials .
0	Inflationary models predict a correlation between primordial density perturbations ( scalar metric perturbations ) and gravitational waves ( tensor metric perturbations ) in the form of a scalar-scalar-tensor three-point correlation , or bispectrum in Fourier space .	The squeezed limit of this bispectrum implies a quadrupolar asymmetry in the observed local power spectrum for matter and galaxies .	Here we show ( like others before ) that an infrared divergence in the amplitude of this power asymmetry predicted in single-field slow-roll models is canceled by projection effects when considering the observed power spectrum .	We then further evaluate the nonzero , but finite , residual quadrupolar power asymmetry that remains after the divergences are canceled .	While the quadrupolar power asymmetry is small , it is conceptually important .
0	The Goldstone mode in a helical magnetic phase , also known as the helimagnon , is a propagating mode with a highly anisotropic dispersion relation .	Here we study theoretically the helimagnon excitations in a complex chiral ground state of pyrochlore antiferromagnets such as spinel CdCr2O4 and itinerant magnet YMn2 .	We show that the effective theory of the soft modes in the helical state possesses a symmetry similar to that of smectic liquid crystals .	We compute the low-energy spin-wave spectrum based on a microscopic spin Hamiltonian and find a dispersion relation characteristic of the helimagnons .	By performing dynamics simulations with realistic model parameters , we also obtain an overall agreement between experiment and the numerical spin-wave spectrum .
4	These include `Fermi arcs ' with temperature-dependent length and an antinodal pseudogap which fills up linearly as the temperature increases towards the pseudogap temperature .	We describe here a minimal theory of tight binding electrons moving on the square planar Cu lattice of the hole-doped cuprates and mixed quantum mechanically with pairs of them ( Cooper pairs ) .	Superconductivity occurring at the transition temperature T_c is the long-range , d-wave symmetry phase coherence of these Cooper pairs .	Fluctuations necessarily associated with incipient long-range superconducting order have a generic large distance behaviour near T_c .	We calculate the spectral density of electrons coupled to such Cooper pair fluctuations and show that features observed in Angle Resolved Photo Emission Spectroscopy ( ARPES ) experiments on different cuprates above T_c as a function of doping and temperature emerge naturally in this description .
4	In this paper we show that the class of hereditary biclique-Helly graphs is formed precisely by those C_4-dominated graphs that contain no triangles and no induced cycles of length either 5 , or 6 .	A biclique is a set of vertices that induce a bipartite complete graph .	A graph G is biclique-Helly when its family of maximal bicliques satisfies the Helly property .	If every induced subgraph of G is also biclique-Helly , then G is hereditary biclique-Helly .	A graph is C_4-dominated when every cycle of length 4 contains a vertex that is dominated by the vertex of the cycle that is not adjacent to it .
2	The resulting criterion has several advantages , including the avoidance of certain technical difficulties relating to sets of measure zero .	This note contains some initial work on attempting to bring recent developments in the foundations of quantum mechanics concerning the nature of the wavefunction within the scope of more logical and structural methods .	A first step involves generalising and reformulating a criterion for the reality of the wavefunction proposed by Harrigan & amp ; Spekkens , which was central to the PBR theorem .	By considering the 'reality ' not of the wavefunction but of the observable properties of any ontological physical theory a novel characterisation of non-locality and contextuality is found .	Secondly , a careful analysis of preparation independence , one of the key assumptions of the PBR theorem , leads to an analogy with Bell locality , and thence to a proposal to weaken it to an assumption of `no-preparation-signalling ' in analogy with no-signalling .
3	Here , we report photonic crystals , based on the double-gyroid structures , exhibiting frequency-isolated Weyl points with intricate phase diagrams .	Weyl points and line nodes are three-dimensional linear point- and line-degeneracies between two bands .	In contrast to Dirac points , which are their two-dimensional analogues , Weyl points are stable in the momentum space and the associated surface states are predicted to be topologically non-trivial .	However , Weyl points are yet to be discovered in nature .	The surface states associated with the non-zero Chern numbers are demonstrated .
1	We will discuss the important difference between the applications of these concepts to stochastic systems and to a second class of systems ( chaotic systems ) where the fluctuations are induced either by chaotic flows or by fluctuating driving forces .	We introduce from an experimental point of view the main concepts of fluctuation theorems for work , heat and entropy production in out of equilibrium systems .	We will mainly analyze the stochastic systems using the measurements performed in two experiments : a ) a harmonic oscillator driven out of equilibrium by an external force b ) a colloidal particle trapped in a time dependent double well potential .	We will rapidly describe some consequences of fluctuation theorems and some useful applications to the analysis of experimental data .	As an example the case of a molecular motor will be analyzed in some details .
2	In this framework , the so-called Discontinuous Petrov -- Galerkin ( DPG ) concept can be viewed as a systematic strategy of contriving variational formulations which possess these desirable stability properties , see e. g. Broersen et al . [ 2015 ] .	In the numerical solution of partial differential equations ( PDEs ) , a central question is the one of building variational formulations that are inf-sup stable not only at the infinite-dimensional level , but also at the finite-dimensional one .	This guarantees that residuals can be used to tightly bound errors from below and above and is crucial for a posteriori error control and the development of adaptive strategies .	In this paper , we present a C++ library , Dune-DPG , which serves to implement and solve such variational formulations .	The library is built upon the multipurpose finite element package Dune ( see Blatt et al . [ 2016 ] ) .
1	As shown by recent studies , the shock-heating associated with the formation of large-scale structures heats the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) and leads to a `` warm IGM '' component for the gas .	We point out that two problems of observational cosmology , the facts i ) that & gt ; 60 % of the baryonic content of the universe is not observed at z=0 and ii ) that the properties of small clusters do not agree with simple expectations , could be closely related .	In the same spirit , we suggest the intracluster medium ( ICM ) to be a mixture of galaxy-recycled , metal enriched gas and intergalactic gas , shock-heated by the collapsing much larger scales .	This could be obtained through two processes : 1 ) the late infalling gas from the external warm IGM is efficiently mixed within the halo and brings some additional entropy , or 2 ) the shocks generated by larger non-linear scales are also present within clusters and can heat the ICM .	We show that if assumption ( 1 ) holds , the entropy brought by the warm IGM is sufficient to explain the observed properties of clusters , in particular the entropy floor and the LX-T relation .
1	These consist of concentric nested solenoidal coils with elliptical turns tilted at a certain angle to the central axis and current flowing in opposite directions in the coils tilted at opposite angles , generating a perfectly uniform transverse field .	The mathematical foundation is laid for a relatively new type of magnets generating uniform transverse field - tilted coil magnets .	Both superconducting wire-wound and resistive Bitter tilted coils are discussed .	An original analytical method is used to prove that the wire-wound tilted coils have the ideal distribution of the axial linear current density - `` cosine-theta '' .	Magnetic fields are calculated for a tilted Bitter coil magnet using an original exact solution for current density in an elliptical Bitter disk .
1	We investigate the stationary state properties of this model conditioned on finding a given particle number in the system .	We analytically study the one-dimensional Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process ( ASEP ) with open boundaries under sublattice-parallel updating scheme .	Recent numerical investigations have shown that the model possesses three different phases in this case .	Using a matrix product method we calculate both exact canonical partition function and also density profiles of the particles in each phase .	Application of the Yang-Lee theory reveals that the model undergoes two second-order phase transitions at critical points .
4	We rule out the presence of either brown or white dwarf .	We constrain the binary parameters of the eclipsing accreting X-ray binary IGR J17451 -- 3022 and the nature of its donor star .	The donor mass , its radius , and the system inclination angle are computed based on the system orbital period and eclipse duration recently reported by Bozzo et al . ( 2016 ) .	We find that the donor is most likely a main-sequence star with the mass comprised within the range about 0.6 -- 0.8 solar masses and the radius of about 0.7 solar radii .	Assuming that the accreting compact object in IGR J17451 -- 3022 is a neutron star , the duration of the nearly total rectangular eclipses yields the inclination angle of the system of 71 deg & lt ; i & lt ; 75deg , compatible with the presence of dips in this system .
1	For some sources , they follow the `original ' type of correlation which is described by a single power-law .	Two types of correlations between the radio and X-ray luminosities ( $ L_R $ and $ L_X $ ) have been found in black hole X-ray binaries .	Later it was found that some other sources follow a different correlation consisting of three power-law branches , with each branch having different power-law indexes .	In this work , we explain these two types of correlation under the coupled accretion -- jet model .	We attribute the difference between these two types of sources to the different value of viscosity parameter $ \alpha $ .
1	A simple , non-chiral , renormalizable model is presented to illustrate this mechanism .	Supersymmetry breaking by the quantum deformation of a classical moduli space is considered .	The well known , chiral , $ SU ( 3 ) \times SU ( 2 ) $ model and its generalizations are shown to break supersymmetry by this mechanism in the limit $ \Lambda_2 \gg \Lambda_3 $ .	Other supersymmetry breaking models , with classical flat directions that are only lifted quantum mechanically , are presented .	Finally , by integrating in vector matter , the strongly coupled region of chiral models with a dynamically generated superpotential is shown to be continuously connected to a weakly coupled description in terms of confined degrees of freedom , with supersymmetry broken at tree level .
3	Optimal Kato constants for elliptic operators were computed by Calderbank , Gauduchon and Herzlich .	We give a representation theoretical proof of Branson 's classification of minimal elliptic sums of generalized gradients .	The original proof uses tools of harmonic analysis , which as powerful as they are , seem to be specific for the structure groups SO ( n ) and Spin ( n ) .	The different approach we propose is based on the relationship between ellipticity and optimal Kato constants and on the representation theory of so ( n ) .	We extend their method to all generalized gradients ( not necessarily elliptic ) and recover Branson 's result , up to one special case .
1	These routes to strange nonchaos are characterised through the behavior of the largest nontrivial Lyapunov exponent , as well as through the characteristic distributions of finite time Lyapunov exponents .	Different mechanisms for the creation of strange non-chaotic dynamics in the quasiperiodically forced logistic map are studied .	Strange nonchaotic attractors can be created at a saddle-node bifurcation when the dynamics shows Type-I intermittency ; this intermittent transition , which is studied in detail , is characterised through scaling exponents .	Band-merging crises through which dynamics remains nonchaotic are also studied , and correspondence is made with analogous behavior in the unforced logistic map .	Robustness of these phenomena with respect to additive noise is investigated .
1	White dwarf stars are the final evolutionary stage of the vast majority of stars , including our Sun .	Abridged .	The study of white dwarfs has potential applications to different fields of astrophysics .	In particular , they can be used as independent reliable cosmic clocks , and can also provide valuable information about the fundamental parameters of a wide variety of stellar populations , like our Galaxy and open and globular clusters .	In addition , the high densities and temperatures characterizing white dwarfs allow to use these stars as cosmic laboratories for studying physical processes under extreme conditions that can not be achieved in terrestrial laboratories .
4	Finally , SVD is applied to each quadrant .	This paper presents a hybrid digital image watermarking based on Discrete Wavelet Transform ( DWT ) , Discrete Cosine Transform ( DCT ) and Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) in a zigzag order .	From DWT we choose the high band to embed the watermark that facilities to add more information , gives more invisibility and robustness against some attacks .	Such as geometric attack .	Zigzag method is applied to map DCT coefficients into four quadrants that represent low , mid and high bands .
0	Dark matter particles form halos that contribute the major part of the mass of galaxy clusters .	The formation of these cosmological structures have been investigated both observationally and in numerical simulations , which have confirmed the existence of a universal mass profile .	However , the dynamic behaviour of dark matter in halos is not as well understood .	We have used observations of 16 equilibrated galaxy clusters to show that the random velocities of dark matter particles are larger on average along the radial direction than along the tangential , and that the magnitude of this velocity anisotropy is radially varying .	Our measurement implies that the collective behaviour of dark matter particles is fundamentally different from that of normal particles and the radial variation of the anisotropy velocity agrees with the predictions of numerical simulation .
4	Large data samples are needed to study the initial state configuration choice and to extract nucleation times to good precision .	We study the rate of true vacuum bubble nucleation numerically for a phi^4 field system coupled to a source of thermal noise .	We compare in detail the cases of additive and multiplicative noise .	We pay special attention to the choice of initial field configuration , showing the advantages of a version of the quenching technique .	We advocate a new method of extracting the nucleation time scale that employs the full distribution of nucleation times .
2	We utilize elements of the Glazek and Wilson regularization method but now introduce a continuous cut-off procedure which eliminates non-local counterterms .	Extending previous QCD Hamiltonian studies , we present a new renormalization procedure which generates an effective Hamiltonian for the gluon sector .	The formulation is in the Coulomb gauge where the QCD Hamiltonian is renormalizable and the Gribov problem can be resolved .	The effective Hamiltonian is then derived to second order in the strong coupling constant .	The resulting renormalized Hamiltonian provides a realistic starting point for approximate many-body calculations of hadronic properties for systems with explicit gluon degrees of freedom .
1	Previous Bayesian treatments of this problem define a prior over the number of hidden causes and use algorithms such as reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to move between solutions .	We present a non-parametric Bayesian approach to structure learning with hidden causes .	In contrast , we assume that the number of hidden causes is unbounded , but only a finite number influence observable variables .	This makes it possible to use a Gibbs sampler to approximate the distribution over causal structures .	We evaluate the performance of both approaches in discovering hidden causes in simulated data , and use our non-parametric approach to discover hidden causes in a real medical dataset .
1	The objective of this work is to suggest and validate an approach to estimating the K ratio at any soil clay content through characteristics of soil texture and structure .	A recently introduced parameter , the ratio of an aggregate solid mass to a solid mass of an intraaggregate matrix ( K ratio ) is connected with the mean thickness of a deformable , but non-shrinking surface layer of aggregates and is a fundamental property of aggregated soils that essentially influences their shrinkage .	We derive an equation that reflects the interrelation between the K ratio and soil texture and structure .	The K ratio can be estimated as the solution of the equation and is determined by the mean size of soil solids and the maximum size of soil aggregates in the oven-dried state , independently of a measured shrinkage curve .	To validate the approach we use available data for eight soils .
4	To take benefits from the abundance of unlabeled patterns , we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression in this paper , namely Transductive Ordinal Regression ( TOR ) .	Ordinal regression is commonly formulated as a multi-class problem with ordinal constraints .	The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for ordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved , due to the large number of labeled patterns that are needed .	The availability of ordinal class labels , however , is often costly to calibrate or difficult to obtain .	Unlabeled patterns , on the other hand , often exist in much greater abundance and are freely available .
1	With an additional assumptions , we prove that the special values of partial zeta function at $ s=0 $ behaves as quasi-polynomial .	We compute the special values of partial zeta function at $ s=0 $ for family of real quadratic fields $ K_n $ and ray class ideals $ \fb_n $ such that $ \fb_n^ { -1 } = [ 1 , \delta ( n ) ] $ where the continued fraction expansion of $ \delta ( n ) $ is purely periodic and each terms are polynomial in $ n $ of bounded degree $ d $ .	We apply this to obtain that the special values the Hecke 's $ L $ -functions at $ s=0 $ for a family of for a Dirichlet character $ \chi $ behave as quasi-polynomial as well .	We compute out explicitly the coefficients of the quasi-polynomials .	Two examples satisfying the condition are presented and for these families the special values of the partial zeta functions at $ s=0 $ .
0	We show that the Davenport-Stothers inequality from characteristic 0 fails in any characteristic p & gt ; 3 .	The proof uses elliptic surfaces over the projective line and inseparable base change .	We then present adjusted inequalities .	These follow from results of Pesenti-Szpiro .	For characteristic 2 and 3 , we achieve a similar result in terms of the maximal singular fibres of elliptic surfaces over the projective line .
4	In this paper we study orders which are more than one time monogenic .	Let O be an order in an algebraic number field K , i.e. , a ring with quotient field K which is contained in the ring of integers of K. The order O is called monogenic , if it is of the shape Z [ w ] , i.e. , generated over the rational integers by one element .	By a result of Gy\H { o } ry ( 1976 ) , the set of w with Z [ w ] =O is a union of finitely many equivalence classes , where two elements v , w of O are called equivalent if v+w or v-w is a rational integer .	An order O is called k times monogenic if there are at least k different equivalence classes of w with Z [ w ] =O , and precisely k times monogenic if there are precisely k such equivalence classes .	It is known that every quadratic order is precisely one time monogenic , while in number fields of degree larger than 2 , there may be non-monogenic orders .
0	Recently , a large number of protocols for bidirectional controlled state teleportation ( BCST ) have been proposed using $ n $ -qubit entangled states ( $ n\in\ { 5,6,7\ } $ ) as quantum channel .	Here , we propose a general method of selecting multi-qubit $ ( n & gt ; 4 ) $ quantum channels suitable for BCST and show that all the channels used in the existing protocols of BCST can be obtained using the proposed method .	Further , it is shown that the quantum channels used in the existing protocols of BCST forms only a negligibly small subset of the set of all the quantum channels that can be constructed using the proposed method to implement BCST .	It is also noted that all these quantum channels are also suitable for controlled bidirectional remote state preparation ( CBRSP ) .	Following the same logic , methods for selecting quantum channels for other controlled quantum communication tasks , such as controlled bidirectional joint remote state preparation ( CJBRSP ) and controlled quantum dialogue , are also provided .
4	The analysis reveals that always the resultant ground force is harmonic .	We present an instructive way to introduce the subject of resonance using a typical spring-mass system without damping .	In contrast to the standard approach found in most textbooks , here we propose a way to extend the lectures from common translational systems to rotating ones .	In the latter case , particular attention is paid to the role of the variable centripetal force .	The students will find analytical solutions of the simplest possible ordinary differential equations of motion and see that the natural frequency strongly depends on the rotation speed , the latter being a simple vector sum .
1	In the charged Lifshitz background with the dynamical exponent $ z=2 $ , we find that the dispersion relation is linear .	We investigate the properties of holographic fermions in charged Lifshitz black holes at finite temperature through the AdS/CFT correspondence .	The scaling behavior of the imaginal part of the Green function relative to $ k_ { \perp } =k-k_F $ is also discussed .	We find , although the system has linear dispersion relation and quadratic quasi-particle width , it does not satisfy Luttinger 's theorem .	We also find that the variation of the scaling parameters $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ is small as the charge $ q $ varies .
0	We analyze the parameter space of the ( mu & gt ; 0 , A_0 = 0 ) CMSSM at large tan beta with a small degree of non-universality originating from D-terms and Higgs-sfermion splitting inspired by SO ( 10 ) GUT models .	The effects of such non-universalities on the sparticle spectrum and observables such as ( g-2 ) _mu , B ( b - & gt ; X_s gamma ) , the SUSY threshold corrections to the bottom mass and Omega_CDM h^2 are examined in detail and the consequences for the allowed parameter space of the model are investigated .	We find that even small deviations to universality can result in large qualitative differences compared to the universal case ; for certain values of the parameters , we find , even at low m_16 , that radiative electroweak symmetry breaking fails as a consequence of either |mu|^2 & lt ; 0 or m_ ( A^0 ) ^2 & lt ; 0 .	We find particularly large departures from the mSugra case for the neutralino relic density , which is sensitive to significant changes in the position and shape of the A^0 resonance and a substantial increase in the Higgsino component of the LSP .	However , we find that the corrections to the bottom mass are not sufficient to allow for Yukawa unification .
4	This is associated with the formation of a spin density wave state above the superconducting transition temperature .	The normal state and superconducting properties are investigated in the phase diagram of K_xSr_ { 1-x } Fe_2As_2 for 0 & lt ; x & lt ; 1 .	The ground state upper critical field , H_ { c2 } ( 0 ) , is extrapolated from magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements .	H_ { c2 } ( 0 ) scales with the critical temperature , T_c , of the superconducting transition .	In the normal state the Seebeck coefficient is shown to experience a dramatic change near a critical substitution of x=0.3 .
3	In addition , we use Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) and UKIRT Infrared Sky Survey ( UKIDSS ) magnitudes to search for objects in which one of the two components dominates the SDSS spectrum .	We present a catalogue of 1602 white dwarf-main sequence binaries ( WDMS ) from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 ( SDSS DR6 ) .	Among these we identify 440 as new WDMS binaries .	We select WDMS binary candidates from template fitting all 1.27 million DR6 spectra , using combined constraints in both $ \chi^ { 2 } $ and signal-to-noise ratio .	We use a decomposition/fitting technique to measure the effective temperatures , surface gravities , masses and distances to the white dwarfs , as well as the spectral types and distances to the companions in our catalogue .
4	A clear Cherenkov ring was successfully observed by a ring imaging Cherenkov counter .	We have succeeded in developing hydrophobic silica aerogels over a wide range of densities ( i.e.refractive indices ) .	A pinhole drying method was invented to make possible producing highly transparent aerogels with entirely new region of refractive indices of 1.06-1.26 .	Obtained aerogels are more transparent than conventional ones , and the refractive index is well controlled in the pinhole drying process .	A test beam experiment was carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the pinhole-dried aerogels as a Cherenkov radiator .
0	Kernel-based non-linear dimensionality reduction methods , such as Local Linear Embedding ( LLE ) and Laplacian Eigenmaps , rely heavily upon pairwise distances or similarity scores , with which one can construct and study a weighted graph associated with the data set .	When each individual data object carries structural details , the correspondence relations between these structures provide additional information that can be leveraged for studying the data set using the graph .	We generalize Diffusion Maps ( DM ) in manifold learning and introduce the framework of Horizontal Diffusion Maps ( HDM ) .	We model a data set with pairwise structural correspondences as a fibre bundle equipped with a connection .	We further demonstrate the advantage of incorporating such additional information and study the asymptotic behavior of HDM on general fibre bundles .
4	Adding all possible contributions to $ e^+ e^- \to b \bar b X $ together removes a huge deficit observed in earlier works but does not solve the problem totally .	I discuss mechanisms of heavy quark production in ( real ) photon-nucleon and ( real ) photon - ( real ) photon collisions .	In particular , I focuse on application of the Saturation Model .	In addition to the main dipole-nucleon or dipole-dipole contribution included in recent analyses , I propose how to calculate within the same formalism the hadronic single-resolved contribution to heavy quark production .	At high photon-photon energies this yields a sizeable correction of about 30-40 % for inclusive charm production and 15-20 % for bottom production .
1	We then face the problem of constructing a prediction in the presence of potentially large estimation error .	In many prediction problems , it is not uncommon that the number of variables used to construct a forecast is of the same order of magnitude as the sample size , if not larger .	Control of the estimation error is either achieved by selecting variables or combining all the variables in some special way .	This paper considers greedy algorithms to solve this problem .	It is shown that the resulting estimators are consistent under weak conditions .
2	In this model , we are able to reproduce the luminosity function of the satellites around the Milky Way by preventing cooling in haloes with Vvir & lt ; 16.7 km/s ( i.e.the atomic hydrogen cooling limit ) and including the impact of the reionization of the Universe .	We combine a series of high-resolution simulations with semi-analytic galaxy formation models to follow the evolution of a system resembling the Milky Way and its satellites .	The semi-analytic model is based on that developed for the Millennium Simulation , and successfully reproduces the properties of galaxies on large scales , as well as those of the Milky Way .	The physical properties of our model satellites ( e.g.mean metallicities , ages , half-light radii and mass-to-light ratios ) are in good agreement with the latest observational measurements .	We do not find a strong dependence upon the particular implementation of supernova feedback , but a scheme which is more efficient in galaxies embedded in smaller haloes , i.e.shallower potential wells , gives better agreement with the properties of the ultra-faint satellites .
0	We derive a two-band finite-dimensional model for description of the condensate tunneling in an accelerating optical lattice , taking into account the fine Bloch band structure .	The model reveals a very strong dependence of the final band populations on the initial populations and phases .	Most importantly , additionally to the known asymmetric dependence on the nonlinearity , there is also a notable asymmetry in the sensitivity of the tunneling probability to the nonliearity-induced initial population of the Bloch band to which the tunneling takes place .	This fact can explain the experimentally observed unexpected independence of the upper-to-lower tunneling probablity on the nonlinearity .	Finally , we compare the predictions of the two-band model with that of the well-known nonlinear Landau-Zener model and find disagreement when the two bands are initially populated .
1	However , the introduction of this technology was controversial and its efficiency has never been univocally established .	The amendment of the subsurface with nanoscale metallic iron particles ( nano-Fe0 ) has been discussed in the literature as an efficient in situ technology for groundwater remediation .	This unsatisfying situation has motivated this communication whose objective was a comprehensive discussion of the intrinsic reactivity of nano-Fe0 based on the contemporary knowledge on the mechanism of contaminant removal by Fe0 and a mathematical model .	It is showed that due to limitations of the mass transfer of nano-Fe0 to contaminants , available concepts can not explain the success of nano-Fe0 injection for in situ groundwater remediation .	It is recommended to test the possibility of introducing nano-Fe0 to initiate the formation of roll-fronts which propagation would induce the reductive transformation of both dissolved and adsorbed contaminants .
1	The first such instrument , IceCube , is near completion and taking data .	Neutrino astronomy beyond the Sun was first imagined in the late 1950s ; by the 1970s , it was realized that kilometer-scale neutrino detectors were required .	The IceCube project transforms a cubic kilometer of deep and ultra-transparent Antarctic ice into a particle detector .	A total of 5,160 optical sensors are embedded into a gigaton of Antarctic ice to detect the Cherenkov light emitted by secondary particles produced when neutrinos interact with nuclei in the ice .	Each optical sensor is a complete data acquisition system , including a phototube , digitization electronics , control and trigger systems and LEDs for calibration .
0	In this paper , we continue the analysis of heterotic string compactifications on half-flat mirror manifolds by including the 10-dimensional gauge fields .	It is argued , that the heterotic Bianchi identity is solved by a variant of the standard embedding .	Then , the resulting gauge group in four dimensions is still E6 despite the fact that the Levi-Civita connection has SO ( 6 ) holonomy .	We derive the associated four-dimensional effective theories including matter field terms for such compactifications .	The results are also extended to more general manifolds with SU ( 3 ) structure .
4	We find that there is a systematic steepening of the faint end slope ( alpha ) as one moves from passive ( alpha = -0.54 ) to active ( alpha = -1.50 ) star-forming galaxies , and that there is also a corresponding faintening of the rest-frame characteristic magnitude M* - 5\log_10 ( h ) ( from -19.6 to -19.2 ) .	We calculate the optical bj luminosity function of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey ( 2dFGRS ) for different subsets defined by their spectral properties .	These spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter , eta , which is a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a Principal Component Analysis .	This parameter eta identifies the average emission and absorption line strength in the galaxy rest-frame spectrum and hence is a useful indicator of the present star formation .	We use a total of 75,000 galaxies in our calculations , chosen from a sample of high signal-to-noise ratio , low redshift galaxies observed before January 2001 .
4	Our methods are built around this performance measure , and each of them is crafted to overcome the weakness of the previous algorithm .	We propose several novel methods for enhancing the multi-class SVMs by applying the generalization performance of binary classifiers as the core idea .	This concept will be applied on the existing algorithms , i.e. , the Decision Directed Acyclic Graph ( DDAG ) , the Adaptive Directed Acyclic Graphs ( ADAG ) , and Max Wins .	Although in the previous approaches there have been many attempts to use some information such as the margin size and the number of support vectors as performance estimators for binary SVMs , they may not accurately reflect the actual performance of the binary SVMs .	We show that the generalization ability evaluated via a cross-validation mechanism is more suitable to directly extract the actual performance of binary SVMs .
3	Such factors are particularly important for NMR and MRI of batteries and other electrochemical devices .	While experiments on metals have been performed since the early days of NMR ( and DNP ) , the use of bulk metal is normally avoided .	Instead , often powders have been used in combination with low fields , so that skin depth effects could be neglected .	Another complicating factor of acquiring NMR spectra or MRI images of bulk metal is the strong signal dependence on the orientation between the sample and the radio frequency ( RF ) coil , leading to non-intuitive image distortions and inaccurate quantification .	Here , we show results from a systematic study combining RF field calculations with experimental MRI of $ ^7 $ Li metal to visualize skin depth effects directly and to analyze the RF field orientation effect on MRI of bulk metal .
1	The classical canonical transformation is written out explicitly , which relates physical variables in both gauges , and equivalence of two classical theories is demonstrated in such a way .	The canonical description is presented for the string with pointlike masses at the ends in 1+1 dimensions in two different gauges : in the proper time gauge and in the light cone one .	Both theories are quantized , and it is shown that quantum theories are not unitary equivalent .	It happens due to the fact that the canonical transformation depends on interaction .	The quantum Poincare algebra proves to be closed in both cases , so that the requirement of Poincare covariance is not able to distinguish between two versions of the theory .
3	They are then used for calculating the ASER of M-ary phase shift keying ( PSK ) , differentially encoded non-coherent PSK ( DPSK ) and non-coherent frequency-shift keying ( FSK ) .	This paper investigates the average symbol error rate ( ASER ) performance of a dual-hop hybrid relaying system relying on both radio frequency ( RF ) and free space optical ( FSO ) links .	Specifically , the RF link is used for supporting mobile communication , while the FSO link is adopted as the backhaul of the cellular infrastructure .	Considering non-line-of-sight ( NLoS ) RF transmissions and a generalized atmospheric turbulence ( AT ) channel , the associated statistical features constituted of both the exact and the asymptotic moment generating functions ( MGF ) are derived in closed form .	A range of additional asymptotic expressions are also derived for all the modulation schemes under high signal-to-noise ratios ( SNR ) .
0	Future wireless communication systems require efficient and flexible baseband receivers .	Meaningful efficiency metrics are key for design space exploration to quantify the algorithmic and the implementation complexity of a receiver .	Most of the current established efficiency metrics are based on counting operations , thus neglecting important issues like data and storage complexity .	In this paper we introduce suitable energy and area efficiency metrics which resolve the afore-mentioned disadvantages .	These are decoded information bit per energy and throughput per area unit .
0	We analyze the current status of the solution to the solar neutrino problem based both on : a ) non-standard flavor changing neutrino interactions ( FCNI ) and b ) non-universal flavor diagonal neutrino interactions ( FDNI ) .	We find that FCNI and FDNI with matter in the sun as well as in the earth provide a good fit not only to the total rate measured by all solar neutrino experiments but also to the day-night and seasonal variations of the event rate , as well as the recoil electron energy spectrum measured by the SuperKamiokande collaboration .	This solution does not require massive neutrinos and neutrino mixing in vacuum .	Stringent experimental constraints on FCNI from bounds on lepton flavor violating decays and on FDNI from limits on lepton universality violation rule out $ \nu_e \to \nu_\mu $ transitions induced by New Physics as a solution to the solar neutrino problem .	However , a solution involving $ \nu_e \to \nu_\tau $ transitions is viable and could be tested independently by the upcoming $ B $ -factories if flavor violating tau decays would be observed at a rate close to the present upper bounds .
0	With the boom in IT technology , the data sets used in application are more and more larger and are described by a huge number of attributes , therefore , the feature selection become an important discipline in Knowledge discovery and data mining , allowing the experts to select the most relevant features to improve the quality of their studies and to reduce the time processing of their algorithm .	In addition to that , the data used by the applications become richer .	They are now represented by a set of complex and structured objects , instead of simple numerical matrixes .	The purpose of our algorithm is to do feature selection on rich data , called Boolean Symbolic Objects ( BSOs ) .	These objects are described by multivalued features .
3	Secondly , the RG is used together with the replica method to study the interacting Bose gas with delta-correlated disorder .	The momentum-shell renormalization group ( RG ) is used to study the condensation of interacting Bose gases without and with disorder .	First of all , for the homogeneous disorder-free Bose gas the interaction-induced shifts in the critical temperature and chemical potential are determined up to second order in the scattering length .	The approach does not make use of dimensional reduction and is thus independent of previous derivations .	The flow equations are derived and found to reduce , in the high-temperature limit , to the RG equations of the classical Landau-Ginzburg model with random-exchange defects .
0	Quantum key distribution ( QKD ) allows two spatially separated parties to securely generate a cryptographic key .	The first QKD protocol , published by C. H. Bennett and G. Brassard in 1984 ( BB84 ) , describes how this is achieved by transmitting individual qubits and exchanging classical authenticated information .	Any attempt to eavesdrop on the protocol introduces errors detectable by the legitimate parties .	This Licentiate Thesis studies the recently introduced EEQKD protocol which builds on BB84 .	In EEQKD , the qubits sent individually in BB84 are entangled and thus not directly available to an eavesdropper who is , in this protocol , provided only one-by-one access to the transmission .
4	The discharge spectra are measured ; they are dominated by the minority species N2 on Venus , while signatures of both species are found on Jupiter-like planets .	Large sprite discharges at high atmospheric altitudes have been found to be physically similar to small streamer discharges in air at sea level density .	Based on this understanding , we investigate possible sprite discharges on Venus or Jupiter-like planets through laboratory experiments on streamers in appropriate CO2-N2 and H2-He mixtures .	First , the scaling laws are experimentally confirmed by varying the density of the planetary gasses .	Then streamer diameters , velocities and overall morphology are investigated for sprites on Venus and Jupiter ; they are quite similar to those on earth , but light emissions in the visible range are fainter by two orders of magnitude .
0	Switching ARMA models greatly enhance the standard linear models to the extent that different ARMA model is allowed in a different regime , and the regime switching is typically assumed a Markov chain on the finite states of potential regimes .	Although statistical issues have been the subject of many recent papers , there is few systematic study of the probabilistic aspects of this new class of nonlinear models .	This paper discusses some basic issues concerning this class of models including strict stationarity , influence of initial conditions , and second-order property by studying SVAR models .	A number of examples are given to illustrate the theory and the variety of applications .	Extensions to other models such as mean-shifting , and inhomogeneous transition probabilities are discussed .
0	In power systems , load curve data is one of the most important datasets that are collected and retained by utilities .	The quality of load curve data , however , is hard to guarantee since the data is subject to communication losses , meter malfunctions , and many other impacts .	In this paper , a new approach to analyzing load curve data is presented .	The method adopts a new view , termed \textit { portrait } , on the load curve data by analyzing the periodic patterns in the data and re-organizing the data for ease of analysis .	Furthermore , we introduce algorithms to build the virtual portrait load curve data , and demonstrate its application on load curve data cleansing .
1	The idea is to generate effective encodings to allow fast distance approximation .	Vector quantization-based approaches are successful to solve Approximate Nearest Neighbor ( ANN ) problems which are critical to many applications .	We propose quantization-based methods should partition the data space finely and exhibit locality of the dataset to allow efficient non-exhaustive search .	In this paper , we introduce the concept of High Capacity Locality Aggregating Encodings ( HCLAE ) to this end , and propose Dictionary Annealing ( DA ) to learn HCLAE by a simulated annealing procedure .	The quantization error is lower than other state-of-the-art .
0	Consider a model parameterized by a scalar parameter of interest and a nuisance parameter vector .	Inference about the parameter of interest may be based on the signed root of the likelihood ratio statistic R. The standard normal approximation to the conditional distribution of R typically has error of order O ( n^ { -1/2 } ) , where n is the sample size .	There are several modifications for R , which reduce the order of error in the approximations .	In this paper , we mainly investigate Barndorff-Nielsen 's modified directed likelihood ratio statistic , Severini 's empirical adjustment , and DiCiccio and Martin 's two modifications , involving the Bayesian approach and the conditional likelihood ratio statistic .	For each modification , two formats were employed to approximate the conditional cumulative distribution function ; these are Barndorff-Nielson formats and the Lugannani and Rice formats .
4	Furthermore , we clarify in another way that exponent $ n $ should be even numbers by discuss the spherically symmetric static solutions in Newtonian gauge .	We construct a class of generalized non-local gravity ( GNLG ) model which is the modified theory of general relativity ( GR ) obtained by adding a term $ m^ { 2n-2 } R\Box^ { -n } R $ to the Einstein-Hilbert action .	Concretely , we not only study the gravitational equation for the GNLG model by introducing auxiliary scalar fields , but also analyse the classical stability and examine the cosmological consequences of the model for different exponent $ n $ .	We find that the half of the scalar fields are always ghost-like and the exponent $ n $ must be taken even number for a stable GNLG model .	Meanwhile , the model spontaneously generates three dominant phases of the evolution of the universe , and the equation of state parameters turn out to be phantom-like .
0	The success of models of coupled two-leg spin ladders in describing the magnetic excitation spectrum of La_ { 2-x } Ba_xCuO_4 had been interpreted previously as evidence for bond-centered stripes .	In a recent article , however , we have determined the magnetic coupling induced by the charge stripes between bond- or site-centered spin stripes modeled by two- or three-leg ladders , respectively .	We found that only the site-centered models order .	We further indicated excellent agreement of a fully consistent analysis of coupled three-leg ladders using a spin wave theory of bond with the experimental data .	Here , we provide a full and detailed account of this analysis .
0	The traditional information theoretic approach to studying feedback is to consider ideal instantaneous high-rate feedback of the channel outputs to the encoder .	This was acceptable in classical work because the results were negative : Shannon pointed out that even perfect feedback often does not improve capacity and in the context of symmetric DMCs , Dobrushin showed that it does not improve the fixed block-coding error exponents in the interesting high rate regime .	However , it has recently been shown that perfect feedback does allow great improvements in the asymptotic tradeoff between end-to-end delay and probability of error , even for symmetric channels at high rate .	Since gains are claimed with ideal instantaneous feedback , it is natural to wonder whether these improvements remain if the feedback is unreliable or otherwise limited .	Here , packet-erasure channels are considered on both the forward and feedback links .
4	This algorithm should be applicable for any parallel simulation with short-range interactions , including parallel or grid simulations of partial differential equations .	We analyze the evolution of the local simulation times ( LST ) in Parallel Discrete Event Simulations .	The new ingredients introduced are i ) we associate the LST with the nodes and not with the processing elements , and 2 ) we propose to minimize the exchange of information between different processing elements by freezing the LST on the boundaries between processing elements for some time of processing and then releasing them by a wide-stream memory exchange between processing elements .	Highlights of our approach are i ) it keeps the highest level of processor time utilization during the algorithm evolution , ii ) it takes a reasonable time for the memory exchange excluding the time-consuming and complicated process of message exchange between processors , and iii ) the communication between processors is decoupled from the calculations performed on a processor .	The effectiveness of our algorithm grows with the number of nodes ( or threads ) .
3	Our algorithm approximates the data points , which are probability distributions , by the weighted Kullback-Leibeler center ( KL-center ) of the dictionary atoms .	In this work , we propose a novel information theoretic framework for dictionary learning ( DL ) and sparse coding ( SC ) on a statistical manifold ( the manifold of probability distributions ) .	Unlike the traditional DL and SC framework , our new formulation { \it does not explicitly incorporate any sparsity inducing norm in the cost function but yet yields SCs } .	Moreover , we extend this framework to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices , $ \mathcal { P } _n $ .	The KL-center is the minimizer of the maximum KL-divergence between the unknown center and members of the set whose center is being sought .
1	In this paper , we present our Abaqus/Standard-based pipeline to create subject-specific left ventricular models .	Computational modeling can provide critical insight into existing and potential new surgical procedures , medical or minimally-invasive treatments for heart failure , one of the leading causes of deaths in the world that has reached epidemic proportions .	We first review our generic left ventricular model , and then the personalization process based on magnetic resonance images .	Identification of subject-specific cardiac material properties is done by coupling Abaqus/Standard to the python optimization library NL-Opt .	Compared to previous studies from our group , the emphasis is here on the fully implicit solving of the model , and the two-parameter optimization of the passive cardiac material properties .
1	We have carried out Monte Carlo simulations of a minimal hard spherocylinder dimer model to investigate the role of excluded volume interations in determining the phase behavior of bent-core materials and to probe the molecular origins of polar and chiral symmetry breaking .	Recently , a new class of smectic liquid crystal phases ( SmCP phases ) characterized by the spontaneous formation of macroscopic chiral domains from achiral bent-core molecules has been discovered .	We present the phase diagram as a function of pressure or density and dimer opening angle $ \psi $ .	With decreasing $ \psi $ , a transition from a nonpolar to a polar smectic phase is observed near $ \psi = 167^ { \circ } $ , and the nematic phase becomes thermodynamically unstable for $ \psi & lt ; 135^ { \circ } $ .	No chiral smectic or biaxial nematic phases were found .
1	The cosmic abundance of the non-thermally produced gravitinos naturally explains the dark matter component of the universe .	We find that there is no supersymmetric flavor/CP problem , mu-problem , cosmological moduli/gravitino problem or dimension four/five proton decay problem in a class of supersymmetric theories with O ( 1 ) GeV gravitino mass .	A mild hierarchy between the mass scale of supersymmetric particles and electroweak scale is predicted , consistent with the null result of a search for the Higgs boson at the LEP-II experiments .	A relation to the strong CP problem is addressed .	We propose a parametrization of the model for the purpose of collider studies .
0	Explicit expressions for the differential and total rates and emissivities of neutrino pairs from the photo-neutrino process $ e^\pm + \gamma \to e^\pm + \nu + \bar\nu $ in hot and dense matter are derived .	Full information about the emitted neutrinos is retained by evaluating the squared matrix elements for this process which was hitherto bypassed through the use of Lenard 's identity in obtaining the total neutrino emissivities .	Accurate numerical results are presented for widely varying conditions of temperature and density .	Analytical results helpful in understanding the qualitative behaviors of the rates and emissivities in limiting situations are derived .	The corresponding production and absorption kernels in the source term of the Boltzmann equation for neutrino transport are developed .
0	Marcatili 's famous approximate analytical description of light propagating through rectangular dielectric waveguides , published in 1969 , gives accurate results for low-index-contrast waveguides .	However , photonic integrated circuit technology has advanced to high-index-contrast ( HIC ) waveguides .	In this paper , we improve Marcatili 's model by adjusting the amplitudes of the components of the electromagnetic fields in his description .	We find that Marcatili 's eigenvalue equation for the propagation constant is also valid for HIC waveguides .	Our improved method shows much better agreement with rigorous numerical simulations , in particular for the case of HIC waveguides .
2	The 64 DGSS galaxies collectively exhibit an increase in metallicity with B-band luminosity .	Using spectroscopic data from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe ( DEEP ) Groth Strip survey ( DGSS ) , we analyze the gas-phase oxygen abundances in the warm ionized medium for 64 emission-line field galaxies in the redshift range 0.26 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.82 .	Oxygen abundances relative to hydrogen range between 8.4 & lt ; 12+log ( O/H ) & lt ; 9.0 with typical internal plus systematic measurement uncertainties of 0.17 dex .	DGSS galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( z=0.6-0.82 ) are brighter , on average , by ~1 mag at fixed metallicity compared to the lowest DGSS redshift bin ( z=0.26-0.40 ) and brighter by up to ~2.4 mag compared to local ( z & lt ; 0.1 ) emission-line field galaxies .	Alternatively , DGSS galaxies in the highest redshift bin ( z=0.6-0.82 ) are , on average , 40 % ( 0.15 dex ) more metal-poor at fixed luminosity compared to local ( z & lt ; 0.1 ) emission-line field galaxies .
3	The absolute lower bound for the detection rate can naturally be due to SD interaction .	The Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ( WIMPs ) are among the main candidates for the relic dark matter ( DM ) .	The idea of the direct DM detection relies on elastic in-dependent ( SD ) and spin-independent ( SI ) interaction of WIMPs with target nuclei .	The importance of the SD WIMP-nucleus interaction for reliable DM detection is argued .	An experiment aimed at detecting DM with sensitivity higher than 10^ { -5 } event/day/kg should have a non-zero-spin target .
3	We aim to derive the dust mass in NGC 4370 from both optical and FIR data , and investigate the need to invoke a putative diffuse dust component .	A fraction of the early-type galaxy population hosts a prominent dust lane .	Methods to quantify the dust content of these systems based on optical imaging data usually yield dust masses which are an order of magnitude lower than dust masses derived from the observed FIR emission .	High-quality optical data from the Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey ( NGVS ) and FIR/submm observations from the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey ( HeViCS ) allow us to revisit previous methods to determine the dust content in galaxies and explore new ones .	We create color and attenuation maps , which are converted to approximate dust mass maps based on simple dust geometries .
3	The presence of guests creates an energy gap in the dispersion of vibrational frequencies .	A simple model shows how it is possible to create a gap in the vibrational spectrum of a one-dimensional lattice .	The proposed model is a host-guest chain having , instead of point-like masses connected by spring , massive cages hosting particles inside .	We imagine the cage as a rigid box containing a mass linked by a spring to the box inner wall .	The gap is about the internal resonance of the mass hidden in the cage .
0	In this paper we discuss the broad-band X-ray characteristics of a complete sample of 36 type 1 AGN , detected by INTEGRAL in the 20-40 keV band above the 5.5sigma level .	We present , for all the objects in the sample , the broad-band ( 1-110 keV ) spectral analysis obtained by using INTEGRAL/Swift-BAT observations together with XMM-Newton , Chandra , ASCA and Swift/XRT data .	We also present the general average properties of the sample , i.e.the distribution of photon indices , high energy cut-offs , reflection fractions and absorption properties , together with an in-depth analysis of their parameter space .	We find that the average Seyfert 1 power law has an index of 1.7 with a dispersion of 0.2 .	The mean cut-off energy is at around 100 keV , with most objects displaying Ec in the range 50-150 keV ; the average amount of Compton reflection is 1.5 with a typical dispersion of 0.7 .
2	We demonstrate this technique as an efficient means to accomplish broadband dipolar recoupling of homonuclear spins , while decoupling heteronuclear dipolar couplings and anisotropic chemicals shifts and retaining influence from isotropic chemical shifts .	We present a new concept for homonuclear dipolar recoupling in magic-angle-spinning ( MAS ) solid-state NMR experiments which avoids the problem of dipolar truncation .	This is accomplished through the introduction of a new NMR pulse sequence design principle : the triple oscillating field technique .	In this manner , it possible to synthesize Ising interactions in homonuclear spin networks and thereby avoid dipolar truncation - a serious problem essentially all previous homonuclear dipolar recoupling experiments suffer from .	Combination of this recoupling concept with rotor assisted dipolar refocusing enables easy readout of internuclear distances through comparison with analytical Fresnel curves .
2	In continuum quantum field theories the fermion-antifermion creation and annihilation operators appear as bilinears in the four-momentum operator and generate a unitary algebra .	In constrast to discretized space-time approximations to continuum quantum field theories , discretized velocity space approximations to continuum quantum field theories are investigated .	A four-momentum operator is given in terms of bare fermion-antifermion-boson creation and annihilation operators with discrete indices .	When the number of modes range over only a finite number of values , the algebra is that associated with the Lie algebra of U ( 2N ) .	By keeping N finite ( but arbitrary ) problems due to an infinite Lorentz volume and to the creation of infinite numbers of bare fermion-antifermion pairs are avoided .
4	We find $ m_e ( T ) = 2.484 ( 52 ) T $ and $ m_m ( T ) = 0.466 ( 15 ) g^2 ( T ) T $ .	We study the gluon propagator in Landau gauge in the deconfined phase of $ SU ( 2 ) $ gauge theory .	From the long-distance behaviour of correlation functions of temporal and spatial components of the gauge fields we extract electric ( $ m_e $ ) and magnetic ( $ m_m $ ) screening masses .	For temperatures larger than twice $ T_c $ we find no additional temperature dependence in $ m_e ( T ) /T $ , while $ m_m ( T ) /T $ drops with increasing temperature .	The decrease is consistent with the expected behaviour , $ m_m ( T ) \sim g^2 ( T ) T $ .
3	This paper argues that the lessons of the UAI community , in particular that one should produce and communicate beliefs rather than raw sensor values , are highly relevant to sensor networks .	Sensor networks are an exciting new kind of computer system .	Consisting of a large number of tiny , cheap computational devices physically distributed in an environment , they gather and process data about the environment in real time .	One of the central questions in sensor networks is what to do with the data , i.e. , how to reason with it and how to communicate it .	We contend that loopy belief propagation is particularly well suited to communicating beliefs in sensor networks , due to its compact implementation and distributed nature .
0	Optimal zero-delay coding ( quantization ) of a vector-valued Markov source driven by a noise process is considered .	Using a stochastic control problem formulation , the existence and structure of optimal quantization policies are studied .	For a finite-horizon problem with bounded per-stage distortion measure , the existence of an optimal zero-delay quantization policy is shown provided that the quantizers allowed are ones with convex codecells .	The bounded distortion assumption is relaxed to cover cases that include the linear quadratic Gaussian problem .	For the infinite horizon problem and a stationary Markov source the optimality of deterministic Markov coding policies is shown .
1	Values for Q^ { -1 } above T_c are temperature independent and have a weak pressure dependence .	We present data for energy dissipation factor ( Q^ { -1 } ) over a broad temperature range at various pressures of a torsion pendulum setup used to study 3He confined in a 98 % open silica aerogel .	Below T_c , a deliberate axial compression of the aerogel by 10 % widens the range of metastability for a superfluid Equal Spin Pairing ( ESP ) state ; we observe this ESP phase on cooling and the B phase on warming over an extended temperature region .	While the dissipation for the B phase tends to zero as T goes to 0 , Q^ { -1 } exhibits a peak value greater than that at T_c at intermediate temperatures .	Values for Q^ { -1 } in the ESP phase are consistently higher than in the B phase and are proportional to \rho_s/\rho until the ESP to B phase transition is attained .
4	This also shows that the concept of equilibrium is confusing , especially neutral equilibrium is confused to be stable equilibrium .	The principles of static equilibrium are of special interest to civil engineers .	For a rigid body to be in static equilibrium the condition is that net force and net torque acting on the body should be zero .	That clearly signifies that if equal weights are placed on either sides of a balance , the balance should be in equilibrium , even if its beam is not horizontal ( we have considered the beam to be straight and have no thickness , an ideal case ) .	Thus , although the weights are equal , they will appear different which is puzzling .
4	The progenitor of iPTF13bvn would have been a helium giant rather than a Wolf-Rayet star .	We report and discuss post-explosion observations of supernova iPTF13bvn .	We find that the brightness of the SN at +740 days is below the level of the pre-explosion source and thus confirm that the progenitor star has gone .	We estimate that the late-time brightness is still dominated by the supernova , which constrains the magnitude and thus mass of a possible companion star to below approximately 10Msun .	In turn this implies that the progenitor 's initial mass is constrained to a narrow range of between 10 to 12Msun .
2	The bulk partition function is given by a functional integral over string fields in AdS_2 .	We consider the AdS_2/CFT_1 holographic correspondence near the horizon of big four-dimensional black holes preserving four supersymmetries in toroidally compactified Type-II string theory .	The boundary partition function of CFT_1 is given by the known quantum degeneracies of these black holes .	Using recent results on localization we reduce the infinite-dimensional functional integral to a finite number of ordinary integrals over a space of localizing instantons .	Under reasonable assumptions about the relevant terms in the effective action , these integrals can be evaluated exactly to obtain a bulk partition function .
4	The method is illustrated with a calculation of conditional probabilities by Monte Carlo Simulation .	We use first-order perturbation theory to provide a local linear relation between the circuit parameters and the poles of an RLC network .	The sensitivity matrix , which defines this relationship , is obtained from the systems eigenvectors and the derivative of its eigenvalues .	In general , the sensitivity matrix is related to the equilibrium fluctuations of the system .	In particular , it may be used as the basis for a statistical model to efficiently predict the sensitivity of the circuit response to small component variations .
4	( 2 ) For a self-injective Artin algeba $ A $ and an $ A $ -module $ X $ , the $ \Phi $ -Auslander-Yoneda algebras of $ A\oplus X $ and $ A\oplus \Omega_A ( X ) $ are derived-equivalent for every admissible set $ \Phi $ , where $ \Omega $ is the Heller loop operator .	In this paper , we introduce $ \Phi $ -Auslander-Yoneda algebras in a triangulated category with $ \Phi $ a parameter set in $ \mathbb N $ , and provide a method to construct new derived equivalences between these $ \Phi $ -Auslander-Yoneda algebras ( not necessarily Artin algebras ) , or their quotient algebras , from a given almost $ \nu $ -stable derived equivalence .	As consequences of our method , we have : ( 1 ) Suppose that $ A $ and $ B $ are representation-finite , self-injective Artin algebras with $ _AX $ and $ _BY $ additive generators for $ A $ and $ B $ , respectively .	If $ A $ and $ B $ are derived-equivalent , then the $ \Phi $ -Auslander-Yoneda algebras of $ X $ and $ Y $ are derived-equivalent for every admissible set $ \Phi $ .	In particular , the Auslander algebras of $ A $ and $ B $ are both derived-equivalent and stably equivalent .
4	We then provide a formal mathematical proof why the approach is valid in the point-to-plane version of ICP , which validates the intuition and experimental results of practitioners .	This paper considers the problem of estimating the covariance of roto-translations computed by the Iterative Closest Point ( ICP ) algorithm .	The problem is relevant for localization of mobile robots and vehicles equipped with depth-sensing cameras ( e.g. , Kinect ) or Lidar ( e.g. , Velodyne ) .	The closed-form formulas for covariance proposed in previous literature generally build upon the fact that the solution to ICP is obtained by minimizing a linear least-squares problem .	In this paper , we show this approach needs caution because the rematching step of the algorithm is not explicitly accounted for , and applying it to the point-to-point version of ICP leads to completely erroneous covariances .
4	On a qualitative level , the NJL model provides a consistent description of the dependence of quark number fluctuations on temperature and baryon chemical potential .	We discuss the net quark and isovector fluctuations as well as off-diagonal quark flavor susceptibilities along the chiral phase transition line in the Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio ( NJL ) model .	The model is formulated at non-zero quark and isospin chemical potentials with non-vanishing vector couplings in the iso-scalar and iso-vector channels .	We study the influence of the quark chemical potential on the quark flavour susceptibilities in detail and the dependence of the results on model parameters as well as on the quark mass .	The NJL model findings are compared with recent lattice results obtained in two -- flavor QCD at finite chemical potential .
1	It crosses the negative parity ground band above 11/2- and becomes the yrast at 15/2- .	A superdeformed ( SD ) band has been identified in a non - alpha - conjugate nucleus 35Cl .	Lifetimes of all relevant states have been measured to follow the evolution of collectivity .	Enhanced B ( E2 ) , B ( E1 ) values as well as energetics provide evidences for superdeformation and existence of parity doublet cluster structure in an odd-A nucleus for the first time in A = 40 region .	Large scale shell model calculations assign ( sd ) 16 ( pf ) 3 as the origin of these states .
2	However , if these hot Jupiters are located in the habitable zones of their host stars , and if rocky moons orbit them , then these moons may be habitable .	Since the discovery of the first exoplanets , those most adequate for life to begin and evolve have been sought .	Due to observational bias , however , most of the discovered planets so far are gas giants , precluding their habitability .	In this work , we present a model for planetary transit simulation considering the presence of moons and planetary rings around a planet .	The moon 's orbit is considered to be circular and coplanar with the planetary orbit .
2	They can have a regular horizon , and we show that this implies the existence of an infinite number of black rings , labeled by a continuous parameter , with the same mass and angular momentum as neutral black rings and black holes .	We present new self-gravitating solutions in five dimensions that describe circular strings , i.e. , rings , electrically coupled to a two-form potential ( as e.g. , fundamental strings do ) , or to a dual magnetic one-form .	The rings are prevented from collapsing by rotation , and they create a field analogous to a dipole , with no net charge measured at infinity .	We also discuss the solution for a rotating loop of fundamental string .	We show how more general rings arise from intersections of branes with a regular horizon ( even at extremality ) , closely related to the configurations that yield the four-dimensional black hole with four charges .
3	Among other things , we calculate the variety of tangent directions to lines on $ X $ through a point and determine unirulings of $ X $ .	We study the projective geometry of homogeneous varieties $ X= G/P\subset P ( V ) $ , where $ G $ is a complex simple Lie group , $ P $ is a maximal parabolic subgroup and $ V $ is the minimal $ G $ -module associated to $ P $ .	Our study began with the observation that Freudenthal 's magic chart could be derived from Zak 's theorem on Severi varieties and standard geometric constructions .	Our attempt to understand this observation led us to discover further connections between projective geometry and representation theory .	We show this variety is a Hermitian symmetric space if and only if $ P $ does not correspond to a short root .
3	These results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on 2D metallic dot arrays .	We investigate the effects of finite temperature , dc pulse , and ac drives on the charge transport in metallic arrays using numerical simulations .	For finite temperatures there is a finite conduction threshold which decreases linearly with temperature .	Additionally we find a quadratic scaling of the current-voltage curves which is independent of temperature for finite thresholds .	We have also investigated the effects of an ac drive as well as a suddenly applied dc drive .
0	The connection between some features of the metallicity gradient in the Galactic disk , best revealed by Open Clusters and Cepheids , and the spiral structure , is explored .	The step-like abrupt decrease in metallicity at 8.5 kpc ( with R_0= 7.5 kpc , or at 9.5 kpc if R_0 = 8.5 kpc is adopted ) is well explained by the corotation ring-shaped gap in the density of gas , which isolates the internal and external regions of the disk one from the other .	This solves a long standing problem of understanding the different chemical characteristics of the inner and outer parts of the disk .	The time required to build up the metallicity difference between the two sides of the step is a measure of the minimal life-time of the present grand-design spiral pattern structure , of the order of 3 Gyr .	The plateaux observed on each side of the step are interpreted in terms of the large scale radial motion of the stars and of the gas flow induced by the spiral structure .
2	Next-to-leading-order ( NLO ) QCD calculations describe the measured differential cross sections well .	Dijet production has been studied in neutral current deep inelastic e+p scattering for 470 & lt ; Q**2 & lt ; 20000 GeV**2 with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 38.4 pb** { -1 } .	Dijet differential cross sections are presented in a kinematic region where both theoretical and experimental uncertainties are small .	A QCD analysis of the measured dijet fraction as a function of Q**2 allows both a precise determination of alpha_s ( M_Z ) and a test of the energy-scale dependence of the strong coupling constant .	A detailed analysis provides an improved estimate of the uncertainties of the NLO QCD cross sections arising from the parton distribution functions of the proton .
3	The electron density and ionization parameter decrease with radius indicating that the NLR is photoionized by the central source only .	We study the narrow-line region ( NLR ) of six Seyfert-1 and six Seyfert-2 galaxies by means of spatially resolved optical spectroscopy and photoionization modelling .	From spatially resolved spectral diagnostics , we find a transition between the AGN-excited NLR and the surrounding star-forming regions , allowing us to determine the NLR size independent of stellar contamination .	CLOUDY photoionization models show that the observed transition represents a true difference in ionization source and can not be explained by variations of physical parameters .	The velocity field suggests a disky NLR gas distribution .
1	We prove a number of results about what is and is not locally possible .	Entanglement is an useful resource because some global operations can not be locally implemented using classical communication .	We focus on orthogonal states , which can always be globally distinguished .	We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a general set of 2x2 quantum states to be locally distinguishable , and for a general set of 2xn quantum states to be distinguished given an initial measurement of the qubit .	These results reveal a fundamental asymmetry to nonlocality , which is the origin of `` nonlocality without entanglement '' , and we present a very simple proof of this phenomenon .
2	Lattice fluctuations are taken into account by a bond disorder model .	A theory of optical excitations by using a tight binding model with long-range Coulomb interactions is developed .	The model is applied to a C60 molecule and a cluster , and is treated by the Hartree-Fock approximation followed by a configuration interaction method .	We first examine what strength of Coulomb interaction is appropriate to describe the electronic structures observed by photo-electron and optical absorption spectroscopy .	Then , we demonstrate that the photo-excited states are mainly intramolecular ( i.e.Frenkel ) excitons with small charge-transfer components .
0	Magneto-convection simulations on meso-granule and granule scales near the solar surface are used to study small scale dynamo activity , the emergence and disappearance of magnetic flux tubes , and the formation and evolution of micropores .	From weak seed fields , convective motions produce highly intermittent magnetic fields in the intergranular lanes which collect over the boundaries of the underlying meso-granular scale cells .	Instances of both emerging magnetic flux loops and magnetic flux disappearing from the surface occur in the simulations .	We show an example of a flux tube collapsing to kG field strength and discuss how the nature of flux disappearance can be investigated .	Observed stokes profiles of small magnetic structures are severely distorted by telescope diffraction and seeing .
1	We study the thermodynamics of a single pancake stack pinned by columnar defects and obtain the temperature dependence of localization length , pinning energy and critical current .	We investigate fluctuations of Josephson-coupled pancake vortices in layered superconductors in the presence of columnar defects .	We study the creep regime and compute the crossover current between line-like creep and pancake-like creep motion .	We find that columnar defects effectively increase interlayer Josephson coupling by suppressing thermal fluctuations of pancakes .	This leads to an upward shift in the decoupling line most pronounced around the matching field .
1	deg in the central region of the Pleiades open cluster .	We present intermediate and low resolution optical spectroscopy ( 650-915 nm ) of seven faint , very red objects ( 20 & gt ; I & gt ; = 17.8 , I-Z & gt ; = 0.5 ) discovered in a CCD-based IZ survey covering an area of 1 sq .	The observed spectra show that these objects are very cool dwarfs , having spectral types in the range M6-M9 .	Five out of the seven objects can be considered as Pleiades members on the basis of their radial velocities , Halpha emission and other gravity sensitive atomic features like the NaI doublet at 818.3 and 819.5 nm .	According to current evolutionary models the masses of these new objects range from roughly 80 MJup for the hottest in the sample down to 45 MJup for Roque 4 , the coolest and faintest confirmed member .
2	We measured a sky-projected , spin-orbit angle of 0.1 +/- 2.6 degrees , which is consistent with a very low-inclined orbit with respect to the stellar rotation axis .	We report the detection of the Doppler shadow of the transiting hot Jupiter CoRoT-11b .	Our analysis is based on line-profile tomography of time-series , Keck/HIRES high-resolution spectra acquired during the transit of the planet .	We refined the physical parameters of the system using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simultaneous fitting of the available photometric and spectroscopic data .	An analysis of the tidal evolution of the system shows how the currently measured obliquity and its uncertainty translate into an initial absolute value of less than about 10 degrees on the zero-age main sequence , for an expected average modified tidal quality factor of the star Q'* & gt ; 4 x 10^6 .
0	Over the last two decades , several methods have been proposed for stabilizing the dynamics of biological populations .	However , these methods have typically been evaluated using different population dynamics models and in the context of very different concepts of stability , which makes it difficult to compare their relative efficiencies .	Moreover , since the dynamics of populations are dependent on the life-history of the species and its environment , it is conceivable that the stabilizing effects of control methods would also be affected by such factors , a complication that has typically not been investigated .	In this study we compare six different control methods with respect to their efficiency at inducing a common level of enhancement ( 50 % increase ) for two kinds of stability ( constancy and persistence ) under four different life history/ environment combinations .	Since these methods have been analytically studied elsewhere , we focus on an intuitive understanding of realistic simulations incorporating noise , extinction probability and lattice effect .
2	At a temperature of 300 K the measured bulk modulus is reduced and shows a very strong enhancement under increasing pressure due to pressure-induced oxygen ordering .	The linear compressibilities and the thermal expansion of an untwinned , nearly optimal doped YBa2Cu3O6.94 single crystal were measured along the three crystallographic axes with a high-resolution dilatometer mounted in a high-pressure cell .	The measurements were performed in a temperature range from 50 K to 320 K under hydrostatic gas pressure of maximal 0.65 GPa .	This ordering process can also be related to a glass transition seen in the thermal expansion above 225 K. At lower temperatures , when oxygen ordering is frozen , the bulk modulus is increased and shows a significantly reduced enhancement under pressure .	This pressure dependence , however , is still anomalous high , probably caused by bonds of extremely different compressibilities within the unit cell .
2	For these objects color superconductivity turns out to be an essential ingredient for a successful description of the cooling phenomenology in accordance with recently developed tests .	Recent indications for high neutron star masses ( M \sim 2 M_sun ) and large radii ( R & gt ; 12 km ) could rule out soft equations of state and have provoked a debate whether the occurence of quark matter in compact stars can be excluded as well .	We show that modern quantum field theoretical approaches to quark matter including color superconductivity and a vector meanfield allow a microscopic description of hybrid stars which fulfill the new , strong constraints .	We discuss the energy release in the neutrino untrapping transition as a new aspect of the problem that hybrid stars masquerade themselves as neutron stars .	Quark matter searches in future generations of low-temperature/high-density nucleus-nucleus collision experiments such as low-energy RHIC and CBM @ FAIR might face the same problem of an almost crossover behavior of the deconfinement transition .
0	We investigated the thermal evolution of non-spherical primordial gas clouds of mass $ M=10^6M_\odot $ .	We studied two cases : 1 ) prolate and oblate clouds without angular momentum , 2 ) initially spherical , oblate and prolate clouds with angular momentum .	In the spherical case , the magnitude of the angular momentum is the key quantity which determines the fragment mass .	The fragment mass is found to be $ M \gsim 100 M_\odot $ for $ 10^ { -2 } \lsim \lambda \lsim 1 $ , where $ \lambda $ is the cosmological spin parameter .	For the oblate shape of initial gas clouds , the angular momentum is almost always not important , In the case of prolate clouds with some angular momentum , collapse proceeds in the same way as spherical case , and the bounce occurs to form a disk due to the angular momentum .
0	The seminal work of Waldhausen , Farrell and Jones , Igusa , and Weiss and Williams shows that the homotopy groups in low degrees of the space of homeomorphisms of a closed Riemannian manifold of negative sectional curvature can be expressed as a functor of the fundamental group of the manifold .	To determine this functor , however , it remains to determine the homotopy groups of the topological Whitehead spectrum of the circle .	The cyclotomic trace of B okstedt , Hsiang , and Madsen and a theorem of Dundas , in turn , lead to an expression for these homotopy groups in terms of the equivariant homotopy groups of the homotopy fiber of the map from the topological Hochschild T-spectrum of the sphere spectrum to that of the ring of integers induced by the Hurewicz map .	We evaluate the latter homotopy groups , and hence , the homotopy groups of the topological Whitehead spectrum of the circle in low degrees .	The result extends earlier work by Anderson and Hsiang and by Igusa and complements recent work by Grunewald , Klein , and Macko .
0	We complete the list of one loop renormalization group equations and matching conditions relevant for the computation of the electroweak precision parameters $ S $ and $ T $ in the three site Higgsless model .	We obtain one-loop formulas for $ S $ and $ T $ expressed in terms of physical observables such as the KK gauge boson mass $ M_ { W ' } $ , the KK fermion mass $ M $ , and the KK gauge boson ( $ W ' $ ) couplings with light quarks and leptons $ g_ { W'ff } $ .	It is shown that these physical observables , $ M_ { W ' } $ , $ M $ and $ g_ { W'ff } $ are severely constrained by the electroweak precision data .	Unlike the tree level analysis on the ideally delocalized fermion , we find that perfect fermiophobity of $ W ' $ is ruled out by the precision data .	We also study the cutoff dependence of our analysis .
2	The quadrupole probe should be connected to an appropriate analogical digital converter ( ADC ) which samples in phase and quadrature ( IQ ) or in uniform mode .	This paper discusses the development and engineering of electrical spectroscopy for simultaneous and non invasive measurement of electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity .	A suitable quadrupolar probe is able to perform measurements on a subsurface with inaccuracies below a fixed limit ( 10 % ) in a bandwidth of low ( LF ) frequency ( 100kHz ) .	If the quadrupole is characterized by a galvanic contact with the surface , the inaccuracies in the measurement of resistivity and permittivity , due to the IQ or uniform sampling ADC , are analytically expressed .	A large number of numerical simulations proves that the performances of the probe depend on the selected sampler and that the IQ is better compared to the uniform mode under the same operating conditions , i.e.bit resolution and medium .
1	However , the current large amount of data up to higher and higher redshifts asks for more sophisticated statistical approaches like multivariate analyses .	The Hubble tuning fork diagram , based on morphology and established in the 1930s , has always been the preferred scheme for classification of galaxies .	Clustering analyses are still very confidential , and do not take into account the unavoidable characteristics in our Universe : evolution .	Assuming branching evolution of galaxies as a 'transmission with modification ' , we have shown that the concepts and tools of phylogenetic systematics ( cladistics ) can be heuristically transposed to the case of galaxies .	This approach that we call `` astrocladistics '' , has now successfully been applied on several samples of galaxies and globular clusters .
4	In particular we propose an efficient mutual authentication protocol between a tag and a reader that achieves a reasonable level of privacy , using only symmetric key cryptography on the tag , while not requiring a costly key-search algorithm at the reader side .	Proper privacy protection in RFID systems is important .	However , many of the schemes known are impractical , either because they use hash functions instead of the more hardware efficient symmetric encryption schemes as a efficient cryptographic primitive , or because they incur a rather costly key search time penalty at the reader .	Moreover , they do not allow for dynamic , fine-grained access control to the tag that cater for more complex usage scenarios .	In this paper we investigate such scenarios , and propose a model and corresponding privacy friendly protocols for efficient and fine-grained management of access permissions to tags .
4	We derive the deepest upper limits to date on the presence of lines in the 4U 0142+614 spectrum as a function of energy : equivalent width in the 1-3 keV energy range & lt ; 4 eV and & lt ; 8 eV for narrow and broad lines , respectively .	We report on two new XMM-Newton observations of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar ( AXP ) 4U 0142+614 performed in March and July 2004 , collecting the most accurate spectrum for this source to date .	Furthermore , we analyse two short archival observations performed in February 2002 and January 2003 ( the latter already reported by Gohler et al .	2005 ) in order to study the long term behaviour of this AXP .	4U 0142+614 appears to be relatively steady in flux between 2002 and 2004 , and the phase-averaged spectrum does not show any significant variability between the four epochs .
4	These objects display a wide range of properties since they are each at different points on evolutionary paths from ambient molecular cloud material to cold , contracting , and centrally concentrated configurations with significant molecular depletions and , in rare cases , enhancements .	Low-mass dense cores represent the state of molecular gas associated with the earliest phases of low-mass star formation .	Such cores are called `` protostellar '' or `` starless , '' depending on whether they do or do not contain compact sources of luminosity .	In this chapter , the first half of the review of low-mass dense cores , we describe the numerous inferences made about the nature of starless cores as a result of recent observations , since these reveal the initial conditions of star formation .	We focus on the identification of isolated starless cores and their internal physical and chemical properties , including morphologies , densities , temperatures , kinematics , and molecular abundances .
1	Our results show there may exist a non-trivial gapped spin liquid with time-reversal symmetry spontaneously breaking .	The spin 1 bilinear-biquadratic model on square lattice in the region $ 0 & lt ; \phi & lt ; \pi/4 $ is studied in a fermion representation with a p-wave pairing BCS type mean-field theory .	This exotic state manifests its topological nature by forming chiral states at the edges .	To show it more clear , we set up and solved a ribbon system .	We got a gapless dispersion representing the edge modes beneath the bulk modes .
3	However , for an interacting multiparticle circuit , the mutual electromagnetic interactions between particles can dominate the behavior so that the mass and charge of the individual particles becomes irrelevant ; the induced fields are then comparable to the inducing fields and energy goes into magnetic energy .	In this article , the self-inductance of a circular circuit is treated from an untraditional , particle-based point of view .	The electromagnetic fields of Faraday induction are calculated explicitly from the point-charge fields derived from the Darwin Lagrangian for particles confined to move in a circular orbit .	For a one-particle circuit ( or for N non-interacting particles ) , the induced electromagnetic fields depend upon the mass and charge of the current carriers while energy is transferred to the kinetic energy of the particle ( or particles ) .	In addition to providing a deeper understanding of self-inductance , the example suggests that the claims involving hidden mechanical momentum in connection with momentum balance for interacting multiparticle systems are unlikely to be accurate .
1	Topological surface states with up and down helical spin locking provide unique rectification in the flow of current , such as Klein tunneling and Veselago lensing .	A topological p-n junction ( TPNJ ) is an important concept to control spin and charge transport on a surface of three dimensional topological insulators ( 3D-TIs ) .	Although theoretical predictions have been reported on the p-n junction of 3D-TIs , intrinsic experimental observations on the electric transport arising from such intriguing p-n junction composed of spin helical Dirac fermions have not yet been made .	Here we report successful fabrication of such TPNJ on a surface of 3D-TI Bi $ _ { 2-x } $ Sb $ _x $ Te $ _ { 3-y } $ Se $ _y $ ( BSTS ) thin films and experimental observation of the electrical transport .	Tuning the chemical potential of n-type topological Dirac surface of BSTS in its top half by employing tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane ( F4-TCNQ ) as an acceptor molecule , the half surface can be converted to p-type with leaving the other half side as the opposite n-type , and consequently a TPNJ can be created .
0	In this work we present work in progress on functionality duplication detection in logic programs .	Eliminating duplicated functionality recently became prominent in context of refactoring .	We describe a quantitative approach that allows to measure the `` similarity '' between two predicate definitions .	Moreover , we show how to compute a so-called `` fingerprint '' for every predicate .	Fingerprints capture those characteristics of the predicate that are significant when searching for duplicated functionality .
1	These RLGs are divided into radio-loud ( RL ) active galactic nuclei ( AGNs ) , mainly occurring at redshifts of $ 0.05 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.3 $ and star-forming-dominated RLGs ( SFGs ) , mainly occurring at redshifts of $ 0.01 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.15 $ .	By combining the data of the Two Micron All Sky Survey , the \textit { Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer } and the \textit { AKARI } satellite , we study the infrared colour properties of a sample of 2712 nearby radio-luminous galaxies ( RLGs ) .	RL AGNs and SFGs are separately distributed in the ( [ 3.4 ] $ - $ [ 4.6 ] ) $ - $ ( [ 4.6 ] $ - $ [ 12 ] ) two-colour diagram , in which the RL AGNs display a double-core distribution , and the SFGs display a single-core distribution .	SFGs have a redder [ 4.6 ] $ - $ [ 12 ] colour than RL AGNs due to the significant contribution from the dust component of SFGs .	We find simple criteria of MIR colour separation between RL AGNs and SFGs such that : 95 $ \ % $ of RL AGNs have [ 4.6 ] $ - $ [ 12 ] $ & lt ; $ 3.0 and 94 $ \ % $ of SFGs have [ 4.6 ] $ - $ [ 12 ] $ & gt ; $ 3.0 .
2	This allows us to give some criteria ensuring existence of isoperimetric regions : for instance , local convexity of the cone at some boundary point .	We study the problem of existence of regions separating a given amount of volume with the least possible perimeter inside a Euclidean cone .	Our main result shows that nonexistence for a given volume implies that the isoperimetric profile of the cone coincides with the one of the half-space .	We also characterize which are the stable regions in a convex cone , i.e. , second order minima of perimeter under a volume constraint .	From this it follows that the isoperimetric regions in a convex cone are the euclidean balls centered at the vertex intersected with the cone .
3	It turns out that the energy conversion from gravitational to electromagnetic waves can be significantly altered due to the QED effects .	The interaction between gravitational and electromagnetic waves in the presence of a static magnetic field is studied .	The field strength of the static field is allowed to surpass the Schwinger critical field , such that the quantum electrodynamical ( QED ) effects of vacuum polarization and magnetization are significant .	Equations governing the interaction are derived and analyzed .	The consequences of our results are discussed .
0	Particle accelerators pushed the limits of our knowledge in search of the answers to most fundamental questions about micro-world and our Universe .	In these pursuits , accelerators progressed to higher and higher energies and particle beam intensities as well as increasingly smaller and smaller beam sizes .	As the result , modern existing and planned energy frontier accelerators demand very tight tolerances on alignment and stability of their elements : magnets , accelerating cavities , vacuum chambers , etc .	In this article we describe the instruments developed for and used in such accelerators as Fermilab 's Tevatron ( FNAL , Batavia , IL USA ) and for the studies toward an International Linear Collider ( ILC ) .	The instrumentation includes Hydrostatic Level Sensors ( HLS ) for very low frequency measurements .
2	Here our factorisation is completely independent from the derivation in Kyprianou ( 2015 ) , moreover there is no clear way to invert the factors in Kyprianou ( 2015 ) to derive our results .	Here we propose a different perspective of the deep factorisation in Kyprianou ( 2015 ) based on determining potentials .	Indeed , we factorise the inverse of the MAP-exponent associated to a stable process via the Lamperti-Kiu transform .	Our method gives direct access to the potential densities of the ascending and descending ladder MAP of the Lamperti-stable MAP in closed form .	In the spirit of the interplay between the classical Wiener-Hopf factorisation and fluctuation theory of the underlying Levy process , our analysis will produce a collection of of new results for stable processes .
0	We analyze the one-dimensional ( 1D ) and the two-dimensional ( 2D ) repulsive Hubbard models ( HM ) for densities slightly away from half-filling through the behavior of two central quantities of a system : the uniform charge and spin susceptibilities .	We point out that a consistent renormalization group treatment of them can only be achieved within a two-loop approach or beyond .	In the 1D HM , we show that this scheme reproduces correctly the metallic behavior given by the well-known Luttinger liquid fixed-point result .	Then , we use the same approach to deal with the more complicated 2D HM .	In this case , we are able to show that both uniform susceptibilities become suppressed for moderate interaction parameters as one take the system towards the Fermi surface .
1	If the Higgs mass is approximately 600 GeV or higher , there must be additional dynamics at a scale $ \Lambda $ which is less than a few TeV .	The one-Higgs-doublet standard model is necessarily incomplete because of the triviality of the scalar symmetry-breaking sector .	In this case the properties of the Higgs resonance can differ substantially from those predicted by the standard model .	In this letter we construct an effective Lagrangian description of a theory with a non-standard Higgs boson and analyze the features of a theory with such a resonance coupled to the Goldstone Bosons of the breaking of $ \su $ .	This Lagrangian describes the most general theory in which the Higgs and the Goldstone Bosons are the only particles with a mass small compared to $ \Lambda $ .
0	The emergence of the seeds of cosmic structure , from a perfect isotropic and homogeneous Universe , has not been clearly explained by the standard version of inflationary models as the dynamics involved preserve the homogeneity and isotropy at all times .	A proposal that attempts to deal with this problem , by introducing `` the self-induced collapse hypothesis , '' has been introduced by D. Sudarsky and collaborators in previous papers .	In all these works , the collapse of the wave function of the inflaton mode is restricted to occur during the inflationary period .	In this paper , we analyse the possibility that the collapse happens during the radiation era .	A viable model can be constructed under the condition that the inflaton field variable must be affected by the collapse while the momentum variable can or can not be affected .
3	In the known Einstein-Bohr controversy Einstein has been shown to be true .	The mathematical model of orthodox quantum mechanics has been critically examined and some deficiencies have been summarized .	The model based on the extended Hilbert space and free of these shortages has been proposed ; parameters being until now denoted as `` hidden '' have been involved .	Some earlier arguments against a hidden-variable theory have been shown to be false , too .	The extended model seems to be strongly supported also by the polarization experiments performed by us ten years ago .
3	For a large fraction of the relevant cosmological parameter space , the decay rate required to produce the observed dark matter abundance leads to displaced signals at LHC and future colliders , for any $ m_X $ in the range $ { \rm keV } & lt ; m_X & lt ; m_B $ and for values of $ m_B $ accessible to these colliders .	Dark matter , $ X $ , may be generated by new physics at the TeV scale during an early matter-dominated ( MD ) era that ends at temperature $ T_R \ll { \rm TeV } $ .	Compared to the conventional radiation-dominated ( RD ) results , yields from both Freeze-Out and Freeze-In processes are greatly suppressed by dilution from entropy production , making Freeze-Out less plausible while allowing successful Freeze-In with a much larger coupling strength .	Freeze-In is typically dominated by the decay of a particle $ B $ of the thermal bath , $ B \rightarrow X $ .	This result applies whether the early MD era arises after conventional inflation , when $ T_R $ is the usual reheat temperature , or is a generic MD era with an alternative origin .
4	In agreement with earlier studies , we find that the enriched material from supernovae is largely lost when the supernovae are concentrated near the nucleus , as expected for a starburst event .	We examine the efficiency with which supernova-enriched gas may be ejected from dwarf disk galaxies , using a methodology previously employed to study the self-enrichment efficiency of dwarf spheroidal systems .	Unlike previous studies that focused on highly concentrated starbursts , in the current work we consider discrete supernova events spread throughout various fractions of the disk .	We model disk systems having gas masses of 10^8 and 10^9 solar masses with supernova rates of 30 , 300 , and 3000 per Myr .	The supernova events are confined to the midplane of the disk , but distributed over radii of 0 , 30 , and 80 % of the disk radius , consistent with expectations for Type II supernovae .
3	It is shown that for an equation composed of one type of function there is a corresponding equation composed of functions of the other type .	The article presents mathematical generalization of results which originated as solutions of practical problems , in particular , the modeling of transitional processes in electrical circuits and problems of resource allocation .	However , the presented findings have broader meaning and can be used for approximation of transitional and other processes in different areas of science and technology .	We present discovered properties of sums of polynomial , power , and exponential functions of one variable .	The number of real solutions of such equations and the number of characteristic points of certain appropriate corresponding functions are closely related .
2	It is shown that the QFI for the amplitude parameter $ \alpha $ is invariant in the whole process , while the QFI for the phase parameter $ \phi $ strongly depends on the reservoir squeezing .	We study the the precision of parameter estimation for dephasing model under squeezed environment .	We analytically calculate the dephasing factor $ \gamma ( t ) $ and obtain the analytic quantum Fisher information ( QFI ) for the amplitude parameter $ \alpha $ and the phase parameter $ \phi $ .	It is shown that the QFI can be enhanced for appropriate squeeze parameters $ r $ and $ \theta $ .	Finally , we also investigate the effect of temperature on the QFI .
0	Broadcasting systems such as P2P streaming systems represent important network applications that support up to millions of online users .	An efficient broadcasting mechanism is at the core of the system design .	Despite substantial efforts on developing efficient broadcasting algorithms , the following important question remains open : How to achieve the maximum broadcast rate in a distributed manner with each user maintaining information queues only for its direct neighbors ?	In this work , we first derive an innovative formulation of the problem over acyclic overlay networks with arbitrary underlay capacity constraints .	Then , based on the formulation , we develop a distributed algorithm to achieve the maximum broadcast rate and every user only maintains one queue per-neighbor .
2	Our characterization extends earlier results by Gramchev et al . ( Proc.Amer.Math.Soc .	We obtain a characterization of $ { \mathcal S } ^ { \ { M_p\ } } _ { \ { M_p\ } } ( \mathbb R^n ) $ and $ \mathcal { S } ^ { ( M_p ) } _ { ( M_p ) } ( \mathbb { R } ^n ) $ , the general Gelfand-Shilov spaces of ultradifferentiable functions of Roumieu and Beurling type , in terms of decay estimates for the Fourier coefficients of their elements with respect to eigenfunction expansions associated to normal globally elliptic differential operators of Shubin type .	Moreover , we show that the eigenfunctions of such operators are absolute Schauder bases for these spaces of ultradifferentiable functions .	139 ( 2011 ) , 4361-4368 ) for Gevrey weight sequences .	It also generalizes to $ \mathbb { R } ^ { n } $ recent results by Dasgupta and Ruzhansky which were obtained in the setting of compact manifolds .
2	This involves managers making decisions on proper countermeasures to be implemented to mitigate the risks .	Risk is unavoidable in business and risk management is needed amongst others to set up good security policies .	Once the risks are evaluated , the next step is to decide how they should be treated .	The countermeasure expenditure , together with its ability to mitigate risks , is factors that affect the selection .	While many approaches have been proposed to perform risk analysis , there has been less focus on delivering the prescriptive and specific information that managers require to select cost-effective countermeasures .
3	First , we study the two-dimensional case , in particular we examine the effects of the relative phases of the different fragments and the removal rate of the optical potential on the vortex formation .	We study the formation of vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate ( BEC ) that has been prepared by allowing isolated and independent condensed fragments to merge together .	We focus on the experimental setup of Scherer { \it et al . } [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 98 } , 110402 ( 2007 ) ] , where three BECs are created in a magnetic trap that is segmented into three regions by a repulsive optical potential ; the BECs merge together as the optical potential is removed .	We find that many vortices are created by instant removal of the optical potential regardless of relative phases , and that fewer vortices are created if the intensity of the optical potential is gradually ramped down and the condensed fragments gradually merge .
3	We find the stellar luminosity function peaks at M_V = 12 and declines thereafter .	We present a study of M dwarfs discovered in a large area , multicolor survey .	We employ a combination of morphological and color criteria to select M dwarfs to a limiting magnitude in V of 22 , the deepest such ground-based survey for M dwarfs to date .	We solve for the vertical disk stellar density law and use the resulting parameters to derive the M dwarf luminosity and mass functions from this sample .	Our derived mass function for stars with M & lt ; 0.6 M_sun is inconsistent with a Salpeter function at the 3 sigma level ; instead , we find the mass function is relatively flat for 0.6 M_sun & gt ; M & gt ; 0.1 M_sun .
0	Understanding the dynamics of computer virus ( malware , worm ) in cyberspace is an important problem that has attracted a fair amount of attention .	Early investigations for this purpose adapted biological epidemic models , and thus inherited the so-called homogeneity assumption that each node is equally connected to others .	Later studies relaxed this often-unrealistic homogeneity assumption , but still focused on certain power-law networks .	Recently , researchers investigated epidemic models in { \em arbitrary } networks ( i.e. , no restrictions on network topology ) .	However , all these models only capture { \em push-based } infection , namely that an infectious node always actively attempts to infect its neighboring nodes .
4	Here we demonstrate that Kerr combs are suited for coherent data transmission with advanced modulation formats that pose stringent requirements on the spectral purity of the optical source .	Optical frequency combs enable coherent data transmission on hundreds of wavelength channels and have the potential to revolutionize terabit communications .	Generation of Kerr combs in nonlinear integrated microcavities represents a particularly promising option enabling line spacings of tens of GHz , compliant with wavelength-division multiplexing ( WDM ) grids .	However , Kerr combs may exhibit strong phase noise and multiplet spectral lines , and this has made high-speed data transmission impossible up to now .	Recent work has shown that systematic adjustment of pump conditions enables low phase-noise Kerr combs with singlet spectral lines .
0	A nonperturbative method to obtain on- and off-site one-particle Green 's function is introduced and applied to noninteracting Hubbard model with next nearest neighbor hopping and interacting Hubbard model in large dimensions , for example .	The former gives some lessons on the method and shows the advantage of the method compared with continued fraction formalism .	The latter is treated by selecting important dynamic processes contributing to the Green 's function when correlation is strong .	We consider the model in the Bethe lattice with large connectivity .	The dynamic processes describing on-site spin fluctuation clearly shows metal-insulator transition in the paramagnetic ground state at half filling .
0	We report on efforts to identify large samples of very and extremely metal-poor stars based on medium-resolution spectroscopy and ugriz photometry obtained during the course of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) , and its extension , SDSS-II , which includes the program SEGUE : Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration .	To date , over 8000 stars with [ Fe/H ] & lt ; = -2.0 and effective temperatures in the range 4500K & lt ; T_eff & lt ; 7000K have been found , with the expected numbers in this temperature range to be well over 10,000 once SEGUE is completed .	The numbers roughly double when one includes warmer blue stragglers and Blue Horizontal-Branch ( BHB ) stars in these counts .	We show the observed low-metallicity tails of the Metallicity Distribution Functions for the cooler SDSS/SEGUE stars obtained thus far .	We also comment on the confirmation of an inner/outer halo dichotomy in the Milky Way , and on how this realization may be used to direct searches for even more metal-poor stars in the near future .
3	We evaluate the SU ( 3 ) spin currents .	In a recent publication , we proposed two possible wave functions for the elementary excitations of the SU ( 3 ) Haldane -- Shastry model ( HSM ) , but argued on very general grounds that only one or the other can be a valid excitation .	Here we provide the explicit details of our calculation proving that the wave function describing a coloron excitation which transforms according to representation $ \bar { 3 } $ under SU ( 3 ) rotations if the spins of the original model transform according to representation 3 , is exact .	We further provide an explicit construction of the exact color-polarized two-coloron eigenstates , and thereby show that colorons are free but that their relative momentum spacings are shifted according to fractional statistics with parameter $ g=2/3 $ .	Finally , we interpret our results within the framework of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz and generalize some of them to the case of SU ( $ n $ ) .
2	The network consists of the museums participating in the program of Abbonamento Musei Torino Piemonte , which is a yearly subscription managed by the Associazione Torino Citt\`a Capitale Europea .	Probabilistic graphical models are a powerful tool to represent real-word phenomena and to learn network structures starting from data .	This paper applies graphical models in a new framework to study association rules driven by consumer choices in a network of museums .	Consumers are card-holders , who are allowed to entry to all the museums in the network for one year .	We employ graphical models to highlight associations among the museums driven by card-holder visiting behaviour .
4	Various operator bimodule structures are considered on a Banach bimodule admitting a normal such structure .	For an operator bimodule $ X $ over von Neumann algebras $ A\subseteq\bh $ and $ B\subseteq\bk $ , the space of all completely bounded $ A , B $ -bimodule maps from $ X $ into $ \bkh $ , is the bimodule dual of $ X $ .	Basic duality theory is developed with a particular attention to the Haagerup tensor product over von Neumann algebras .	To $ X $ a normal operator bimodule $ \nor { X } $ is associated so that completely bounded $ A , B $ -bimodule maps from $ X $ into normal operator bimodules factorize uniquely through $ \nor { X } $ .	A construction of $ \nor { X } $ in terms of biduals of $ X $ , $ A $ and $ B $ is presented .
4	In particular we study several combinations of the moments which are scale invariant at a critical point .	We investigate the behavior of the moments of the partially transposed reduced density matrix \rho^ { T_2 } _A in critical quantum spin chains .	Given subsystem A as union of two blocks , this is the ( matrix ) transposed of \rho_A with respect to the degrees of freedom of one of the two .	This is also the main ingredient for constructing the logarithmic negativity .	We provide a new numerical scheme for calculating efficiently all the moments of \rho_A^ { T_2 } using classical Monte Carlo simulations .
4	These results validate certain sequence design methods which can exponentially speed up computational design and greatly simplify experimental realizations .	Current theories of heteropolymers are inherently macrpscopic , but are applied to folding proteins which are only mesoscopic .	In these theories , one computes the averaged free energy over sequences , always assuming that it is self-averaging -- a property well-established only if a system with quenched disorder is macroscopic .	By enumerating the states and energies of compact 18 , 27 , and 36mers on a simplified lattice model with an ensemble of random sequences , we test the validity of the self-averaging approximation .	We find that fluctuations in the free energy between sequences are weak , and that self-averaging is a valid approximation at the length scale of real proteins .
2	Buckypapers showed an interesting linear dependence in the Fowler-Nordheim plots demonstrating their suitability as emitters .	Multiwalled carbon nanotubes have been produced by ethylene catalytic chemical vapor deposition and used to fabricate thick and dense freestanding films ( `` buckypapers '' ) by membrane filtering .	Field emission properties of buckypapers have been locally studied by means of high vacuum atomic force microscopy with a standard metallic cantilever used as anode to collect electrons emitted from the sample .	By precisely tuning the tip-sample distance in the submicron region we found out that the field enhancement factor is not affected by distance variations up to 2um .	Finally , the study of current stability showed that the field emission current with intensity of about 3,3*10-5A remains remarkably stable ( within 5 % fluctuations ) for several hours .
4	The effect of electron-electron interactions on the shot noise is more complicated .	We analyze current fluctuations in mesoscopic coherent conductors in the presence of electron-electron interactions .	In a wide range of parameters we obtain explicit universal dependencies of the current noise on temperature , voltage and frequency .	We demonstrate that Coulomb interaction decreases the Nyquist noise .	In this case the interaction correction to the noise spectrum is governed by the combination $ \sum_nT_n ( T_n-1 ) $ , where $ T_n $ is the transmission of the $ n $ -th conducting mode .
1	Matter in this scenario consists of baryonic matter and primordial black holes ( PBHs ) as the dark matter .	We propose a possible resolution to the cosmological constant problem through a scenario in which the universe is composed of three components : matter , radiation ( CMB ) and vacuum energy such that vacuum energy is not constant and is decaying into the matter component .	Local equilibrium condition between PBHs and CMB confines the mass and the radius of PBHs .	The mechanism accounting for the decaying process is nothing but the absorption of vacuum energy modes by the PBHs up to a wavelength of the order of their radius .	Acting as a natural cut-off on the wavelength of vacuum energy modes , this leads to the observed value for the vacuum energy density .
0	Mutually unbiased bases ( MUBs ) , which are such that the inner product between two vectors in different orthogonal bases is a constant equal to 1/sqrt { d ) , with d the dimension of the finite Hilbert space , are becoming more and more studied for applications such as quantum tomography and cryptography , and in relation to entangled states and to the Heisenberg-Weil group of quantum optics .	Complete sets of MUBs of cardinality d+1 have been derived for prime power dimensions d=p^m using the tools of abstract algebra .	Presumably , for non prime dimensions the cardinality is much less .	Here we reinterpret MUBs as quantum phase states , i.e.as eigenvectors of Hermitean phase operators generalizing those introduced by Pegg & amp ; Barnett in 1989 .	We relate MUB states to additive characters of Galois fields ( in odd characteristic p ) and to Galois rings ( in characteristic 2 ) .
3	Number of qubits in a quantum computer is approximately proportional to kn+2mn in the approach below .	Quantum computer versus quantum algorithm processor in CMOS are compared to find ( in parallel ) all Hamiltonian cycles in a graph with m edges and n vertices , each represented by k bits .	A quantum computer uses quantum states analogous to CMOS registers .	With efficient initialization , number of CMOS registers is proportional to ( n-1 ) !	Using CMOS , the bits per register is about proportional to kn , which is less since bits can be irreversibly reset .
0	We present techniques to characterize which data is important to a recommender system and which is not .	Important data is data that contributes most to the accuracy of the recommendation algorithm , while less important data contributes less to the accuracy or even decreases it .	Characterizing the importance of data has two potential direct benefits : ( 1 ) increased privacy and ( 2 ) reduced data management costs , including storage .	For privacy , we enable increased recommendation accuracy for comparable privacy levels using existing data obfuscation techniques .	For storage , our results indicate that we can achieve large reductions in recommendation data and yet maintain recommendation accuracy .
0	The efficiencies of the gratings in the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer ( HETGS ) were updated using in-flight observations of bright continuum sources .	The procedure first involved verifying that fluxes obtained from the +1 and -1 orders match , which checks that the contaminant model and the CCD quantum efficiencies agree .	Then the fluxes derived using the high energy gratings ( HEGs ) were compared to those derived from the medium energy gratings ( MEGs ) .	The flux ratio was fit to a low order polynomial , which was allocated to the MEGs above 1 keV or the HEGs below 1 keV .	The resultant efficiencies were tested by examining fits to blazar spectra .
1	While oxygen absorption features are not uncommon in the spectra of SNe Ia before maximum light , the presence of strong carbon absorption has been reported only in a minority of objects , typically during the pre-maximum phase .	One of the major differences between various explosion scenarios of Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia ) is the remaining amount of unburned ( C+O ) material and its velocity distribution within the expanding ejecta .	The reported low frequency of carbon detections may be due to low signal-to-noise data , low abundance of unburned material , line blending between C II 6580 and Si II 6355 , ejecta temperature differences , asymmetrical distribution effects , or a combination of these .	However , a survey of published pre-maximum spectra reveals that more SNe Ia than previously thought may exhibit C II 6580 absorption features and relics of line blending near 6300 Angstroms .	Here we present new SN Ia observations where spectroscopic signatures of C II 6580 are detected , and investigate the presence of C II 6580 in the optical spectra of 19 SNe Ia using the parameterized spectrum synthesis code , SYNOW .
0	The wireless network places vital role in the present day communication scenario .	The ad hoc nature of wireless communication adds flavour to suit various real world applications .	This improves the performance of the network tremendously while the clustering mechanism gets added to the ad hoc network .	It has been found out that the existing WCA lacks in forming efficient clusters .	Thus , this work proposes an Extended weighted partitioning around cluster head mechanism by considering W-PAC as a base to form clusters .
3	The bulk geometry is non-static , unlike most of the braneworld models in the literature .	A six dimensional standing-wave braneworld model has been constructed .	It consists in an anisotropic 4-brane generated by standing gravitational waves whose source is normal matter .	In this model the compact ( on-brane ) dimension is assumed to be sufficiently small in order to describe our universe ( hybrid compactification ) .	The principal feature of this model is the fact that the source is not a phantom like scalar field , as the original standing-wave model that was proposed in five dimensions and its six dimensional extension recently proposed in the literature .
3	The physics of vacua in which these symmetries are spontaneously broken precisely matches a dual gravity analysis involving resolutions of the singularity , where we are able to match condensates , Goldstone bosons and global strings .	In the first part of this thesis we study baryonic U ( 1 ) symmetries dual to Betti multiplets in the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence for M2 branes at Calabi-Yau 4-fold singularities .	We begin by focusing on isolated toric singularities without vanishing 6-cycles , which we classify , and propose for them field theory duals .	We then study in detail the cone over Q^111 and find agreement between the spectrum of baryonic operators in this theory and M5 branes wrapping 5-cycles in the Q^111 space .	We then study the implications of turning on a torsion 4-form flux .
4	These results reveal a significant electron dominance in the lobes .	An 80 ksec Chandra ACIS observation of the radio galaxy 3C 452 is reported .	A diffuse X-ray emission associated with the lobes has been detected with high statistical significance , together with the X-ray nucleus of the host galaxy .	The 0.5 -- 5 keV ACIS spectrum of the diffuse emission is described by a two-component model , consisting of a soft thermal plasma emission from the host galaxy halo and a hard non-thermal power-law component .	The hard component is ascribed to the inverse Comptonization of cosmic microwave background photons by the synchrotron emitting electrons in the lobes , because its spectral energy index , 0.68+-0.28 , is consistent with the radio synchrotron index , 0.78 .
3	In particular , we obtain a characterization of finite-dimensional solvable restricted Lie algebras in terms of the second Loewy layer of the projective cover of the trivial irreducible module .	In this paper we investigate the relation between the multiplicities of split strongly abelian p-chief factors of finite-dimensional restricted Lie algebras and first degree restricted cohomology .	As an application we obtain a characterization of solvable restricted Lie algebras in terms of the multiplicities of split strongly abelian p-chief factors .	Moreover , we derive some results in the representation theory of restricted Lie algebras related to the principal block and the projective cover of the trivial irreducible module of a finite-dimensional restricted Lie algebra .	The analogues of these results are well known in the modular representation theory of finite groups .
3	Accordingly to the scenario proposed in Astrophys.J.586 ( 2003 ) 1250 , the energy released in this conversion can power a Gamma Ray Burst .	We study the effects of color superconductivity on the structure and formation of compact stars .	We show that it is possible to satisfy most of recent observational boundaries on masses and radii if a diquark condensate forms in a hybrid or a quark star .	Moreover , we find that a huge amount of energy , of the order of $ 10^ { 53 } $ erg , can be released in the conversion from a ( metastable ) hadronic star into a ( stable ) hybrid or quark star , if the presence of a color superconducting phase is taken into account .	This mechanism can explain the recent observations indicating a delay , of the order of days or years , between a few Supernova explosions and the subsequent Gamma Ray Burst .
0	Since it is impossible to predict and identify all the vulnerabilities of a network , and penetration into a system by malicious intruders can not always be prevented , intrusion detection systems ( IDSs ) are essential entities for ensuring the security of a networked system .	To be effective in carrying out their functions , the IDSs need to be accurate , adaptive , and extensible .	Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days ' networks , the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task .	Although , an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment , distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g. , high rates of false positives , low detection efficiency etc .	In this paper , the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents .
2	It is proposed that these stripes make up the boundaries between the two degenerate anti-ferromagnetic ( AFM ) states , and that they are a key factor in switching between these states .	The role of the anti-bonding state in the electron correlations in Copper Oxide HTSC is analyzed .	Then the t-J Hamiltonian is used to establish the formation of the charge stripes in underdoped oxides .	We also provide a theoretical expression for the charge driven AFM magnons that have been observed by Neutron scattering experiments .	Finally , the double correlation theory is applied to the stripe phase of holes to result in the superconductive gap and in the `` pseudogap '' .
3	We detected an outburst two weeks after perihelion , with gas and dust production rates being multiplied by a factor five within a few days .	In this paper , we present a unique data set of more than one year 's worth of regular observations of comet C/2013 A1 ( Siding Spring ) with TRAPPIST in Chile , along with low-resolution spectra obtained with the ESO/VLT FORS 2 instrument .	The comet made a close approach to Mars on October 19 , 2014 and was then observed by many space and ground-based telescopes .	We followed the evolution of the OH , NH , CN , $ \mathrm { C_3 } $ , and $ \mathrm { C_2 } $ production rates as well as the $ Af\rho $ parameter as a proxy for the dust production .	By modelling the shape of the CN and $ \mathrm { C_2 } $ radial profiles , we determined that the outburst happened around on November 10 around 15:30 UT ( $ \pm $ 5h ) and measured a gas ejection velocity of $ 1.1\pm0.2 $ km/s .
3	The model is the diffusion equation for sediment transport on hillslopes and channels with the local diffusivity proportional to the square of the discharge .	The power spectrum S of linear transects of the earth 's topography is often observed to be a power-law function of wave number k with exponent close to -2 : S ( k ) is proportional to k^-2 .	In addition , river networks are fractal trees that satisfy many power-law or fractal relationships between their morphologic components .	A model equation for the evolution of the earth 's topography by erosional processes which produces fractal topography and fractal river networks is presented and its solutions compared in detail to real topography .	The dependence of diffusivity on discharge follows from fundamental equations of sediment transport .
1	The P-for-As substitution results in shrinkage of lattice , especially for the FeAs block layers .	We report bulk superconductivity induced by an isovalent doping of phosphorus in BaFe $ _ { 2 } $ ( As $ _ { 1-x } $ P $ _ { x } $ ) $ _ { 2 } $ .	The resistivity anomaly associated with the spin-density-wave ( SDW ) transition in the undoped compound is gradually suppressed by the P doping .	Superconductivity with the maximum $ T_c $ of 30 K emerges at $ x $ =0.32 , coinciding with a magnetic quantum critical point ( QCP ) which is evidenced by the disappearance of SDW order and the linear temperature-dependent resistivity in the normal state .	The $ T_c $ values were found to decrease with further P doping , and no superconductivity was observed down to 2 K for $ x\geq $ 0.77 .
1	The cluster centered on the BL Lac works as a strong gravitational lens , forming a large arc around itself .	The BL Lac object RGB 1745+398 lies in an environment that makes it possible to study the cluster around it more deeply than the environments of other BL Lac objects .	The aim of this paper is to study the environment and characteristics of this object more accurately than the environments of other BL Lac objects have been before.We measured the redshifts of galaxies in the cluster from the absorption lines in their spectra .	The velocity dispersion was then obtained from the redshifts .	The gravitational lensing was used for measuring the mass at the center of the cluster .
0	The SPring-8 control system provides data acquisition software called Poller/Collector for periodic data taking .	Its polling scheme does not support taking data synchronized with an event , and simultaneity in the data from the different VME systems is not guaranteed .	Recently , requirement for fast and event-driven data acquisition has increased , and the synchronization of a set of data from the different VME systems is requested .	We added new data-taking software to the standard framework with a shared memory network .	We designed the software on the VME by updating the original framework that was already used for feedback control .
3	Recently , Hsiao et al .	Current low-latency anonymity systems use complex overlay networks to conceal a user 's IP address , introducing significant latency and network efficiency penalties compared to normal Internet usage .	Rather than obfuscating network identity through higher level protocols , we propose a more direct solution : a routing protocol that allows communication without exposing network identity , providing a strong foundation for Internet privacy , while allowing identity to be defined in those higher level protocols where it adds value .	Given current research initiatives advocating `` clean slate '' Internet designs , an opportunity exists to design an internetwork layer routing protocol that decouples identity from network location and thereby simplifies the anonymity problem .	proposed such a protocol ( LAP ) , but it does not protect the user against a local eavesdropper or an untrusted ISP , which will not be acceptable for many users .
0	In this paper , we report results for the wave packet dynamics in a class of quasiperiodic chains consisting of two types of weakly coupled clusters .	The dynamics are studied by means of the return probability and the mean square displacement .	The wave packets show anomalous diffusion in a stepwise process of fast expansion followed by time intervals of confined wave packet width .	Applying perturbation theory , where the coupling parameter v is treated as perturbation , the properties of the eigenstates of the system are investigated and related to the structure of the chains .	The results show the appearance of non-localized states only in sufficiently high orders of the perturbation expansions .
1	We consider several examples including diffractive processes , elastic and inclusive over the target degrees of freedom , scattering with fixed total transverse momentum transfer and inclusive gluon production .	We develop the formalizm for calculating semi inclusive observables at high energy in the JIMWLK/KLWMIJ approach .	We discuss evolution of these observables with respect to various rapidity variables involved in their definitions ( total rapidity , rapidity gap , width of diffractive interval etc . ) .	We also discuss the dipole model limit of these observables and derive closed simple ( as opposed to functional ) differential equations in this approximation .	We point out that there are some interesting differences between the full JIMWLK/KLWMIJ evolution and the dipole model evolution of diffractive cross section .
3	Spitzer Space Telescope observations of thermal emission at 24 and 70 microns are combined with visible photometry to constrain the system 's effective radius ( 109 +10/-11 km ) and geometric albedo ( 0.084 +0.021/-0.014 ) .	Hubble Space Telescope observations of Uranus- and Neptune-crossing object ( 65489 ) Ceto/Phorcys ( provisionally designated 2003 FX128 ) reveal it to be a close binary system .	The mutual orbit has a period of 9.554 +/- 0.011 days and a semimajor axis of 1840 +/- 48 km .	These values enable computation of a system mass of ( 5.41 +/- 0.42 ) 10^18 kg .	We estimate the average bulk density to be 1.37 +0.66/-0.32 g cm^-3 , consistent with ice plus rocky and/or carbonaceous materials .
4	We employ a residual-permutation method to assess the impact of correlated noise on the depth difference between the z and g bands and calculate the significance of the color dependence at 3.2 { \sigma } .	We present simultaneous multi-color optical photometry using ULTRACAM of the transiting exoplanet KIC 12557548 b ( also known as KIC 1255 b ) .	This reveals , for the first time , the color dependence of the transit depth .	Our g and z transits are similar in shape to the average Kepler short-cadence profile , and constitute the highest-quality extant coverage of individual transits .	Our Night 1 transit depths are 0.85 +/- 0.04 % in z ; 1.00 +/- 0.03 % in g ; and 1.1 +/- 0.3 % in u .
1	This analysis is based on high-resolution ( R ~ 47000 ) spectra obtained with the UVES @ VLT spectrograph .	This paper presents the chemical abundance analysis of a sample of 27 red giant stars located in 4 popolous intermediate-age globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud , namely NGC 1651 , 1783 , 1978 and 2173 .	For each cluster we derived up to 20 abundance ratios sampling the main chemical elemental groups , namely light odd-Z , alpha , iron-peak and neutron-capture elements .	All the analysed abundance patterns behave similarly in the 4 clusters and also show negligible star-to-star scatter within each cluster .	We find [ Fe/H ] =-0.30+-0.03 , -0.35+-0.02 , -0.38+-0.02 and -0.51+-0.03 dex for NGC 1651 , 1783 , 1978 and 2173 , respectively .
4	While for each individual object we can not discriminate between these alternatives , we conclude that most of the objects actually contain an older component because the star formation rates inferred from the picture based on reddening , applied to all candidates , would imply an exceedingly high star formation rate , i.e.more than two orders of magnitude above the peak cosmic star formation rate ( e.g.Lilly et al.1996 ) .	We have carried out a search for Lyman alpha emission from galaxies at z~=2.4 over a field of 1200 sq .	arcmin using the CFH12K camera at the CFHT and a custom medium band filter .	The search has uncovered 58 candidates , corresponding to a completeness-corrected source density of ~0.07 sq.arcmin^-2 .	Our sources have red colors ( B-I~=1.8 ) which imply either that a large fraction of the light is highly reddened and we are detecting Lyman alpha through special lines of sight , or that these objects contain an underlying older stellar population .
0	The steep rise in availability and usage of high-throughput technologies in biology brought with it a clear need for methods to control the False Discovery Rate ( FDR ) in multiple tests .	Benjamini and Hochberg ( BH ) introduced in 1995 a simple procedure and proved that it provided a bound on the expected value , $ \mathit { FDR } \leq q $ .	Since then , many authors tried to improve the BH bound , with one approach being designing adaptive procedures , which aim at estimating the number of true null hypothesis in order to get a better FDR bound .	Our two main rigorous results are the following : ( i ) a theorem that provides a bound on the FDR for adaptive procedures that use any estimator for the number of true hypotheses ( $ m_0 $ ) , ( ii ) a theorem that proves a monotonicity property of general BH-like procedures , both for the case where the hypotheses are independent .	We also propose two improved procedures for which we prove FDR control for the independent case , and demonstrate their advantages over several available bounds , on simulated data and on a large number of gene expression data sets .
0	We explore two fundamental questions at the intersection of sampling theory and information theory : how channel capacity is affected by sampling below the channel 's Nyquist rate , and what sub-Nyquist sampling strategy should be employed to maximize capacity .	In particular , we derive the capacity of sampled analog channels for three prevalent sampling strategies : sampling with filtering , sampling with filter banks , and sampling with modulation and filter banks .	These sampling mechanisms subsume most nonuniform sampling techniques applied in practice .	Our analyses illuminate interesting connections between under-sampled channels and multiple-input multiple-output channels .	The optimal sampling structures are shown to extract out the frequencies with the highest SNR from each aliased frequency set , while suppressing aliasing and out-of-band noise .
3	We confirm the existence of a critical chiral state in the middle of the energy band and calculate the critical exponent nu=0.35 +/- 0.03 for the divergence of the localization length .	The zero temperature transport properties of two-dimensional lattice systems with static random magnetic flux per plaquette and zero mean are investigated numerically .	We study the two-terminal conductance and its dependence on energy , sample size , and magnetic flux strength .	The influence of boundary conditions and of the oddness of the number of sites in the transverse direction is also studied .	The sample averaged scale independent critical conductance & lt ; g & gt ; _c turns out to be a function of the amplitude of the flux fluctuations whereas the variance of the respective conductance distributions appears to be universal .
3	A significant velocity gradient is found along an axis highly discrepant with the major axis of the X-ray elongation .	We report the results of spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of 8 different ASCA pointings distributed symmetrically around the center of the Perseus cluster .	The outer region of the intracluster gas is roughly isothermal , with temperature ~6-7 keV , and metal abundance ~ 0.3 Solar .	Spectral analysis of the central pointing is consistent with the presence of a cooling flow and a central metal abundance gradient .	The radial velocity difference is found to be greater than 1000 km/sMpc at the 90 % confidence level .
3	The spectroscopic data and SDSS/UKIDSS photometry are supplemented by mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer .	Quasi-stellar objects ( QSOs ) whose spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) are reddened by dust either in their host galaxies or in intervening absorber galaxies are to a large degree missed by optical color selection criteria like the one used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) .	To overcome this bias against red QSOs , we employ a combined optical and near-infrared color selection .	In this paper , we present a spectroscopic follow-up campaign of a sample of red candidate QSOs which were selected from the SDSS and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey ( UKIDSS ) .	In our sample of 159 candidates , 154 ( 97 % ) are confirmed to be QSOs .
4	In this note , we provide a compact derivation of super cosmic variance , survey recent results , and show how experimental limits on nongaussianity help to rule it out .	If cosmological perturbations in our Hubble sized volume are nongaussian , then they will be coupled to any larger perturbation modes outside our Hubble volume .	This has important consequences for modeling inflation : the scalar power spectrum and spectral index measured in our Hubble volume would depend on an adjacent background of super Hubble perturbations .	In other words , a detection of nongaussianity implies a possible portal to the superhorizon .	By the same token , ruling out nongaussianity would rule out the possibility that the power spectrum 's size and running are accidents of super cosmic variance .
1	Initial observations of the HST Ultra Deep Field ( UDF ) have yielded multiple z & gt ; ~7 dropout candidates .	The installation of the Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) on the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) will revolutionize the study of high-redshift galaxy populations .	Supplemented by the Great Observatory Origins Deep Survey ( GOODS ) Early Release Science ( ERS ) and further UDF pointings , these data will provide crucial information about the most distant known galaxies .	However , achieving tight constraints on the z~7 galaxy luminosity function ( LF ) will require even more ambitious photometric surveys .	Using a Fisher matrix approach to fully account for Poisson and cosmic sample variance , as well as covariances in the data , we estimate the uncertainties on LF parameters achieved by surveys of a given area and depth .
2	The spin domain can be used to construct a model in which spin 1 and spin1/2 particles coexist .	We show that the triple product defined by the spin domain ( Bounded Symmetric Domain of type 4 in Cartan 's classification ) is closely related to the geometric product in Clifford algebras .	We present the properties of this tri-product and compare it with the geometric product .	Using the geometric tri-product , we develop the geometry of this domain .	We present a geometric spectral theorem for this domain and obtain both spin 1 and spin 1/2 representations of the Lorentz group on this domain .
1	Pulsar B is seen in almost all orbital phases , except in the range of $ \sim 6\deg $ to $ 65\deg $ .	We describe the morphological and fluctuation properties of the pulsars in the double neutron star system , PSR J0737 -- 3039 .	This may be interpreted as an { \it eclipse } of pulsar B 's signal by its own magnetopause region produced by interaction with pulsar A 's relativistic wind .	No modulation of the emission of pulsar B is found at the period of pulsar A .	This places a constraint on the models that propose that pulsar A 's beamed radiation is directly responsible for pulsar B 's emission .
0	Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning perform poorly in the early stages of learning in noisy environments , because much effort is spent on unlearning biased estimates of the state-action function .	The bias comes from selecting , among several noisy estimates , the apparent optimum , which may actually be suboptimal .	We propose G-learning , a new off-policy learning algorithm that regularizes the noise in the space of optimal actions by penalizing deterministic policies at the beginning of the learning .	Moreover , it enables naturally incorporating prior distributions over optimal actions when available .	The stochastic nature of G-learning also makes it more cost-effective than Q-learning in noiseless but exploration-risky domains .
4	The astrophysical uncertainties are expected to be dramatically reduced by the data upcoming from AMS-02 , so that the nuclear uncertainties will likely represent the most serious limitation on the reliability of the model predictions .	Observations of light isotopes in cosmic rays provide valuable information on their origin and propagation in the Galaxy .	Using the data collected by the AMS-01 experiment in the range ~0.2-1.5 GeV/nucleon , we compare the measurements on 1H , 2H , 3He , and 4He with calculations for interstellar propagation and solar modulation .	These data are described well by a diffusive-reacceleration model with parameters that match the B/C ratio data , indicating that He and heavier nuclei such as C-N-O experience similar propagation histories .	Close comparisons are made within the astrophysical constraints provided by the B/C ratio data and within the nuclear uncertainties arising from errors in the production cross-section data .
3	To obtain the presented results , we have suggested a simplified approach that permits to incorporate the effect of fullerenes polarizability into the Neon and Argon endohedrals polarization potential .	We have demonstrated that the polarization of the fullerene shell considerably alters the polarization potential of an atom , stuffed inside a fullerene .	This essentially affects the electron elastic scattering phases as well as corresponding cross-sections .	We illustrate the general trend by concrete examples of electron scattering by endohedrals of Neon and Argon .	As a result , we obtained numeric results that show strong variations in shape and magnitudes of scattering phases and cross-sections due to effect of fullerene polarization upon the endohedral polarization potential .
2	The channel polarization is found to be universal in many signal processing problems and has been applied to the coded modulation schemes .	The polar codes are proven to be capacity-achieving and are shown to have equivalent or even better finite-length performance than the turbo/LDPC codes under some improved decoding algorithms over the additive white Gaussian noise ( AWGN ) channels .	Polar coding is based on the so-called channel polarization phenomenon induced by a transform over the underlying binary-input channel .	In this paper , the channel polarization is further extended to the multiple antenna transmission following a multilevel coding principle .	The multiple-input multile-output ( MIMO ) channel under quadrature amplitude modulation ( QAM ) are transformed into a series of synthesized binary-input channels under a three-stage channel transform .
2	To evaluate the proposed method , we manually constructed a gold standard where for each ( word , definition ) pair and given the set of synonyms defined for that word by the 5 synonym dictionaries , 4 lexicographers specified the set of synonyms they judge adequate .	We present a method for grouping the synonyms of a lemma according to its dictionary senses .	The senses are defined by a large machine readable dictionary for French , the TLFi ( Tr\'esor de la langue fran\c { c } aise informatis\'e ) and the synonyms are given by 5 synonym dictionaries ( also for French ) .	While inter-annotator agreement ranges on that task from 67 % to at best 88 % depending on the annotator pair and on the synonym dictionary being considered , the automatic procedure we propose scores a precision of 67 % and a recall of 71 % .	The proposed method is compared with related work namely , word sense disambiguation , synonym lexicon acquisition and WordNet construction .
0	We present the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey ( SERVS ) , an 18 square degrees medium-deep survey at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with the post-cryogenic Spitzer Space Telescope to ~2 microJy ( AB=23.1 ) depth of five highly observed astronomical fields ( ELAIS-N1 , ELAIS-S1 , Lockman Hole , Chandra Deep Field South and XMM-LSS ) .	SERVS is designed to enable the study of galaxy evolution as a function of environment from z~5 to the present day , and is the first extragalactic survey both large enough and deep enough to put rare objects such as luminous quasars and galaxy clusters at z & gt ; 1 into their cosmological context .	SERVS is designed to overlap with several key surveys at optical , near- through far-infrared , submillimeter and radio wavelengths to provide an unprecedented view of the formation and evolution of massive galaxies .	In this paper , we discuss the SERVS survey design , the data processing flow from image reduction and mosaicing to catalogs , as well as coverage of ancillary data from other surveys in the SERVS fields .	We also highlight a variety of early science results from the survey .
2	This scheme benefits from a novel scheduler design which takes into account the cooperation level of each node , reimburses the extra energy consumptions of group representatives , and maximizes the network lifetime .	In this paper , energy-efficient scheduling for grouped machine-type devices deployed in cellular networks is investigated .	We introduce a scheduling-based cooperation incentive scheme which enables machine nodes to organize themselves locally , create machine groups , and communicate through group representatives to the base station .	As reusing cellular uplink resources for communications inside the groups degrades the Quality of Service ( QoS ) of the primary users , analytical results are provided which present a tradeoff between maximum allowable number of simultaneously active machine groups in a given cell and QoS of the primary users .	Furthermore , we extend our derived solutions for the existing cellular networks , propose a cooperation-incentive LTE scheduler , and present our simulation results in the context of LTE .
2	It is confirmed that the polarization amplitude $ & lt ; \phi^ { 2 } & gt ; _ { H } $ is free from any divergence due to the infinite red-shift effect .	We study vacuum polarization of quantized massive scalar fields $ \phi $ in equilibrium at black-hole temperature in Reissner-Nordstr\ '' { o } m background .	By means of the Euclidean space Green 's function we analytically derive the renormalized expression $ & lt ; \phi^ { 2 } & gt ; _ { H } $ at the event horizon with the area $ 4\pi r_ { + } ^ { 2 } $ .	Our main purpose is to clarify the dependence of $ & lt ; \phi^ { 2 } & gt ; _ { H } $ on field mass $ m $ in relation to the excitation mechanism .	It is shown for small-mass fields with $ mr_ { + } \ll1 $ how the excitation of $ & lt ; \phi^ { 2 } & gt ; _ { H } $ caused by finite black-hole temperature is suppressed as $ m $ increases , and it is verified for very massive fields with $ mr_ { + } \gg1 $ that $ & lt ; \phi^ { 2 } & gt ; _ { H } $ decreases in proportion to $ m^ { -2 } $ with the amplitude equal to the DeWitt-Schwinger approximation .
3	This indicates that the large masses of gas typically hosted in SMGs have already been highly enriched with metals and dust .	We use deep observations taken with the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer ( PACS ) , on board the Herschel satellite as part of the PACS evolutionary probe ( PEP ) guaranteed project along with submm ground-based observations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimeter galaxies ( SMGs ) .	We investigate their dust content relative to their stellar and gas masses , and compare them with local star-forming galaxies .	High-z SMGs are dust rich , i.e.they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared to local spiral galaxies ( by a factor of 30 ) and also compared to local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ULIRGs , by a factor of 6 ) .	Indeed , for those SMGs whose gas mass is measured , we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals and ULIRGs .
0	Grid computing consists of the coordinated use of large sets of diverse , geographically distributed resources for high performance computation .	Effective monitoring of these computing resources is extremely important to allow efficient use on the Grid .	The large number of heterogeneous computing entities available in Grids makes the task challenging .	In this work , we describe a Grid monitoring system , called GridMonitor , that captures and makes available the most important information from a large computing facility .	The Grid monitoring system consists of four tiers : local monitoring , archiving , publishing and harnessing .
4	A section of the paper concerns compositions of the form $ N_\alpha ( \tau_k^\nu ) $ , $ \nu \in ( 0,1 ] $ , where $ \tau_k^\nu $ is the inverse of the fractional Poisson process , and we show how these compositions can be represented as random sums .	In this paper we consider the relation between random sums and compositions of different processes .	In particular , for independent Poisson processes $ N_\alpha ( t ) $ , $ N_\beta ( t ) $ , $ t & gt ; 0 $ , we show that $ N_\alpha ( N_\beta ( t ) ) \overset { \text { d } } { = } \sum_ { j=1 } ^ { N_\beta ( t ) } X_j $ , where the $ X_j $ s are Poisson random variables .	We present a series of similar cases , the most general of which is the one in which the outer process is Poisson and the inner one is a nonlinear fractional birth process .	We highlight generalisations of these results where the external process is infinitely divisible .
3	By decoupling the quantization error from the measurement noise , the quantization error is modeled as a random variable and estimated jointly with the signal being recovered .	Compressed sensing ( CS ) is on recovery of high dimensional signals from their low dimensional linear measurements under a sparsity prior and digital quantization of the measurement data is inevitable in practical implementation of CS algorithms .	In the existing literature , the quantization error is modeled typically as additive noise and the multi-bit and 1-bit quantized CS problems are dealt with separately using different treatments and procedures .	In this paper , a novel variational Bayesian inference based CS algorithm is presented , which unifies the multi- and 1-bit CS processing and is applicable to various cases of noiseless/noisy environment and unsaturated/saturated quantizer .	Such a novel characterization of the quantization error results in superior performance of the algorithm which is demonstrated by extensive simulations in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for both multi-bit and 1-bit CS problems .
3	We derive a simple relation between the momentum of a string and its density of particles , E , which is reminiscent of a dispersion relation , E=k^2 .	The Abelian Sandpile generates complex and beautiful patterns and seems to display allometry .	On the plane , beyond patches , patterns periodic in both dimensions , we remark the presence of structures periodic in one dimension , that we call strings .	We classify completely their constituents in terms of their principal periodic vector k , that we call momentum .	Strings interact : they can merge and split and within these processes momentum is conserved .
0	A laser can be understood as thermodynamic engine converting heat to a coherent single mode field close to Carnot efficiency .	From this perspective spectral shaping of the excitation light generates a higher effective temperature on the pump than on the gain transition .	Here , using a toy model of a quantum well structure with two suitably designed tunnel-coupled wells kept at different temperature , we study a laser operated on an actual spatial temperature gradient between pump and gain region .	We predict gain and narrow band laser emission for a sufficient temperature gradient and resonator quality .	Lasing appears concurrent with amplified heat flow and points to a new form of stimulated solid state cooling .
3	Through comparison with simulations , we demonstrate that all barium-enhanced populations are best represented by a ~100 % binary fraction with a shorter period distribution of at maximum ~20,000 days .	A substantial fraction of the lowest metallicity stars show very high enhancements in carbon .	It is debated whether these enhancements reflect the stars ' birth composition , or if their atmospheres were subsequently polluted , most likely by accretion from an AGB binary companion .	Here we investigate and compare the binary properties of three carbon-enhanced sub-classes : The metal-poor CEMP-s stars that are additionally enhanced in barium ; the higher metallicity ( sg ) CH- and Ba II stars also enhanced in barium ; and the metal-poor CEMP-no stars , not enhanced in barium .	This result greatly strengthens the hypothesis that a similar binary mass transfer origin is responsible for their chemical patterns .
4	Specially , in the case of $ f=1 $ , the results for warped product in \cite { Balmus-mont } are obtained .	In this paper biharmonic maps between doubly warped product manifolds are studied .	We show that the inclusion maps of Riemannian manifolds $ B $ and $ F $ into the doubly warped product $ _ { f } B\times_ { b } F $ can not be proper biharmonic maps .	Also we analyze the conditions for the biharmonicity of projections $ _ { f } B\times_ { b } F\to B $ and $ _ { f } B\times_ { b } F\to F $ , respectively .	Some characterizations for non-harmonic biharmonic maps are given by using product of harmonic maps and warping metric .
3	By summing over all low-lying levels , the partition functions are obtained explicitly .	The Bethe ansatz equation is solved to obtain analytically the leading finite-size correction of the spectra of the asymmetric XXZ chain and the accompanying isotropic 6-vertex model near the antiferromagnetic phase boundary at zero vertical field .	The energy gaps scale with size $ N $ as $ N^ { -1/2 } $ and its amplitudes are obtained in terms of level-dependent scaling functions .	Exactly on the phase boundary , the amplitudes are proportional to a sum of square-root of integers and an anomaly term .	Similar analysis is performed also at the phase boundary of zero horizontal field in which case the energy gaps scale as $ N^ { -2 } $ .
3	For short posts , as the drop loses volume , its curvature increases allowing it to touch the surface below the posts .	We investigate the transition between the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states of a slowly evaporating , micron-scale drop on a superhydrophobic surface .	In two dimensions analytical results show that there are two collapse mechanisms .	For long posts the drop collapses when it is able to overcome the free energy barrier presented by the hydrophobic posts .	We emphasise the importance of the contact line retreating across the surface as the drop becomes smaller : this often preempts the collapse .
2	Surprisingly , we show that there are ( topologically embedded ) smooth suborbifolds which do not arise as the image of a smooth orbifold embedding .	The purpose of this article is to investigate the relationship between suborbifolds and orbifold embeddings .	In particular , we give natural definitions of the notion of suborbifold and orbifold embedding and provide many examples .	We are also able to characterize those suborbifolds which can arise as the images of orbifold embeddings .	As an application , we show that a length-minimizing curve ( a geodesic segment ) in a Riemannian orbifold can always be realized as the image of an orbifold embedding .
4	In this paper we consider cooperative systems , i.e.systems with positive feedback interconnections among all variables , which in a continuous setting guarantees a very stable dynamics .	Boolean networks have been the object of much attention , especially since S. Kauffman proposed them in the 1960 's as models for gene regulatory networks .	These systems are characterized by being defined on a Boolean state space and by simultaneous updating at discrete time steps .	Of particular importance for biological applications are networks in which the indegree for each variable is bounded by a fixed constant , as was stressed by Kauffman in his original papers .	An important question is which conditions on the network topology can rule out exponentially long periodic orbits in the system .
2	[ 1 ] , it is possible to obtain a unified result for the one-loop correction to the Euclidean effective action in 2+1 dimensions .	In this work , we mainly study the one-loop effective action for real scalar theories in non-homogeneous backgrounds in odd dimensions .	It is shown that through the method studied in Ref .	Our result simplifies into the ones given in the literature calculated via different techniques based on some assumptions of field and its derivative .	The one-loop correction is obtained in ( 2n+1 ) -dimensional Euclidean space-times , as well .
4	Here we use the Van-Kampen method to compute the fundamental group of the complement from a braid monodromy factorization and some extra properties of the factorization , namely invariant properties , also proven in IV .	Computation of the fundamental group of the complement in the complex plane of the branch curve S , of a generic projection of the Veronese surface to the plane is presented .	This paper is a continuation of our previous papers : Braid Group Technique I - IV .	In I and II we developed algorithms to compute braid monodromy of a brunch curve , provided there exist a degeneration of the surface to union of planes in a configuration where the associated branch curve is partial to a line arrangement dual to generic .	In III we constructed a degeneration of the Veronese surface of order 3 to union of planes with the desired property and in IV we used I -III to compute the braid monodromy of the associated branch curve .
3	These equations are generated by the superspace action when it is expressed in terms of prepotentials .	We present an alternative method of exploring the component structure of an integer super-helicity Y=s ( for any integers ) irreducible representation of the Super-Poincare group .	We use it to derive the component action and the SUSY transformation laws .	The effectiveness of this approach is based on the equations of motion and their properties , like Bianchi identities .	For that reason we reproduce the superspace action for integer superspin , using unconstrained superfields .
4	Also we investigate stability of the system and find that the thermodynamical stability exists .	In this paper we study thermodynamics , statistics and spectroscopic aspects of a charged black hole with a scalar hair coupled to the gravity in ( 2+1 ) dimensions .	We obtained effects of the black hole charge and scalar field on the thermodynamical and statistical quantities .	We find that scalar charge may increase entropy , temperature and probability , while may decrease black hole mass , free and internal energy .	Also electric charge increases probability and decreases temperature and internal energy .
0	We present a set of 26 finite quandles that distinguish ( up to reversal and mirror image ) by number of colorings , all of the 2977 prime oriented knots with up to 12 crossings .	We also show that 1058 of these knots can be distinguished from their mirror images by the number of colorings by quandles from a certain set of 23 finite quandles .	We study the colorings of these 2977 knots by all of the 431 connected quandles of order at most 35 found by L. Vendramin .	Among other things , we collect information about quandles that have the same number of colorings for all of the 2977 knots .	For example , we prove that if $ Q $ is a simple quandle of prime power order then $ Q $ and the dual quandle $ Q^* $ of $ Q $ have the same number of colorings for all knots and conjecture that this holds for all Alexander quandles $ Q $ .
1	Such an invariance is useful in photography but is unique to perspective projection .	In perspective cameras , images of a frontal-parallel 3D object preserve its aspect ratio invariant to its depth .	In this paper , we show that alternative non-perspective cameras such as the crossed-slit or XSlit cameras exhibit a different depth-dependent aspect ratio ( DDAR ) property that can be used to 3D recovery .	We first conduct a comprehensive analysis to characterize DDAR , infer object depth from its AR , and model recoverable depth range , sensitivity , and error .	We show that repeated shape patterns in real Manhattan World scenes can be used for 3D reconstruction using a single XSlit image .
1	We consider stochastic processes in the sense of generalized convolution or weak generalized convolution following the idea given in [ 1 ] .	The paper deals with a new class of random walks strictly connected with the Pareto distribution .	The processes are Markov processes in the usual sense .	Their structure is similar to perpetuity or autoregressive model .	We prove theorem , which describes the magnitude of the fluctuations of random walks generated by generalized convolutions .
1	Dust is detected in 31 out of 64 galaxies , although the sample is biased against the detection of dust .	The dust properties of all early-type galaxies imaged with the Planetary Camera of the HST in cycles I-III are examined .	From the distribution of observed axis ratios of the dust features it is inferred that 78 \pm 16 % of early-type galaxies contain nuclear dust .	From the dependence of the angle between dust major axis and galaxy major axis on size and appearance of the dust , it is found that dust features with semi-major axis size a_d & gt ; 250 pc are generally not settled .	If it is assumed that dust lanes with a_d & lt ; 250 pc are in equilibrium in the galaxy potential , the observed distribution of misalignment angles can only be explained if elliptical galaxies have a mean triaxiality & lt ; T & gt ; & gt ; = 0.4 .
2	We present and analyze a dynamic Multiple-Message Broadcast protocol that works under an affectance model , which parameterizes the interference that other nodes introduce in the communication between a given pair of nodes .	We study a dynamic version of the Multiple-Message Broadcast problem , where packets are continuously injected in network nodes for dissemination throughout the network .	Our performance metric is the ratio of the throughput of such protocol against the optimal one , for any sufficiently long period of time since startup .	As an algorithmic tool , we develop an efficient algorithm to schedule a broadcast along a BFS tree under the affectance model .	To provide a rigorous and accurate analysis , we define two novel network characteristics based on the network topology and the affectance function .
4	Furthermore , the capacity-achieving conditional input distributions in these two cases are the same .	For a discrete memoryless channel with non-causal state information available only at the encoder , it is well-known that Gelfand-Pinsker coding achieves its capacity .	In this paper , we analyze Gelfand-Pinsker coding scheme and capacity to bring out further understandings .	We show that Gelfand-Pinsker capacity is equal to the interference-free capacity .	Thus the capacity of a channel with non-causal state information available only at the encoder is the same as if the state information is also available at the decoder .
4	Thus our main goal is to derive results on the existence ( or non-existence ) of syllogistic proof systems for relational fragments .	The Aristotelian syllogistic can not account for the validity of many inferences involving relational facts .	In this paper , we investigate the prospects for providing a relational syllogistic .	We identify several fragments based on ( a ) whether negation is permitted on all nouns , including those in the subject of a sentence ; and ( b ) whether the subject noun phrase may contain a relative clause .	The logics we present are extensions of the classical syllogistic , and we pay special attention to the question of whether reductio ad absurdum is needed .
3	In addition , a hybridization gap is opened in the surface states when the thickness of film is reduced to the two-dimensional limit .	The surface of a topological crystalline insulator ( TCI ) carries an even number of Dirac cones protected by crystalline symmetry .	We epitaxially grew high quality Pb $ _ { 1-x } $ Sn $ _x $ Te ( 111 ) films and investigated the TCI phase by in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy .	Pb $ _ { 1-x } $ Sn $ _x $ Te ( 111 ) films undergo a topological phase transition from trivial insulator to TCI via increasing the Sn/Pb ratio , accompanied by a crossover from n-type to p-type doping .	The work demonstrates an approach to manipulating the topological properties of TCI , which is of importance for future fundamental research and applications based on TCI .
1	We include Coulomb interactions , a dilute density of charged impurities and the presence of a magnetic field to describe both the static and the low frequency response as a function of temperature T and chemical potential mu .	We study the thermal and electric transport of a fluid of interacting Dirac fermions as they arise in single-layer graphene .	In the critical regime mu & lt ; & lt ; T where both bands above and below the Dirac point contribute to transport we find pronounced deviations from Fermi liquid behavior , universal , collision-dominated values for transport coefficients and a cyclotron resonance of collective nature .	In the collision-dominated high temperature regime the linear thermoelectric transport coefficients are shown to obey the constraints of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics which we derive microscopically from Boltzmann theory .	The latter also allows us to describe the crossover to disorder-dominated Fermi liquid behavior at large doping and low temperatures , as well as the crossover to the ballistic regime at high fields .
0	After recalling several constructions of the moduli space of curves of genus zero by different people we give our alternative construction of the moduli space .	This gives a simple description of the intersection ring of this space .	We give a basis for the Chow groups and an explicit duality between the Chow groups in complementary degrees .	There is a recursive description of this algebra by S. Keel .	Our presentation is simpler in the sense that there are fewer generators and fewer relations and our description is explicit .
3	It is shown that if the dynamical variable used in the first apparatus is represented by an operator of the Weyl-Wigner type ( for example , if it is a linear coordinate ) , then the conversion from quantum to classical terminology does not affect the final result .	A measuring apparatus is described by quantum mechanics while it interacts with the quantum system under observation , and then it must be given a classical description so that the result of the measurement appears as objective reality .	Alternatively , the apparatus may always be treated by quantum mechanics , and be measured by a second apparatus which has such a dual description .	This article examines whether these two different descriptions are mutually consistent .	However , if the first apparatus encodes the measurement in a different type of operator ( e.g. , the phase operator ) , the two methods of calculation may give different results .
0	Parity and time reversal are obvious and plausible candidates for fundamental symmetries of nature .	Hypothesising that these symmetries exist implies the existence of a new form of matter , called mirror matter .	The mirror matter theory ( or exact parity model ) makes four main predictions : 1 ) Dark matter in the form of mirror matter should exist in the Universe ( i.e.mirror galaxies , stars , planets , meteoroids ... ) , 2 ) Maximal ordinary neutrino - mirror neutrino oscillations if neutrinos have mass , 3 ) Orthopositronium should have a shorter effective lifetime than predicted by QED ( in `` vacuum '' experiments ) because of the effects of photon-mirror photon mixing and 4 ) Higgs production and decay rate should be 50 % lower than in the standard model due to Higgs mirror - Higgs mixing ( assuming that the seperation of the Higgs masses is larger than their decay widths ) .	At the present time there is strong experimental/observational evidence supporting the first three of these predictions , while the fourth one is not tested yet because the Higgs boson , predicted in the standard model of particle physics , is yet to be found .	This experimental/observational evidence is rich and varied ranging from the atmospheric and solar neutrino deficits , MACHO gravitational microlensing events , strange properties of extra-solar planets , the existence of `` isolated '' planets , orthopositronium lifetime anomaly , Tunguska and other strange `` meteor '' events including perhaps , the origin of the moon .
4	Remarkably , their result is the same as that obtained previously by Vainshtein in the field-theoretic framework .	I discuss aspects of the QCD sum rule method which attracted theorists ' attention in earnest at a relatively late stage and are not yet fully solved .	At first I briefly review such general topics as the structure of the operator product expansion in QCD and intrinsic limitations of the quark-hadron duality concept .	In the second part I comment on holographic constructions - a focus of the current efforts to say something new on QCD at strong coupling .	Of particular interest to me is the recent derivation of the vacuum magnetic susceptibility due to Son and Yamamoto .
2	We highlight the $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca $ ( 0^+ , 0 ) $ $ \to $ $ ^ { 40 } $ K $ ( 0^- , 2626 ) $ axial charge transition and its sensitivity to the induced pseudoscalar coupling $ g_p $ of the proton 's weak interaction .	We report results from shell model studies of muon capture on $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca to low-lying levels of $ ^ { 40 } $ K .	We discuss the comparison between calculated capture rates , measured capture rates and analogous transitions in ( $ e $ , $ e^ { \prime } $ ) scattering in terms of the particle-hole structure of the $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca- $ ^ { 40 } $ K nuclei .	In addition , we address the hindrance of unique first-forbidden transitions due to particle-hole interactions and the emergence of allowed Gamow-Teller transitions due to ground state correlations .	Lastly , we examine the longitudinal alignment of $ ^ { 40 } $ K recoils following muon capture , and discuss this possibility for independently determining the induced coupling $ g_p $ .
3	In this way , dynamical evolution of the system in the strong coupling regime is intimately tied with the coupling of an atom with a single resonant or non-resonant mode within the cavity .	Since the photon box gedanken experiments of several of the founding fathers of modern physics , considerable progress has been made in differentiating the quantum and classical worlds .	In this pursuit , the cavity as an open quantum system has been indispensable .	From the quantization of the atom and field within a superconducting cavity , a unique realm of EPR type entanglement has emerged .	More specifically , the cavity can be prepared so that the atom is detected in a desired state .
2	For adjoint sources both the Y-shaped and triangular configurations may realize .	Gauge invariant extended configurations are considered for the three fundamental ( quarks ) or adjoint ( gluons ) particles .	For quarks it is shown that the Y-shaped configuration is the only possible .	The corresponding static potentials are calculated in the Method of Field Correlators and in the case of baryon shown to be consistent with the lattice simulations .	For adjoint sources the potentials of Y-shaped and Delta-shaped configurations turn out to be close to each other , which leads to almost degenerate masses of 3 -- 3g glueballs and odderon trajectories .
2	The shape of the marbles was described as a prolate spheroid .	Liquid marbles , which are droplets coated with a hydrophobic powder , were exposed to a uniform electric field .	It was established that a threshold value of the electric field , 15 cgse , should be surmounted for deformation of liquid marbles .	The semi-quantitative theory describing deformation of liquid marbles in a uniform electric field is presented .	The scaling law relating the radius of the contact area of the marble to the applied electric field shows a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data .
2	We also analyze the spectral properties of classical amplitudes of the plane waves -- the eigenmodes of the time averaged one -- particle density matrix .	A classical fields approximation to the finite temperature microcanonical thermodynamics of weakly interacting Bose gas is applied to the idealized case of atoms confined in a box with periodic boundary conditions .	We analyze in some detail the microcanonical temperature in the model .	Looking at the zero momentum component -- the order parameter of the condensate , we obtain the nonperturbative results for the chemical potential .	Analogous analysis of the other modes yields nonperturbative temperature dependent Bogoliubov frequencies and their damping rates .
0	This paper discusses the potential of graphics processing units ( GPUs ) in high-dimensional optimization problems .	A single GPU card with hundreds of arithmetic cores can be inserted in a personal computer and dramatically accelerates many statistical algorithms .	To exploit these devices fully , optimization algorithms should reduce to multiple parallel tasks , each accessing a limited amount of data .	These criteria favor EM and MM algorithms that separate parameters and data .	To a lesser extent block relaxation and coordinate descent and ascent also qualify .
0	We exhibit a fundamental relationship between measures of dynamical and structural stability of equilibriums , arising from real dynamical systems .	We show that dynamical stability , quantified via systems local response to external perturbations , coincides with the minimal internal perturbation able to destabilize the equilibrium .	First , by reformulating a result of control theory , we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral sensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium , with respect to constant changes of its coefficients .	However , for this equivalence to hold , imaginary changes of the Jacobian 's coefficients have to be allowed .	The connection with dynamical stability is thus lost for real dynamical systems .
4	Electrostatic trapping of metastable NH followed by optical pumping of the trapped molecules to the electronic ground state is an important step towards accumulation of these radicals in a magnetic trap .	We report on the Stark deceleration and electrostatic trapping of $ ^ { 14 } $ NH ( $ a ^1\Delta $ ) radicals .	In the trap , the molecules are excited on the spin-forbidden $ A ^3\Pi \leftarrow a ^1\Delta $ transition and detected via their subsequent fluorescence to the $ X ^3\Sigma^- $ ground state .	The 1/e trapping time is 1.4 $ \pm $ 0.1 s , from which a lower limit of 2.7 s for the radiative lifetime of the $ a ^1\Delta , v=0 , J=2 $ state is deduced .	The spectral profile of the molecules in the trapping field is measured to probe their spatial distribution .
4	Many of the extended jet regions display exceedingly high fractional polarizations ( & gt ; 50 % ) and electric vectors aligned with the jet ridge line , consistent with optically thin emission from transverse shocks .	We present first-epoch , milliarcsecond-scale linear polarization images at 15 GHz of 133 jets associated with AGN in the MOJAVE survey ( Monitoring of Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei with VLBA Experiments ) .	The sample consists of all known AGN with galactic latitude |b| & gt ; 2.5 deg. , J2000 declination & gt ; -20 deg. , and 15 GHz VLBA flux density exceeding 1.5 Jy ( 2 Jy for sources with declination & lt ; 0 ) at any epoch during the period 1994-2003 .	Because of strong selection effects , the sample primarily consists of blazars with parsec-scale morphologies consisting of a bright core component at the extreme end of a one-sided jet .	At least one third of the compact cores are completely unresolved on the longest VLBA baselines , indicating brightness temperatures above 10^ { 11 } K. The unresolved cores tend to have electric vectors that are aligned with the inner jet direction , suggesting the presence of a stationary transverse shock near the base of the jet .
0	We investigate bridging and aggregation of two colloidal particles in a near-critical binary mixture when the fluid far from the particles is outside the coexistence ( CX ) curve and is rich in the component disfavored by the colloid surfaces .	In such situations , the adsorption-induced interaction is enhanced , leading to bridging and aggregation of the particles .	We realize bridging firstly by changing the temperature with a fixed interparticle separation and secondly by letting the two particles aggregate .	The interparticle attractive force dramatically increases upon bridging .	The dynamics is governed by hydrodynamic flow around the colloid surfaces .
3	Taken independently , trends and geography have been discussed in recent literature on online social media ; although , so far , little has been done to characterize the relation between trends and geography .	Trending topics are the online conversations that grab collective attention on social media .	They are continually changing and often reflect exogenous events that happen in the real world .	Trends are localized in space and time as they are driven by activity in specific geographic areas that act as sources of traffic and information flow .	Here we investigate more than eleven thousand topics that trended on Twitter in 63 main US locations during a period of 50 days in 2013 .
4	Employing binary geometry to scale the model and assuming companion star reflection , we are able to reconstruct the incident X-rays which are removed from our direct line-of-sight ( presumably by the accretion disk ) .	We present RXTE observations of the eclipsing X-ray binary Hercules X-1 conducted during an anomalous low state .	Data reduction reveals a light curve over 2.7 orbital cycles remarkably similar to optical and UV light curves which are dominated by the companion star .	Count rates are modulated close to the orbital period , attaining a maximum when the inner face of the companion star , irradiated by X-rays from the compact source , is most-visible .	Cold reflection provides an acceptable fit to the energy spectrum .
3	We also propose a simple numerical algorithm for finding a finite computational range of an improper integral term in the PIDE so that the accuracy of approximation of the integral can be improved .	The aim of this chapter is to show how option prices in jump-diffusion models can be computed using meshless methods based on Radial Basis Function ( RBF ) interpolation .	The RBF technique is demonstrated by solving the partial integro-differential equation ( PIDE ) in one-dimension for the American put and the European vanilla call/put options on dividend-paying stocks in the Merton and Kou jump-diffusion models .	The radial basis function we select is the Cubic Spline .	Moreover , the solution functions of the PIDE are approximated explicitly by RBFs which have exact forms so we can easily compute the global integral by any kind of numerical quadrature .
3	Hence an interacting thermal vacuum is a necessary component of the exact real-time formalism .	Analytic continuation of quantum statistical physics from imaginary to real time is analyzed .	Adiabatic vanishing of interactions at real time infinities gives origin to singularities at complex times .	This undermines the hypothesis of decoupling of interactions at $ t \rightarrow \infty $ .	Consequences for Thermo-field dynamics are discussed .
4	We use Chezaro means of the partial sums for study of summability problems .	Solution of some boundary value problems and initial problems in unique ball leads to the convergence and sumability problems of Fourier series of given function by eigenfunctions of Laplace operator on a sphere - spherical harmonics .	Such a series are called as Fourier-Laplace series on sphere .	There are a number of works devoted investigation of these expansions in different topologies and for the functions from the various functional spaces .	In the present work we consider only localization problems in both usual and generalized ( almost everywhere localization ) senses in the classes of summable functions .
4	In the presence of such interaction we analyze quantum correlation functions of individual qubits $ C_i ( t ) $ to obtain two collective quantum-mechanical coherent oscillations , characterized by frequencies $ \omega_1=\bar { \Delta } /\hbar $ and $ \omega_2=\tilde { \omega } _R $ , where $ \tilde { \omega } _R $ is the resonant frequency of the cavity renormalized by interaction .	We report a theoretical study of coherent collective quantum dynamic effects in an array of N qubits ( two-level systems ) incorporated into a low-dissipation resonant cavity .	Individual qubits are characterized by energy level differences $ \Delta_i $ and we take into account a spread of parameters $ \Delta_i $ .	Non-interacting qubits display coherent quantum beatings with N different frequencies , i.e. $ \omega_i=\Delta_i/\hbar $ .	Virtual emission and absorption of cavity photons provides a long-range interaction between qubits .
2	However , there are also many kinds of amplitudes which will have boundary terms .	Up until now , the BCFW technique has been a widely used method in getting the amplitudes in various theories .	Usually , the vanishing of the boundary term is necessary for the efficiency of the method .	Hence it will be nice if it is possible to get the boundary terms in an efficient manner .	As is well-known , in gauge theory the Ward identity imposes constraints on the form of the amplitude .
1	An angular bin signal based Cerenkov light component subtraction method and a shower maximum fitting method using a local parabolic function are used to correct and normalize the data .	The average extensive air shower longitudinal development profile as a function of shower age in the energy range from 10 $ ^ { 17 } $ to 10 $ ^ { 18 } $ eV is measured using data from the hybrid HiRes/MIA experiment .	The Gaisser-Hillas and Greisen functions work equally well for describing the shower profile .	The Gaussian function is a poor fit .	A simple scale-free function is proposed and fits the data equally well .
0	A team of players plays the following game .	After a strategy session , each player is randomly fitted with a blue or red hat .	Then , without further communication , everybody can try to guess simultaneously his or her own hat color by looking at the hat colors of other players .	Visibility is defined by a directed graph ; that is , vertices correspond to players , and a player can see each player to whom she or he is connected by an arc .	The team wins if at least one player guesses his hat color correctly , and no one guesses his hat color wrong ; otherwise the team loses .
3	This is done in three qualitatively distinct manners : The first set of solution generating theorems apply in Schwarzschild curvature coordinates , and are phrased in terms of the metric components : they show how to transform one static spherical perfect fluid spacetime geometry into another .	In this thesis four separate problems in general relativity are considered , divided into two separate themes : coordinate conditions and perfect fluid spheres .	Regarding coordinate conditions we present a pedagogical discussion of how the appropriate use of coordinate conditions can lead to simplifications in the form of the spacetime curvature -- such tricks are often helpful when seeking specific exact solutions of the Einstein equations .	Regarding perfect fluid spheres we present several methods of transforming any given perfect fluid sphere into a possibly new perfect fluid sphere .	A second set of solution generating theorems extends these ideas to other coordinate systems ( such as isotropic , Gaussian polar , Buchdahl , Synge , and exponential coordinates ) , again working directly in terms of the metric components .
0	Applications involving dictionary learning , non-negative matrix factorization , subspace clustering , and parallel factor tensor decomposition tasks motivate well algorithms for per-block-convex and non-smooth optimization problems .	By leveraging the stochastic approximation paradigm and first-order acceleration schemes , this paper develops an online and modular learning algorithm for a large class of non-convex data models , where convexity is manifested only per-block of variables whenever the rest of them are held fixed .	The advocated algorithm incurs computational complexity that scales linearly with the number of unknowns .	Under minimal assumptions on the cost functions of the composite optimization task , without bounding constraints on the optimization variables , or any explicit information on bounds of Lipschitz coefficients , the expected cost evaluated online at the resultant iterates is provably convergent with quadratic rate to an accumulation point of the ( per-block ) minima , while subgradients of the expected cost asymptotically vanish in the mean-squared sense .	The merits of the general approach are demonstrated in two online learning setups : ( i ) Robust linear regression using a sparsity-cognizant total least-squares criterion ; and ( ii ) semi-supervised dictionary learning for network-wide link load tracking and imputation with missing entries .
4	Further we propose an analytical application of this master wave equation to the stability problem by means of the normal mode analysis for the perturbations having the time dependence given by $ \exp { ( i\omega\log|t| ) } $ , and present some sufficient conditions for the absence of non-oscillatory unstable normal modes with purely imaginary $ \omega $ .	Stability of self-similar solutions for gravitational collapse is an important problem to be investigated from the perspectives of their nature as an attractor , critical phenomena and instability of a naked singularity .	In this paper we study spherically symmetric non-self-similar perturbations of matter and metrics in spherically symmetric self-similar backgrounds .	The collapsing matter is assumed to be a perfect fluid with the equation of state $ P=\alpha\rho $ .	We construct a single wave equation governing the perturbations , which makes their time evolution in arbitrary self-similar backgrounds analytically tractable .
4	The line list has been used to identify individual water lines in a variety of objects including : comets , sunspots , a brown dwarf and the nova-like object V838 Mon .	A computed list of H $ _ { 2 } $ $ ^ { 16 } $ O infra-red transition frequencies and intensities is presented .	The list , BT2 , was produced using a discrete variable representation two-step approach for solving the rotation-vibration nuclear motions .	It is the most complete water line list in existence , comprising over 500 million transitions ( 65 % more than any other list ) and it is also the most accurate ( over 90 % of all known experimental energy levels are within 0.3 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ of the BT2 values ) .	Its accuracy has been confirmed by extensive testing against astronomical and laboratory data .
4	Among other things , our results give additional motivation for an all-out effort to measure CMB polarization .	The increasing precision of cosmological datasets is opening up new opportunities to test predictions from cosmic inflation .	Here we study the impact of high precision constraints on the primordial power spectrum and show how a new generation of observations can provide impressive new tests of the slow-roll inflation paradigm , as well as produce significant discriminating power among different slow-roll models .	In particular , we consider next-generation measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) temperature anisotropies and ( especially ) polarization , as well as new Lyman- $ \alpha $ measurements that could become practical in the near future .	We emphasize relationships between the slope of the power spectrum and its first derivative that are nearly universal among existing slow-roll inflationary models , and show how these relationships can be tested on several scales with new observations .
0	We consider the problems of identifying and estimating dynamical parameters of an ergodic quantum Markov chain , when only the stationary output is accessible for measurements .	On the identifiability question , we show that the knowledge of the output state completely fixes the dynamics up to a `coordinate transformation ' consisting of a multiplication by a phase and a unitary conjugation of the Kraus operators .	When the dynamics depends on an unknown parameter , we show that the latter can be estimated at the `standard ' rate $ n^ { -1/2 } $ , and give an explicit expression of the ( asymptotic ) quantum Fisher information of the output , which is proportional to the Markov variance of a certain `generator ' .	More generally , we show that the output is locally asymptotically normal , i.e.it can be approximated by a simple quantum Gaussian model consisting of a coherent state whose mean is related to the unknown parameter .	As a consistency check we prove that a parameter related to the `coordinate transformation ' unitaries , has zero quantum Fisher information .
3	We also show that the difference between the bar fraction distributions as a function of galaxy luminosity ( and mass ) in the field and Coma cluster are statistically significant , with Virgo being an intermediate case .	The effects that interactions produce on galaxy disks and how they modify the subsequent formation of bars need to be distinguished to fully understand the relationship between bars and environment .	To this aim we derive the bar fraction in three different environments ranging from the field to Virgo and Coma clusters , covering an unprecedentedly large range of galaxy luminosities ( or , equivalently , stellar masses ) .	We confirm that the fraction of barred galaxies strongly depends on galaxy luminosity .	The fraction of barred galaxies shows a maximum of about 50 % at $ M_r\ , \simeq\ , -20.5 $ in clusters , whereas the peak is shifted to $ M_r\ , \simeq\ , -19 $ in the field .
2	Nuclear power in stars governs their lifetimes and of course the stellar nucleosynthesis .	The force that governs the evolution of stars is gravity .	Indeed this force drives star formation , imposes thermal and density gradients into stars at hydrostatic equilibrium and finally plays the key role in the last phases of their evolution .	The nuclear reactions are at the heart of the changes of composition of the baryonic matter in the Universe .	This change of composition , in its turn , has profound consequences on the evolution of stars and galaxies .
4	These classes differ primarily by whether the behavior of the two-particle S matrix at low momenta is diagonal or corresponds to pure reflection .	We propose an approach to the problem of low but finite temperature dynamical correlation functions in integrable one-dimensional models with a spectral gap .	The approach is based on the analysis of the leading singularities of the operator matrix elements and is not model specific .	We discuss only models with well defined asymptotic states .	For such models the long time , large distance asymptotics of the correlation functions fall into two universality classes .
3	We show that in generic competitive percolation processes , including those displaying explosive percolation , single links do not induce a discontinuous gap in the largest cluster size in the thermodynamic limit .	How a complex network is connected crucially impacts its dynamics and function .	Percolation , the transition to extensive connectedness upon gradual addition of links , was long believed to be continuous but recent numerical evidence on `` explosive percolation '' suggests that it might as well be discontinuous if links compete for addition .	Here we analyze the microscopic mechanisms underlying discontinuous percolation processes and reveal a strong impact of single link additions .	Nevertheless , our results highlight that for large finite systems single links may still induce observable gaps because gap sizes scale weakly algebraically with system size .
3	Power consumption requirements of the sensor nodes may turn some of these applications impractical .	Recent advances in wireless body area sensor net- works leverage wireless and mobile communication technologies to facilitate development of innovative medical applications that can significantly enhance healthcare services and improve quality of life .	Specifically , Electroencephalography ( EEG ) -based applications lie at the heart of these promising technologies .	However , the design and operation of such applications is challenging .	Hence , implementing efficient encoding schemes are essential to reduce power consumption in such applications .
3	Conceptually the diference between the InHZ and the Abiotic HZ ( AHZ ) depends on unique and robust properties of life as an emergent physical phenomenon and not necesarily on the particular life forms bearing in the planet .	In this paper we discuss and illustrate the hypothesis that life substantially alters the state of a planetary environment and therefore , modifies the limits of the HZ as estimated for an uninhabited planet .	This hypothesis lead to the introduction of the Habitable Zone for Inhabited planets ( hereafter InHZ ) , defined here as the region where the complex interaction between life and its abiotic environment is able to produce plausible equilibrium states with the necessary physical conditions for the existence and persistence of life itself .	We support our hypothesis of an InHZ with three theoretical arguments , multiple evidences coming from observations of the Earth system , several conceptual experiments and illustrative numerical simulations .	Our aim here is to provide conceptual basis for the development of InHZ models incorporating consistently life-environment interactions .
1	The toric version of this result , translated to the realm of convex geometry , thus confirms Ehrhart 's volume conjecture for a large class of rational polytopes , including duals of lattice polytopes .	We show that the complex projective space has maximal degree ( volume ) among all n-dimensional Kahler-Einstein Fano manifolds admitting a holomorphic C^*-action with a finite number of fixed points .	The case of spherical varieties/multiplicity free symplectic manifolds is also discussed .	The proof uses Moser-Trudinger type inequalities for Stein domains and also leads to criticality results for mean field type equations in C^n of independent interest .	The paper supersedes our previous preprint concerning the case of toric Fano manifolds .
2	The PG3 SRVs form a sequence ( period-luminosity & amp ; period-colour ) with the PG3 Miras , in which the SRVs are the short period extension to the Miras .	Near-infrared photometry ( JHKL 'M ) was obtained for 78 semiregular variables ( SRVs ) in field # 3 of the Palomar-Groningen survey ( PG3 , l=0 , b=-10 ) .	Together with a sample of Miras in this field a comparison is made with a sample of field SRVs and Miras .	The field and PG3 Miras follow the same P/ ( J -- K ) o relation , while this is not the case for the field and PG3 SRVs .	Both the PG3 SRVs and Miras follow the SgrI period-luminosity relation adopted from Glass et al .
2	Dipole layers naturally occur on the interior surfaces of certain nanopores , leading to intrinsic preference for cations or anions .	The permeation , rejection , and transport of electrolytes in water-filled nanopores are critical to ion current gating and desalinalion processes in synthetic porous membranes and the functions of biological ion channels .	Mile the effects of confinement pore polarizability , and discrete channel charge sites have been much studied , the potentially dramatic impact of dipole-lined synthetic pores on electrolytes has seldom been addressed .	This preference can be exploited when the membrane surface is functionalized differently from the pore interior or when there are alternating dipolar/nondipolar stretches inside a long pore .	The dipole-ion interaction is asymptotically unscreened by water , leading to ionic , charge segregated , insulating behavior that can block ion transport , and potentially novel current-voltage ( I-V ) characteristics .
3	Cooling gas explanations are plausible but excessively complicated , and the 450/850 micron ratio rules out a significant fraction of the signal arising from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich increment .	We have used the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array ( SCUBA ) detector on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope ( JCMT ) to measure bright sub-mm emission associated with a recently discovered extensive ( & gt ; 100/h kpc ) and highly luminous , `blob ' of Ly-alpha emission at z=3.09 .	The blob lies within a known large overdensity of optical sources in the z=3.07-3.11 range , and is centered on a locally overdense peak within this region .	The best explanation for the copious sub-mm emission is a dust obscured continuum source , which may produce the ionizing flux for the Ly-alpha cloud .	At least two additional ~10 mJy sub-mm detections in the SCUBA map , with a surface density significantly higher than in blank field surveys , suggests that they may be associated with the z=3.09 structure .
4	We find a wide range of interest and distinguish stories primarily of interest to a users ' friends from those of interest to the entire user community .	Online social media provide multiple ways to find interesting content .	One important method is highlighting content recommended by user 's friends .	We examine this process on one such site , the news aggregator Digg .	With a stochastic model of user behavior , we distinguish the effects of the content visibility and interestingness to users .
0	In a recent Letter , Hassan and S\'en\'echal [ 1 ] discussed the existence of a spin-liquid phase of the half-filled Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice .	Using schemes , such as the variational cluster approximation ( VCA ) and the cluster dynamical mean field theory ( CDMFT ) in combination with exact diagonalization ( ED ) , they argued that a single bath orbital per site of the six-atom unit cell is insufficient and leads to the erroneous conclusion that the system is gapped for all nonzero values of the onsite Coulomb interaction $ U $ .	In contrast , we point out here that , in the case of the honeycomb lattice , six bath levels per six-site unit cell are perfectly adequate for the description of short-range correlations .	Instead , we demonstrate that it is the violation of long-range translation symmetry inherent in CDMFT-like schemes which opens a gap at Dirac points .	The gap found at small $ U $ therefore does not correspond to a Mott gap .
2	The results are further employed to establish the dependence of the plasmon frequency on the number of cluster components .	Some properties of small and medium sodium clusters are described within the RPA approach using a projected spherical single particle basis .	The oscillator strengths calculated with a Schiff-like dipole transition operator and folded with Lorentzian functions are used to calculate the photoabsorbtion cross section spectra .	Static electric polarizabilities of the clusters excited in a RPA dipole state are also calculated .	Comparison of our results with the corresponding experimental data show an overall good agreement .
4	The system provides 240GIPS with each core consuming 71 -- 193mW , dependent on workload .	We present Swallow , a scalable many-core architecture , with a current configuration of 480 x 32-bit processors .	Swallow is an open-source architecture , designed from the ground up to deliver scalable increases in usable computational power to allow experimentation with many-core applications and the operating systems that support them .	Scalability is enabled by the creation of a tile-able system with a low-latency interconnect , featuring an attractive communication-to-computation ratio and the use of a distributed memory configuration .	We analyse the energy and computational and communication performances of Swallow .
1	For any isotopy class of closed curves $ \gamma $ , we compute the first three derivatives of the length function $ \ell\_\gamma : \mathcal { T } ( S ) \rightarrow\mathbf { R } \_+ $ in the shearing coordinates associated to a maximal geodesic lamination $ \lambda $ .	Let $ S $ be a closed oriented surface of genus at least $ 2 $ , and denote by $ \mathcal { T } ( S ) $ its Teichm { \ '' u } ller space .	We show that if $ \gamma $ intersects every leaf of $ \lambda $ , then the Hessian of $ \ell\_\gamma $ is positive-definite .	We extend this result to length functions of measured laminations .	We also provide a method to compute higher derivatives of length functions of geodesics .
2	We find that gluino -- squark corrections to down -- type quark masses induce large NLO corrections to the dominant Wilson coefficients whose size is often similar to those at LO , especially at large $ \tan\beta $ .	We examine the process $ B \to X_s \gamma $ in minimal supersymmetry ( SUSY ) with general squark flavor mixings .	We include all relevant next -- to -- leading order ( NLO ) QCD corrections and dominant NLO SUSY effects from the gluino .	For $ \mu & gt ; 0 $ , destructive interference , and suppression by the renormalization group running lead to a `` focusing effect '' of reducing the size of gluino corrections to the branching ratio , and also of reducing the LO sensitivity to flavor mixings among squarks .	Constraints from $ B ( B \to X_s \gamma ) $ on the SUSY -- breaking scale can become significantly weakened relative to the minimal flavor violation case , even , at large $ \tan\beta $ , for small flavor mixings .
0	At observations of galaxy clusters luminosity L , size R , mass M , temperature T $ _e $ , sometimes velocities are usually measured .	These four quantities and the gravity constant G are determined by three measurements units : mass M , length L and time T. Therefore one can form two non-dimensional similarity criteria : $ \Pi_1 $ and $ \Pi_2 $ .	Any chosen observable can be formed as a function of the other three ones .	The author has at hand the data by Vikhlinin ( 2002 ) and Vikhlinin et al .	( 2006 ) , rather more complete than any other .
0	We present a multiwavelength analysis of the nebula around the candidate luminous blue variable G79.29+0.46 .	The study is based on our radio observations performed at the Expanded Very Large Array and at the Green Bank Telescope and on archival infrared datasets , including recent images obtained by the Herschel Space Observatory .	We confirm that the radio central object is characterized by a stellar wind and derive a current mass-loss rate of about 1.4x10-6 Msun yr-1 .	We find the presence of a dusty compact envelope close to the star , with a temperature between 40 and 1200 K. We estimate for the outer ejecta an ionised gas mass of 1.51 Msun and a warm ( 60 -- 85 K ) dust mass of 0.02 Msun .	Diagnostics of the far-infrared spectra indicate the presence of a photo-dissociation region around the ionised gas .
1	The spatial distribution of radioactive 44Ti , synthesized in an exploding star near the boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and that ejected into the surrounding medium , directly probes the explosion asymmetries .	Asymmetry is required by most numerical simulations of stellar core-collapse explosions , but the form it takes differs significantly among models .	CassiopeiaA is a young , nearby , core-collapse remnant from which 44Ti emission has previously been detected but not imaged .	Asymmetries in the explosion have been indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed 44Ti emission to estimated 56Ni emission , from optical light echoes , and from jet-like features seen in the X-ray and optical ejecta .	Here we report spatial maps and spectral properties of the 44Ti in Cassiopeia A .
3	Such clones emerge when the fitness advantage of some of the genotypes is large enough that they grow to a significant fraction of the population despite being broken down by recombination .	In sexual population , recombination reshuffles genetic variation and produces novel combinations of existing alleles , while selection amplifies the fittest genotypes in the population .	If recombination is more rapid than selection , populations consist of a diverse mixture of many genotypes , as is observed in many populations .	In the opposite regime , which is realized for example in the facultatively sexual populations that outcross in only a fraction of reproductive cycles , selection can amplify individual genotypes into large clones .	The occurrence of this `` clonal condensation '' depends , in addition to the outcrossing rate , on the heritability of fitness .
3	Light transport through brain tissue was modelled using a Finite Element approach .	Photoacoustic imaging has shown great promise for medical imaging , where optical energy absorption by blood haemoglobin is used as the contrast mechanism .	A numerical method was developed for the in-silico assessment of the photoacoustic image reconstruction of the brain .	Image segmentation techniques were used to prepare a digital phantom from MR images .	The resulting acoustic pressure was then estimated by pulsed photoacoustics considerations .
0	We study binomial D-modules , which generalize A-hypergeometric systems .	We determine explicitly their singular loci and provide three characterizations of their holonomicity .	The first of these states that a binomial D-module is holonomic if and only if its corresponding singular locus is proper .	The second characterization is an equivalence of holonomicity and L-holonomicity for these systems .	The third refines the second by giving more detailed information about the L-characteristic variety of a non-holonomic binomial D-module .
4	The subspaces are learned so that each face image to its nearest line is minimized .	Face recognition is a popular application of pat- tern recognition methods , and it faces challenging problems including illumination , expression , and pose .	The most popular way is to learn the subspaces of the face images so that it could be project to another discriminant space where images of different persons can be separated .	In this paper , a nearest line projection algorithm is developed to represent the face images for face recognition .	Instead of projecting an image to its nearest image , we try to project it to its nearest line spanned by two different face images .
0	The Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin inequalities play an important role in the study of quantum mechanical processes in Nature , since they provide general limits on the speed of dynamical evolution .	However , to date there has been only one derivation of the Margolus-Levitin inequality .	In this paper , alternative geometric derivations for both inequalities are obtained from the statistical distance between quantum states .	The inequalities are shown to hold for unitary evolution of pure and mixed states , and a counterexample to the inequalities is given for evolution described by completely positive trace-preserving maps .	The counterexample shows that there is no quantum speed limit for non-unitary evolution .
0	We present a combined X-ray and optical analysis of the cold front cluster Abell 1201 using archival Chandra , data and multi-object spectroscopy taken with the 3.9m Anglo Australian and 6.5m Multiple Mirror Telescopes .	This paper represents the first in a series presenting a study of a sample of cold front clusters selected from the Chandra , archives with the aim of relating cold fronts to merger activity , understanding the dynamics of mergers and their effect on the cluster constituents .	The Chandra X-ray imagery of Abell 1201 reveals two conspicuous surface brightness discontinuities , which are shown to be cold fronts , and a remnant core structure .	Temperature maps reveal a complex multi-phase temperature structure with regions of hot gas interspersed with fingers of cold gas .	Our optical analysis is based on a sample of 321 confirmed members , whose mean redshift is z=0.1673 +/- 0.0002 and velocity dispersion is 778 +/- 36 km/s .
3	We find that the main differences are attributable to the amount of smoothing applied to the counts .	Latent Dirichlet analysis , or topic modeling , is a flexible latent variable framework for modeling high-dimensional sparse count data .	Various learning algorithms have been developed in recent years , including collapsed Gibbs sampling , variational inference , and maximum a posteriori estimation , and this variety motivates the need for careful empirical comparisons .	In this paper , we highlight the close connections between these approaches .	When the hyperparameters are optimized , the differences in performance among the algorithms diminish significantly .
0	We consider the quenched and the averaged ( or annealed ) large deviation rate functions $ I_q $ and $ I_a $ for space-time and ( the usual ) space-only RWRE on $ \mathbb { Z } ^d $ .	By Jensen 's inequality , $ I_a\leq I_q $ .	In the space-time case , when $ d\geq3+1 $ , $ I_q $ and $ I_a $ are known to be equal on an open set containing the typical velocity $ \xi_o $ .	When $ d=1+1 $ , we prove that $ I_q $ and $ I_a $ are equal only at $ \xi_o $ .	Similarly , when d=2+1 , we show that $ I_a & lt ; I_q $ on a punctured neighborhood of $ \xi_o $ .
2	A second generation electron synchrotron component from attenuated proton synchrotron radiation makes enhanced soft X-ray to MeV gamma-ray emission .	Fermi gamma-ray telescope data of GRB 080916C with ~1e55 erg in apparent isotropic gamma-ray energy , show a several second delay between the rise of 100 MeV - GeV radiation compared with keV - MeV radiation .	Here we show that synchrotron radiation from cosmic ray protons accelerated in GRBs , delayed by the proton synchrotron cooling timescale in a jet of magnetically-dominated shocked plasma moving at highly relativistic speeds with bulk Lorentz factor Gamma ~ 500 , could explain this result .	Long GRBs with narrow , energetic jets accelerating particles to ultra-high energies could explain the Auger observations of UHE cosmic rays from sources within 100 Mpc for nano-Gauss intergalactic magnetic fields .	The total energy requirements in a proton synchrotron model are proportional to Gamma^ ( 16/3 ) .
4	We find that the collapse leads either to a central runaway or to off-center fragmentation .	We use numerical simulations to explore whether direct collapse can lead to the formation of SMBH seeds at high-z .	We follow the evolution of gas within DM halos of 2 x 10^8 Mo and 1 kpc .	We adopt cosmological density profiles and j-distributions .	Our goal is to understand how the collapsing flow overcomes the centrifugal barrier and whether it is subject to fragmentation .
1	Alon and Peres provided a general framework for this problem , and showed quantitatively that one can restrict the dilation to be of the form $ f ( n ) X $ where $ f \in \mathbb { Z } [ x ] $ is not constant .	A theorem of Glasner says that if $ X $ is an infinite subset of the torus $ \mathbb { T } $ , then for any $ \epsilon & gt ; 0 $ , there exists an integer $ n $ such that the dilation $ nX=\ { nx : x \in \mathbb { T } \ } $ is $ \epsilon $ -dense ( i.e , it intersects any interval of length $ 2\epsilon $ in $ \mathbb { T } $ ) .	Building upon the work of Alon and Peres , we study this phenomenon in higher dimensions .	Let $ { \bf A } ( x ) $ be an $ L \times N $ matrix whose entries are in $ \mathbb { Z } [ x ] $ , and $ X $ be an infinite subset of $ \mathbb { T } ^N $ .	Contrarily to the case $ N=L=1 $ , it 's not always true that there is an integer $ n $ such that $ \bA ( n ) X $ is $ \epsilon $ -dense in a translate of a subtorus of $ \mathbb { T } ^ { L } $ .
2	We demonstrate that by means of this feedback technique , we can transport a predefined number of ions and also split and unify ion crystals .	We report on transport operations with linear crystals of 40Ca+ ions by applying complex electric time-dependent potentials .	For their control we use the information obtained from the ions ' fluorescence .	The feedback control allows for a robust scheme , compensating for experimental errors as it does not rely on a precisely known electrical modeling of the electric potentials in the ion trap beforehand .	Our method allows us to generate a self-learning voltage ramp for the required process .
0	Many of the early works in the quality control literature construct control limits through the use of graphs and tables as described in Wortham and Ringer ( 1972 ) .	However , the methods used in this literature are restricted to using only the values that the graphs and tables can provide and to the case where the parameters of the underlying distribution are known .	In this note , we briefly describe a technique which can be used to calculate exact control limits without the use of graphs or tables .	We also describe what are commonly referred to in the literature as fiducial limits .	Fiducial limits are often used as the limits in control charting when the parameters of the underlying distribution are unknown .
4	This results in a large enhancement of the folded shape in the bispectrum .	In this paper , we study non-Gaussianity generated by a single scalar field in slow-roll inflation in the framework of the non-relativistic general covariant Ho\v { r } ava-Lifshitz theory of gravity with the projectability condition and an arbitrary coupling constant $ \lambda $ , where $ \lambda $ characterizes the deviation of the theory from general relativity ( GR ) in the infrared .	We find that the leading effect of self-interaction , in contrary to the case of minimal scenario of GR , is in general of the order $ \hat { \alpha } _ { n } \epsilon^ { 3/2 } $ , where $ \epsilon $ is a slow-roll parameter , and $ \hat { \alpha } _ { n } ( n = 3 , 5 ) $ are the dimensionless coupling coefficients of the six-order operators of the Lifshitz scalar , and have no contributions to power spectra and indices of both scalar and tensor .	The bispectrum , comparing with the standard one given in GR , is enhanced , and gives rise to a large value of the nonlinearity parameter $ f_ { \text { NL } } $ .We study how the modified dispersion relation with high order moment terms affects the evaluation of the mode function and in turn the bispectrum , and show explicitly that the mode function takes various asymptotic forms during different periods of its evolution .	In particular , we find that it is in general of superpositions of oscillatory functions , instead of plane waves like in the minimal scenario of GR .
4	Furthermore , a formula for c depending on the mass distribution is given that reproduces Newton 's law of gravitation .	Ernst Mach ( 1838-1916 ) suggested that the origin of gravitational interaction could depend on the presence of all masses in the universe .	A corresponding hypothesis of Sciama ( 1953 ) on the gravitational constant , c^2/G = \sum m_i/r_i , is linked to Dicke 's ( 1957 ) proposal of an electromagnetic origin of gravitation , a precursor of scalar-tensor-theories .	In this an equivalent description in terms of a variable speed of light ( VSL ) is given , and the agreement with the four classical tests of general relativity is shown .	Moreover , VSL opens the possibility to write the total energy of a particle as E=mc^2 ; this necessarily leads to the proportionality of inertial and gravitating mass , the equivalence principle .
1	These transverse relations have the potential to determine the full fermion-boson vertex in terms of the renormalization functions of the fermion propagator .	Some time ago Takahashi derived so called { \it transverse } relations relating Green 's functions of different orders to complement the well-known Ward-Green-Takahashi identities of gauge theories by considering wedge rather than inner products .	He & amp ; Yu have given an indicative proof at one-loop level in 4-dimensions .	However , their construct involves the 4th rank Levi-Civita tensor defined only unambiguously in 4-dimensions exactly where the loop integrals diverge .	Consequently , here we explicitly check the proposed transverse Ward-Takahashi relation holds at one loop order in $ d $ -dimensions , with $ d=4+\epsilon $ .
1	However by relaxing the hypothesis that the fluctuation spectrum can be described by a single power law , we demonstrate that an Einstein-de Sitter universe with { \em zero } cosmological constant can fit the data as well as the best concordance model .	Precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background by WMAP are believed to have established a flat $ \Lambda $ -dominated universe , seeded by nearly scale-invariant adiabatic primordial fluctuations .	Moreover unlike a $ \Lambda $ -dominated universe , such an universe has no strong integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect , so is in better agreement with the low quadrupole seen by WMAP .	The main problem is that the Hubble constant is required to be rather low : $ H_0 \simeq 46 $ km/s/Mpc ; we discuss whether this can be consistent with observations .	Furthermore for universes consisting only of baryons and cold dark matter , the amplitude of matter fluctuations on cluster scales is too high , a problem which seems generic .
2	Using density matrix renormalization group ( DMRG ) , we find that , in contrast to standard behavior , the system becomes more compressible as the repulsive interaction is increased .	We study the interplay between repulsive interaction and an almost staggered on-site potential in one-dimension .	Specifically , we address the Harper model for spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion , close to half-filling .	By generating a low-energy effective model , we unveil the effect of interactions using mean-field analysis : the density of a narrow band around half-filling is anti-correlated with the on-site potential , whereas the density of lower occupied bands follows the potential and strengthens it .	As a result , the states around half-filling are squeezed by the background density , their band becomes flatter , and the compressibility increases .
3	The fluctuations are found to be Gaussian while the mean flow is in a Beltrami state .	A simplified thermodynamic approach of the incompressible axisymmetric Euler equations is considered based on the conservation of helicity , angular momentum and microscopic energy .	Statistical equilibrium states are obtained by maximizing the Boltzmann entropy under these sole constraints .	We assume that these constraints are selected by the properties of forcing and dissipation .	Furthermore , we show that the maximization of entropy at fixed helicity , angular momentum and microscopic energy is equivalent to the minimization of macroscopic energy at fixed helicity and angular momentum .
2	So , we arrive at unitary spaces on Clifford algebras .	For the complex Clifford algebra Cl ( p , q ) of dimension n=p+q we define a Hermitian scalar product .	This scalar product depends on the signature ( p , q ) of Clifford algebra .	With the aid of Hermitian idempotents we suggest a new construction of , so called , normal matrix representations of Clifford algebra elements .	These representations take into account the structure of unitary space on Clifford algebra .
4	The exponential of the negative lp-norm is involved in the lower bound of the Bayes error rate , which shows that it is reasonable to use parameters as features in algorithms that rely on metric spaces ( e.g.classification , dimensionality reduction , clustering ) .	We show that the log-likelihood of several probabilistic graphical models is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the lp-norm of the parameters .	We discuss several implications of Lipschitz parametrization .	We present an upper bound of the Kullback-Leibler divergence that allows understanding methods that penalize the lp-norm of differences of parameters as the minimization of that upper bound .	The expected log-likelihood is lower bounded by the negative lp-norm , which allows understanding the generalization ability of probabilistic models .
1	The detector should ideally be integrated on the chip .	Detecting single atoms ( qubits ) is a key requirement for implementing quantum information processing on an atom chip .	Here we present and compare different methods capable of detecting neutral atoms on an atom chip .	After a short introduction to fluorescence and absorption detection we discuss cavity enhanced detection of single atoms .	In particular we concentrate on optical fiber based detectors such as fiber cavities and tapered fiber dipole traps .
2	[ V. Braginsky , Y. I. Vorontsov , and K. P. Thorne , Science 209 , 547 ( 1980 ) ] , allows a back-action free measurement of one quadrature of the cantilever 's motion , and hence the possibility of generating a squeezed state .	We study the quantum measurement of a cantilever using a parametrically-coupled electromagnetic cavity which is driven at the two sidebands corresponding to the mechanical motion .	This scheme , originally due to Braginsky et al .	We present a complete quantum theory of this system , and derive simple conditions on when the quantum limit on the added noise can be surpassed .	We also study the conditional dynamics of the measurement , and discuss how such a scheme ( when coupled with feedback ) can be used to generate and detect squeezed states of the oscillator .
1	Fouvry and Iwaniec [ FI ] proved that the 1-level density for L-functions attached to imaginary quadratic fields agrees with results predicted by random matrix theory .	One of the most important statistics in studying the zeros of L-functions is the 1-level density , which measures the concentration of zeros near the central point .	In this paper , we show a similar agreement with random matrix theory occurring in more general sequences of number fields .	We first show that the main term agrees with random matrix theory , and similar to all other families studied to date , is independent of the arithmetic of the fields .	We then derive the first lower order term of the 1-level density , and see the arithmetic enter .
2	These FC interactions can make significant loop-level contributions to the couplings $ tcV $ , and furthermore enhance the cross sections of the FC single-top quark production processes .	The littlest Higgs model with discrete symmetry named `` T-parity '' ( LHT ) is an interesting new physics model which does not suffer strong constraints from electroweak precision data .	One of the important features of the LHT model is the existence of new source of FC interactions between the SM fermions and the mirror fermions .	In this paper , we study some FC single-top quark production processes , $ pp\to t\bar { c } $ and $ pp\to tV $ , at the LHC in the LHT model .	We find that the cross sections of these processes are strongly depended on the mirror quark masses .
3	The strength of the critical repulsion decreases monotonically as the mass imbalance grows so that the minimum is realized when one of the species is localized .	We investigate the effect of mass imbalance in binary Fermi mixtures loaded in optical lattices .	Using dynamical mean-field theory , we study the transition from a fluid to a Mott insulator driven by the repulsive interactions .	For almost every value of the parameters we find that the light species with smaller bare mass is more affected by correlations than the heavy one , so that their effective masses become closer than their bare masses before a Mott transition occurs .	The evolution of the spectral functions testifies that a continuous loss of coherence and a destruction of the Fermi liquid occur as the imbalance grows .
4	For Stratonovich sde 's , the stable and unstable manifolds are dynamically characterized using forward and backward solutions of the anticipating sde .	We formulate and prove a { \it Local Stable Manifold Theorem\/ } for stochastic differential equations ( sde 's ) that are driven by spatial Kunita-type semimartingales with stationary ergodic increments .	Both Stratonovich and It\^o-type equations are treated .	Starting with the existence of a stochastic flow for a sde , we introduce the notion of a hyperbolic stationary trajectory .	We prove the existence of invariant random stable and unstable manifolds in the neighborhood of the hyperbolic stationary solution .
0	We study the flavor changing neutral current decays of the MSSM Higgs bosons into strange and bottom quarks .	We focus on a scenario of minimum flavor violation here , namely only that induced by the CKM matrix .	Taking into account constraint from $ b\to s \gamma $ , $ \delta\rho $ as well as experimental constraints on the MSSM spectrum , we show that the branching ratio of $ ( \Phi\to b\bar { s } ) $ and $ ( \Phi \to \bar { b } s ) $ combined , for $ \Phi $ being either one of the CP even Higgs states , can reach the order $ 10^ { -4 } $ - $ 10^ { -3 } $ for large $ \tan\beta $ , large $ \mu $ , and large $ A_t $ .	The result illustrates the significance of minimal flavor violation scenario which can induce competitive branching fraction for flavor changing Higgs decays .	This can be compared with the previous studies where similar branching fraction has been reported , but with additional sources of flavor violations in squark mass matrices .
4	Typically spiral galaxies are copiously observed at redshifts z ~ 1 .	It is well established that many galaxies , like our Milky Way , exhibit spiral patterns .	The entire galactic disc rotates about the galactic centre with different speeds ; higher closer to the centre , lower at greater distances - that is , galactic discs do not rotate like a solid compact disc .	The spiral arms are the part of the galactic disc where many young stars are being born .	Since young stars are also brightest , we can see the spiral structure of other galaxies from afar .
2	While it is generally believed that the algorithm 's regret is low ( high ) when the prior is good ( bad ) , little is known about the exact dependence .	The empirically successful Thompson Sampling algorithm for stochastic bandits has drawn much interest in understanding its theoretical properties .	One important benefit of the algorithm is that it allows domain knowledge to be conveniently encoded as a prior distribution to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively .	In this paper , we fully characterize the algorithm 's worst-case dependence of regret on the choice of prior , focusing on a special yet representative case .	These results also provide insights into the general sensitivity of the algorithm to the choice of priors .
0	We use one-dimensional radiative transfer simulations to study the evolution of H_2 gas-phase ( H^- catalyzed ) formation and photo-dissociation regions in the primordial universe .	We find a new positive feedback mechanism capable of producing shells of H_2 in the intergalactic medium , which are optically thick in some Lyman-Werner bands .	While these shells exist , this feedback effect is important in reducing the H_2 dissociating background flux and the size of photo-dissociation spheres around each luminous object .	The maximum background opacity of the IGM in the H_2 Lyman-Werner bands is \tau_ { H_2 } ~ 1-2 for a relic molecular fraction x_ { H_2 } =2 x 10^ { -6 } , about 6 times greater than found by Haiman , Abel & amp ; Rees .	Therefore , the relic molecular hydrogen can decrease the photo-dissociation rate by about an order of magnitude .
4	Such a protocol appears challenging but feasible .	Though appropriate for core Internet infrastructure , the Internet Protocol is unsuited to routing within and between emerging ad-hoc edge networks due to its dependence on hierarchical , administratively assigned addresses .	Existing ad-hoc routing protocols address the management problem but do not scale to Internet-wide networks .	The promise of ubiquitous network computing can not be fulfilled until we develop an Unmanaged Internet Protocol ( UIP ) , a scalable routing protocol that manages itself automatically .	UIP must route within and between constantly changing edge networks potentially containing millions or billions of nodes , and must still function within edge networks disconnected from the main Internet , all without imposing the administrative burden of hierarchical address assignment .
4	It is finally shown that different gauge choices produce different equivalent forms of the constraints .	The physical phase space of the relativistic top , as defined by Hanson and Regge , is expressed in terms of canonical coordinates of the Poincar\'e group manifold .	The system is described in the Hamiltonian formalism by the mass shell condition and constraints that reduce the number of spin degrees of freedom .	The constraints are second class and are modified into a set of first class constraints by adding combinations of gauge fixing functions .	The Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky ( BFV ) method is then applied to quantize the system in the path integral formalism in Hamiltonian form .
1	By employing a field-theoretical approach , we analyze the topology of the ground-state phase diagram and identify the nature of the phase transitions .	Motivated by recent experiments on quasi-1D vanadium oxides , we study quantum phase transitions in a one-dimensional spin-orbital model describing a Haldane chain and a classical Ising chain locally coupled by the relativistic spin-orbit interaction .	In the strong coupling limit , a long-range N\'eel order of entangled spin and orbital angular momentum appears in the ground state .	We find that , depending on the relative scales of the spin and orbital gaps , the linear chain follows two distinct routes to reach the N\'eel state .	First , when the orbital exchange is the dominating energy scale , a two-stage ordering takes place in which the magnetic transition is followed by melting of the orbital Ising order ; both transitions belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class .
2	The kinematics of the different ejections close to XZ Tau reveal a rotating and expanding structure with a southeast-northwest velocity gradient .	We present high angular resolution ( $ \sim $ 0.94 $ '' $ ) $ ^ { 12 } $ CO ( 1-0 ) Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) observations obtained during the 2014 long baseline campaign from the eruptive bipolar flow from the multiple XZ Tau stellar system discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) .	These observations reveal , for the first time , the kinematics of the molecular flow .	The youngest eruptive bubbles unveiled in the optical HST images are inside of this molecular expanding structure .	Additionally , we report a very compact and collimated bipolar outflow emanating from XZ Tau A , which indicates that the eruptive outflow is indeed originating from this object .
4	We also discovered that the structure acts as a local field concentrator and a resonant `amplifier ' of losses in the underlying dielectric .	We report on a new type of continuous electromagnetic metal planar meta-material , which resembles a `fish scale ' structure .	It is highly transparent to electromagnetic radiation throughout a broad spectral range apart from at one isolated wavelength .	When the structure is superimposed on a metallic mirror it becomes a good broadband reflector everywhere apart from one wavelength where the reflectivity is small .	At this wavelength the reflected wave shows no phase change with respect to the incident wave , thus resembling a reflection from a hypothetical zero refractive index material , or `magnetic wall ' .
3	This conversion of the random phase into the random Cauchy potential is a notable feature of our work .	We introduce phase disorder in a 1D quantum resistor through the formal device of `fake channels ' distributed uniformly over its length such that the out-coupled wave amplitude is re-injected back into the system , but with a phase which is random .	The associated scattering problem is treated via invariant imbedding in the continuum limit , and the resulting transport equation is found to correspond exactly to the Lloyd model .	The latter has been a subject of much interest in recent years .	It is further argued that our phase-randomizing reservoir , as distinct from the well known phase-breaking reservoirs , induces no decoherence , but essentially destroys all interference effects other than the coherent back scattering .
3	We have developped a calibration procedure for our total absorbing electromagnetic calorimeter which consists of 1022 lead fluoride ( PbF_2 ) crystals .	Sufficient energy resolution is the key issue for the calorimetry in particle and nuclear physics .	The calorimeter of the A4 parity violation experiment at MAMI is a segmented calorimeter where the energy of an event is determined by summing the signals of neighbouring channels .	In this case the precise matching of the individual modules is crucial to obtain a good energy resolution .	This procedure reconstructs the the single-module contributions to the events by solving a linear system of equations , involving the inversion of a 1022 x 1022-matrix .
2	However , difficulty in merging those theories self-consistently still exists , and no such theory is generally accepted .	Observed physical phenomena can be described well by quantum mechanics or general relativity .	People may try to find an unified fundamental theory which mainly aims to merge gravity with quantum theory .	Here we try to propose a quantum theory with space and time in symmetrical positions in the framework of general relativity .	In this theory , Dirac matter fields , gauge fields and gravity field are formulated in an unified way which satisf Dirac equation , Yang-Mills equation and Einstein equation in operator form .
1	The microscopic model , used before to study magnetic fluctuations and superconducting properties , includes the two effective tight-binding bands proposed by S.Raghu et al . [ Phys.Rev .	Using a second-order perturbative Green 's functions approach we determined the normal state single-particle spectral function $ A ( \vec { k } , \omega ) $ employing a minimal effective model for iron-based superconductors .	B 77 , 220503 ( R ) ( 2008 ) ] , and intra- and inter-orbital local electronic correlations , related to the Fe-3d orbitals .	Here , we focus on the study of normal state electronic properties , in particular the temperature and doping dependence of the total density of states , $ A ( \omega ) $ , and of $ A ( \vec { k } , \omega ) $ in different Brillouin zone regions , and compare them to the existing angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( ARPES ) and previous theoretical results in ferropnictides .	We obtain an asymmetric effect of electron and hole doping , quantitative agreement with the experimental chemical potential shifts as a function of doping , as well as spectral weight redistributions near the Fermi level as a function of temperature consistent with the available experimental data .
2	By introducing a general analytic approach we show that the system Green function can be exactly determined , allowing for the investigation of the matter-wave transport properties .	We present a general scheme to realize a cold-atom quantum simulator of bidimensional atomic crystals .	Our model is based on the use of two independently trapped atomic species : the first one , subject to a strong in-plane confinement , constitutes a two-dimensional matter wave which interacts only with atoms of the second species , deeply trapped around the nodes of a two-dimensional optical lattice .	We propose some illustrative applications to both Bravais ( square , triangular ) and non-Bravais ( graphene , kagom\'e ) lattices , studying both ideal periodic systems and experimental-size and disordered ones .	Some remarkable spectral properties of these atomic artificial lattices are pointed out , such as the emergence of single and multiple gaps , flat bands , and Dirac cones .
1	Our forcing is tidal like , but its main property is that it is on the large scales .	We investigate the properties of forced inertial modes of a rotating fluid inside a spherical shell .	Our solutions first confirm some analytical results obtained on a two-dimensional model by Ogilvie ( 2005 ) .	We also note that as the frequency of the forcing varies , the dissipation varies drastically if the Ekman number E is low ( as is usually the case ) .	We then investigate the three-dimensional case and compare the results to the foregoing model .
4	For `` regular by blocks '' orbits , we get an explicit formula for these integrals in terms of the zeta function of the curve .	This paper is concerned with two problems .	One is to count Hitchin bundles on a projective curve and the other is to get an explicit formula for the nilpotent part of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula for a simple test function .	The fact that the two problems are in fact related has been noticed in a previous paper .	We expand the nilpotent part of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula in a sum of adelic integrals indexed by nilpotent orbits .
2	The vertical velocity dispersion of the discs is measured from absorption lines ( near the V-band ) of near-face-on spiral galaxies , with the light coming from a mixed population of giants of all ages .	In decomposing the HI rotation curves of disc galaxies , it is necessary to break a degeneracy between the gravitational fields of the disc and the dark halo by estimating the disc surface density .	This is done by combining measurements of the vertical velocity dispersion of the disc with the disc scale height .	However , the scale heights for these galaxies are estimated statistically from near-IR surface photometry of edge-on galaxies .	The scale height estimate is therefore dominated by a population of older ( & gt ; 2 Gyr ) red giants .
4	A coupling via a real scalar field transmits the breaking scale to the Standard Model Higgs and triggers electroweak symmetry breaking .	The LHC and other experiments show so far no sign of new physics and long-held beliefs about naturalness should be critically reexamined .	We discuss therefore in this paper a model with a combined breaking of conformal and electroweak symmetry by a strongly coupled hidden sector .	Even though the conformal symmetry is anomalous , this may still provide an explanation of the smallness of electroweak scale compared to the Planck scale .	Specifically we start from a classically conformal model , in which a strongly coupled hidden sector undergoes spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .
0	Australia Telescope Compact Array HI observations reveal the existence of 5.8x10^8 M_sun of HI gas in the central 7 kpc of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3175 .	The detected HI and CO gas can explain why star formation , as traced by other emission processes , is going on in the inner part of its disk .	On the other hand , the entire outer disk , beyond 3.5 kpc radius , shows no HI emission , has a very red colour and exhibits neither radio continuum nor H-alpha emission .	This indicates that the outer part of NGC 3175 is quiescent , i.e.not forming stars at a measurable rate .	Its HI deficiency and the small extent of the HI layer , which is confined to the boundaries of the optically visible disk , make NGC 3175 a peculiar spiral galaxy .
2	We consider three simple cases of multivalued analytic functions $ f_1 $ and $ f_2 $ , with separated pairs of branch points belonging to the real line .	In this paper are discussed the results of new numerical experiments on zero distribution of type I Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials of order $ n=200 $ for three different collections of three functions $ [ 1 , f_1 , f_2 ] $ .	These results are obtained by the authors numerically and do not match any of the theoretical results that were proven so far .	In the first case both functions have two logarithmic branch points , in the second case they both have branch points of second order , and finally , in the third case they both have branch points of third order .	All three cases may be considered as representative of the asymptotic theory of Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials .
4	We argue that this trend is not caused by starburst events , by changes in the physical parameters of the molecular clouds , or by the impact of the fundamental metallicity-SFR-stellar mass relation .	We use the first systematic samples of CO millimeter emission in z & gt ; 1 'main-sequence ' star forming galaxies ( SFGs ) to study the metallicity dependence of the conversion factor { \alpha } CO , from CO line luminosity to molecular gas mass .	The molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio of the star formation rate ( SFR ) to CO luminosity , is ~1 Gyr-1 for near-solar metallicity galaxies with stellar masses above M_S~1e11 M_sun .	In this regime the depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as a function of molecular gas surface density , or redshift between z~0 and 2 .	Below M_S the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity .
4	Using a rapid hadronization model we obtain final state particle yields , providing detailed theoretical predictions about strange particle spectra and yields as function of heavy ion energy .	After a brief survey of the remarkable accomplishments of the current heavy ion collision experiments up to 200A GeV , we address in depth the role of strange particle production in the search for new phases of matter in these collisions .	In particular , we show that the observed enhancement pattern of otherwise rarely produced multistrange antibaryons can be consistently explained assuming color deconfinement in a localized , rapidly disintegrating hadronic source .	We develop the theoretical description of this source , and in particular study QCD based processes of strangeness production in the deconfined , thermal quark-gluon plasma phase , allowing for approach to chemical equilibrium and dynamical evolution .	We also address thermal charm production .
3	Our task is to derive expressions for the $ \beta $ functions valid to all orders .	We consider two-dimensional $ \mathcal { N } = ( 0,2 ) $ sigma models with the CP ( 1 ) target space .	A minimal model of this type has one left-handed fermion .	Nonminimal extensions contain , in addition , $ N_f $ right-handed fermions .	To this end we use a variety of methods : ( i ) perturbative analysis ; ( ii ) instanton calculus ; ( iii ) analysis of the supercurrent supermultiplet ( the so-called hypercurrent ) and its anomalies , and some other arguments .
3	The present paper proves numerically , using periodic orbits for the Lorentz gas , that SCPR can not hold for isoenergetic ( IE ) stationary states , which have a given total internal energy .	For Hamiltonian systems subject to an external potential , which in the presence of a thermostat will reach a nonequilibrium stationary state , Dettmann and Morriss proved a strong conjugate pairing rule ( SCPR ) for pairs of Lyapunov exponents in the case of isokinetic ( IK ) stationary states which have a given kinetic energy .	This SCPR holds for all initial phases of the system , all times t and all numbers of particles N. This proof was generalized by Wojtkovski and Liverani to include hard interparticle potentials .	A geometrical reformulation of those results is presented .	In that case strong evidence is obtained for CPR to hold for large N and t , where it can be conjectured that the larger N , the smaller t will be .
4	As an application of the invariance of normal maps , we give a very short proof to a theorem of Dwyer and Farjoun namely that a localization by a suspended map of a principal fibration of connected spaces is again principal .	Normal maps between discrete groups $ N\rightarrow G $ were characterized [ FS ] as those which induce a compatible topological group structure on the homotopy quotient $ EN\times_N G $ .	Here we deal with topological group ( or loop ) maps $ N\rightarrow G $ being normal in the same sense as above and hence forming a homotopical analogue to the inclusion of a topological normal subgroup in a reasonable way .	We characterize these maps by a compatible simplicial loop space structure on $ Bar_\bullet ( N , G ) $ , invariant under homotopy monoidal functors , e.g.Localizations and Completions .	In the course of characterizing homotopy normality , we define a notion of a `` homotopy action '' similar to an $ A_ { \infty } $ action on a space , but phrased in terms of Segal 's 'special $ \Delta- $ spaces ' and seem to be of importance on its own right .
0	The study of exoplanetary atmospheres is one of the most exciting and dynamic frontiers in astronomy .	Over the past two decades ongoing surveys have revealed an astonishing diversity in the planetary masses , radii , temperatures , orbital parameters , and host stellar properties of exoplanetary systems .	We are now moving into an era where we can begin to address fundamental questions concerning the diversity of exoplanetary compositions , atmospheric and interior processes , and formation histories , just as have been pursued for solar system planets over the past century .	Exoplanetary atmospheres provide a direct means to address these questions via their observable spectral signatures .	In the last decade , and particularly in the last five years , tremendous progress has been made in detecting atmospheric signatures of exoplanets through photometric and spectroscopic methods using a variety of space-borne and/or ground-based observational facilities .
4	In the absence of some resummation technique , the convergence of perturbation theory is poor .	We present the full details of a calculation at next-to-leading order of the momentum diffusion coefficient of a heavy quark in a hot , weakly coupled , QCD plasma .	Corrections arise at O ( g_s ) ; physically they represent interference between overlapping scatterings , as well as soft , electric scale ( p ~ gT ) gauge field physics , which we treat using the hard thermal loop ( HTL ) effective theory .	In 3-color , 3-flavor QCD , the momentum diffusion constant of a fundamental representation heavy quark at NLO is kappa = ( 16\pi/3 ) alpha_s^2 T^3 ( log ( 1/g ) + 0.07428 + 1.9026 g ) .	We extend the computation to a heavy fundamental representation `` probe '' quark in large N_c , N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory , where the result is kappa^ { SYM } = ( lambda^2 T^3 ) ( 6\pi ) ( log ( 1/\sqrt { \lambda } ) + 0.4304 + 0.8010 \sqrt { lambda } ) ( where lambda=g_s^2 N_c is the t'Hooft coupling ) .
3	This is deduced from a general theorem that compares twisted and untwisted $ L^2 $ -torsions in the general base-change situation .	Let $ G $ be the group of complex points of a real semi-simple Lie group whose fundamental rank is equal to 1 , e.g. $ G= \SL_2 ( \C ) \times \SL_2 ( \C ) $ or $ \SL_3 ( \C ) $ .	Then the fundamental rank of $ G $ is $ 2 , $ and according to the conjecture made in \cite { BV } , lattices in $ G $ should have 'little ' -- - in the very weak sense of 'subexponential in the co-volume ' -- - torsion homology .	Using base change , we exhibit sequences of lattices where the torsion homology grows exponentially with the \emph { square root } of the volume .	This also makes uses of a precise equivariant 'Cheeger-M\ '' uller Theorem ' proved by the second author \cite { Lip1 } .
4	It is also completely independent of the details put in by hand , e.g.the choice of covariantisation and the cutoff profile , and , therefore , guides us to a procedure for streamlined calculations .	A manifestly gauge invariant exact renormalization group for pure SU ( N ) Yang-Mills theory is proposed , along with the necessary gauge invariant regularisation which implements the effective cutoff .	The latter is naturally incorporated by embedding the theory into a spontaneously broken SU ( N|N ) super-gauge theory , which guarantees finiteness to all orders in perturbation theory .	The effective action , from which one extracts the physics , can be computed whilst manifestly preserving gauge invariance at each and every step .	As an example , we give an elegant computation of the one-loop SU ( N ) Yang-Mills beta function , for the first time at finite N without any gauge fixing or ghosts .
3	While a single instanton does not give rise to a center vortex , we find center vortices for merons .	Abelian and center gauges are considered in continuum Yang-Mills theory in order to detect the magnetic monopole and center vortex content of gauge field configurations .	Specifically we examine the Laplacian Abelian and center gauges , which are free of Gribov copies , as well as the center gauge analog of the ( Abelian ) Polyakov gauge .	In particular , we study meron , instanton and instanton-anti-instanton field configurations in these gauges and determine their monopole and vortex content .	Furthermore we provide evidence , that merons can be interpreted as intersection points of center vortices .
3	The following result is obtained : Theorem : Let $ G $ be a finite almost simple group .	Let $ G $ be a finite group and $ G_p $ be a Sylow $ p $ -subgroup of $ G $ for a prime $ p $ in $ \pi ( G ) $ , the set of all prime divisors of the order of $ G $ .	The automiser $ A_p ( G ) $ is defined to be the group $ N_G ( G_p ) /G_pC_G ( G_p ) $ .	We define the Sylow graph $ \Gamma_A ( G ) $ of the group $ G $ , with set of vertices $ \pi ( G ) $ , as follows : Two vertices $ p , q\in\pi ( G ) $ form an edge of $ \Gamma_A ( G ) $ if either $ q\in\pi ( A_p ( G ) ) $ or $ p\in \pi ( A_q ( G ) ) $ .	Then the graph $ \Gamma_A ( G ) $ is connected and has diameter at most 5 .
3	We find a rapid increase of the leading term when liquid is added .	In this work we derive an analytic expression for the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of dilute wet granular matter , valid for any spatial dimension .	The grains are modelled as hard spheres and the influence of the wetting liquid is described according to the Capillary Model , in which dissipation is due to the hysteretic cohesion force of capillary bridges .	The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is expanded in a series with respect to density .	This demonstrates the sensitivity of the granular dynamics to humidity , and shows that the liquid significantly increases the chaoticity of the granular gas .
2	In a nonextensive scenario , these indices are quantities that measure the degree of nonextensivity present in the system .	Time-dependent nonextensivity in a stellar astrophysical scenario combines nonextensive entropic indices $ q_ { K } $ derived from the modified Kawaler 's parametrization , and $ q $ , obtained from rotational velocity distribution .	These $ q $ 's are related through a heuristic single relation given by $ q\approx q_ { 0 } ( 1-\Delta t/q_ { K } ) $ , where $ t $ is the cluster age .	Recent studies reveal that the index $ q $ is correlated to the formation rate of high-energy tails present in the distribution of rotation velocity .	On the other hand , the index $ q_ { K } $ is determined by the stellar rotation-age relationship .
4	For sufficiently low lattice temperatures , Bloch and Gunn type oscillations mediated by electric field , current and energy domains coexist for a range of voltages .	In a semiconductor superlattice with long scattering times , damping of Bloch oscillations due to scattering is so small that nonlinearities may compensate it and Bloch oscillations persist even in the hydrodynamic regime .	To demonstrate this , a Boltzmann-Poisson transport model of miniband superlattices with inelastic collisions is proposed and hydrodynamic equations for electron density , electric field and the complex amplitude of the Bloch oscillations are derived by singular perturbation methods .	For appropriate parameter ranges , numerical solutions of these equations show stable Bloch oscillations with spatially inhomogeneous field , charge , current density and energy density profiles .	These Bloch oscillations disappear as scattering times become sufficiently short .
4	As a distinguished feature of the present study , we take the space of the unresolved subscales orthogonal to the finite element space , which promises a remedy to the above mentioned complication .	In this paper , the stabilized finite element approximation of the Stokes eigenvalue problems is considered for both the two-field ( displacement-pressure ) and the three-field ( stress-displacement-pressure ) formulations .	The method presented is based on a subgrid scale concept , and depends on the approximation of the unresolvable scales of the continuous solution .	In general , subgrid scale techniques consist in the addition of a residual based term to the basic Galerkin formulation .	The application of a standard residual based stabilization method to a linear eigenvalue problem leads to a quadratic eigenvalue problem in discrete form which is physically inconvenient .
0	Using the 2MASS Second Incremental Data Release , we have searched for near infrared counterparts to 13214 quasars from the Veron-Cetty & amp ; Veron ( 2000 ) catalog .	We have detected counterparts within 4 arcsec for 2277 of the approximately 6320 quasars within the area covered by the 2MASS Second Incremental Data Release .	Only 1.6 % of these are expected to be chance coincidences .	Though this sample is heterogeneous , we find that known radio-loud quasars are more likely to have large near-infrared-to-optical luminosity ratios than radio-quiet quasars are , at a statistically significant level .	This is consistent with dust-reddened quasars being more common in radio-selected samples than in optically-selected samples , due to stronger selection effects against dust-reddened quasars in the latter .
2	We calculate several points on the coexistence curve between these phases .	We present a study of the dynamical behavior of a Ziff-Gulari-Barshad model with CO desorption and lateral diffusion .	Depending on the values of the desorption and diffusion parameters , the system presents a discontinuous phase transition between low and high CO coverage phases .	Inclusion of the diffusion term produces a significant increase in the CO_2 production rate .	We further applied a square-wave periodic pressure variation of the partial CO pressure with parameters that can be tuned to modify the catalytic activity .
2	Atmospheric parameters are estimated from the ionization equilibrium set by neutral and singly ionized species of Fe and Mg , the excitation of Fe I and Fe II lines and the wings of the Paschen lines .	We have conducted an LTE abundance analysis for SAO 40039 a warm post-AGB star whose spectrum is known to show surprisingly strong He I lines for its effective temperature and has been suspected of being H-deficient and He-rich .	High-resolution optical spectra are analyzed using a family of model atmospheres with different He/H ratios .	On the assumption that the He I lines are of photospheric and not chromospheric in origin , a He/H ratio of approximately unity is found by imposing the condition that the adopted He/H ratio of the model atmosphere must equal the ratio derived from the observed He I triplet lines at 5876 , 4471 and 4713 Angstrom , and singlet lines at 4922 and 5015 Angstrom .	Using the model with the best-fitting atmospheric parameters for this He/H ratio , SAO 40039 is confirmed to exhibit mild dust-gas depletion , i.e. , the star has an atmosphere deficient in elements of high condensation temperature .
1	CFFs have been of interest for a long time both in discrete mathematics as part of block design theory , and in theoretical computer science where they have found a variety of applications , for example , in parametrized algorithms where they were introduced in the recent breakthrough work of Fomin , Lokshtanov and Saurabh under the name `lopsided universal sets ' .	Roughly speaking , an $ ( n , ( r , s ) ) $ -Cover Free Family ( CFF ) is a small set of $ n $ -bit strings such that : `` in any $ d : =r+s $ indices we see all patterns of weight $ r $ '' .	In this paper we give the first explicit construction of cover-free families of optimal size up to lower order multiplicative terms , { for any $ r $ and $ s $ } .	In fact , our construction time is almost linear in the size of the family .	Before our work , such a result existed only for $ r=d^ { o ( 1 ) } $ .
3	The main results are Theorem 10 , Theorem 57 , Theorem 67 and Theorem 73 .	We work within the framework of the Alpha-Theory introduced by Benci and Di Nasso .	The Alpha-Theory postulates a few natural properties for an infinite `` ideal '' number $ \alpha $ .	The formulation provides an elementary axiomatics for the methods of abstract ultra-Ramsey theory .	Theorem 10 is an infinite-dimensional extension of the celebrated Ramsey 's Theorem .
3	An application of the method to the observational data of the light curve of the irregular variable star R Scuti is presented .	We introduce the reader to the `` global flow reconstruction method '' .	The purpose of the method is to see if a given temporal sequence has been generated by a low dimensional dynamics , and to determine that dimension and other properties of the dynamics .	The method is shown to work very well on the well known Roessler system .	This light curve is shown to have been generated by a 4 dimensional dynamics .
3	With respect to the secular angle $ \Delta\varpi $ , possible motions are circulations , oscillations ( around 0 and $ 180^\circ $ ) , and high eccentricity/inclination librations in secular resonances .	The three-dimensional secular behavior of a system composed of a central star and two massive planets is modeled semi-analytically in the frame of the general three-body problem .	The main dynamical features of the system are presented in geometrical pictures allowing us to investigate a large domain of the phase space of this problem without time-expensive numerical integrations of the equations of motion and without any restriction on the magnitude of the planetary eccentricities , inclinations and mutual distance .	Several regimes of motion of the system are observed .	With respect to the arguments of pericenter , $ \omega_1 $ and $ \omega_2 $ , possible motions are direct circulation and high-inclination libration around $ \pm 90^\circ $ in the Lidov-Kozai resonance .
4	The proposed experimental setup and the analysis technique is discussed .	Massive photon-like particles are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model .	They have interactions similar to the photon , are vector bosons , and can be produced together with photons .	The PADME experiment proposes a search for the dark photon ( $ A ' $ ) in the $ e^+e^- \to \gamma A ' $ process in a positron-on-target experiment , exploiting the positron beam of the DA $ \Phi $ NE linac at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati , INFN .	In one year of running a sensitivity in the relative interaction strength down to $ 10^ { -6 } $ is achievable , in the mass region from 2.5 MeV $ & lt ; M_ { A ' } & lt ; $ 22.5 MeV .
0	In the framework of the majorization technique , an improved condition is proposed for the semilocal convergence of the Newton method under the mild assumption that the derivative of the involved operator F ( x ) is continuous .	Our starting point is the Argyros representation of the optimal upper bound for the distance between the adjacent members of the Newton sequence .	The major novel element of our proposal is the optimally reconstructed 'first integral ' approximation to the recurrence relation defining the scalar majorizing sequence .	Compared to the previous results of Argyros , it enables one to obtain a weaker convergence condition that leads to a better bound on the location of the solution of the equation F ( x ) =0 and allows for a wider choice of initial guesses .	In the simplest case of the Lipschitz continuous derivative operator , an explicit restriction is found which guarantees that the new convergence condition improves the famous Kantorovich condition .
3	We use the sonic point analysis to study the solution .	We study the effect of nuclear reaction on a thin , axisymmetric , differentially rotating , inviscid , steady accretion flow around a black hole from an analytical point of view .	We find that for most of the reasonable disk parameters , when $ p-p $ -reaction , dissociation of deuterium and helium are taken into account , the transonic region of the disk continues to have the inner sonic point and if the temperature of the flow at the injection sonic point could be raised ( by say , some heating processes ) the flow would to pass through this inner sonic point .	Otherwise , the flow may be unstable .	In the rest of the disk parameters the inner sonic point is absent altogether and the flow will definitely be unstable .
3	Here we show that current inventories of planets and protoplanetary discs are sensitive enough to place basic constraints on the timescale and efficiency of the planet formation process .	The high rate of planet detection among solar-type stars argues that planet formation is common .	It is also generally assumed that planets form in protoplanetary discs like those observed in nearby star forming regions .	On what timescale does the transformation from discs to planets occur ?	A comparison of planet detection statistics and the measured solid reservoirs in T Tauri discs suggests that planet formation is likely already underway at the few Myr age of the discs in Taurus-Auriga , with a large fraction of solids having been converted into large objects with low millimeter opacity and/or sequestered at small disc radii where they are difficult to detect at millimeter wavelengths .
4	The second one introduces couplings between the matter and ghost worldsheet fields on the boundaries .	We show that the lightcone worldsheet formalism , constructed to represent the sum of the bare planar diagrams of scalar \phi^3 field theory , survives the renormalization procedure in space-time dimensions D not greater than 6 .	Specifically this means that all the counter-terms , necessary to produce a successful renormalized perturbation expansion to all orders , can be represented as local terms in the lightcone worldsheet action .	Because the worldsheet regulator breaks Lorentz invariance , we find the need for two non-covariant counter-terms , in addition to the usual mass , coupling and wave function renormalization .	One of these can be simply interpreted as a rescaling of transverse coordinates with respect to longitudinal coordinates .
0	From 2MASS infra-red photometry we find two red clump ( RC ) populations co-existing in the same fields toward the Galactic bulge at latitudes |b| & gt ; 5.5 deg. , ranging over ~13 degrees in longitude and 20 degrees in latitude .	We can only understand the data if these RC peaks simply reflect two stellar populations separated by ~2.3 kpc ; at ( l , b ) = ( +1 , -8 ) the two RCs are located at 6.5 and 8.8+/-0.2 kpc .	The double-peaked RC is inconsistent with a tilted bar morphology .	Most of our fields show the two RCs at roughly constant distance with longitude , which is also inconsistent with a tilted bar , although an underlying bar may be present .	The stellar densities in the two RCs changes dramatically with longitude : on the positive longitude side the foreground RC is dominant , while the background RC dominates negative longitudes .
2	If $ k \leq n $ , then $ \mathcal { P } _ { k , k , n } $ describes permutations of $ k $ -element subsets of $ [ n ] $ .	For any positive integers $ k , r , n $ with $ r \leq \min\ { k , n\ } $ , let $ \mathcal { P } _ { k , r , n } $ be the family of all sets $ \ { ( x_1 , y_1 ) , \dots , ( x_r , y_r ) \ } $ such that $ x_1 , \dots , x_r $ are distinct elements of $ [ k ] = \ { 1 , \dots , k\ } $ and $ y_1 , \dots , y_r $ are distinct elements of $ [ n ] $ .	The families $ \mathcal { P } _ { n , n , n } $ and $ \mathcal { P } _ { n , r , n } $ describe permutations of $ [ n ] $ and $ r $ -partial permutations of $ [ n ] $ , respectively .	A family $ \mathcal { A } $ of sets is said to be intersecting if every two members of $ \mathcal { A } $ intersect .	In this note we use Katona 's elegant cycle method to show that a number of important Erd\H { o } s-Ko-Rado-type results by various authors generalise as follows : the size of any intersecting subfamily $ \mathcal { A } $ of $ \mathcal { P } _ { k , r , n } $ is at most $ { k-1 \choose r-1 } \frac { ( n-1 ) ! } { ( n-r ) !
4	We also note that since observations are expected to yield much better information on the scalars than on the tensors , it is likely to be the next-order version of this consistency equation which will be appropriate , not the lowest-order one .	We review the relation between the inflationary potential and the spectra of density ( scalar ) perturbations and gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations ) produced , with particular emphasis on the possibility of reconstructing the inflaton potential from observations .	The spectra provide a potentially powerful test of the inflationary hypothesis ; they are not independent but instead are linked by consistency relations reflecting their origin from a single inflationary potential .	To lowest-order in a perturbation expansion there is a single , now familiar , relation between the tensor spectral index and the relative amplitude of the spectra .	We demonstrate that there is an infinite hierarchy of such consistency equations , though observational difficulties suggest only the first is ever likely to be useful .
1	A generalization of this interpretation is given for the local $ h $ -polynomial of the $ r $ th edgewise subdivision of the barycentric subdivision of the simplex .	The coefficients of the local $ h $ -polynomial of the barycentric subdivision of the simplex with $ n $ vertices are known to count derangements in the symmetric group $ \mathfrak { S } _n $ by the number of excedances .	This polynomial is shown to be $ \gamma $ -nonnegative and a combinatorial interpretation to the corresponding $ \gamma $ -coefficients is provided .	The new combinatorial interpretations involve the notions of flag excedance and descent in the wreath product $ \ZZ_r \wr \mathfrak { S } _n $ .	A related result on the derangement polynomial for $ \ZZ_r \wr \mathfrak { S } _n $ , studied by Chow and Mansour , is also derived from results of Linusson , Shareshian and Wachs on the homology of Rees products of posets .
3	We exactly evaluate the basin free energy and show that it can be separated into a { \it vibrational } ( $ \Delta $ -dependent ) and a { \it floppy } ( $ \Delta $ -independent ) component .	We study the statistical properties of the potential energy landscape of a system of particles interacting via a very short-range square-well potential ( of depth $ -u_0 $ ) , as a function of the range of attraction $ \Delta $ to provide thermodynamic insights of the Noro and Frenkel [ M.G .	Noro and D. Frenkel , J.Chem.Phys .	{ \bf 113 } , 2941 ( 2000 ) ] scaling .	We also show that the partition function is a function of $ \Delta e^ { \beta u_o } $ , explaining the equivalence of the thermodynamics for systems characterized by the same second virial coefficient .
0	The suppression of Y mesons in the hot quark-gluon medium ( QGP ) versus reduced feed-down is investigated in UU collisions at RHIC energies and PbPb collisions at LHC energies .	Our centrality- and p_T-dependent model encompasses screening , collisional damping and gluodissociation in the QGP .	For Y ( nS ) it is in agreement with both STAR and CMS data provided the reduced feed-down from the Y ( nS ) and chi_b ( nP ) states that accounts for more suppression than the in-medium effects is properly considered .	In contrast , most of the suppression for the Y ( 2S ) state occurs in the medium .	A prediction for the centrality-dependent Y ( 1S ) -suppression in PbPb at 5.02 TeV is made .
1	Below , we show that this system violates the general expectation that the number of decay constants needed to fit a first passage time distribution reflects the number of states in the escape problem .	The first passage times for enzymatic turnovers in non-equilibrium steady state display a statistical symmetry property related to non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems , that makes it possible to extract the chemical driving force from single molecule trajectories in non-equilibrium steady state .	In fact , the structure of the kinetic mechanism makes half of the decay times vanish identically from the turnover time distribution .	The terms that cancel out correspond to the eigenvalues of a certain sub-matrix of the master equation matrix for the first exit time problem .	We discuss how these results make modeling and data analysis easier for such systems , and how the turnovers can be measured .
1	It starts from the Smoluchowski equation of interacting Brownian particles in a given shear flow , derives generalized Green-Kubo relations , which contain the transients dynamics formally exactly , and closes the equations using mode coupling approximations .	The nonlinear rheological properties of dense colloidal suspensions under steady shear are discussed within a first principles approach .	Shear thinning of colloidal fluids and dynamical yielding of colloidal glasses arise from a competition between a slowing down of structural relaxation , because of particle interactions , and enhanced decorrelation of fluctuations , caused by the shear advection of density fluctuations .	The integration through transients approach takes account of the dynamic competition , translational invariance enters the concept of wavevector advection , and the mode coupling approximation enables to quantitatively explore the shear-induced suppression of particle caging and the resulting speed-up of the structural relaxation .	Extended comparisons with shear stress data in the linear response and in the nonlinear regime measured in model thermo-sensitive core-shell latices are discussed .
2	The main part of the paper introduces the notion of extension property which , similarly as equicontinuity , equates different topologies on $ C ( X , Y ) $ .	In the paper , we generalize the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem in the setting of uniform spaces .	At first , we recall well-known facts and theorems coming from monographs of Kelley and Willard .	This property enables us to prove the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem for uniform convergence .	The paper culminates with applications , which are motivated by Schwartz 's distribution theory .
3	The first generation of stars consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium .	Mass is constantly being recycled in the universe .	One of the most powerful recycling paths is via stellar mass-loss .	All stars exhibit mass loss with rates ranging from ~10 ( -14 ) to 10 ( -4 ) M ( sun ) yr-1 , depending on spectral type , luminosity class , rotation rate , companion proximity , and evolutionary stage .	These shed material - via massive winds , planetary nebulae and supernova explosions - seeding the interstellar medium with heavier elements .
0	Bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios of both X-ray selected broad-line ( Type-1 ) and narrow-line ( Type-2 ) AGN from the XMM-Newton survey in the COSMOS field are presented .	The sample is composed by 929 AGN ( 382 Type-1 AGN and 547 Type-2 AGN ) and it covers a wide range of redshifts , X-ray luminosities and absorbing column densities .	About 65 % of the sources are spectroscopically identified as either Type-1 or Type-2 AGN ( 83 % and 52 % respectively ) , while accurate photometric redshifts are available for the rest of the sample .	The study of such a large sample of X-ray selected AGN with a high quality multi-wavelength coverage from the far-infrared ( now with the inclusion of Herschel data at 100 micron and 160 micron ) to the optical-UV allows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities , bolometric corrections and Eddington ratios .	The kbol-Lbol relations derived in the present work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable AGN sample , and rely on observed redshifts , X-ray luminosities and column density distributions .
0	Based on Newtonian dynamics , observations show that the luminous masses of astrophysical objects that are the size of a galaxy or larger are not enough to generate the measured motions which they supposedly determine .	This is typically attributed to the existence of dark matter , which possesses mass but does not radiate ( or absorb radiation ) .	Alternatively , the mismatch can be explained if the underlying dynamics is not Newtonian .	Within this conceptual scheme , Modified Newtonian Dynamics ( MOND ) is a successful theoretical paradigm .	MOND is usually expressed in terms of a nonlinear Poisson equation , which is difficult to analyse for arbitrary matter distributions .
4	We provide the first constant ratio competitive algorithm for the non-preemptive setting , which is of particular interest with regard to the known strong lower bound of n for the general problem .	We consider the online resource minimization problem in which jobs with hard deadlines arrive online over time at their release dates .	The task is to determine a feasible schedule on a minimum number of machines .	We rigorously study this problem and derive various algorithms with small constant competitive ratios for interesting restricted problem variants .	As the most important special case , we consider scheduling jobs with agreeable deadlines .
4	However , it is not sufficient to distinguish between turbulence , some other SOC-like models , and other red noise sources .	We determine that the sizes of bursts in mean-square current density in a reduced magnetohydrodynamic ( RMHD ) simulation follow power-law probability density function ( PDF ) .	The PDFs for burst durations and waiting time between bursts are clearly not exponential and could also be power-law .	This suffices to distinguish their behaviour from the original Bak et al .	sandpile model which had exponential waiting time PDFs .
0	The eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian of an electron confined to a plane and subjected to a perpendicular time-independent magnetic field which is the sum of a homogeneous field and an additional field contributed by a singular flux tube , i.e.of zero width , is investigated .	Since both a direct approach based on distribution-valued operators and a limit process starting from a non-singular flux tube , i.e.of finite size , fail , an alternative method is applied leading to consistent results .	An essential feature is quantum mechanical supersymmetry at g=2 which imposes , by proper representation , the correct choice of `` boundary conditions '' .	The corresponding representation of the Hilbert space in coordinate space differs from the usual space of square-integrable 2-spinors , entailing other unusual properties .	The analysis is extended to $ g\ne 2 $ so that supersymmetry is explicitly broken .
3	In this paper , we view registers as elements of a finite field and we compute linear permutations without memory .	Memoryless computation is a novel means of computing any function of a set of registers by updating one register at a time while using no memory .	We aim to emulate how computations are performed on modern cores , since they typically involve updates of single registers .	The computation model of memoryless computation can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups , or in the case of bijective functions , permutation groups .	We first determine the maximum complexity of a linear function when only linear instructions are allowed .
0	We propose and analyze the concept of the vertical hot-electron terahertz ( THz ) graphene-layer detectors ( GLDs ) based on the double-GL and multiple-GL structures with the barrier layers made of materials with a moderate conduction band off-set ( such as tungsten disulfide and related materials ) .	The operation of these detectors is enabled by the thermionic emissions from the GLs enhanced by the electrons heated by incoming THz radiation .	The electron heating is primarily associated with the intraband absorption ( the Drude absorption ) .	We calculate the responsivity and detectivity as functions of the photon energy , GL doping , and the applied voltage for the GL detectors ( GLDs ) with different number of GLs .	The detectors based on the cascade multiple-GL structures can exhibit a substantial photoelectric gain resulting in the elevated responsivity and detectivity .
4	Since our classification implies the non-recursive freeness of the reflection arrangement $ \mathcal { A } ( G_ { 31 } ) $ , we can prove a conjecture by Abe about the new class of divisionally free arrangements which he recently introduced .	Let $ \mathcal { A } = \mathcal { A } ( W ) $ be the reflection arrangement of the finite complex reflection group $ W $ .	By Terao 's famous theorem , the arrangement $ \mathcal { A } $ is free .	In this paper we classify all reflection arrangements which belong to the smaller class of recursively free arrangements .	Moreover for the case that $ W $ admits an irreducible factor isomorphic to $ G_ { 31 } $ we obtain a new ( computer free ) proof for the non-inductive freeness of $ \mathcal { A } ( W ) $ .
4	As an application , we calculate the energy , number , and multiplicity distributions of produced soft gluons and reproduce earlier results by Gunion and Bertsch and by Kovner , McLerran , and Weigert .	The classical Yang-Mills equations are solved perturbatively in covariant gauge for a collision of two ultrarelativistic nuclei .	The nuclei are taken as ensembles of classical color charges on eikonal trajectories .	The classical gluon field is computed in coordinate space up to cubic order in the coupling constant g. We construct the Feynman diagrams corresponding to this field and show the equivalence of the classical and diagrammatic approaches .	An argument is given which demonstrates that at higher orders in g the classical description of the process breaks down .
0	As the first step in an approach to the solution of Hilbert 's sixth problem , a general scheme of mechanics , called `supmech ' , is developed integrating noncommutative symplectic geometry and noncommutative probability theory in an algebraic framework ; it has quantum mechanics ( QM ) and classical mechanics as special subdisciplines and facilitates an autonomous development of QM and satisfactory treatments of quantum-classical correspondence and quantum measurements ( including a straightforward \emph { derivation } of the von Neumann reduction rule ) .	The scheme associates , with every `experimentally accessible ' system , a symplectic superalgebra and operates essentially as noncommutative Hamiltonian mechanics incorporating the extra condition that the sets of observables and pure states be mutually separating .	The latter condition serves to smoothly connect the algebraically defined quantum systems to ilbert space-based ones ; the rigged Hilbert space - based Dirac bra-ket formalism naturally appears .	The formalism has a natural place for commutative superselection rules .	Noncommutative analogues of objects like the momentum map and the Poincar $ \acute { e } $ -Cartan form are introduced and some related symplectic geometry developed .
4	So a literal execution of the above mentioned query will return zero results .	Web search engines and specialized online verticals are increasingly incorporating results from structured data sources to answer semantically rich user queries .	For example , the query \WebQuery { Samsung 50 inch led tv } can be answered using information from a table of television data .	However , the users are not domain experts and quite often enter values that do not match precisely the underlying data .	Samsung makes 46- or 55- inch led tvs , but not 50-inch ones .
1	It has been called the safe operating space , the viability kernel or the sunny region .	The notion of a part of phase space containing desired ( or allowed ) states of a dynamical system is important in a wide range of complex systems research .	In this paper we define the notion of survivability : Given a random initial condition , what is the likelihood that the transient behaviour of a deterministic system leaves the region of desirable states .	In three conceptual examples we show that this basic measure captures notions of fundamental interest for climate models , transient chaos , and synchronisation .	This covers applications to linear and non-linear , multistable and monostable systems .
4	We briefly describe the experimental method , paying special attention to the radiative corrections .	We report on the status of the Novosibirsk experiment on a precision measurement of the ratio $ R $ of the elastic $ e^+ p $ and $ e^- p $ scattering cross sections .	Such measurements determine the two-photon exchange effect in elastic electron-proton scattering .	The experiment is conducted at the VEPP-3 storage ring using a hydrogen internal gas target .	The ratio $ R $ is measured with a beam energy of 1.6 GeV ( electron/positron scattering angles are $ \theta = 55 \div 75^ { \circ } $ and $ \theta = 15 \div 25^ { \circ } $ ) and 1 GeV ( $ \theta = 65 \div 105^ { \circ } $ ) .
3	For the supersymmetrization of the five dimensional Chern-Simons three form this requires the introduction of a new chiral Chern-Simons multiplet .	The five dimensional version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism can be invoked to cancel U ( 1 ) anomalies on the boundaries of brane world models .	In five dimensions there are two dual descriptions that employ either a two-form tensor field or a vector field .	We present the supersymmetric extensions of these dual theories using four dimensional N=1 superspace .	We derive the supersymmetric vector/tensor duality relations and show that not only is the usual one/two-form duality modified , but that there is also an interesting duality relation between the scalar components .
0	{ \alpha } Vir is a well known double-lined spectroscopic binary with a B-type for both components .	In the present paper we have analyzed a total of 90 spectra obtained through 1992-2000 .	Spectral analysis are based on two spectral lines H ( alpha ) and HeI 6678 belong to H ( alpha ) region .	Radial velocity analysis have suggested low eccentric orbit ( e=0.002 ) at inclination ( i=81.89+-2.34 ) and with 4d.01422 period , semi-amplitude k1=100 km/s , mass ratio q=0.49+-0.05 and mass function f ( m ) =0.547 .	Using KOREL program for spectrum disentangling we have been able to decompose the spectrum of the system to its primary and secondary components .
3	We apply this selection technique to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and identify the 200 fields with the highest total LRG luminosities projected within a 3.5 ' radius over the redshift range 0.1 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.7 .	The best gravitational lenses for detecting distant galaxies are those with the largest mass concentrations and the most advantageous configurations of that mass along the line of sight .	Our new method for finding such gravitational telescopes uses optical data to identify projected concentrations of luminous red galaxies ( LRGs ) .	LRGs are biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution , so lines of sight with the highest total luminosity in LRGs are likely to contain the largest total mass .	The redshift and angular distributions of LRGs in these fields trace the concentrations of non-LRG galaxies .
0	We study the nonlinear dynamics of a warped or twisted accretion disc , in which the viscosity coefficients are assumed to be locally proportional to the rotational velocity ( beta- prescription ) .	Using asymptotic methods for thin discs , dynamical equations of the disc are obtained in a warped spherical polar coordinates .	These equations are solved by the method of the separation of the variables .	This analysis constitutes an analogous study of the nonlinear theory of an alpha model warped disc which has been studied by Ogilvie ( 1999 ) .	We have compared our results with Ogilvie 's analysis .
1	In order to achieve the observed Higgs mass around $ 126 $ GeV and also to satisfy constraints on flavor- and/or CP-violating processes , we assume that the SUSY-breaking scale is $ O ( 100 ) $ TeV , so that the $ U ( 1 ) _X $ breaking scale is also $ O ( 100 ) $ TeV .	We propose an $ SO ( 10 ) $ supersymmetric grand unified theory ( SUSY GUT ) , where the $ SO ( 10 ) $ gauge symmetry breaks down to $ SU ( 3 ) _c \times SU ( 2 ) _L \times U ( 1 ) _Y\times U ( 1 ) _ { X } $ at the GUT scale and $ U ( 1 ) _X $ is radiatively broken at the SUSY-braking scale .	One big issue in the SO ( 10 ) GUTs is how to realize realistic Yukawa couplings .	In our model , not only $ { \bf 16 } $ -dimensional but also $ { \bf 10 } $ -dimensional matter fields are introduced to predict the observed fermion masses and mixings .	The Standard-Model quarks and leptons are linear combinations of the $ { \bf 16 } $ - and $ { \bf 10 } $ -dimensional fields so that the $ U ( 1 ) _ { X } $ gauge interaction may be flavor-violating .
4	The results show flatter spectra compared to the spectra of the pressumed sharp discontinuity shock fronts .	The non-linear back reaction of accelerated cosmic rays at the shock fronts , leads to the formation of a smooth precursor with a length scale corresponding to the diffusive scale of the energetic particles .	Past works claimed that shocklets could be created in the precursor region of a specific shock width , which might energize few thermal particles to sufficient acceleration and furthermore this precursor region may act as confining large angle scatterer for very high energy cosmic rays .	On the other hand , it has been shown that the smoothing of the shock front could lower the acceleration efficiency .	These controversies motivated us to investigate numerically by Monte Carlo simulations the particle acceleration efficiency in oblique modified shocks .
4	Due to the presence of a gradient of pressure in the model equations , waves hitting the obstacle may impart acceleration to it .	The scattering of electromagnetic waves by an obstacle is analyzed through a set of partial differential equations combining the Maxwell 's model with the mechanics of fluids .	Solitary type EM waves , having compact support , may easily be modeled in this context since they turn out to be explicit solutions .	From the numerical viewpoint , the interaction of these waves with a material body is examined .	Computations are carried out via a parallel high-order finite-differences code .
0	Nonnegative matrix factorization ( NMF ) has an established reputation as a useful data analysis technique in numerous applications .	However , its usage in practical situations is undergoing challenges in recent years .	The fundamental factor to this is the increasingly growing size of the datasets available and needed in the information sciences .	To address this , in this work we propose to use structured random compression , that is , random projections that exploit the data structure , for two NMF variants : classical and separable .	In separable NMF ( SNMF ) the left factors are a subset of the columns of the input matrix .
1	In particular , this paper addresses the problem of encoding a Bernoulli ( 0.5 ) source : for randomly generated LDGM codes with suitably irregular degree distributions , our methods yield performance very close to the rate distortion limit over a range of rates .	We describe message-passing and decimation approaches for lossy source coding using low-density generator matrix ( LDGM ) codes .	Our approach is inspired by the survey propagation ( SP ) algorithm , originally developed by Mezard et al .	for solving random satisfiability problems .	Previous work by Maneva et al .
4	We furthermore find that electromigrated junctions fabricated from pure titanium are electrically exceptionally stable .	A standard route for fabrication of nanoscopic tunnel junctions is via electromigration of lithographically prepared gold nanowires .	In the lithography process , a thin adhesion layer , typically titanium , is used to promote the adhesion of the gold nanowires to the substrate .	Here , we demonstrate that such an adhesion layer plays a vital role in the electrical transport behavior of electromigrated tunnel junctions .	We show that junctions fabricated from gold deposited on top of a titanium adhesion layer are electrically stable at ambient conditions , in contrast to gold junctions without a titanium adhesion layer .
0	The mid-infrared is an optimal window to trace stellar mass in nearby galaxies and the 3.6 $ \mu m $ IRAC band has been exploited to this effect , but such mass estimates can be biased by dust emission .	We present our pipeline to reveal the old stellar flux at 3.6 $ \mu m $ and obtain stellar mass maps for more than 1600 galaxies available from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies ( S $ ^ { 4 } $ G ) .	This survey consists of images in two infrared bands ( 3.6 and 4.5 $ \mu m $ ) , and we use the Independent Component Analysis ( ICA ) method presented in Meidt et al .	( 2012 ) to separate the dominant light from old stars and the dust emission that can significantly contribute to the observed 3.6 $ \mu m $ flux .	We exclude from our ICA analysis galaxies with low signal-to-noise ratio ( S/N & lt ; 10 ) and those with original [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] colors compatible with an old stellar population , indicative of little dust emission ( mostly early Hubble types , which can directly provide good mass maps ) .
4	Combining these two results gives us a generic construction of codes of inverse polynomial rate , that are testable with poly-logarithmically many queries .	We continue the investigation of locally testable codes , i.e. , error-correcting codes for whom membership of a given word in the code can be tested probabilistically by examining it in very few locations .	We give two general results on local testability : First , motivated by the recently proposed notion of { \em robust } probabilistically checkable proofs , we introduce the notion of { \em robust } local testability of codes .	We relate this notion to a product of codes introduced by Tanner , and show a very simple composition lemma for this notion .	Next , we show that codes built by tensor products can be tested robustly and somewhat locally , by applying a variant of a test and proof technique introduced by Raz and Safra in the context of testing low-degree multivariate polynomials ( which are a special case of tensor codes ) .
4	Also , we conjecture that the same inequality is tighter to $ S_ { n } ^ { + } $ than any other graph on $ n $ vertices .	Let G be a simple graph on $ n $ vertices and $ e ( G ) $ edges .	Consider $ Q ( G ) = D + A $ as the signless Laplacian of $ G $ , where $ A $ is the adjacency matrix and $ D $ is the diagonal matrix of the vertices degree of $ G $ .	Let $ q_1 ( G ) $ and $ q_2 ( G ) $ be the first and the second largest eigenvalues of $ Q ( G ) , $ respectively , and denote by $ S_ { n } ^ { + } $ the star graph plus one edge .	In this paper , we prove that inequality $ q_1 ( G ) + q_2 ( G ) & lt ; = e ( G ) +3 $ is tighter for the graph $ S_ { n } ^ { + } $ among all firefly graphs and also tighter to $ S_ { n } ^ { + } $ than to the graphs $ K_ { k } \vee \overline { K_ { n-k } } $ recently presented by Ashraf , Omidi and Tayfeh-Rezaie .
4	In line with previous findings , these results allow one to compute the critical Casimir force for the film geometry and in the presence of arbitrarily shaped , but wide stripes .	Recent experimental realizations of the critical Casimir effect have been implemented by monitoring colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture near demixing and exposed to a chemically structured substrate .	In particular , critical Casimir forces have been measured for surfaces consisting of stripes with periodically alternating adsorption preferences , forming chemical steps between them .	Motivated by these experiments , we analyze the contribution of such chemical steps to the critical Casimir force for the film geometry and within the Ising universality class .	By means of Monte Carlo simulations , mean-field theory , and finite-size scaling analysis we determine the universal scaling function associated with the contribution to the critical Casimir force due to individual , isolated chemical steps facing a surface with homogeneous adsorption preference or with Dirichlet boundary condition .
0	In this note we consider $ { \cal N } =4 $ SYM theories in 2+1 dimensions with gauge group $ U ( N ) \times U ( M ) $ and $ k $ hypermultiplets charged under the $ U ( N ) $ .	When $ k & gt ; 2 ( N-M ) $ , the theory flows to a superconformal fixed point in the IR .	Theories with $ k & lt ; 2 ( N-M ) $ , on the other hand , flows to strong coupling .	We explore these theories from the perspective of gravity dual .	We find that the gravity duals of theories with $ k & lt ; ( N-M ) $ contain enhancons even in situations where repulson singularities are absent .
0	The non-perturbative behavior of the N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is both highly non-trivial and tractable .	In the last three years the valuable progress was achieved in the instanton counting , the direct evaluation of the low-energy effective Wilsonian action of the theory .	The localization technique together with the Lorentz deformation of the action provides an elegant way to reduce functional integrals , representing the effective action , to some finite dimensional contour integrals .	These integrals , in their turn , can be converted into some difference equations which define the Seiberg-Witten curves , the main ingredient of another approach to the non-perturbative computations in the N=2 super Yang-Mills theories .	Almost all models with classical gauge groups , allowed by the asymptotic freedom condition can be treated in such a way .
3	First , we compare two independent criteria for choosing the orbital frequency , the `` Komar-mass condition '' and the `` effective-potential method , '' and find excellent agreement .	The construction of initial data for black-hole binaries usually involves the choice of free parameters that define the spins of the black holes and essentially the eccentricity of the orbit .	Such parameters must be chosen carefully to yield initial data with the desired physical properties .	In this paper , we examine these choices in detail for the quasiequilibrium method coupled to apparent-horizon/quasiequilibrium boundary conditions .	Second , we implement quasi-local measures of the spin of the individual holes , calibrate these with corotating binaries , and revisit the construction of non-spinning black hole binaries .
4	Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one direction or the other , but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are known .	Molecular phylogeny has focused mainly on improving models for the reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alignments .	Yet , most phylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species .	Although the histories of genes and species are tightly linked , they are seldom identical , because genes duplicate , are lost or horizontally transferred , and because alleles can co-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events .	Building models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can thus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known , and vice-versa .
1	In this paper , when the Laplace exponent $ \phi $ of the corresponding subordinator satisfies some mild conditions , we first prove the scale invariant boundary Harnack inequality for $ X $ on arbitrary open sets .	A subordinate Brownian motion $ X $ is a L\'evy process which can be obtained by replacing the time of the Brownian motion by an independent subordinator .	Then we give an explicit form of sharp two-sided estimates on the Green functions of these subordinate Brownian motions in any bounded $ C^ { 1,1 } $ open set .	As a consequence , we prove the boundary Harnack inequality for $ X $ on any $ C^ { 1,1 } $ open set with explicit decay rate .	Unlike { KSV2 , KSV4 } , our results cover geometric stable processes and relativistic geometric stable process , i.e.the cases when the subordinator has the Laplace exponent $ $ \phi ( \lambda ) =\log ( 1+\lambda^ { \alpha/2 } ) ( 0 & lt ; \alpha\leq 2 , d & gt ; \alpha ) $ $ and $ $ \phi ( \lambda ) =\log ( 1+ ( \lambda+m^ { \alpha/2 } ) ^ { 2/\alpha } -m ) ( 0 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; 2 , \ , m & gt ; 0 , d & gt ; 2 ) . $ $
2	We write the evolution equations of the reduced density matrix of the two-qubit system after integrating out the electromagnetic field modes .	We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a pair of qubits made of two-level atoms separated in space with distance $ r $ and interacting with one common electromagnetic field but not directly with each other .	Our calculation makes a weak coupling assumption but no Born or Markov approximation .	We study two classes of states in detail : Class A is a one parameter family of states which are the superposition of the highest energy and lowest energy states , and Class B states which are the linear combinations of the symmetric and the antisymmetric Bell states .	Our results for an initial Bell state are similar to those obtained before for the same model derived under the Born-Markov approximation .
3	This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics , in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory .	The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems .	These probabilities are important in many fields of study , including statistics , finance , and engineering , as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory .	In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics , the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein 's theory of fluctuations .	The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory , and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes .
3	The CALICO approach relies on the synchronization of a model view , which specifies the application properties , and a runtime view , which contains the application in its execution context .	Agile development processes and component-based software architectures are two software engineering approaches that contribute to enable the rapid building and evolution of applications .	Nevertheless , few approaches have proposed a framework to combine agile and component-based development , allowing an application to be tested throughout the entire development cycle .	To address this problematic , we have built CALICO , a model-based framework that allows applications to be safely developed in an iterative and incremental manner .	Tests on the application specifications that require values only known at runtime , are automatically integrated by CALICO into the running application , and the captured needed values are reified at execution time to resume the tests and inform the architect of potential problems .
1	Our results are compared with broad spectrum of existing theoretical quark models and all experimental data from PDG98 .	We scrutinized hadronic Regge trajectories in a framework of two different models -- - string and potential .	It was recognized that Regge trajectories for mesons and baryons are not straight and parallel lines in general in the current resonance region both experimentally and theoretically , but very often have appreciable curvature , which is flavor-dependent .	For a set of baryon Regge trajectories this fact is well described in the considered potential model .	The standard string models predict linear trajectories at high angular momenta J with some form of nonlinearity at low J .
4	Within a radius of 2 Mpc , we found masses of Mgas = 1.2e14 Msun and Mtot = 6.5e14 Msun , and a gas mass fraction of about 19 % .	The cluster A2597 was observed in X-rays with the ROSAT PSPC and HRI detectors .	The X-ray isophotes are oriented similarly to the optical isophotes of the central cD galaxy and to the isopleths of the galaxy distribution in the cluster , but are otherwise quite regular , suggesting that this cluster is reasonably relaxed and in hydrostatic equilibrium .	The merged HRI and PSPC surface brightness profile is not adequately fit by a beta model because of the central X-ray surface brightness peak , indicating the presence of a cooling flow .	If the central 108 arcsec in radius are excluded , an acceptable fit is found which gives beta = 0.64 but only an upper limit to the core radius , rcore & lt ; 78 arcsec .
3	Our prediction can be tested with the satellite-borne Fermi/LAT detector as well as with the ground-based IACTs H.E.S.S. , MAGIC , CANGAROOIII , VERITAS and the Extensive Air Shower arrays ARGO-YBJ andMILAGRO .	An anomalously large transparency of the Universe to gamma rays has recently been discovered by the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes ( IACTs ) H.E.S.S.and MAGIC .	We show that observations can be reconciled with standard blazar emission models provided photon oscillations into a very light Axion-Like Particle occur in extragalactic magnetic fields .	A quantitative estimate of this effect is successfully applied to the blazar 3C279 .	Our result also offers an important observational test for models of dark energy wherein quintessence is coupled to the photon through an effective dimension-five operator .
2	While these approaches are computationally efficient , they rely on fixed image regions as anchors for predictions .	State-of-the-art object detection systems rely on an accurate set of region proposals .	Several recent methods use a neural network architecture to hypothesize promising object locations .	In this paper we propose to use a search strategy that adaptively directs computational resources to sub-regions likely to contain objects .	Compared to methods based on fixed anchor locations , our approach naturally adapts to cases where object instances are sparse and small .
1	We show that On-Shell Effective Theories ( OSETs ) effectively characterize hadron collider data in terms of masses , production cross sections , and decay modes of candidate new particles .	We describe a coherent strategy and set of tools for reconstructing the fundamental theory of the TeV scale from LHC data .	An OSET description of the data strongly constrains the underlying new physics , and sharply motivates the construction of its Lagrangian .	Simulating OSETs allows efficient analysis of new-physics signals , especially when they arise from complicated production and decay topologies .	To this end , we present MARMOSET , a Monte Carlo tool for simulating the OSET version of essentially any new-physics model .
2	Interestingly , our analysis provides a reduction method that is valid regardless of whether or not the system is isotropic .	We explain a method , inspired by control theory model reduction and interpolation theory , that rigorously establishes the types of coarse graining that are appropriate for systems with quadratic , generalized Hamiltonians .	For such systems , general conditions are given that establish when local coarse grainings should be valid .	We provide the linear harmonic chain as a prototypical example .	Additionally , these reduction techniques are based on the dynamic response of the system , and hence are also applicable to nonequilibrium systems .
0	We consider a model of the double perovskite Ba2FeReO6 , a room temperature ferrimagnet with correlated and spin-orbit coupled Re t2g electrons moving in the background of Fe moments stabilized by Hund 's coupling .	We show that for such 3d/5d double perovskites , strong correlations on the 5d-element ( Re ) are essential in driving a half-metallic ground state .	Incorporating both strong spin-orbit coupling and the Hubbard repulsion on Re leads to a band structure consistent with ab initio calculations .	Using our model , we find a large spin polarization at the Fermi level , and obtain a semi-quantitative understanding of the saturation magnetization of Ba2FeReO6 , as well as X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data indicating a significant orbital magnetization .	Based on the orbital populations obtained in our theory , we predict a specific doping dependence to the tetragonal distortion accompanying ferrimagnetic order .
4	To do so , we exploit a natural complexification of the scattering map associated with the ZS-AKNS system .	This is the first in a series of papers on scattering theory for one-dimensional Schr\ '' odinger operators with highly singular potentials $ q\in H^ { -1 } ( R ) $ .	In this paper , we study Miura potentials $ q $ associated to positive Schr\ '' odinger operators that admit a Riccati representation $ q=u'+u^2 $ for a unique $ u\in L^1 ( R ) \cap L^2 ( R ) $ .	Such potentials have a well-defined reflection coefficient $ r ( k ) $ that satisfies $ |r ( k ) | & lt ; 1 $ and determines $ u $ uniquely .	We show that the scattering map $ S : u\mapsto r $ is real-analytic with real-analytic inverse .
3	Several results on the long time behavior of the conditioned mass process|the conditioned multitype Feller branching diffusion are then proved .	A multitype Dawson-Watanabe process is conditioned , in subcritical and critical cases , on non-extinction in the remote future .	On every finite time interval , its distribution is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the unconditioned process .	A martingale problem characterization is also given .	The general case is first considered , where the mutation matrix which models the interaction between the types , is irreducible .
0	Charge transport in electrorheological fluids is studied experimentally under strongly nonequlibrium conditions .	By injecting an electrical current into a suspension of conducting nanoparticles we are able to initiate a process of self-organization which leads , in certain cases , to formation of a stable pattern which consists of continuous conducting chains of particles .	The evolution of the dissipative state in such system is a complex process .	It starts as an avalanche process characterized by nucleation , growth , and thermal destruction of such dissipative elements as continuous conducting chains of particles as well as electroconvective vortices .	A power-law distribution of avalanche sizes and durations , observed at this stage of the evolution , indicates that the system is in a self-organized critical state .
0	Complementary diffuse and inelastic synchrotron X-ray scattering measurements of lead zirconate-titanate single crystals with composition near the morphotropic phase boundary ( x=0.475 ) are reported .	In the temperature range 293 K & lt ; T & lt ; 400 K a highly anisotropic quasielastic diffuse scattering is observed .	Above 400 K this scattering disappears .	Its main features can be reproduced by model of inhomogeneous lattice deformations caused by inclusions of a tetragonal phase into a rhombohedral or monoclinic phase .	This observation supports the idea that PZT at its morphotropic phase boundary is essentially structurally inhomogeneous .
4	The low viscosity case , which corresponds to a dwarf nova in quiescense , also shows a BL , but it is optically thin .	We describe the results of numerical simulations of the dynamics of the boundary layer ( BL ) between the accretion disk and the surface of a non-magnetic white dwarf ( WD ) for different viscosities which corresponds to different stages for dwarf novae burst cycles .	The simulations cover the inner part of the accretion disk , the BL , and the upper atmosphere of the star .	The high viscosity case , which corresponds to a dwarf nova in outburst , shows a optically thick BL which after one Keplerian rotation period ( t_K=19s ) extends more than 30 degrees to either side of the disk plane .	The BL is optically thick and thus occludes part of the star .
0	The physics of collisionless relativistic shocks with a moderate magnetization is presented .	Micro-physics is relevant to explain the most energetic radiative phenomena of Nature , namely that of the termination shock of Gamma Ray Bursts .	A transition towards Fermi process occurs for decreasing magnetization around a critical value which turns out to be the condition for the scattering to break the mean field inhibition .	Scattering is produced by magnetic micro-turbulence driven by the current carried by returning particles , which had not been considered till now , but turns out to be more intense than Weibel 's one around the transition .	The current is also responsible for a buffer effect on the motion of the incoming flow , on which the threshold for the onset of turbulence depends .
4	The expansion of the $ f $ -mode is stronger for fields confined to the layer below the surface .	We show that in the presence of a harmonically varying magnetic field the fundamental or $ f $ -mode in a stratified layer is altered in such a way that it fans out in the diagnostic $ k\omega $ diagram , but with mode power also within the fan .	In our simulations , the surface is defined by a temperature and density jump in a piecewise isothermal layer .	Unlike our previous work ( Singh et al .	2014 ) where a uniform magnetic field was considered , we employ here a nonuniform magnetic field together with hydromagnetic turbulence at length scales much smaller than those of the magnetic fields .
2	Cisco devices run Cisco Discovery Protocol ( CDP ) which holds information about these devices .	In this paper we address the problem of discovering network topology in proprietary networks .	Namely , we investigate topology discovery in Cisco-based networks .	We first compare properties of topologies that can be obtained from networks deploying CDP versus Spanning Tree Protocol ( STP ) and Management Information Base ( MIB ) Forwarding Database ( FDB ) .	Then we describe a method of discovering topology of CDP-based networks .
3	Self-affinity enters through the scaling of the standard deviation $ \sigma $ , which is proportional to $ \delta^\zeta $ with a unique roughness exponent .	We analyse the statistical distribution function for the height fluctuations of brittle fracture surfaces using extensive experimental data sampled on widely different materials and geometries .	We compare a direct measurement of the distribution to a new analysis based on the structure functions .	For length scales $ \delta $ larger than a characteristic scale $ \delta^* $ , we find that the distribution of the height increments $ \Delta h = h ( x+ \delta ) -h ( x ) $ is Gaussian .	Below the scale $ \delta^* $ we observe an effective multi-affine behavior of the height fluctuations and a deviation from a Gaussian distribution which is related to the discreteness of the measurement or of the material .
0	A theory of higher-derivative 2D dilaton gravity which has its roots in the massive higher-spin mode dynamics of string theory is suggested .	The divergences of the effective action to one-loop are calculated , both in the covariant and in the conformal gauge .	Some technical problems which appear in the calculations are discussed .	An interpretation of the theory as a particular D=2 higher-derivative $ \sigma $ -model is given .	For a specific case of higher-derivative 2D dilaton gravity , which is one loop multiplicatively renormalizable , static configurations corresponding to black holes are shown to exist .
0	We consider a model of multiband superconductivity , inspired by iron pnictides , in which three bands are connected via repulsive pair-scattering terms .	Generically , three distinct superconducting states arise within such a model .	Two of them are straightforward generalizations of the two-gap order parameter while the third one corresponds to a time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter , altogether absent within the two-band model .	Potential observation of such a genuinely frustrated state would be a particularly vivid manifestation of the repulsive interactions being at the root of iron-based high temperature superconductivity .	We construct the phase diagram of this model and discuss its relevance to the iron pnictides family of high temperature superconductors .
3	A remarkable agreement between the calculated and observed frequency shifts for the ascending phase of cycle 23 indicates that the derived relations are independent of epoch and do not change significantly from cycle to cycle .	We have obtained empirical relations between the p-mode frequency shift and the change in solar activity indices .	The empirical relations are determined on the basis of frequencies obtained from BBSO and GONG stations during solar cycle 22 .	These relations are applied to estimate the change in mean frequency for the cycle 21 and 23 .	We propose that these relations could be used to estimate the shift in p-mode frequencies for past , present and future solar activity cycles , if the solar activity index is known .
2	We examine the exactness of mean-field steady-state mass distributions in dependence of $ \phi $ and identify as a conjecture based on high order calculations the class $ \mathcal { M } $ of density functions yielding product measure solutions .	We consider the asymmetric random average process ( ARAP ) with continuous mass variables and parallel discrete time dynamics studied recently by Krug/Garcia and Rajesh/Majumdar [ both Jrl.Stat.Phys.99 ( 2000 ) ] .	The model is defined by an arbitrary state-independent fraction density function $ \phi ( r ) $ with support on the unit interval .	Additionally the exact form of the associated mass distributions P ( m ) is derived .	Using these results we show examplary the exactness of the mean-field ansatz for monomial fraction densities $ \phi ( r ) = ( n-1 ) r^ { n-2 } $ with $ n \geq 2 $ .
0	We predict intensities of lines of CII , NI , NII , OI and OII and compare them with a deep spectroscopic survey of IC 418 to test the effect of excitation of nebular emission lines by continuum fluorescence of starlight .	Our calculations use a nebular model and a synthetic spectrum of its central star to take into account excitation of the lines by continuum fluorescence and recombination .	The NII spectrum is mostly produced by fluorescence due to the low excitation conditions of the nebula , but many CII and OII lines have more excitation by fluorescence than recombination .	In the neutral envelope , the NI permitted lines are excited by fluorescence , and almost all the OI lines are excited by recombination .	Electron excitation produces the forbidden optical lines of OI , but continuum fluorescence excites most of the NI forbidden line intensities .
4	We predict that under proper epitaxial strain the Tc of LSCO and Bi-2201 should increase from 30 's all the way upto the intrinsic Tc $ \sim $ 90 K , at optimal doping .	Members of the high Tc cuprate family ( with defect free $ CuO_2 $ planes ) are suggested to have an ` { \em Intrinsic single layer superconducting } Tc ' , larger than the experimentally observed Tc , at a given hole concentration .	This difference occurs to varying degrees among the different members , due to an anomalous response of the d-wave superconducting state to self generated charge perturbations .	In particular , any quasi elastic charge stripe order , arising from electron-electron and electron- lattice coupling , can suppress the large intrinsic superconducting Tc .	Existing experimental results on the wide Tc variation in the single layer cuprate families , such as the low Tc ( $ \approx 38 K , 33 K $ ) of LSCO and Bi-2201 compared to high Tc ( $ \approx 95 K , 98 K $ ) of Tl-2201 and Hg-1201 , the strain induced increase in Tc ( 25 to 50 K ) observed in LSCO are qualitatively explained by our mechanism .
2	The pi+ and subsequent mu+ decay at rest , providing a neutrino beam comprising numu , nue , and anti-numu components .	The Spallation Neutron Source ( SNS ) , located at Oak Ridge Laboratory in the United States , will be coming online over the next few years .	In addition to producing fluxes of high-intensity neutrons , the interaction of the proton beam with the liquid mercury target produces copious pions .	This neutrino beam is ideal for high-precision neutrino experiments .	OscSNS is a proposed multi-purpose experiment that will perform a search for light sterile neutrinos , search for beyond the Standard Model interactions using neutrino oscillations , and provide tests of Standard Model predictions through world-record precision neutrino cross section measurements .
2	In this model , security violations occur when processes attempt to read or write messages of inappropriate security levels within directed exchanges .	We present initial results on a comprehensive model of structured communications , in which self- adaptation and security concerns are jointly addressed .	More specifically , we propose a model of self-adaptive , multiparty communications with secure information flow guarantees .	Such violations trigger adaptation mechanisms that prevent the violations to occur and/or to propagate their effect in the choreography .	Our model is equipped with local and global mechanisms for reacting to security violations ; type soundness results ensure that global protocols are still correctly executed , while the system adapts itself to preserve security .
2	However , towards the true thermodynamic limit , the high-frequency scaling regime extends to lower frequencies for larger chain length $ L $ and the system has only one scaling ( $ A_ { \rm loop } \approx \nu^ { -1 } F^2 ) $ .	We propose a generic model of driven DNA under the influence of an oscillatory force of amplitude $ F $ and frequency $ \nu $ and show the existence of a dynamical transition for a chain of finite length .	We find that the area of the hysteresis loop , $ A_ { \rm loop } $ , scales with the same exponents as observed in a recent study based on a much more detailed model .	Expansion of an analytical expression for $ A_ { \rm loop } $ obtained for the model system in the low-force regime revealed that there is a new scaling exponent associated with force ( $ A_ { \rm loop } \approx \nu^ { -1 } F^ { 2.5 } $ ) , which has been validated by high-precision numerical calculation .	By a combination of analytical and numerical arguments , we also deduce that for large but finite $ L $ , the exponents are robust and independent of temperature and friction coefficient .
3	We identify paths along which alternate unviable states are reached , and hence critical nodes whose state changes lead the system away from the wild-type state .	Continuous and Boolean models for the Drosophila segment polarity network have shown that the system is able to maintain the wild-type pattern when subjected to sustained changes in the interaction parameters and initial conditions .	Embryo development is likely to occur under fluctuating environmental conditions .	We use a well-established Boolean model to explore the ability of the segment polarity network to resist transient changes .	We find that the system appears to be more sensitive to changes that involve activation of normally inactive nodes .
4	The methods are applied assuming that only the phylogeny and the function-valued traits of taxa at its tips are known .	Many biological characteristics of evolutionary interest are not scalar variables but continuous functions .	Given a dataset of function-valued traits generated by evolution , we develop a practical statistical approach to infer ancestral function-valued traits , and estimate the generative evolutionary process .	We do this by combining dimension reduction and phylogenetic Gaussian process regression , a nonparametric procedure which explicitly accounts for known phylogenetic relationships .	We test the methods ' performance on simulated function-valued data generated from a stochastic evolutionary model .
4	The Tc keeps increasing to about 4.0 K at 21.3 GPa , then shows a nearly constant pressure dependence up to the highest pressure 50.9 GPa .	The recently discovered Dirac and Weyl semimetals are new members of topological materials .	Starting from them , topological superconductivity may be achieved , e.g.by carrier doping or applying pressure .	Here we report high-pressure resistance and X-ray diffraction study of the three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 .	Superconductivity with Tc ~ 2.0 K is observed at 8.5 GPa .
4	We achieve this by normalizing the polynomials , employing efficient and stable recurrence relations , and precomputing coefficients .	Associated Legendre polynomials and spherical harmonics are central to calculations in many fields of science and mathematics - not only chemistry but computer graphics , magnetic , seismology and geodesy .	There are a number of algorithms for these functions published since 1960 but none of them satisfy our requirements .	In this paper , we present a comprehensive review of algorithms in the literature and , based on them , propose an efficient and accurate code for quantum chemistry .	Our requirements are to efficiently calculate these functions for all non-negative integer degrees and orders up to a given number ( & lt ; =1000 ) and the absolute or the relative error of each calculated value should not exceed 10E-10 .
2	The model is devised to simulate the laboratory set-up of fragmentation experiments as monitored by 4pi detectors .	A 3D Cellular Automaton model developed by the authors to deal with the dynamics of N-body interactions has been adapted to investigate the head-on collision of two identical bound clusters of particles , and the ensuing process of fragmentation .	The range of impact energies is chosen low enough , to secure that a compound bound cluster can be formed .	The particles interact via a Lennard-Jones potential .	At low impact energies the numerical experiments following the dynamics of the individual particles indicate a phase of energy sharing among all the particles of the compound cluster .
0	The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves ( NANOGrav ) is a consortium of astronomers whose goal is the creation of a galactic scale gravitational wave observatory sensitive to gravitational waves in the nHz-microHz band .	It is just one component of an international collaboration involving similar organizations of European and Australian astronomers who share the same goal .	Gravitational waves , a prediction of Einstein 's general theory of relativity , are a phenomenon of dynamical space-time generated by the bulk motion of matter , and the dynamics of space-time itself .	They are detectable by the small disturbance they cause in the light travel time between some light source and an observer .	NANOGrav exploits radio pulsars as both the light ( radio ) source and the clock against which the light travel time is measured .
1	We consider both gluino and chargino exchanges in a model independent way by using the mass insertion approximation method .	We analyse the CP asymmetry of the B -- & gt ; phi K and B -- & gt ; eta ' K processes in general supersymmetric models .	We adopt the QCD factorization method for evaluating the corresponding hadronic matrix elements .	We show that chromomagnetic type of operator may play an important role in accounting for the deviation of the mixing CP asymmetry between B -- & gt ; phi K and B -- & gt ; J/psi K processes observed by Belle and BaBar experiments .	We also show that due to the different parity in the final states of these processes , their supersymmetric contributions from the R-sector have an opposite sign , which naturally explain the large deviation between their asymmetries .
1	Even though only a small fraction of observed bursts exhibit such pulses , these are of interest to study as they reflect individual emission episodes during the burst .	We find and study a variety of the spectral-temporal behavior during the decay phase of long and bright GRB pulses .	We have previously found that for about half of these decays , the instantaneous photon flux ~ 1/time , which is a consequence of the validity of both a power-law hardness-intensity correlation ( HIC ) and an exponential hardness-fluence correlation ( HFC ) .	Here , we study a complete sample of 25 BATSE pulses ( having a peak flux in 1 s resolution of & gt ; 5 photons/s/cm^2 and a S/N of 30 in at least 8 time bins ) and , specifically , search for other types of decay behaviors .	First , we find that a power law gives a better description of the pulse decays than a stretched exponential , the most commonly assumed pulse shape so far .
0	We describe an accurate , one-dimensional , spherically symmetric , Lagrangian hydrodynamics/gravity code , designed to study the effects of radiative cooling and photo-ionization on the formation of protogalaxies .	The code can treat an arbitrary number of fluid shells ( representing baryons ) and collisionless shells ( representing cold dark matter ) .	As a test of the code , we reproduce analytic solutions for the pulsation behavior of a polytrope and for the self-similar collapse of a spherically symmetric , cosmological perturbation .	In this paper , we concentrate on the effects of radiative cooling , examining the ability of collapsing perturbations to cool within the age of the universe .	In contrast to some studies based on order-of- magnitude estimates , we find that cooling arguments alone can not explain the sharp upper cutoff observed in the galaxy luminosity function .
3	For example , the control equation can be applied to the approximation methods based on the reduction of the evolution equation to finite-dimensional manifolds : among them , the Galerkin method is discussed in detail .	A general framework is presented to discuss the approximate solutions of an evolution equation in a Banach space , with a linear part generating a semigroup and a sufficiently smooth nonlinear part .	A theorem is presented , allowing to infer from an approximate solution the existence of an exact solution .	According to this theorem , the interval of existence of the exact solution and the distance of the latter from the approximate solution can be evaluated solving a one-dimensional `` control '' integral equation , where the unknown gives a bound on the previous distance as a function of time .	To illustrate this framework , the nonlinear heat equation is considered .
4	We note that these tasks were accomplished prior to the submission of the above paper .	We comment on a recent paper by Weiser et al . [ Phys.Rev .	C { \bf 54 } , 1930 ( 1996 ) ] .	The authors have performed a single-energy analysis of $ \pi^+ p $ scattering data at 68.3 MeV , finding a value for the $ S_ { 31 } $ phase shift about 1^o smaller than found in the Karlsruhe-Helsinki ( KH ) partial-wave analysis .	The authors use this result to argue for a dispersion relation analysis using recently measured data , so that their effect on the $ \pi NN $ coupling constant ( f^2 ) and $ \Sigma $ amplitude can be determined .
2	For the sum rate of each of these , we derive simple closed-form formulas .	In this paper , we consider massive multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) systems for both downlink and uplink scenarios , where three radio units ( RUs ) connected via one digital unit ( DU ) support multiple user equipments ( UEs ) at the cell-boundary through the same radio resource , i.e. , the same time-frequency slot .	For downlink transmitter options , the study considers zero-forcing ( ZF ) and maximum ratio transmission ( MRT ) , while for uplink receiver options it considers ZF and maximum ratio combining ( MRC ) .	In the simple but practically relevant case where uniform power is allocated to all downlink data streams , we observe that , for the downlink , vector normalization is better for ZF while matrix normalization is better for MRT .	For a given antenna and user configuration , we also derive analytically the signal-to-noise-ratio ( SNR ) level below which MRC should be used instead of ZF .
0	Analyzing the static spherically symmetric and rotating ellipsoid solutions in the Newtonian limit of Jordan , Brance - Dicke theory we find the following .	In empty space scalar-tensor theories have trivial solution of field equation with constant scalar potential ( efficient value of gravitation constant ) .	In this case no celestial-mechanical experiments to reveal a difference between scalar-tensor theories and Einstein theory is not presented possible .	However , scalar field , inside the matter , has characteristics like gravitation permeability of material similar electromagnetic permeability of material in Maxwell theories of electromagnetism .	Investigation of obtained exact solutions for given functions of a matter distributions in the Newtonian limit of Jordan , Brance - Dicke theory show the efficient value of gravitation constant depends on density of matter , sizes and form of object , as well as on the value of theories coupling constant .
3	For scales larger than $ l_0 $ we predict a stretched exponential decay to 1 of the pair correlation function .	We demonstrate that diffusiophoretic , thermophoretic and chemotactic phenomena in turbulence lead to clustering of particles on multi-fractal sets that can be described using one single framework , valid when the particle size is much smaller than the smallest length scale of turbulence $ l_0 $ .	To quantify the clustering , we derive positive pair correlations and fractal dimensions that hold for scales smaller than $ l_0 $ .	Statistics of the number of particles in a small volume are non-Poissonian manifesting deviations from the case of uncorrelated particles .	For the case of inhomogeneous turbulence we find that the fractal dimension depends on the inhomogeneous direction .
4	We then prove global well-posedness in $ H^ { 1/2 } $ for the variant of ( \ref { Abs_magform } ) , where $ \mathbb { P } w $ is replaced by $ w $ in the second nonlinear term : \begin { equation } \label { Abs_Simplified } \partial_tw + ( \mathbb { P } w \cdot\nabla ) w + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \nabla|w|^2- \mathrm { \Delta } w =0 .	The Navier -- Stokes equations can be reformulated in terms of so-called magnetization variables $ w $ that satisfy \begin { equation } \label { Abs_magform } \partial_tw + ( \mathbb { P } w \cdot\nabla ) w + ( \nabla \mathbb { P } w ) ^\top w - \mathrm { \Delta } w =0 , \end { equation } and relate to the classical velocity $ u $ via a Leray projection $ u=\mathbb { P } w $ .	Working on the 3-dimensional torus , we review how this is an equivalent formulation for classical solutions .	Moreover we prove that if $ w\in L^\infty ( 0 , T ; L^2 ) \cap L^2 ( 0 , T ; H^1 ) $ is a weak solution of ( \ref { Abs_magform } ) , then $ \mathbb { P } w $ is a weak solution of the Navier -- Stokes equations .	For a more regular weak solution of the Navier -- Stokes equations $ u\in L^\infty ( 0 , T ; H^ { 1/2 } ) \cap L^2 ( 0 , T ; H^ { 3/2 } ) $ we show that there exists a solution $ w $ to ( \ref { Abs_magform } ) that is uniquely determined by the initial data $ w_0 $ such that $ \mathbb { P } w_0=u_0 $ .
4	Finite contributions to dielectric screening are expected in all orders of perturbation theory .	We discuss the effect of electron-electron interactions on the static polarization properties of graphene beyond RPA .	Divergent self-energy corrections are naturally absorbed into the renormalized coupling constant $ \alpha $ .	We find that the lowest order vertex correction , which is the first non-trivial correlation contribution , is finite , and about 30 % of the RPA result at strong coupling $ \alpha \sim 1 $ .	The vertex correction leads to further reduction of the effective charge .
3	Spectroscopic distances suggests that 27 of the M dwarfs , 3 of the white dwarfs , and one of the subdwarfs ( LSR2036+5059 ) are within 25pc of the Sun , making them excellent candidates for inclusion in the solar neighborhood census .	We define an enhanced spectral classification scheme for M dwarf stars , and use it to derive spectral classification of 104 northern stars with proper motions larger than 0.5 '' /yr which we discovered in a survey of high proper motion stars at low galactic latitudes .	The final tally is as follows : 54 M dwarfs , 25 sdK and sdM subdwarfs , 14 esdK and esdM extreme subdwarfs , and 11 DA and DC white dwarfs .	Among the most interesting cases , we find one star to be the coolest subdwarf ever reported ( LSR2036+5059 , with spectral type sdM7.5 ) , a new M9.0 dwarf only about 6pc distant ( LSR1835+3259 ) , and a new M6.5 dwarf only 7pc from the Sun ( LSR2124+4003 ) .	Estimated sky-projected velocities suggest that most of our subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs have halo kinematics .
2	This outcome evidences that the tolerance factor is in fact a more reliable representative of the lattice deformation induced by doping .	This work is focused on the phase diagrams and physical properties of Y-doped and Lu-doped EuMnO3 .	The differences in the corresponding phase boundaries in the ( x , T ) phase diagram could be overcome by considering a scaling of the Y3+ and Lu3+ concentrations to the tolerance factor .	The normalization of the phase boundaries using the tolerance factor corroborates previous theoretical outcomes regarding the key role of competitive FM and AFM exchanges in determining the phase diagrams of manganite perovskites .	Though , significant differences in the nature and number of phases at low temperatures and concentrations could not be explained by just considering the normalization to the tolerance factor .
3	These representations allow to derive rigorously the Seiberg-Witten geometry , the curves , the differentials , and the prepotential .	We study N=2 supersymmetric four dimensional gauge theories , in a certain N=2 supergravity background , called Omega-background .	The partition function of the theory in the Omega-background can be calculated explicitly .	We investigate various representations for this partition function : a statistical sum over random partitions , a partition function of the ensemble of random curves , a free fermion correlator .	We study pure N=2 theory , as well as the theory with matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental or adjoint representations , and the five dimensional theory compactified on a circle .
1	The novel feature of adaptive perturbation theory is that it decomposes a given Hamiltonian , $ H $ , into an unperturbed part and a perturbation in a way which extracts the leading non-perturbative behavior of the problem exactly .	Adaptive perturbation is a new method for perturbatively computing the eigenvalues and eigenstates of quantum mechanical Hamiltonians that heretofore were not believed to be obtainable by such methods .	This paper introduces the method in the context of the pure anharmonic oscillator and then goes on to apply it to the case of tunneling between both symmetric and asymmetric minima .	It concludes with an introduction to the extension of these methods to the discussion of a quantum field theory .	A more complete discussion of this issue will be given in the second paper in this series .
0	We will show that if $ \sM $ is a factor , then for any pair $ \f , \p\in\sMdsup $ of normal positive linear functionals on $ \sM $ , the inequality : $ $ \lrnorm { \f } \leq \lrnorm { \p } $ $ is equivalent to the fact that there exist a countable family $ \lrbrace { \ffdi : i\in I } \subset \sMdsup $ in $ \sMdsup $ and a family $ \lrbrace { \udi : i\in I } \i\sM $ of partial isometries in \cM such that $ $ \f=\sumd { i\in I } \ffdi , \quad \sumd { i\in I } \udi { \ffdi } \udius\leq \p , \quad \text { and } \quad \udius\udi=s\lr { \ffdi } , i\in I , $ $ where $ s ( \omega ) , \omega\in\sMdsup $ , means the support projection of $ \omega $ .	Furthermore , if $ \lrnorm { \f } =\lrnorm { \p } $ , then the equality replaces the inequality in the second statement .	In the case that $ \sM $ is not of type \threeonec the family of partial isometries can be replaced by a family of unitaries in \cMp One can not expect to have this result in the usual integration thoery .	To have a similar result , one needs to bring in some kind of non-commutativity .	Let $ \lrbrace { X , \mu } $ be a $ \sig $ -finite semifinite measure space and $ G $ be an ergodic group of automorphisms of $ \linflr { X , \mu } $ , then for a pair $ f $ and $ g $ of $ \mu $ -integrable positive functions on $ X $ , the inequality : $ $ \int_X f ( x ) \txd \mu ( x ) \leq \int_X g ( x ) \txd \mu ( x ) $ $ is equivalent to the existence of a countable families $ \lrbrace { \fdi : i\in I } \subset L^1 ( X , \mu ) $ of positive integrable functions and $ \lrbrace { \gdi : i\in I } $ in $ G $ such that $ $ f=\sumd { i\in I } \fdi\quad\text { and } \quad \sumd { i\in I } \gdi\lr { \fdi } \leq g , $ $ where the summation and inequality are all taken in the oredered Banach space $ L^1 ( X , \mu ) $ and the action of $ G $ on $ \lonelr { X , \mu } $ is defined through the duality between $ \linflr { X , \mu } $ and $ \lonelr { X , \mu } $ , i.e. , \lr { \g ( f ) } ( x ) & amp ; =f\lr { \g\inv x } \frac { \txd\mu\scirc \g\inv } { \txd\mu } ( x ) , \quad f\in\lonelr { X , \mu } .
4	We also clarify the supersymmetric alternative derivation , even though it proves less efficient than the replica treatment for such thermodynamic quantities .	We study spectral properties of a one-dimensional Dirac equation with various disorder .	We use replicas to calculate the exact density of state and typical localization length of a Dirac particle in several cases .	We show that they can be calculated in any type of disorder obeying a Gaussian white noise distribution .	In particular , we study the random electric potential model , as well as a mixed disorder case .
0	Coherent diffraction imaging ( CDI ) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a major goal for the x-ray free electron lasers ( XFELs ) .	However , during an imaging pulse , the fast laser-induced ionization may strongly affect the recorded diffraction pattern of the irradiated sample .	The radiation tolerance of the imaged molecule should then be investigated 'a priori ' with a dedicated simulation tool .	The continuum approach is a powerful tool for modeling the evolution of irradiated large systems consisting of more than a few hundred thousand atoms .	However , this method follows the evolution of average single-particle densities , and the experimentally recorded intensities reflect the spatial two-particle correlations .
3	We also show that the quantum semi-group is `` Zariski '' dense in the quantum group .	Given a Hecke symmetry $ R $ , one can define a matrix bialgebra $ E_R $ and a matrix Hopf algebra $ H_R $ , which are called function rings on the matrix quantum semi-group and matrix quantum groups associated to $ R $ .	We show that for an even Hecke symmetry , the rational representations of the corresponding quantum group are absolutely reducible and that the fusion coefficients of simple representations depend only on the rank of the Hecke symmetry .	Further we compute the quantum rank of simple representations .	Finally we give a formula for the integral .
4	We then consider a structured jet , with the blazar component that- although not directly visible in the X-ray band - provides an intense field of seed synchrotron photons Compton-scattered by electrons in a mildly relativistic knot .	We present the X-ray analysis of a deep ~200 ksec Chandra observation of the compact steep spectrum radio-loud quasar 3C 186 ( z=1.06 ) and investigate the contribution of the unresolved radio jet to the total X-ray emission .	The spectral analysis is not conclusive on the origin of the bulk of the X-ray emission .	In order to examine the jet contribution to the X-ray flux , we model the quasar spectral energy distribution ( SED ) , adopting several scenarios for the jet emission .	For the values of the main physical parameters favored by the observables , a dominant role of the jet emission in the X-ray band is ruled out when a single zone ( leptonic ) scenario is adopted , even including the contribution of the external photon fields as seed photons for inverse Compton emission .
0	Extreme value statistics ( EVS ) is applied to the distribution of galaxy luminosities in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) .	We analyze the DR8 Main Galaxy Sample ( MGS ) , as well as the Luminous Red Galaxies ( LRG ) .	Maximal luminosities are sampled from batches consisting of elongated pencil beams in the radial direction of sight .	For the MGS , results suggest a small and positive tail index $ \xi $ , effectively ruling out the possibility of having a finite maximum cutoff luminosity , and implying that the luminosity distribution function may decay as a power law at the high luminosity end .	Assuming , however , $ \xi=0 $ , a non-parametric comparison of the maximal luminosities with the Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel distribution ( limit distribution for variables distributed by the Schechter fit ) indicates a good agreement provided uncertainties arising both from the finite batch size and from the batch size distribution are accounted for .
3	The filter phase select the features with highest information gain and guides the initialization of search process for wrapper phase whose output the final feature subset .	Feature selection is an indispensable preprocessing step when mining huge datasets that can significantly improve the overall system performance .	Therefore in this paper we focus on a hybrid approach of feature selection .	This method falls into two phases .	The final feature subsets are passed through the Knearest neighbor classifier for classification of attacks .
2	Thorough analysis of interferometric data was performed to measure the stellar angular diameter and to search for circumstellar material .	We aim at resolving the circumstellar environment around beta Pic in the near-infrared in order to study the inner planetary system ( & lt ; 200 mas , i.e. , ~4 AU ) .	Precise interferometric fringe visibility measurements were obtained over seven spectral channels dispersed across the H band with the four-telescope VLTI/PIONIER interferometer .	We detected near-infrared circumstellar emission around beta Pic that accounts for 1.37 % +/- 0.16 % of the near-infrared stellar flux and that is located within the field-of-view of PIONIER ( i.e. , ~200 mas in radius ) .	The flux ratio between this excess and the photosphere emission is shown to be stable over a period of 1 year and to vary only weakly across the H band , suggesting that the source is either very hot ( & gt ; 1500 K ) or dominated by the scattering of the stellar flux .
2	We then convert to the nonlinear refractive index coefficients through the Kramers-Kronig relation .	We present a comprehensive analysis of the the nonlinear optical Kerr effect in graphene .	We directly solve the S-matrix element to calculate the absorption rate , utilizing the Volkov-Keldysh- type crystal wave functions .	In this formalism , the source of Kerr nonlinearity is the interplay of optical fields that cooperatively drive the transition from valence to conduction band .	This formalism makes it possible to identify and compute the rates of distinct nonlinear processes that contribute to the Kerr nonlinear refractive index coefficient .
2	In particular , he showed that the space-like weight vectors correspond to a ball packing if and only if the associated Coxeter graph is of `` level $ 2 $ . ''	Boyd ( 1974 ) proposed a class of infinite ball packings that are generated by inversions .	Later , Maxwell ( 1983 ) interpreted Boyd 's construction in terms of root systems in Lorentz space .	In Maxwell 's work , the simple roots form a basis of the representations space of the Coxeter group .	In several recent studies , the more general based root system is considered , where the simple roots are only required to be positively independent .
0	The ACS and NICMOS have been used to obtain new HST images of NGC 4038/4039 ( `` The Antennae '' ) .	These new observations allow us to better differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars , based on both size and color .	We use this ability to extend the cluster luminosity function by approximately two magnitudes over our previous WFPC2 results , and find that it continues as a single power law , dN/dL propto L^alpha with alpha=-2.13+/-0.07 , down to the observational limit of Mv~-7 .	Similarly , the mass function is a single power law dN/dM propto M^beta with beta=-2.10+/-0.20 for clusters with ages t & lt ; 3x10^8 yr , corresponding to lower mass limits that range from 10^4 to 10^5 Msun , depending on the age range of the subsample .	Hence the power law indices for the luminosity and mass functions are essentially the same .
1	This paper considers scattering encounters between solar systems and passing cluster members , and calculates the corresponding interaction cross sections .	Most planetary systems are formed within stellar clusters , and these environments can shape their properties .	The target solar systems are generally assumed to have four giant planets , with a variety of starting states , including circular orbits with the semimajor axes of our planets , a more compact configuration , an ultra-compact state with multiple mean motion resonances , and systems with massive planets .	We then consider the effects of varying the cluster velocity dispersion , the relative importance of binaries versus single stars , different stellar host masses , and finite starting eccentricities of the planetary orbits .	For each state of the initial system , we perform an ensemble of numerical scattering experiments and determine the cross sections for eccentricity increase , inclination angle increase , planet ejection , and capture .
3	The 3-dimensional dynamics of initially identical stellar discs is studied in both models .	We compare N-body simulations of isolated galaxies performed in both frameworks of modified Newtonian dynamics ( MOND ) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter ( DM ) .	We have developed a multigrid code able to efficiently solve the modified Poisson equation derived from the Lagrangian formalism AQUAL .	We take particular care of the boundary conditions that are a crucial point in MOND .	In Newtonian gravity the live DM halo is chosen to fit the rotation curve of the MOND galaxy .
2	We also mention some relevant results from the field of lossy compression and algorithms specialized for the use on large graphs .	We present an informal survey ( meant to accompany another paper ) on graph compression methods .	We focus on lossless methods , briefly list available pproaches , and compare them where possible or give some indicators on their compression ratios .	-- - Note : The comparison is by no means complete .	This document is a first draft and will be updated and extended .
0	We use finite size scaling to study Ising spin glasses in two spatial dimensions .	The issue of universality is addressed by comparing discrete and continuous probability distributions for the quenched random couplings .	The sophisticated temperature dependency of the scaling fields is identified as the major obstacle that has impeded a complete analysis .	Once temperature is relinquished in favor of the correlation length as the basic variable , we obtain a reliable estimation of the anomalous dimension and of the thermal critical exponent .	Universality among binary and Gaussian couplings is confirmed to a high numerical accuracy .
0	The Noether-charge realization and the Hamiltonian realization for the $ \diff ( { \cal M } ) $ algebra in diffeomorphism invariant gravitational theories are studied in a covariant formalism .	For the Killing vector fields , the Nother-charge realization leads to the mass formula as an entire vanishing Noether charge for the vacuum black hole spacetimes in general relativity and the corresponding first law of the black hole mechanics .	It is analyzed in which sense the Hamiltonian functionals form the $ \diff ( { \cal M } ) $ algebra under the Poisson bracket and shown how the Noether charges with respect to the diffeomorphism generated by vector fields and their variations in general relativity form this algebra .	The asymptotic behaviors of vector fields generating diffeomorphism of the manifold with boundaries are discussed .	In order to get more precise estimation for the `` central extension '' of the algebra , it is analyzed in the Newman-Penrose formalism and shown that the `` central extension '' for a large class of vector fields is always zero on the Killing horizon .
1	By rigorous asymptotic analysis we show that the sharp-interface limit of this model recovers the continuum model equations for the Grinfeld instability .	A phase-field approach describing the dynamics of a strained solid in contact with its melt is developed .	Moreover , we use our approach to derive hitherto unknown sharp-interface equations for a situation including a field of body forces .	The numerical utility of the phase-field approach is demonstrated by comparison with a sharp-interface simulation .	We then investigate the dynamics of extended systems within the phase-field model which contains an inherent lower length cutoff , thus avoiding cusp singularities .
3	This neutrino-mass/recombination effect depends strongly on the neutrino rest masses .	We discuss how small neutrino rest masses can increase the expansion rate near the photon decoupling epoch in the early universe , causing an earlier , higher temperature freeze-out for ionization equilibrium compared to the massless neutrino case .	This yields a larger free-electron fraction .	A larger ratio of the sound horizon to the photon diffusion length follows , implying a smaller inferred Neff .	Though below current sensitivity , this effect could be probed by next-generation cosmic microwave background experiments , giving an observational handle of neutrino mass physics .
4	These effective results have some interesting applications in concrete situations .	The main purpose of this note is to establish an effective version of the Grunwald -- Wang Theorem , which asserts that given a family of local characters $ \chi^ { v } $ of $ K_ { v } ^ { * } $ of exponent $ m $ where $ v \in S $ for a finite set $ S $ of primes of $ K $ , there exists a global character $ \chi $ of the idele class group $ C_ { K } $ of exponent $ m $ ( unless some special case occurs , when it is $ 2 m $ ) whose component at $ v $ is $ \chi^ { v } $ .	The effectiveness problem for this theorem is to bound the norm $ N ( \chi ) $ of the conductor of $ \chi $ in terms of $ K $ , $ m $ , $ S $ and $ N ( \chi^ { v } ) $ .	The Kummer case ( when $ K $ contains $ \mu_ { m } $ ) is easy since it is almost an application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem .	In this note , we solve this problem completely in general case , and give three versions of bound , one is with \GRH , and the other two are unconditional bounds .
1	Within a kinetic equation approach , we identify coefficients of response to the time-dependent external driving and relate these to the concepts of charge and spin emissivities previously discussed within the time-dependent scattering matrix approach .	We investigate charge and spin transport through an adiabatically driven , strongly interacting quantum dot weakly coupled to two metallic contacts with finite bias voltage .	Expressed in terms of auxiliary vector fields , the response coefficients allow for a straightforward analysis of recently predicted interaction-induced pumping under periodic modulation of the gate and bias voltage [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	104 , 226803 ( 2010 ) ] .	We perform a detailed study of this effect and the related adiabatic Coulomb blockade spectroscopy , and , in particular , extend it to spin pumping .
2	One realisation of our scenario is scalar electrodynamics with a scalar whose mass is large enough to evade observational constraints - the obvious candidates being supersymmetric partners of the standard-model fermions .	We show that conformal invariance of gauge fields is naturally broken in inflation , having as a consequence amplification of gauge fields .	The resulting spectrum of the field strength is approximately B_L ~ L^ ( -1 ) , where L is the relevant coherence scale .	Our mechanism also leads naturally to amplification of the standard-model Z-boson field due to its coupling to the electroweak Higgs field .	At preheating , the spectrum of the Z field is transferred to the hypercharge field , which remains frozen in the plasma and is converted into a magnetic field at the electroweak phase transition .
0	We consider the field theory on non-commutative superspace and non-commutative spacetime that arises on D-branes in Type II superstring theory with a constant self-dual graviphoton and NS-NS $ B $ field background .	$ \N=1 $ supersymmetric field theories on this non-commutative space ( such theories are called $ \N=1/2 $ supersymmetric theories . )	can be reduced to supermatrix models as in hep-th/0303210 \cite { KKM } .	We take an appropriate commutative limit in these theories and show that holomorphic quantities in commutative field theories are equivalent to reduced models , including non-planar diagrams to which the graviphoton contributes .	This is a new derivation of Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory including non-planar diagrams .
0	Motivated by the anomalous dust-to-metal ratios derived in the literature for gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) damped Lyman-alpha absorbers ( DLAs ) , we measure these ratios using the dust-depletion pattern observed in UV/optical afterglow spectra associated with the ISM at the GRB host-galaxy redshifts .	Our sample consists of 20 GRB absorbers and a comparison sample of 72 QSO-DLAs with redshift 1.2 & lt ; z & lt ; 4.0 and down to Z = 0.002 Z_Sol metallicities .	The dust-to-metal ratio in QSO- and GRB-DLAs increases both with metallicity and metal column density , spanning ~10 -- 110 % of the Galactic value and pointing to a non universal dust-to-metal ratio .	The low values of dust-to-metal ratio suggest that low-metallicity systems have lower dust fractions than typical spiral galaxies and perhaps that the dust in these systems is produced inefficiently , i.e.by grain growth in the low-metallicity regime with negligible contribution from supernovae ( SNe ) and asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) stars .	On the other hand , some GRB- and QSO-DLAs show high dust-to-metal ratio values out to z ~ 4 , requiring rapid dust production , such as in SN ejecta , but also in AGB winds and via grain growth for the highest metallicity systems .
2	Moreover , the subclass of norm-complete Riesz MV-algebras is equivalent with the class of commutative unital C $ ^* $ -algebras .	We initiate a deep study of { \em Riesz MV-algebras } which are MV-algebras endowed with a scalar multiplication with scalars from $ [ 0,1 ] $ .	Extending Mundici 's equivalence between MV-algebras and $ \ell $ -groups , we prove that Riesz MV-algebras are categorically equivalent with unit intervals in Riesz spaces with strong unit .	The propositional calculus $ { \mathbb R } { \cal L } $ that has Riesz MV-algebras as models is a conservative extension of \L ukasiewicz $ \infty $ -valued propositional calculus and it is complete with respect to evaluations in the standard model $ [ 0,1 ] $ .	We prove a normal form theorem for this logic , extending McNaughton theorem for \L ukasiewicz logic .
1	A multi-spin interaction is used to capture the competition between local and global satisfaction of constraints characteristic for geometric frustration .	We discuss the use of a ferromagnetic spin model on a random graph to model granular compaction .	We define an athermal dynamics designed to model repeated taps of a given strength .	Amplitude cycling and the effect of permanently constraining a subset of the spins at a given amplitude is discussed .	Finally we check the validity of Edwards ' hypothesis for the athermal tapping dynamics .
3	Our results suggest that galaxies in dense environments have either ( i ) consumed their molecular gas via star formation in the past or ( ii ) that dense environments leads to an inhibition of molecular gas from atomic phase .	In order to study whether there is any correlation between nuclear activities , gas content , and the environment where galaxies reside , we have obtained optical and millimetric spectra for a well-defined sample of intermediate Hubble type spirals in dense environments and in the field .	We found that these spirals in dense environments have on average : less molecular gas per blue luminosity , higher atomic gas fraction , lower current star formation rate , and the same star formation efficiency as field galaxies .	Although none of these results stand out as a single strong diagnostic , given their statistical significance , taken together they indicate a trend for diminished gas content and star formation activity in galaxies in high density environments .	The similarities in star formation efficiency of the dense environments and field galaxies suggest that the physical processes controling the formation of stars from the molecular gas are local rather than global .
1	We propose a new model selection and estimation method which is computationally efficient .	We study a variable length Markov chain model associated with a group of stationary processes that share the same context tree but each process has potentially different conditional probabilities .	We develop oracle and adaptivity inequalities , as well as model selection properties , that hold under continuity of the transition probabilities and polynomial $ \beta $ -mixing .	In particular , model misspecification is allowed .	These results are applied to interesting families of processes .
3	We introduce a new method based on minimization of a convex function , and show its numerical superiority when calculating the order statistics of very large arrays on GPUs .	We present and compare various approaches to a classical selection problem on Graphics Processing Units ( GPUs ) .	The selection problem consists in selecting the $ k $ -th smallest element from an array of size $ n $ , called $ k $ -th order statistic .	We focus on calculating the median of a sample , the $ n/2 $ -th order statistic .	We outline an application of this approach to efficient estimation of model parameters in high breakdown robust regression .
3	This paper develops a theoretic framework that enables computation of the deployment cost of a network ( modeled using various spatial point processes ) to answer the question posed by the paper 's title .	Mobile networks of the future are predicted to be much denser than today 's networks in order to cater to increasing user demands .	In this context , cloud based radio access networks have garnered significant interest as a cost effective solution to the problem of coping with denser networks and providing higher data rates .	However , to the best knowledge of the authors , a quantitative analysis of the cost of such networks is yet to be undertaken .	Then , the framework obtained is used along with a complexity model , which enables computing the information processing costs of a network , to compare the deployment cost of a cloud based network against that of a traditional LTE network , and to analyze why they are more economical .
4	We then find that a half of these irregular galaxies ( 33/66 ) are GIGs and obtain an unambiguous sample of 33 GIGs for the first time .	In order to understand nature of building blocks of galaxies in the early universe , we investigate `` genuine irregular galaxies ( GIGs ) '' in the nearby universe .	Here , GIGs are defined as isolated galaxies without regular structures ( spheroid , bulge , disk , bar , spiral arm , and nucleus ) .	Using the results of two excellent studies on galaxy morphology based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) , we obtain a sample of 66 irregular galaxies .	We carry out new classification of them into GIGs and non-GIGs which have regular structure or show evidence for galaxy interaction , by using the SDSS Data Release 10 images .
3	Under an additional hypothesis , which is satisfied by all uniformly quasiregular maps , this bound can be improved to be the same as those in a Baker domain of a transcendental entire function .	We consider the iteration of quasiregular maps of transcendental type from $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ to $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ .	We give a bound on the rate at which the iterates of such a map can escape to infinity in a periodic component of the quasi-Fatou set .	We give examples which show that this result is best possible .	We construct a quasiregular map of transcendental type from $ \mathbb { R } ^3 $ to $ \mathbb { R } ^3 $ with a periodic domain in which all iterates tend locally uniformly to infinity .
1	Existing algorithms run with cubic complexity with respect to the size of the matrix in the worst case .	We present new algorithms for computing the log-determinant of symmetric , diagonally dominant matrices .	Our algorithm computes an approximation of the log-determinant in time near-linear with respect to the number of non-zero entries and with high probability .	This algorithm builds upon the utra-sparsifiers introduced by Spielman and Teng for Laplacian matrices and ultimately uses their refined versions introduced by Koutis , Miller and Peng in the context of solving linear systems .	We also present simpler algorithms that compute upper and lower bounds and that may be of more immediate practical interest .
0	Single and collective cellular oscillations involving the actomyosin cytoskeleton have been observed in numerous biological systems .	We show here that a generic model of a contractile material , which is turning over and contracts against an elastic element , exhibits spontaneous oscillations .	Such a model can thus account for shape oscillations observed in amnioserosa cells during dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo .	We investigate the collective dynamics of an ensemble of such oscillators and show that the relative contribution of viscous and friction losses yield different regimes of collective oscillations .	Taking into account the diffusion of contractile elements , our theoretical framework predicts the appearance of traveling waves which might account for the propagation of actomyosin contractile waves observed during morphogenesis .
0	An alternative to commonly used domain wall fermions is presented .	Some rigorous bounds on the condition number of the associated linear problem are derived .	On the basis of these bounds and some experimentation it is argued that domain wall fermions will in general be associated with a condition number that is of the same order of magnitude as the { \it product } of the condition number of the linear problem in the physical dimensions by the inverse bare quark mass .	Thus , the computational cost of implementing true domain wall fermions using a single conjugate gradient algorithm is of the same order of magnitude as that of implementing the overlap Dirac operator directly using two nested conjugate gradient algorithms .	At a cost of about a factor of two in operation count it is possible to make the memory usage of direct implementations of the overlap Dirac operator independent of the accuracy of the approximation to the sign function and of the same order as that of standard Wilson fermions .
3	Three key papers that followed , shortly , essentially completed the program , as far as superconductivity is concerned : i ) a gauge theory approach by Anderson and us , that went beyond mean field theory ii ) Kotliar 's d-wave solution in BZA theory iii ) improvement of a renormalized Hamiltonian in BZA theory , using a Gutzwiller approximation by Zhang , Gros , Rice and Shiba .	Resonating valence bond states in a doped Mott insulator was proposed to explain superconductivity in cuprates in January 1987 by Anderson .	A challenging task then was proving existence of this unconventional mechanism and a wealth of possibilities , with a rigor acceptable in standard condensed matter physics , in a microscopic theory and develop suitable many body techniques .	Shortly , a paper by Anderson , Zou and us ( BZA ) undertook this task and initiated a program .	In this article I shall focus on the merits of BZA and gauge theory papers .
4	At T=0 this correction is found to vanish for fully transparent contacts indicating the absence of Coulomb effects in this limit .	We derive a microscopic effective action for superconducting contacts with arbitrary transmission distribution of conducting channels .	Provided fluctuations of the Josephson phase remain sufficiently small our formalism allows to fully describe fluctuation and interaction effects in such systems .	As compared to the well studied tunneling limit our analysis yields a number of qualitatively new features which occur due to the presence of subgap Andreev bound states in the system .	We investigate the equilibrium supercurrent noise and evaluate the electron-electron interaction correction to the Josephson current across superconducting contacts .
3	In some models having a first order phase transition , the fluctuations are minimized along the phase transition line if we assume that the pressure in the hot and the cold phase is balanced at the first order phase transition point .	We comment on the reweighting method for the study of finite density lattice QCD .	We discuss the applicable parameter range of the reweighting method for models which have more than one simulation parameter .	The applicability range is determined by the fluctuations of the modification factor of the Boltzmann weight .	This suggests that the reweighting method with two parameters is applicable in a wide range for the purpose of tracing out the phase transition line in the parameter space .
1	We report on the high energy spectrum of the source , concentrating on cyclotron resonant scattering features .	The recurrent hard pulsating X-ray transient \S was observed with \B on March 19 , when the source was at a 2 -- 10 keV flux level of $ \sim $ 310~mCrab .	The spectrum is strongly pulse phase dependent and absorption features are detected at virtually all phases .	In particular , four absorption-like features at 12.74 keV , 24.16 keV , 35.74 keV , and 49.5 keV are observed in the descending edge of the main peak of the pulse profile .	The ratios between the centroid energies of the lines with respect to the first are 1 : ( 1.9 ) : ( 2.8 ) : ( 3.9 ) .
4	Spectral loss occurs in nonlinear fiber-optic channels and it may be one effect that needs to be taken into account to explain the behavior of the capacity of nonlinear fiber-optic channels presented in recent studies .	The mutual information between a complex-valued channel input and its complex-valued output is decomposed into four parts based on polar coordinates : an amplitude term , a phase term , and two mixed terms .	Numerical results for the additive white Gaussian noise ( AWGN ) channel with various inputs show that , at high signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , the amplitude and phase terms dominate the mixed terms .	For the AWGN channel with a Gaussian input , analytical expressions are derived for high SNR .	The decomposition method is applied to partially coherent channels and a property of such channels called `` spectral loss '' is developed .
4	The prospects for future debris searches and the implications for the early evolution of the Galaxy are briefly presented .	We present the kinematic properties of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy in the Milky Way , based on the hypothesis that its central part once contained the most massive Galactic globular cluster , omega Cen .	Dynamical evolution of a self-gravitating progenitor galaxy that follows the present-day and likely past orbits of omega Cen is calculated numerically and the kinematic nature of their tidal debris is analyzed , combined with randomly generated stars comprising spheroidal halo and flat disk components .	We show that the retrograde rotation of the debris stars at $ \sim -100 $ km/s accords with a recently discovered , large radial velocity stream at $ \sim 300 $ km/s towards the Galactic longitude of $ \sim 270^\circ $ .	These stars also contribute , only in part , to a reported retrograde motion of the outer halo at the North Galactic Pole .
4	concerning the rods cross sections and a residual one related to the deformation of the cross-section.The e.r.s.d .	In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of a structure made of curved rods of thickness 2\delta when \delta rightarrow 0 .	This study is carried on within the frame of linear elasticity by using the unfolding method .	It is based on several decompositions of the structure displacements and on the passing to the limit in fixed domains .	We show that any displacement of a structure is the sum of an elementary rods-structure displacement ( e.r.s.d . )
3	Here , we analysed the historical versions of miRBase , a database of microRNAs where we performed an alignment of all mature and precursor miRNAs and calculated a pairwise similarity index .	Biological databases can be analysed as a complex network which may reveal some its underlying biological mechanisms .	Frequently , such databases are identified as scale-free networks or as hierarchical networks depending on connectivity distributions or clustering coefficients .	Since these databases do grow over time , one would expect that their network topology may undergo some changes .	We found that the clustering coefficient shows important changes during the growth of this database .
3	The missing details ( mostly routine elementary estimations ) are in Part Two , which is very long .	We describe a plan how to prove an effective Siegel theorem ( about the exceptional Dirichlet character ) .	We give a brief outline in Section 0 .	We give a more detailed plan in Sections 1-5 .	I am happy to send the pdf-file of Part Two to anybody who requests it by email .
0	Recent studies suggest that the helium content of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters ( GCs ) is not uniform .	The range of helium varies from cluster to cluster with more massive GCs having , preferentially , large helium spread .	GCs with large helium variations also show extended-blue horizontal branch ( HB ) .	I exploit Hubble Space Telescope photometry to investigate multiple stellar populations in NGC6266 and infer their relative helium abundance .	This cluster is an ideal target to investigate the possible connection between helium , cluster mass , and HB morphology , as it exhibits an extended HB and is among the ten more luminous GCs in the Milky Way .
2	The observed lower bound speed of the blob is estimated as $ \sim $ 215 km s $ ^ { -1 } $ in its dynamical phase .	Using multi-wavelength observations of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SoHO ) /Michelson Doppler Imager ( MDI ) , Transition Region and Coronal Explorer ( TRACE ) 171 \AA , and H $ \alpha $ from Culgoora Solar Observatory at Narrabri , Australia , we present a unique observational signature of a propagating supersonic plasma blob before an M6.2 class solar flare in AR10808 on 9th September 2005 .	The blob was observed between 05:27 UT to 05:32 UT with almost a constant shape for the first 2-3 minutes , and thereafter it quickly vanished in the corona .	The evidence of the blob with almost similar shape and velocity concurrent in H $ \alpha $ and TRACE 171 \AA\ supports its formation by multi-temperature plasma .	The energy release by a recurrent 3-D reconnection process via the separator dome below the magnetic null point , between the emerging flux and pre-existing field lines in the lower solar atmosphere , is found to be the driver of a radial velocity pulse outwards that accelerates this plasma blob in the solar atmosphere .
3	The effects of the frustration caused by the coexistence of the different positions of cerium are treated , which may also significantly enhance the observed values of specific heat .	The unusual electronic and magnetic properties of the systems Ce $ _3 $ Pd $ _ { 20 } $ T $ _6 $ ( T = Ge , Si ) with two non-equivalent Ce positions are discussed .	The logarithmic growth of resistance for both the systems confirms the presence of the Kondo effect in the two respective temperature ranges .	The two-scale behavior is explained by consecutive splitting of Ce ion levels in the crystal field .	A model of `` molecular magnetism '' with Ce2 cubes is developed .
4	In our extrapolation of the parton densities to kinematical regions as yet unexplored directly in terrestrial accelerators , we are guided by double asymptotic scaling in the large Q^2 and small Bjorken x region and to models of saturation in the low Q^2 and low x regime .	We reconsider the Standard Model interactions of ultra-high energy neutrinos with matter .	The next to leading order QCD corrections are presented for charged-current and neutral-current processes .	Contrary to popular expectations , these corrections are found to be quite substantial , especially for very large ( anti- ) neutrino energies .	Hence , they need to be taken into account in any search for new physics effects in high-energy neutrino interactions .
3	These experiments directly detect the possible existence of the chargon - a charge $ e $ spinless boson - in the insulator .	We propose several tests of the idea that the electron is fractionalized in the underdoped and undoped cuprates .	These include the ac Josephson effect , and tunneling into small superconducting grains in the Coulomb blockade regime .	In both cases , we argue that the results are qualitatively modified from the conventional ones if the insulating tunnel barrier is fractionalized .	The effects described in this paper provide a means to probing whether the undoped cuprate ( despite it 's magnetism ) is fractionalized .
4	The PVMF reduction of a defectiveness of Fe3O4 structure in the magnetite was detected .	Scientific study of the effect of structural memory of nonequilibrium defective solids about the processing in magnetic field ( the magnetic structural effect ( MSE ) was continued in this paper .	The study was aimed to reveal the universal nature of the MSE , which was investigated in several new nonequilibrium defective solids .	The results of investigation of the processing in the vortical magnetic field ( PVMF ) and its effect on the structure of the natural magnetite Fe3O4 and the SnO2 films were presented .	The methods of M & amp ; # 246 ; ssbauer and X-ray spectroscopy were used .
0	We identify SDSS J010657.39-100003.3 ( hereafter J0106-1000 ) as the shortest period detached binary white dwarf ( WD ) system currently known .	We targeted J0106-1000 as part of our radial velocity program to search for companions around known extremely low-mass ( ELM , ~ 0.2 Msol ) WDs using the 6.5m MMT .	We detect peak-to-peak radial velocity variations of 740 km/s with an orbital period of 39.1 min .	The mass function and optical photometry rule out a main-sequence star companion .	Follow-up high-speed photometric observations obtained at the McDonald 2.1m telescope reveal ellipsoidal variations from the distorted primary but no eclipses .
1	In current services , users however have to give up their location privacy in order to acquire the service .	Location-based services are increasingly used in our daily activities .	The literature features a large number of contributions which aim at enhancing user privacy in location-based services .	Most of these contributions obfuscate the locations of users using spatial and/or temporal cloaking in order to provide k-anonymity .	Although such schemes can indeed strengthen the location privacy of users , they often decrease the service quality and do not necessarily prevent the possible tracking of user movements ( i.e. , direction , trajectory , velocity ) .
2	For small values of the magnetic field they possess localized closed string tachyons analogous to the Nielsen-Olesen instability of a constant magnetic field in SO ( 3 ) Yang-Mills theory .	We study exact string backgrounds representing a constant magnetic field background in heterotic string theory .	These backgrounds are obtained by Kaluza-Klein reduction of a special class of plane wave solutions .	When the magnetic field is embedded in the SO ( 32 ) gauge group of the heterotic string it is possible to study the lowest level tachyon in supergravity .	We identify the closed string tachyons as fluctuations of the supergravity fields about the background .
0	General Trojan horse attacks on quantum key distribution systems are analyzed .	We illustrate the power of such attacks with today 's technology and conclude that all system must implement active counter-measures .	In particular all systems must include an auxiliary detector that monitors any incoming light .	We show that such counter-measures can be efficient , provided enough additional privacy amplification is applied to the data .	We present a practical way to reduce the maximal information gain that an adversary can gain using Trojan horse attacks .
3	The relationship between structure ( intensity of RS lines ) and sample resistance is defined .	Raman scattering ( RS ) spectra and current-voltage characteristics at room temperature were measured in six series of small samples fabricated by means of electron-beam lithography on the surface of a large size ( 5x5 mm ) industrial monolayer graphene film .	Samples were irradiated by different doses of C $ { } ^+ $ ion beam up to $ 10^ { 15 } $ cm $ { } ^ { -2 } $ .	It was observed that at the utmost degree of disorder , the Raman spectra lines disappear which is accompanied by the exponential increase of resistance and change in the current-voltage characteristics.These effects are explained by suggestion that highly disordered graphene film ceases to be a continuous and splits into separate fragments .	It is shown that the maximal resistance of the continuous film is of order of reciprocal value of the minimal graphene conductivity $ \pi h/4e^2\approx 20 $ kOhm .
2	We also obtain the numerical energy spectrum of the SS equation without any approximation to centrifugal term for the same potential and compare them with the approximated numerical ones obtained from the analytical expressions .	We obtain analytical solutions of the two-body spinless Salpeter ( SS ) equation with Yukawa potential within the conventional approximation scheme to the centrifugal term for any -state .	The semi-relativistic bound state energy spectra and the corresponding normalized wave functions are calculated by means of the Nikiforov-Uvarov ( NU ) method .	It is found that the exact numerical results are in good agreement with the approximated ones for the lower energy states .	Special cases are treated like the nonrelativistic limit and the solution for the Coulomb problem .
4	The special case $ \alpha=1/2 $ is also known under the name logarithmic negativity and often considered to be a particularly useful quantification of entanglement .	In a remarkable paper [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	96 , 100503 ( 2006 ) ] , Dimitri Gioev and Israel Klich conjectured an explicit formula for the leading asymptotic growth of the spatially bi-partite von-Neumann entanglement entropy of non-interacting fermions in multi-dimensional Euclidean space at zero temperature .	Based on recent progress by one of us ( A.V.S . )	in semi-classical functional calculus for pseudo-differential operators with discontinuous symbols , we provide here a complete proof of that formula and of its generalization to R\'enyi entropies of all orders $ \alpha & gt ; 0 $ .
4	The pressure in the shock and in the bubble is shown to have a lower limit of 5500 bars .	A single bubble in water is excited by a standing ultrasound wave .	At high intensity the bubble starts to emit light .	Together with the emitted light pulse , a shock wave is generated in the liquid at collapse time .	The time-dependent velocity of the outward-travelling shock is measured with an imaging technique .
1	To reveal the correspondence between the two phenomena , we compute the optical conductivity of a noncentrosymmetric metal to linear order in the wave vector of the light wave , specializing to the low-frequency regime .	We consider the phenomenon of natural optical activity , and related chiral magnetic effect in metals with low carrier concentration .	We show that it is the orbital magnetic moment of quasiparticles that is responsible for the natural optical activity , and thus the chiral magnetic effect .	While for purely static magnetic fields the chiral magnetic effect is known to have a topological origin and to be related to the presence of Berry curvature monopoles ( Weyl points ) in the band structure , we show that the existence of Berry monopoles is not required for the dynamic chiral magnetic effect to appear ; the latter is thus not unique to Weyl metals .	The magnitude of the dynamic chiral magnetic effect in a material is related to the trace of its gyrotropic tensor .
2	The branch-and-bound algorithm generalizes the approach for unconstrained convex quadratic integer programming proposed by Buchheim , Caprara and Lodi to the presence of linear constraints .	We propose a feasible active set method for convex quadratic programming problems with non-negativity constraints .	This method is specifically designed to be embedded into a branch-and-bound algorithm for convex quadratic mixed integer programming problems .	The main feature of the latter approach consists in a sophisticated preprocessing phase , leading to a fast enumeration of the branch-and-bound nodes .	Moreover , the feasible active set method takes advantage of this preprocessing phase and is well suited for reoptimization .
0	A method of quantizing parametrized systems is developed that is based on a kind of `` gauge invariant '' quantities -- -the so-called perennials ( a perennial must also be an `` integral of motion '' ) .	The problem of time in its particular form ( frozen time formalism , global problem of time , multiple choice problem ) is met , as well as the related difficulty characteristic for this type of theory : the paucity of perennials .	The present paper is an attempt to find some remedy in the ideas on `` forms of relativistic dynamics '' by Dirac .	Some aspects of Dirac 's theory are generalized to all finite-dimensional first-class parametrized systems .	The generalization is based on replacing the Poicar\ ' { e } group and the algebra of its generators as used by Dirac by a canonical group of symmetries and by an algebra of elementary perennials .
4	Alternatively , the variation in the mass function of the stellar objects could be an indication that they have undergone mass segregation via dynamical evolution .	We present the stellar and substellar mass function of the open cluster IC2391 , plus its radial dependence , and use this to put constraints on the formation mechanism of brown dwarfs .	Our multiband optical and infrared photometric survey with spectroscopic follow-up covers 11 square degrees , making it the largest survey of this cluster to date .	We observe a radial variation in the mass function over the range 0.072 to 0.3Msol , but no significant variation in the mass function below the substellar boundary at the three cluster radius intervals analyzed .	This lack of radial variation for low masses is what we would expect with the ejection scenario for brown dwarf formation , although considering that IC2391 has an age about three times older than its crossing time , we expect that brown dwarfs with a velocity greater than the escape velocity have already escaped the cluster .
1	We find that even in this relatively quiescent region gas flows away from the disk at speeds up to $ \sim $ 100 km/s in broad and symmetrical absorption in the low and high ions .	We compare the properties of gas flows on both the near and far side of the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) disk using Hubble Space Telescope UV absorption-line observations toward an AGN behind ( transverse ) and a star within ( down-the-barrel ) the LMC disk at an impact parameter of 3.2 kpc .	The symmetric absorption profiles combined with previous surveys showing little evidence that the ejected gas returns to the LMC and provide compelling evidence that the LMC drives a global , large-scale outflow across its disk , which is the likely result of a recent burst of star formation in the LMC .	We find that the outflowing gas is multiphase , ionized by both photoionization ( SiII and SiIII ) and collisional ionization ( SiIV and CIV ) .	We estimate a total mass and outflow rate to be $ & gt ; 10^7 $ Msun and $ & gt ; 0.4 $ Msun/yr .
4	The results for the temperatures and X-ray intensities , which characterize the three components , are given and compared to an alternative model .	We present the results of our investigation of the composition of the diffuse soft X-ray background emission ( SXRB ) .	Combining data of the Leiden/Dwingeloo HI Survey and the ROSAT All-Sky Survey ( RASS ) , we set up a radiation transport equation in order to model the SXRB .	Two different techniques lead to the model parameters : An image oriented approach which compares observed and modeled maps of the 1/4 and 3/4 keV X-ray energy regime and a more analytic approach using scatter diagrams .	The analysis shows that only three independent components of the emitting plasma ( local , halo and extragalactic ) are needed to explain the SXRB .
1	Dust is thought to be produced predominantly in the envelopes of evolved ( age & gt ; 1 Gyr ) , low-mass stars .	Interstellar dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of the Universe by assisting the formation of molecules , by triggering the formation of the first low-mass stars , and by absorbing stellar ultraviolet-optical light and subsequently re-emitting it at infrared/millimetre wavelengths .	This picture has , however , recently been brought into question by the discovery of large masses of dust in the host galaxies of quasars at redshift z & gt ; 6 , when the age of the Universe was less than 1 Gyr .	Theoretical studies , corroborated by observations of nearby supernova remnants , have suggested that supernovae provide a fast and efficient dust formation environment in the early Universe .	Here we report infrared observations of a quasar at redshift 6.2 , which are used to obtain directly its dust extinction curve .
1	Formalisations have been undertaken in a variety of systems , primarily focusing on well-studied ( and challenging ) properties such as the theory of process bisimulation .	Formalising the pi-calculus is an illuminating test of the expressiveness of logical frameworks and mechanised metatheory systems , because of the presence of name binding , labelled transitions with name extrusion , bisimulation , and structural congruence .	We present a formalisation in Agda that instead explores the theory of concurrent transitions , residuation , and causal equivalence of traces , which has not previously been formalised for the pi-calculus .	Our formalisation employs de Bruijn indices and dependently-typed syntax , and aligns the `` proved transitions '' proposed by Boudol and Castellani in the context of CCS with the proof terms naturally present in Agda 's representation of the labelled transition relation .	Our main contributions are proofs of the `` diamond lemma '' for residuation of concurrent transitions and a formal definition of equivalence of traces up to permutation of transitions .
4	Numerical results are provided for the Helmholtz equation and the Schr\ '' odinger in both 2D and 3D to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new preconditioner .	This paper introduces the sparsifying preconditioner for the pseudospectral approximation of highly indefinite systems on periodic structures , which include the frequency-domain response problems of the Helmholtz equation and the Schr\ '' odinger equation as examples .	This approach transforms the dense system of the pseudospectral discretization approximately into an sparse system via an equivalent integral reformulation and a specially-designed sparsifying operator .	The resulting sparse system is then solved efficiently with sparse linear algebra algorithms and serves as a reasonably accurate preconditioner .	When combined with standard iterative methods , this new preconditioner results in small iteration counts .
0	We present the first determination of the Galactic polarized emission at 353 GHz by Archeops .	The data were taken during the Arctic night of February 7 , 2002 after the balloon -- borne instrument was launched by CNES from the Swedish Esrange base near Kiruna .	In addition to the 143 GHz and 217 GHz frequency bands dedicated to CMB studies , Archeops had one 545 GHz and six 353 GHz bolometers mounted in three polarization sensitive pairs that were used for Galactic foreground studies .	We present maps of the I , Q , U Stokes parameters over 17 % of the sky and with a 13 arcmin resolution at 353 GHz ( 850 microns ) .	They show a significant Galactic large scale polarized emission coherent on the longitude ranges [ 100 , 120 ] and [ 180 , 200 ] deg .
3	That is , PhaseLift reduces to a feasibility problem .	We address the problem of recovering an n-vector from m linear measurements lacking sign or phase information .	We show that lifting and semidefinite relaxation suffice by themselves for stable recovery in the setting of m = O ( n log n ) random sensing vectors , with high probability .	The recovery method is optimizationless in the sense that trace minimization in the PhaseLift procedure is unnecessary .	The optimizationless perspective allows for a Douglas-Rachford numerical algorithm that is unavailable for PhaseLift .
4	We will find that a significant difference is possible between the CP violating phases in two decay processes .	CP violation in the B_d system is discussed in the supersymmetric grand unified theory ( GUT ) with the right-handed neutrinos .	Above the GUT scale , the right-handed down-type squarks couple to the right-handed neutrinos .	Due to the renormalization group effect , flavor violations in the lepton sector may be transfered to the right-handed down-type squark mass matrix , which affects the CP violation in the B decay .	Taking into account this effect , we compare the CP violation in B_d \to \psi K_S and B_d \to \phi K_S processes .
2	Different classification methods have been proposed and applied to deal with various real-world problems .	Classification is one of the most popular and widely used supervised learning tasks , which categorizes objects into predefined classes based on known knowledge .	Classification has been an important research topic in machine learning and data mining .	Unlike unsupervised learning such as clustering , a classifier is typically trained with labeled data before being used to make prediction , and usually achieves higher accuracy than unsupervised one .	In this paper , we first define classification and then review several representative methods .
1	However , study of these effects is difficult .	The human lung and its functions are extremely sensitive to orientation and posture , and debate continues as to the role of gravity and the surrounding anatomy in determining lung function and heterogeneity of perfusion and ventilation .	The conventional high-field magnets used for most hyperpolarized 3He MRI of the human lung , and most other common radiological imaging modalities including PET and CT , restrict subjects to lying horizontally , minimizing most gravitational effects .	In this paper , we briefly review the motivation for posture-dependent studies of human lung function , and present initial imaging results of human lungs in the supine and vertical body orientations using inhaled hyperpolarized 3He gas and an open-access MRI instrument .	The open geometry of this MRI system features a `` walk-in '' capability that permits subjects to be imaged in vertical and horizontal positions , and potentially allows for complete rotation of the orientation of the imaging subject in a two-dimensional plane .
2	For sufficiently fast perturbation this smearing exceeds the mean level spacing and the dissipation rate is given by the Kubo formula .	We study the energy dissipation rate in a mesoscopic system described by the parametrically-driven random-matrix Hamiltonian H [ \phi ( t ) ] for the case of linear bias \phi=vt .	Evolution of the field \phi ( t ) causes interlevel transitions leading to energy pumping , and also smears the discrete spectrum of the Hamiltonian .	We calculate the quantum correction to the Kubo result that reveals the original discreteness of the energy spectrum .	The first correction to the system viscosity scales proportional to v^ { -2/3 } in the orthogonal case and vanishes in the unitary case .
2	We show that the class of such $ R $ -diagonal pairs has an absorption property under nested multiplication of free pairs .	In the free probability theory of Voiculescu two of the most frequently used *-distributions are those of a Haar unitary and of a circular element .	We define an $ R $ -diagonal pair as a generalization of these distributions by the requirement that their two-dimensional $ R $ -transform ( or free cumulants ) have a special diagonal form .	This implies that in the polar decomposition of such an element the polar part and the absolute value are free .	Our calculations are based on combinatorial statements about non-crossing partitions , in particular on a canonical bijection between the set of intervals of NC ( n ) and the set of 2-divisible partitions in NC ( 2n ) .
2	This symmetry emerges in the IR as a consequence of the Callias index theorem and abelian duality .	We prove the absence of a mass gap and confinement in the Polyakov model with massless complex fermions in any representation of the gauge group .	A $ U ( 1 ) _ { * } $ topological shift symmetry protects the masslessness of one dual photon .	For matter in the fundamental representation , the infrared limits of this class of theories interpolate between weakly and strongly coupled conformal field theory ( CFT ) depending on the number of flavors , and provide an infinite class of CFTs in $ d=3 $ dimensions .	The long distance physics of the model is same as certain stable spin liquids .
0	Nanoindentation-induced phase transformation in silicon has been studied .	A series of nanoindentations were made with the sharp diamond Berkovich tip .	During nanoindentations , maximum load ranged from 2000 $ \mu $ N to 5000 $ \mu $ N , with a 1000 $ \mu $ N/sec loading rate .	Slow unloading rate at 100 $ \mu $ N/sec was chosen to favor the formation of the crystalline end phases , high pressure phase ( Si-III and Si-XII ) .	Fast unloading rate at 1000 $ \mu $ N/sec was used to obtain amorphous phase .
1	We have measured the ferromagnetic resonance of ferromagnetic nanowire arrays using vector-network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance ( VNA-FMR ) and analyzed the results with the micromagnetic simulations .	We investigate the spin dynamics including Gilbert damping in the ferromagnetic nanowire arrays .	We find excellent agreement between the experimental VNA-FMR spectra and micromagnetic simulations result for various applied magnetic fields .	We find that the demagnetization factor for longitudinal conditions , Nz ( Ny ) increases ( decreases ) as decreasing the nanowire width in the micromagnetic simulations .	For the transverse magnetic field , Nz ( Ny ) increases ( decreases ) as increasing the nanowire width .
3	Our representation offers two main advantages .	This paper introduces EXMOVES , learned exemplar-based features for efficient recognition of actions in videos .	The entries in our descriptor are produced by evaluating a set of movement classifiers over spatial-temporal volumes of the input sequence .	Each movement classifier is a simple exemplar-SVM trained on low-level features , i.e. , an SVM learned using a single annotated positive space-time volume and a large number of unannotated videos .	First , since our mid-level features are learned from individual video exemplars , they require minimal amount of supervision .
0	We propose to analyse quantum protocols by applying formal verification techniques developed in classical computing for the analysis of communicating concurrent systems .	One area of successful application of these techniques is that of classical security protocols , exemplified by Lowe 's discovery and fix of a flaw in the well-known Needham-Schroeder authentication protocol .	Secure quantum cryptographic protocols are also notoriously difficult to design .	Quantum cryptography is therefore an interesting target for formal verification , and provides our first example ; we expect the approach to be transferable to more general quantum information processing scenarios .	The example we use is the quantum key distribution protocol proposed by Bennett and Brassard , commonly referred to as BB84 .
3	We also show that the number of irreducible degree $ n $ polynomials that are not shifted Eisenstein polynomials is infinite .	We study polynomials with integer coefficients which become Eisenstein polynomials after the additive shift of a variable .	We call such polynomials shifted Eisenstein polynomials .	We determine an upper bound on the maximum shift that is needed given a shifted Eisenstein polynomial and also provide a lower bound on the density of shifted Eisenstein polynomials , which is strictly greater than the density of classical Eisenstein polynomials .	We conclude with some numerical results on the densities of shifted Eisenstein polynomials .
1	The model is based on the class of trawl processes , which are stationary , infinitely divisible stochastic processes .	This paper presents a new model for characterising temporal dependence in exceedances above a threshold .	We review properties of trawl processes in the context of statistical modelling , and introduce a new representation that enables exact simulation for discrete observations .	The model for extreme values is constructed by embedding a trawl process in a hierarchical framework , which ensures that the marginal distribution is generalised Pareto , as expected from classical extreme value theory .	We also consider a modified version of this model that works with a wider class of generalised Pareto distributions , and has the advantage of separating marginal and temporal dependence properties .
3	The existence of a majority of [ 4 ] Fe3+ sites illustrates a glass structure that differs from the structure of crystalline NaFeSi2O6 , which contains only octahedral Fe3+ .	The short and medium range structure of a NaFeSi2O6 ( NFS ) glass has been investigated by high-resolution neutron diffraction with Fe isotopic substitution , combined with Empirical Potential Structure Refinement ( EPSR ) simulations .	The majority ( ~60 % ) of Fe is 4-coordinated ( [ 4 ] Fe ) and corresponds only to ferric iron , Fe3+ , with a distance d [ 4 ] Fe3+-O=1.87 $ \pm $ 0.01 { \AA } .	This is at variance with the 3D-structure predicted by glass stoichiometry .	The EPSR modeling of glass structure shows that [ 4 ] Fe3+ is randomly distributed in the silicate network and shares corner with silicate tetrahedra .
3	Future releases will include flux-limited radiation diffusion , thermal heat conduction , two-temperature plasma , and heating and cooling functions .	We describe ZEUS-MP : a Multi-Physics , Massively-Parallel , Message-Passing code for astrophysical fluid dynamics simulations in 3 dimensions .	ZEUS-MP is a follow-on to the sequential ZEUS-2D and ZEUS-3D codes developed and disseminated by the Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics ( lca.ncsa.uiuc.edu ) at NCSA .	V1.0 released 1/1/2000 includes the following physics modules : ideal hydrodynamics , ideal MHD , and self-gravity .	The covariant equations are cast on a moving Eulerian grid with Cartesian , cylindrical , and spherical polar coordinates currently supported .
0	A massive black hole ( MBH ) in a galactic center drives a flow of stars into nearly radial orbits to replace those it destroyed .	Stars whose orbits cross the event horizon r_s or the tidal disruption radius r_t are promptly destroyed in an orbital period P. Stars with orbital periapse r_p slightly larger than the sink radius q=max ( r_s , r_t ) may slowly spiral in due to dissipative interactions with the MBH , e.g.gravitational wave emission , tidal heating or accretion disk drag , with observable consequences and implications for the MBH growth rate .	Unlike prompt destruction , the inspiral time is typically & gt ; & gt ; P. This time is limited by the same scattering process that initially deflected the star into its eccentric orbit , since it can deflect it again to a wider orbit where dissipation is inefficient .	The ratio between slow and prompt event rates is therefore much smaller than that implied by the ratio of cross-sections , ~r_p/q , and so only prompt disruption contributes significantly to the mass of the MBH .	Conversely , most stars that scatter off the MBH survive the extreme tidal interaction ( `` tidal scattering '' ) .
2	Spectroscopy and light curve measurements of this gamma-ray line allow direct measurement of the underlying explosion physics and dynamics , and thus discriminate among the competing models .	We present in this paper a focusing gamma-ray telescope that has only one goal : addressing the true nature of Type Ia Supernovae ( SNe Ia ) .	This telescope is based on a Laue lens focusing a 100-keV wide energy band centered on 847 keV , which correspond to a bright line emitted by the decay chain of 56Ni , a radioactive element massively produced during SNe Ia events .	However reaching this goal the observation of several events with high detection significance , meaning more powerful telescopes .	The telescope concept we present in this paper is composed of a Laue lens held 30 m apart from the focal instrument ( a compact Compton telescope ) by an extensible mast .
1	The mmWave overlaid network however incurs a pitfall that its ample data rate is only applicable for downlink transmissions due to the implementation difficulty at mobile users , leading to an immense difference between uplink and downlink rates .	This paper proposes a cellular network exploiting millimeter-wave ( mmWave ) and ultra-densified base stations ( BSs ) to achieve the far-reaching 5G aim in downlink average rate .	We therefore turn our attention not only to maximize downlink rate but also to ensure the minimum uplink rate .	With this end , we firstly derive the mmWave overlaid ultra-dense cellular network spectral efficiencies for both uplink and downlink cases in closed forms by using stochastic geometry via a lower bound approximation .	In a practical scenario , such tractable results of the proposed network reveal that incumbent micro-wave ( $ \mu $ Wave ) cellular resource should be mostly dedicated to uplink transmissions in order to correspond with the mmWave downlink rate improvement .
4	We present non-linear power spectra from a new suite of N-body simulations for the `` best-bet '' models from each category .	We discuss variants of Cold Dark Matter ( CDM ) dominated cosmological models that give good agreement with a range of observations .	We consider models with hot dark matter , tilt , $ \Omega & lt ; 1 $ , or a cosmological constant .	We also discuss the sensitivity of the results to other parameters , such as the Hubble parameter and the baryon fraction .	We obtain constraints by combining the COBE data , cluster abundances , abundance of damped Lyman- $ \alpha $ systems at $ z\sim3 $ , the small-angle Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy , and the small-scale non-linear power spectrum .
4	Satisfying both constraints requires either of the following : ( i ) H_2 molecules form efficiently at z~20 , survive feedback processes , and allow UV sources in halos with virial temperatures below Tvir=10^4 K to contribute substantially to reionization , or ( ii ) the efficiency epsilon in halos with Tvir & gt ; 10^4K decreased by a factor of ~ 30 between ( z~20 ) and ( z~6 ) .	The recent discovery of a high optical depth tau to Thomson scattering from the WMAP data implies that significant reionization took place at redshifts z~15 .	This discovery has important implications for the sources of reionization , and allows , for the first time , constraints to be placed on physical reionization scenarios out to redshift z~20 .	Using a new suite of semi-analytic reionization models , we show that the high value of tau requires a surprisingly high efficiency epsilon of the first generation of UV sources for injecting ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium .	We find that no simple reionization model can be consistent with the combination of the WMAP result with data from the z & lt ; 6.5 universe .
4	Our results demonstrate that including the diamagnetic term in the photon-electron interaction Hamiltonian drastically improves numerical convergence .	We outline a rigorous method which can be used to solve the many-body Schroedinger equation for a Coulomb interacting electronic system in an external classical magnetic field as well as a quantized electromagnetic field .	Effects of the geometry of the electronic system as well as the polarization of the quantized electromagnetic field are explicitly taken into account .	We accomplish this by performing repeated truncations of many-body spaces in order to keep the size of the many particle basis on a manageable level .	The electron-electron and electron-photon interactions are treated in a nonperturbative manner using `` exact numerical diagonalization '' .
3	The confidence limit for this distinction depends on the mass ratio between the clusters .	The projected gravitational potential of galaxy clusters is reflected in both their X-ray emission and their imprint on the images of background sources due to their gravitational lensing effects .	Since these projections of the potential are weighted differently along the line-of-sight , we propose a method to combine them and remove the degeneracy between two cases : ( i ) a cluster consisting of a single potential well , or ( ii ) an apparent cluster composed of several potential wells projected onto each other .	We demonstrate with simulated data of potential models that this method indeed allows to significantly distinguish multiple from single clusters .	It ranges from ~ 15 sigma for mass ratio 1:1 to ~ 4 sigma for mass ratio 1:6 .
1	It is shown that such impact can lead to creation of bubbles which can propogate through the molecule .	The nonlinear excitations induced in DNA by external force are considered on the basis of Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model .	The interaction of such bubbles with an excess electron or hole is considered .	The numerical experiments demonstrate the possibility of charge transfer induced by bubbles .	The possible applications of the obtained results in nanobioelectronics are discussed .
0	We investigate the consequences of possible medium modifications of the phi meson at finite nuclear matter density on the K+K- mass distribution in photonuclear reactions .	The inclusive cross sections for K+K- pair production are calculated within a semi -- classical BUU transport model , which combines the initial state interaction of the incoming photon with the final state interactions of the produced particles .	The effects of final state interactions on the invariant mass distribution of the observed K+K- pairs are discussed in detail .	In addition we calculate the Coulomb correction and possible effects of hadronic kaon potentials on the K+K- mass spectrum .	Due to the large cross sections for reactions of the final state particles with the surrounding nuclear medium and the influence of the Coulomb potential we find no measurable sensitivity of the observables to the phi properties at finite baryon density .
1	We start by answering the question : `Whatever happened to the light dark matter anomalies ? 'i.e.the fate of the potential dark matter signals observed by the CoGeNT , CRESST-II , CDMS-Si and DAMA/LIBRA experiments .	We review the status and future of direct searches for light dark matter .	We discuss how the excess events in the first two of these experiments have been explained by previously underestimated backgrounds .	For DAMA we summarise the progress and future of mundane explanations for the annual modulation reported in its event rate .	Concerning the future of direct detection we focus on the irreducible background from solar neutrinos .
1	Studies of astrophysical particles ( nuclei , electrons , neutrinos and photons ) at their highest observed energies have implications for fundamental physics as well as astrophysics .	Ultra-high energy cosmic rays ( UHECRs ) are the highest energy messengers of the present universe , with energies up to $ 10^ { 20 } $ eV .	The primary particles interact in the atmosphere and generate extensive air showers .	Analysis of those showers enables one not only to estimate the energy , direction and most probable mass of the primary cosmic particles , but also to obtain information about the properties of their hadronic interactions at an energy more than one order of magnitude above that accessible with the current highest energy human-made accelerator .	In this contribution we will review the state-of-the-art in UHECRs detection .
3	We study the model of a strong adversary which is allowed to change one job at regular intervals .	Evolutionary algorithms have been frequently used for dynamic optimization problems .	With this paper , we contribute to the theoretical understanding of this research area .	We present the first computational complexity analysis of evolutionary algorithms for a dynamic variant of a classical combinatorial optimization problem , namely makespan scheduling .	Furthermore , we investigate the setting of random changes .
0	We studied the role of the tensor interaction in He isotopes systematically on the basis of the tensor-optimized shell model ( TOSM ) .	We use a bare nucleon-nucleon interaction AV8 obtained from nucleon-nucleon scattering data .	The short-range correlation is treated in the unitary correlation operator method ( UCOM ) .	Using the TOSM+UCOM approach , we investigate the role of tensor interaction on each spectrum in He isotopes .	It is found that the tensor interaction enhances the LS splitting energy observed in 5He , in which the p1/2 and p3/2 orbits play different roles on the tensor correlation .
2	The spectrum of the color singlet Reggeon compound states - perturbative Pomerons and Odderons , is expressed by means of the Bethe Ansatz in terms of the fundamental $ Q- $ function , which satisfies the Baxter equation for the XXX Heisenberg magnet .	The Regge behaviour of the scattering amplitudes in perturbative QCD is governed in the generalized leading logarithmic approximation by the contribution of the color -- singlet compound states of Reggeized gluons .	The interaction between Reggeons is described by the effective hamiltonian , which in the multi -- color limit turns out to be identical to the hamiltonian of the completely integrable one -- dimensional XXX Heisenberg magnet of noncompact spin $ s=0 $ .	The exact solution of the Baxter equation is known only in the simplest case of the compound state of two Reggeons , the BFKL Pomeron .	For higher Reggeon states the method is developed which allows to find its general solution as an asymptotic series in powers of the inverse conformal weight of the Reggeon states .
1	The unknown of the coupled Burgers equation is integrated in time by aid of the Crank-Nicolson method .	The coupled Burgers equation is solved by way of the trigonometric B-spline collocation method .	Resulting time-integrated coupled Burgers equation is discretized using the trigonometric cubic B-spline collocation method .	Fully-integrated couupled Burgers equation which is a system of nonlinear algebraic equation is solved with a variant of Thomas algorithm .	The three model test problems are studied to illustrate the accuracy of the suggested method .
2	Practically this means noisy quantum operations could cause ESD during the encoding process in quantum communication protocols like special dense coding ( $ \cal S $ ) .	We show how , in the presence of quantum noises generated by non-commuting Lindblad operators , a maximally entangled Bell state may suffer entanglement sudden death ( ESD ) .	Similarly , ESD may occur when a Bell state is under the action of a quantum operation generated by a Hamiltonian in the presence of a quantum noise , provided that the Hamiltonian does not commute with the corresponding Lindblad operator .	Next , we show how in the presence of quantum noises which cause ESD , a Bell state may lose its capacity for $ \cal S $ before ESD occurs .	Finally , we show that a Bell state may indeed fail to yield information transfer better than classically possible when the encoding operations of $ \cal S $ are noisy , even though entanglement is not totally destroyed in the process .
2	This second-class constrained model is quantized by Dirac Hamiltonian method and symplectic formalism .	The SU ( 2 ) collective coordinates expansion of the Born-Infeld\break Skyrmion Lagrangian is performed .	The classical Hamiltonian is computed from this special Lagrangian in approximative way : it is derived from the expansion of this non-polynomial Lagrangian up to second-order variable in the collective coordinates .	Although it is not expected to find symmetries on second-class systems , a hidden symmetry is disclosed by formulating the Born-Infeld Skyrmion % model as a gauge theory .	To this end we developed a new constraint conversion technique based on the symplectic formalism .
4	It is shown that at finite N_c the two low-energy theories obtained in these ways are different .	Supersymmetric orbifold projection of N=1 SQCD with relatively small number of flavors ( not larger than the number of colors ) is considered .	The purpose is to check whether orbifolding commutes with the infrared limit .	On the one hand , one considers the orbifold projection of SQCD and obtains the low-energy description of the resulting theory .	On the other hand , one starts with the low-energy effective theory of the original SQCD , and only then perfoms orbifolding .
0	We study spectral properties of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on two relevant almost-Riemannian manifolds , namely the Grushin structures on the cylinder and on the sphere .	This operator contains first order diverging terms caused by the divergence of the volume .	We get explicit descriptions of the spectrum and the eigenfunctions .	In particular in both cases we get a Weyl 's law with leading term $ E\log E $ .	We then study the drastic effect of Aharonov-Bohm magnetic potentials on the spectral properties .
3	To deal with the resonance , we generalize the time-dependent Fermi 's golden rule expression for the ET rate in the $ T $ -matrix framework .	It is well known that the electron transfer ( ET ) reaction in donor-bridge-acceptor systems is much influenced by the bridge conformational changes .	However , the importance of the dynamical contribution to the ET rate is still under debate .	In this study , we investigate the significance of the dynamical non-Condon effect on the ET rate in the coherent resonant tunneling regime .	The dynamical effect is thereby expressed in terms of the time correlation function of the non-Hermitian $ T $ -matrix .
3	Taking into account minispike depletion processes , we only sum contributions from a cosmological distribution of IMBHs with maintained minispikes .	We investigate contributions to the extragalactic gamma-ray background ( EGB ) due to neutralino dark matter ( DM ) pair-annihilation into photons , from DM density enhancements ( minispikes ) surrounding intermediate-mass black holes ( IMBHs ) .	We focus on two IMBH formation scenarios ; our conservative scenario where IMBHs are remnants of Population-III stars , and our optimistic scenario here IMBHs are formed in protogalactic disks .	In both scenarios , their formation in pregalactic halos at high redshift lead to the formation of minispikes that are bright sources of gamma-ray photons .	Our conservative scenario ( BH mass 10^2 M_sun with a r^ { -3/2 } minispike ) predicts gamma-ray fluxes that are an order larger than the equivalent flux , using the same DM parameters ( mass 100 GeV and annihilation cross-section 3 \times 10^ { -26 } cm^3 s^ { -1 } , from the host halo without IMBH minispikes .
3	I calculate the cross sections of the three processes - the Compton scattering , electron-positron pair annihilation and production in a plasma .	The square of the four momentum of a photon in vacuum is zero .	However , in an unmagnetized plasma it is equal to the square of the plasma frequency .	Further , the electron-photon coupling vertex is modified in a plasma to include the effect of the plasma medium .	At high plasma densities , the cross sections are found to change significantly .
0	Business analysts and domain experts are often sketching the behaviors of a software system using high-level models that are technology- and platform-independent .	The developers will refine and enrich these high-level models with technical details .	As a consequence , the refined models can deviate from the original models over time , especially when the two kinds of models evolve independently .	In this context , we focus on behavior models ; that is , we aim to ensure that the refined , low-level behavior models conform to the corresponding high-level behavior models .	Based on existing formal verification techniques , we propose containment checking as a means to assess whether the system 's behaviors described by the low-level models satisfy what has been specified in the high-level counterparts .
1	If $ \alpha $ is a quadratic irrationality of certain type , such as the square root of a rational number , we show that the minimal gap is roughly of size 1/N , which is essentially consistent with Poisson statistics .	We study the size of the minimal gap between the first N eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a rectangular billiard having irrational squared aspect ratio $ \alpha $ , in comparison to the corresponding quantity for a Poissonian sequence .	We also give related results for a set of $ \alpha $ 's of full measure .	However , on a fine scale we show that Poisson statistics is violated for all $ \alpha $ .	The proofs use a variety of ideas of an arithmetical nature , involving Diophantine approximation , the theory of continued fractions , and results in analytic number theory .
0	We study the structure of neutron stars in $ f ( R ) =R+\alpha R^ { 2 } $ theory of gravity ( Starobinsky model ) , in an exact and non-perturbative approach .	In this model , apart from the standard General Relativistic junction conditions , two extra conditions , namely the continuity of the curvature scalar and its first derivative needs to be satisfied .	For an exterior Schwarzschild solution , the curvature scalar and its derivative has to be zero at the stellar surface .	We show that for some equation of state ( EoS ) of matter , matching all conditions at the surface of the star is impossible .	Hence the model brings two major fine-tuning problems : ( i ) only some particular classes of EoS are consistent with Schwarzschild at the surface and ( ii ) given that EoS , only a very particular set of boundary conditions at the centre of the star will satisfy the given boundary conditions at the surface .
4	We give an explicit proof that the regularized representation of the FL gives for integer powers $ \frac { \alpha } { 2 } \in \N\_0 $ a distributional representation of the standard Laplacian operator $ \Delta $ including the trivial unity operator for $ \alpha\rightarrow 0 $ .	We demonstrate that the fractional Laplacian ( FL ) is the principal characteristic operator of harmonic systems with { \it self-similar } interparticle interactions .	We show that the FL represents the `` { \it fractional continuum limit } '' of a discrete `` self-similar Laplacian '' which is obtained by Hamilton 's variational principle from a discrete spring model .	We deduce from generalized self-similar elastic potentials regular representations for the FL which involve convolutions of symmetric finite difference operators of even orders extending the standard representation of the FL .	Further we deduce a regularized representation for the FL $ - ( -\Delta ) ^ { \frac { \alpha } { 2 } } $ holding for $ \alpha\in \R \geq 0 $ .
0	One possible solution to achieve high contrast direct imaging at a small inner working angle ( IWA ) is to use a vector vortex coronagraph ( VVC ) , which provides a continuous helical phase ramp in the focal plane of the telescope with a phase singularity in its center .	Such an optical vortex is characterized by its topological charge , i.e. , the number of times the phase accumulates 2 { \pi } radians along a closed path surrounding the singularity .	Over the past few years , we have been developing a charge-2 VVC induced by rotationally symmetric subwavelength gratings ( SGVC2 ) , also known as the Annular Groove Phase Mask ( AGPM ) .	Since 2013 , several SGVC2s ( or AGPMs ) were manufactured using synthetic diamond substrate , then validated on dedicated optical benches , and installed on 10-m class telescopes .	Increasing the topological charge seems however mandatory for cancelling the light of bright stars which will be partially resolved by future Extremely Large Telescopes in the near-infrared .
3	In spacetime as a whole , therefore , quantum information is widely replicated but in a restricted fashion .	One of the most important properties of quantum information , and the one ultimately responsible for its cryptographic applications , is that it ca n't be copied .	That statement , however , is not completely accurate .	While the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics prevents quantum information from being copied in space , the reversibility of microscopic physics actually requires that the information be copied in time .	We fully characterize which regions of spacetime can all hold the same quantum information .
2	With this the total cross section and the real part of the hadronic amplitude may be simultaneously investigated and , with the exception of the diffraction minimum at some ISR energies , a satisfactory description of all experimental data is obtained .	We analyse pp elastic scattering data at the highest accelerator energy region ( between 10 and 63 GeV ) through a multiple diffraction approach .	The use of Martin 's formula in a model developed earlier is substituted by the introduction of a complex elementary ( parton-parton ) amplitude .	Total cross sections extrapolations to cosmic-ray energies ( above 6 TeV ) show agreement with the reanalysis of the Akeno data performed by N. N. Nikolaev and also with Gaisser , Sukhatme and Yodh results , leading to the prediction 147 mb for the total cross section at 16 TeV .	Physical interpretations and critical remarks concerning our parametrizations and results are also presented and discussed .
3	Using the numerical simulations , we first investigate the effect of elastic modulus of sample ( relative to the substrate surface ) and probe stiffness on the scan results .	We investigate nano scanning in tapping mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) under quality ( Q ) control via numerical simulations performed in SIMULINK .	We focus on the simulation of whole scan process rather than the simulation of cantilever dynamics and the force interactions between the probe tip and the surface alone , as in most of the earlier numerical studies .	This enables us to quantify the scan performance under Q control for different scan settings .	Our numerical simulations show that scanning in attractive regime using soft cantilevers with high Qeff results in a better image quality .
3	Hence even ladders should have a dynamically generated spin gap , while odd ladders with half-integer spin should stay gapless , and physically equivalent to a perturbed $ SU ( 2 ) _1 $ Wess-Zumino -Witten model in the infrared regime .	The well known Haldane map from spin chains into the $ O ( 3 ) $ non linear sigma model is generalized to the case of spin ladders .	This map allows us to explain the different qualitative behaviour between even and odd ladders , exactly in the same way it explains the difference between integer and half-integer spin chains .	Namely , for even ladders the topological term in the sigma model action is absent , while for odd ladders the $ \theta $ parameter , which multiplies the topological term , is equal to $ 2 \pi S $ , where $ S $ is the spin of the ladder .	We also derive some consequences from the dependence of the sigma model coupling constant on the ladder Heisenberg couplings constants .
3	The final energy spectrum of the accelerated ion beam is improved dramatically .	Using multi-dimensional particle-in-cell ( PIC ) simulations we study ion acceleration from a foil irradiated by a circularly polarized laser pulse at 1022W/cm^2 intensity .	When the foil is shaped initially in the transverse direction to match the laser intensity profile , the center part of the target can be uniformly accelerated for a longer time compared to a usual flat target .	Target deformation and undesirable plasma heating are effectively suppressed .	Collimated GeV quasi-mono-energetic ion beams carrying as much as 18 % of the laser energy are observed in multi-dimensional simulations .
1	We concentrate here on the supersymmetric QCD corrections and give the analytic expression for these corrections .	The purpose of this note is to give the one loop radiative corrections to the top quark pair production in the $ p\bar { p } $ annihilation at the Fermilab Tevatron in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model .	Recently Li et.al .	have reported the supersymmetric QCD corrections to this process we indicate clearly a comparison of their and our work .	In particular , we find additional corrections [ crossed box and gluon self-energy ] at the one loop level which are not given by Li et .
2	We aim to test theoretical predictions on the luminosity limit for the onset of third dredge-up .	We searched for Technetium ( Tc ) in a sample of bright oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) stars located in the outer galactic bulge .	Tc is an unstable element synthesised via the s-process in deep layers of AGB stars , thus it is a reliable indicator of both recent s-process activity and third dredge-up .	Using high resolution optical spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph at ESO 's VLT we search for resonance lines of neutral Tc in the blue spectral region of our sample stars .	These measurements allow us to improve the procedure of classification of stars with respect to their Tc content by using flux ratios .
0	We study the kinematics and cross section of the scattering process $ e p \rightarrow e \Sigma^+ $ .	The cross section is expressed in terms of complex form factors characterizing the hadron vertices .	We estimate the cross section for small momentum transfer using known experimental information .	To first order in the momentum transfer , we obtain a model independent result for the photon-exchange part of the cross section , which is completely determined by the decay width $ \Gamma ( \Sigma^+ \rightarrow p\gamma ) $ .	For the kinematics of the parity violation experiment at MAMI , this first order result gives rise to a ratio of $ ( d\sigma/d\Omega ) _ { ep\rightarrow e\Sigma^+ } $ $ / ( d\sigma/d\Omega ) _ { ep\rightarrow ep } \simeq 4.0\times 10^ { -15 } $ .
0	This study deals with the evolution of the so called intelligent networks ( insect society without leader , cells of an organism , brain ... ) during their apprenticeship period .	The used formalism draws one 's inspiration from the one of the Quantum field theory ( Principle of stationary action , gauge fields , invariance by symmetry transformations ... ) .	After a recall of some definitions , we consider at first the free network , that is to say which does not exchange any information with outside .	Then we study the evolution of the network connected with its environment , that is to say immersed into an information field created by this environment which so dictates to it the apprenticeship constraints .	At that time , we obtain Lagrange equations which solutions describe the network evolution during the whole apprenticeship period .
4	We show that this limit can only be consistently defined for a field subalgebra of the generalized model .	A foundational investigation of the basic structural properties of two-dimensional anomalous gauge theories is performed .	The Hilbert space is constructed as the representation of the intrinsic local field algebra generated by the fundamental set of field operators whose Wightman functions define the model .	We examine the effect of the use of a redundant field algebra in deriving basic properties of the models and show that different results may arise , as regards the physical properties of the generalized chiral model , in restricting or not the Hilbert space as representation of the intrinsic local field algebra .	The question referring to considering the vector Schwinger model as a limit of the generalized anomalous model is also discussed .
2	The approach is tested on artificial problems generated with two real-world problems as templates .	A novel method is presented and explored within the framework of Potts neural networks for solving optimization problems with a non-trivial topology , with the airline crew scheduling problem as a target application .	The key ingredient to handle the topological complications is a propagator defined in terms of Potts neurons .	The results are compared against the properties of the corresponding unrestricted problems .	The latter are subject to a detailed analysis in a companion paper [ LU TP 97-11 ] .
4	Among these models , we present a scenario in which the Higgs arises as a pseudo-Goldstone boson .	We study the breaking of supersymmetry in models with anomalous U ( 1 ) .	These models are simple to construct and contain natural candidates for being the messengers of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking .	When some of the ordinary matter fields transform under the anomalous U ( 1 ) , we find a hybrid scenario in which the U ( 1 ) and the gauge interactions mediate the breaking of supersymmetry .	This leads to a hierarchy of soft masses between the charged and neutral fields and provides a solution to the $ \mu $ -problem .
3	These experiments suggest that coherent long range molecular interaction must be at work in water so to allow the observed features .	The experimental conditions by which electromagnetic signals ( EMS ) of low frequency can be emitted by diluted aqueous solutions of some bacterial and viral DNAs are described .	That the recorded EMS and nanostructures induced in water carry the DNA information ( sequence ) is shown by retrieval of that same DNA by classical PCR amplification using the TAQ polymerase , including both primers and nucleotides .	Moreover , such a transduction process has also been observed in living human cells exposed to EMS irradiation .	The quantum field theory analysis of the phenomenon is presented .
4	MPs can exchange particles and information .	We develop a new Lagrangian material particle -- dynamical domain decomposition method ( MPD^3 ) for large scale parallel molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation of nonstationary heterogeneous systems on a heterogeneous computing net .	MPD^3 is based on Voronoi decomposition of simulated matter .	The map of Voronoi polygons is known as the Dirichlet tessellation and used for grid generation in computational fluid dynamics .	From the hydrodynamics point of view the moving Voronoi polygon looks as a material particle ( MP ) .
3	Somatosensory system is the one of the critical and must have systems of human body .	Nanonetwork design and analysis has become a very interesting topic in recent years .	Though this area of research is in its formative stage , it definitely posses a strong integrity in finding out numerous applications in medical and allied sciences .	Nanonetworking is indeed a nature built foundation which comprises human intra body communications .	This literature concentrates on the body discriminative touch and proprioception mechanism of somatosensory system .
2	The signal detection problem can be naturally posed in terms of the sample generalized eigenvalues .	The detection problem in statistical signal processing can be succinctly formulated : Given m ( possibly ) signal bearing , n-dimensional signal-plus-noise snapshot vectors ( samples ) and N statistically independent n-dimensional noise-only snapshot vectors , can one reliably infer the presence of a signal ?	This problem arises in the context of applications as diverse as radar , sonar , wireless communications , bioinformatics , and machine learning and is the critical first step in the subsequent signal parameter estimation phase .	The sample generalized eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by `` whitening '' the signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix with the noise-only sample covariance matrix .	In this article we prove a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample generalized eigenvalue based detection of signals in arbitrarily colored noise when there are relatively few signal bearing and noise-only samples .
3	The proposed FNCAC can achieve reduced call blocking probability keeping the resource utilisation at an optimal level .	The Call admission control ( CAC ) is one of the Radio Resource Management ( RRM ) techniques plays instrumental role in ensuring the desired Quality of Service ( QoS ) to the users working on different applications which have diversified nature of QoS requirements .	This paper proposes a fuzzy neural approach for call admission control in a multi class traffic based Next Generation Wireless Networks ( NGWN ) .	The proposed Fuzzy Neural Call Admission Control ( FNCAC ) scheme is an integrated CAC module that combines the linguistic control capabilities of the fuzzy logic controller and the learning capabilities of the neural networks .The model is based on Recurrent Radial Basis Function Networks ( RRBFN ) which have better learning and adaptability that can be used to develop the intelligent system to handle the incoming traffic in the heterogeneous network environment .	In the proposed algorithm we have considered three classes of traffic having different QoS requirements .
3	We also present the linear growth rate as a function of beta , the ratio between radiation force and gravity , and c_s , the sound speed of the disk , obtained using two methods : a semi-analytic analysis of the linearized equations and a numerical simulation using the GPU-accelerated hydrodynamical code PEnGUIn .	An instability can potentially operate in highly irradiated disks where the disk sharply transitions from being radially transparent to opaque ( the 'transition region ' ) .	Such conditions may exist at the inner edges of transitional disks around T Tauri stars and accretion disks around AGNs .	We derive the criterion for this instability , which we term the 'irradiation instability ' , or IRI .	In particular , we find that IRI occurs at beta~0.1 if the transition region extends as wide as ~0.05r , and at higher beta values if it is wider .
2	The interaction of the vortex half -- ring and an external homogeneous magnetic field applied along the surface is studied .	The magnetic field distribution , the magnetic flux , and the free energy of an Abrikosov vortex loop near a flat surface of type -- II superconductors are calculated in the London approximation .	The shape of such a vortex line is a semicircle of arbitrary radius .	The magnitude of the energy barrier against the vortex expansion into superconductor is found .	The possibilities of formation of an equilibrium vortex line determined by the structure of the applied magnetic field by creating the expanding vortex loops near the surface of type -- II superconductor are discussed .
1	But unlike transient conditions like flu , social media users are less vocal about chronic conditions such as obesity , as users might not tweet `` I 'm still overweight '' .	To use social media for health-related analysis , one key step is the detection of health-related labels for users .	As , however , obesity-related conditions such as diabetes , heart disease , osteoarthritis , and even cancer are on the rise , this obese-or-not label could be one of the most useful for studies in public health .	In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using profile pictures to infer if a user is overweight or not .	We show that this is indeed possible and further show that the fraction of labeled-as-overweight users is higher in U.S. counties with higher obesity rates .
1	Usually , the distribution function $ F $ of the $ X_i $ is the target of interest .	Under left truncation , data $ ( X_i , Y_i ) $ are observed only when $ Y_i\le X_i $ .	In this paper , we study linear functionals $ \int\varphi \mathrm { d } F_n $ of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator ( MLE ) of $ F $ , the Lynden-Bell estimator $ F_n $ .	A useful representation of $ \int \varphi \mathrm { d } F_n $ is derived which yields asymptotic normality under optimal moment conditions on the score function $ \varphi $ .	No continuity assumption on $ F $ is required .
3	Such states correspond to quasistationary electromagnetic modes trapped in the scattering structure .	We assert that the physics underlying the extraordinary light transmission ( reflection ) in nanostructured materials can be understood from rather general principles based on the formal scattering theory developed in quantum mechanics .	The Maxwell equations in passive ( dispersive and absorptive ) linear media are written in the form of the Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation to which the quantum mechanical resonant scattering theory ( the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism ) is applied .	It is demonstrated that the existence of long-lived quasistationary eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian for the Maxwell theory naturally explains the extraordinary transmission properties observed in various nanostructured materials .	Our general approach is also illustrated with an example of the zero-order transmission of the TE-polarized light through a metal-dielectric grating structure .
2	In this work , we present the first direct measurement of the IGM temperature around a z=6 quasar by analysing the Doppler widths of Lya absorption lines in the proximity zone of SDSS J0818+1722 .	The thermal state of the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) provides an indirect probe of both the HI and HeII reionisation epochs .	Current constraints on the IGM temperature from the Lya forest are restricted to the redshift range 2 & lt ; z & lt ; 4.5 , limiting the ability to probe the thermal memory of HI reionisation toward higher redshift .	We use a high resolution ( R= 40000 ) Keck/HIRES spectrum in combination with detailed numerical modelling to obtain the temperature at mean density , T_0=23600\pm^5000_6900K ( \pm^9200_9300K ) at 68 ( 95 ) per cent confidence assuming a prior probability 13500K & lt ; T_0 & lt ; 38500 K following HI and HeII reionisation .	This enables us to place an upper limit on the redshift of HI reionisation , z_H , within 33 comoving Mpc of SDSS J0818+1722 .
1	We present a general relation between masses of new gauge bosons and their couplings to fermions .	We consider the phenomenology of new neutral gauge bosons with flavour non-diagonal couplings to fermions , inherent in 6D models explaining successfully the hierarchy of masses as well as the mixing for quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos ( this model can in particular be credited with the correct prediction of the neutrino mixing angle $ \theta_ { 13 } $ ) .	We show that in the current realization of the model , the new heavy bosons are unreachable at LHC but argue why the constraint could be relaxed in the context of a different realization .	In view of a more systematic study , we use an effective model inspired by the above to relate directly rare meson decays to possible LHC observations .	In terms of effective Lagrangians , this can be seen as the introduction in the model of only one overall scaling parameter to extend our approach without modifying the 4D ( gauge ) structure .
1	We then investigate the associated topological groupoids and in particular their representations on certain direct integrals with non constant fibres .	We carry out a careful study of basic topological and ergodic features of Delone dynamical systems .	Via non-commutative-integration theory these representations give rise to von Neumann algebras of random operators .	Features of these algebras and operators are discussed .	Restricting our attention to a certain subalgebra of tight binding operators , we then discuss a Shubin trace formula .
1	To communicate effectively through Twitter , policy makers need to understand how influence and interest propagate within its network of users .	With the rise of social media as an important channel for the debate and discussion of public affairs , online social networks such as Twitter have become important platforms for public information and engagement by policy makers .	In this chapter we use graph-theoretic methods to analyse the Twitter debate surrounding NHS England 's controversial care.data scheme .	Directionality is a crucial feature of the Twitter social graph - information flows from the followed to the followers - but is often ignored in social network analyses ; our methods are based on the behaviour of dynamic processes on the network and can be applied naturally to directed networks .	We uncover robust communities of users and show that these communities reflect how information flows through the Twitter network .
2	In this paper , we present the Gaussian beam method for the Dirac equation .	The Dirac equation is an important model in relativistic quantum mechanics .	In the semi-classical regime $ \epsilon\ll1 $ , even a spatially spectrally accurate time splitting method \cite { HuJi:05 } requires the mesh size to be $ O ( \epsilon ) $ , which makes the direct simulation extremely expensive .	With the help of an eigenvalue decomposition , the Gaussian beams can be independently evolved along each eigenspace and summed to construct an approximate solution of the Dirac equation .	Moreover , the proposed Eulerian Gaussian beam keeps the advantages of constructing the Hessian matrices by simply using level set functions ' derivatives .
3	Differentiability ( $ C^ { 1 , \alpha } $ regularity ) of the boundary data implies the corresponding result for the solution in the interior , despite the fact that the solution need not be continuous up to the boundary .	The Convex Envelope of a given function was recently characterized as the solution of a fully nonlinear Partial Differential Equation ( PDE ) .	In this article we study a modified problem : the Dirichlet problem for the underlying PDE .	The main result is an optimal regularity result .	Secondary results are the characterization of the convex envelope as : ( i ) the value function of a stochastic control problem , and ( ii ) the optimal underestimator for a class of nonlinear elliptic PDEs .
1	When the action of the isometry group on the complex structures is non -- trivial , extended supersymmetry is realized non -- locally after duality , using path ordered Wilson lines .	Non -- Abelian duality in relation to supersymmetry is examined .	Prototype examples considered in detail are , hyper -- Kahler metrics with SO ( 3 ) isometry and supersymmetric WZW models .	For the latter , the natural objects in the non -- local realizations of supersymmetry arising after duality are the classical non -- Abelian parafermions .	The canonical equivalence of WZW models and their non -- Abelian duals with respect to a vector subgroup is also established .
4	Finally , we use the generating technique recently proposed by Garfinkle to construct a traveling wave on the extremal variant of one of our solutions .	We derive several new solutions in three-dimensional stringy gravity .	The solutions are obtained with the help of string duality transformations .	They represent stationary configurations with horizons , and are surrounded by ( quasi ) topologically massive Abelian gauge hair , in addition to the dilaton and the Kalb-Ramond axion .	Our analysis suggests that there exists a more general family , where our solutions are special limits .
3	The instrumented was operated with a satisfying energy scale calibration over a period of 8 years .	According to the international standard ISO 15472 the energy scale of an XPS instrument , type Physical Electronics Quantum 2000 , was calibrated .	It is shown , how the procedures of the ISO 15472 were adapted to the hardware and software design of the Quantum 2000 .	The long time stability of the energy scale calibration of the XPS instrument was investigated .	All the time energy differences between certain peaks could be measured with the chosen precision of the energy scale calibration .
2	This improves results obtained with arithmetic methods by Favre and Rivera-Letellier in the unicritical family and Favre and the first author in the space of degree d polynomials .	In the moduli space of degree d polynomials , we prove the equidistribution of postcritically finite polynomials toward the bifurcation measure .	More precisely , using complex analytic arguments and pluripotential theory , we prove the exponential speed of convergence for C 2-observables .	We deduce from that the equidistribution of hyperbolic parameters with ( d -- 1 ) distinct attracting cycles of given multipliers toward the bifurcation measure with exponential speed for C 1-observables .	As an application , we prove the equidistribution ( up to an explicit extraction ) of parameters with ( d -- 1 ) distinct cycles with prescribed multiplier toward the bifurcation measure for any ( d -- 1 ) multipliers outside a pluripolar set .
3	Beyond 3Re dark matter starts to play important dynamical role .	In this paper we analyze the problem of the total mass and the total mass-to-light ratio of the early-type galaxy NGC 4649 ( M60 ) .	We have used two independent techniques : the X-ray methodology which is based on the temperature of the X-ray halo of NGC 4649 and the tracer mass estimator ( TME ) which uses globular clusters ( GCs ) observed in this galaxy .	We calculated the mass in Newtonian and MOdified Newtonian Dynamics ( MOND ) approaches and found that interior to 3 effective radii ( Re ) there is no need for large amounts of dark matter .	We also discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between the estimates of the total mass based on X-rays and TME in the outer regions of NGC 4649 .
1	The core of the algorithm is based on building a graph representation of the contoured image , which occupies less storage space than produced by raster compression techniques .	A novel algorithm for creating a mathematical model of curved shapes is introduced .	Different advanced applications of the mathematical model are discussed : recognition of handwritten characters and verification of handwritten text and signatures for authentification purposes .	Reducing the storage requirements due to the efficient mathematical model results in faster retrieval and processing times .	The experimental outcomes in compression of contoured images and recognition of handwritten numerals are given .
2	We specially analyze applications to brane world models .	We study the interaction of an n-dimensional topological defect ( n-brane ) described by the Nambu-Goto action with a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole moving in the bulk spacetime .	We derive the general form of the perturbation equations for an n-brane in the weak field approximation and solve them analytically in the most interesting cases .	We calculate the induced geometry on the brane generated by a moving black hole .	From the point of view of a brane observer , this geometry can be obtained by solving ( n+1 ) -dimensional Einstein 's equations with a non-vanishing right hand side .
4	We show that every set $ S\subseteq\mathbb { R } ^2 $ with simply connected components satisfies $ \operatorname { b } ( S ) \leq\alpha\operatorname { c } ( S ) $ for an absolute constant $ \alpha $ , provided $ \operatorname { b } ( S ) $ is defined .	Let $ S $ be a subset of $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ with finite positive Lebesgue measure .	The Beer index of convexity $ \operatorname { b } ( S ) $ of $ S $ is the probability that two points of $ S $ chosen uniformly independently at random see each other in $ S $ .	The convexity ratio $ \operatorname { c } ( S ) $ of $ S $ is the Lebesgue measure of the largest convex subset of $ S $ divided by the Lebesgue measure of $ S $ .	We investigate the relationship between these two natural measures of convexity of $ S $ .
4	In general , however , the Cauchy-problem will be ill-posed , and examples will be given to that effect .	The behaviour of solutions to the partial differential equation $ ( D + \lambda W ) f_\lambda = 0 $ is discussed , where $ D $ is a normal hyperbolic partial differential operator , or pre-normal hyperbolic operator , on $ n $ -dimensional Minkowski spacetime .	The potential term $ W $ is a $ C_0^\infty $ kernel operator which , in general , will be non-local in time , and $ \lambda $ is a complex parameter .	A result is presented which states that there are unique advanced and retarded Green 's operators for this partial differential equation if $ |\lambda| $ is small enough ( and also for a larger set of $ \lambda $ values ) .	Moreover , a scattering operator can be defined if the $ \lambda $ values admit advanced and retarded Green operators .
4	However , with the exception of [ 3 ] , no past work has looked specifically at identifying influence bots on a specific topic .	A number of organizations ranging from terrorist groups such as ISIS to politicians and nation states reportedly conduct explicit campaigns to influence opinion on social media , posing a risk to democratic processes .	There is thus a growing need to identify and eliminate `` influence bots '' - realistic , automated identities that illicitly shape discussion on sites like Twitter and Facebook - before they get too influential .	Spurred by such events , DARPA held a 4-week competition in February/March 2015 in which multiple teams supported by the DARPA Social Media in Strategic Communications program competed to identify a set of previously identified `` influence bots '' serving as ground truth on a specific topic within Twitter .	Past work regarding influence bots often has difficulty supporting claims about accuracy , since there is limited ground truth ( though some exceptions do exist [ 3,7 ] ) .
4	Quantitatively , we compute the likelihood of reconciling a regular Jovian satellite orbit with the current orbit of Callisto following an ice giant ejection by Jupiter of ~ 42 % and conclude that such a large likelihood supports the hypothesis of a fifth giant planet 's existence .	Models of the dynamical evolution of the early solar system following the dispersal of the gaseous protoplanetary disk have been widely successful in reconstructing the current orbital configuration of the giant planets .	Statistically , some of the most successful dynamical evolution simulations have initially included a hypothetical fifth giant planet , of ice giant mass , which gets ejected by a gas giant during the early solar system 's proposed instability phase .	We investigate the likelihood of an ice giant ejection event by either Jupiter or Saturn through constraints imposed by the current orbits of their wide-separation regular satellites Callisto and Iapetus respectively .	We show that planetary encounters that are sufficient to eject an ice giant , often provide excessive perturbations to the orbits of Callisto and Iapetus making it difficult to reconcile a planet ejection event with the current orbit of either satellite .
0	We propose a technique for performing quantum state tomography of photonic polarization-encoded multi-qubit states .	Our method uses a single rotating wave plate , a polarizing beam splitter and two photon-counting detectors per photon mode .	As the wave plate rotates , the photon counters measure a pseudo-continuous signal which is then Fourier transformed .	The density matrix of the state is reconstructed using the relationship between the Fourier coefficients of the signal and the Stokes ' parameters that represent the state .	The experimental complexity , i.e.different wave plate rotation frequencies , scales linearly with the number of qubits .
2	The full-disk images were transformed into Lambert equal-area projection maps and partitioned into a series of overlapping sub-images from which local histograms were extracted .	We identify coronal holes using a histogram-based intensity thresholding technique and compare their properties to fast solar wind streams at three different points in the heliosphere .	The thresholding technique was tested on EUV and X-ray images obtained using instruments onboard STEREO , SOHO and Hinode .	The histograms were used to determine the threshold for the low intensity regions , which were then classified as coronal holes or filaments using magnetograms from the SOHO/MDI .	For all three instruments , the local thresholding algorithm was found to successfully determine coronal hole boundaries in a consistent manner .
2	At LHC with 10 fb^-1 at 14 TeV the combined limits on V_td may be reduced by almost a factor of two when the top rapidity distribution is used .	Single top production processes are usually regarded as the ones in which V_tb can be directly measured at hadron colliders .	We show that the analysis of the single top rapidity distribution in t-channel and tW production can also set direct limits on V_td .	This also implies that the limits on V_tb can also be reduced by 15 % , since both parameters as well as V_ts must be simultaneously obtained from a global fit to data .	At Tevatron the explotation of this distribution would require very high statistics .
1	The proliferation of the next generation sensor nodes , has not solved this problem , because of the greater emphasis on low-cost deployment .	Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks ( WSNs ) indeed is critical ; due to the criticality of the resources in the sensor nodes as well as due to their ubiquitous and pervasive deployment , with varying attributes and degrees of security required .	In addition , the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop communication that in turn , necessitates the security support to be devised at the link layer ( increasing the cost of security related operations ) , instead of being at the application layer , as in general networks .	Therefore , an energy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated .	There do exists a number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of the security attributes desired by different WSN applications .
3	In La_ { 2-x } Sr_xCuO4 the spin excitations are overdamped which leads to a broad low-frequency feature in the susceptibility .	The magnetic susceptibility of underdoped yttrium and lanthanum cuprates is interpreted based on the self-consistent solution of the t-J model of a Cu-O plane .	The calculations reproduce correctly the frequency dependencies of the susceptibility in YBa2Cu3O_ { 7-y } and La_ { 2-x } Sr_xCuO4 attributing their dissimilarity to the difference in the damping of spin excitations .	In YBa2Cu3O_ { 7-y } these excitations are well defined at the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q= ( \pi , \pi ) even in the normal state which manifests itself in a pronounced maximum -- the resonance peak -- in the susceptibility .	The low-frequency incommensurability in the magnetic response is attributed to a dip in the magnon damping at Q .
1	Even though these detectors have used different solar flare samples and analyses , none of them has been able to confirm the possible signal seen by Homestake .	Since the end of the eighties and in response to a reported increase in the total neutrino flux in the Homestake experiment in coincidence with solar flares , solar neutrino detectors have searched for solar flare signals .	Neutrinos from the decay of mesons , which are themselves produced in collisions of accelerated ions with the solar atmosphere would provide a novel window on the underlying physics of the hadronic acceleration and interaction processes during solar flares .	Solar flare neutrino flux measurements would indeed help to constrain current parameters such as the composition of the accelerated flux , the proton/ion spectral index and the high energy cutoff or the magnetic configuration in the interaction region .	We describe here a new way to search for these neutrinos by considering a specific solar flare sample and a data driven time window template which will improve the likelihood of neutrino detection .
0	The PHOBOS experiment at RHIC has the unique capability of measuring particle production at very low transverse momenta .	New results on low-transverse momentum invariant yields of pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions are presented as a function of the collision centrality for the 50 % most central events .	In contrast to the results from d+Au collisions , no $ m_ { T } $ scaling is observed in the very low $ p_ { T } $ region .	The low transverse momentum yields agree with extrapolations from intermediate transverse momentum measurements .	For all collision centralities a flattening of the transverse momentum spectra is observed , consistent with a rapid transverse expansion of the system .
4	The propagation properties are studied in three different regimes : a multi-mode waveguide , a single-mode waveguide , and below-cutoff waveguide .	In this paper propagation properties of a parallel-plate waveguide with tunable artificial impedance surfaces as sidewalls are studied both analytically and numerically .	The impedance surfaces comprise an array of patches over a dielectric slab with embedded metallic vias .	The tunability of surfaces is achieved with varactors .	Simple design equations for tunable artificial impedance surfaces as well as dispersion equations for the TE and TM modes are presented .
4	By measuring the quantity of evaporated molecules in thermal equilibrium through a quadrupole mass spectrometer in a temperature range between 782 K and 1128 K , a value for the sublimation enthalpy of Hsub = 237 +-7 kJ/mol is obtained from the second law method .	The heat of sublimation of the endohedral metallofullerene Er3N @ C80 was measured via Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry .	The large molecule consists of a C80 fullerene cage which is stabilized by comprising a complex of three erbium atoms bounded to a nitrogen atom and has a mass of 1475 amu .	The mass spectrum at a temperature of 1045 K and the relative intensities of the thermal fractions of Er3N @ C80 are provided .	We also discuss possible thermal decomposition processes for these particles .
2	A quantum description comes in two parts : ( 1 ) a statement of results of an experiment , expressed by probabilities of detections as functions of knob settings , and ( 2 ) an explanation of how we think these results come about , expressed by linear operators , also as functions of knob settings .	This paper contributes to a burgeoning area of investigation , the ambiguity inherent in mathematics and the implications for physics of this ambiguity .	To display the mathematical form of equations of quantum theory used to describe experiments , we make explicit the knobs by which the devices of an experiment are arranged and adjusted .	Because quantum mechanics separates the two parts of any description , it is known that between the statements of results and the explanations lurks a logical gap : given any statement of results one has a choice of explanations .	Here we work out some consequences of this openness to choice .
1	We note that the fake curvature condition which is commonly used in the literature would restrict the dynamics to be either a free theory or a topological system .	Motivated by application to multiple M5 branes , we study some properties of non-Abelian two-form gauge theories .	We then propose a modification of transformation law which simplifies the gauge transformation of 3-form field strength and enables us to write down a gauge invariant action .	We then argue that a generalization of Stueckelberg mechanism naturally gives mass to the two-form gauge field .	For the application to multiple M5-branes , it should be identified with the KK modes .
3	Our investigations show that at a fixed rotation rate the large-scale vortex is only observed for a finite range of Rayleigh numbers , as the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the flow disappears at very high Rayleigh numbers .	In this paper we present numerical simulations of rapidly-rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in the Boussinesq approximation with stress-free boundary conditions .	At moderately low Rossby number and large Rayleigh number , we show that a large-scale depth-invariant flow is formed , reminiscent of the condensate state observed in two-dimensional flows .	We show that the large-scale circulation shares many similarities with the so-called vortex , or slow-mode , of forced rotating turbulence .	We observe slow vortex merging events and find a non-local inverse cascade of energy in addition to the regular direct cascade associated with fast small-scale turbulent motions .
2	We derive the mean ( stacked ) surface number density profiles of galaxies as a function of total halo mass in different mass bins .	We present a new catalogue of 55,121 groups and clusters centred on Luminous Red Galaxies from SDSS DR7 in the redshift range 0.15 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.4 .	We provide halo mass estimates for each of these groups derived from a calibration between the optical richness of bright galaxies ( M_r & lt ; -20.5 ) within 1 Mpc , and X-ray-derived mass for a small subset of 129 groups and clusters with X-ray measurements .	We find that derived profiles can be well-described by a projected NFW profile with a concentration parameter ( & lt ; c & gt ; ~2.6 ) that is approximately a factor of two lower than that of the dark matter ( as predicted by N-body cosmological simulations ) and nearly independent of halo mass .	Interestingly , in spite of the difference in shape between the galaxy and dark matter radial distributions , both exhibit a high degree of self-similarity .
1	To achieve this , diverse supporting probabilistic models need to be networked together , the output of one model providing the input to the next .	A subjective expected utility policy making centre , managing complex , dynamic systems , needs to draw on the expertise of a variety of disparate panels of experts and integrate this information coherently .	In this paper we provide a technology for designing an integrating decision support system and to enable the centre to explore and compare the efficiency of different candidate policies .	We develop a formal statistical methodology to underpin this tool .	In particular , we derive sufficient conditions that ensure inference remains coherent before and after relevant evidence is accommodated into the system .
2	Then , we apply these results to price cross-currency swaps under different market situations , to understand how to implement a feasible curve bootstrap procedure .	We present a general derivation of the arbitrage-free pricing framework for multiple-currency collateralized products .	We include the impact on option pricing of the policy adopted to fund in foreign currency , so that we are able to price contracts with cash flows and/or collateral accounts expressed in foreign currencies inclusive of funding costs originating from dislocations in the FX market .	We present the main practical problems arising from the way the market is quoting liquid instruments : uncertainties about collateral currencies and renotioning features .	We discuss the theoretical requirements to implement curve bootstrapping and the approximations usually taken to practically implement the procedure .
3	In this case the friction domination era never ends .	We investigate the evolution of a superconducting string network with arbitrary , constant string current in the friction dominated regime .	In the absence of an external magnetic field the network always reaches a scaling solution .	However , for string current stronger than a critical value , it is different than the usual , horizon-scaling of the non-superconducting string case .	Whilst the superconducting string network can be much denser than usually assumed , it can never dominate the universe energy density .
4	We show that this proposed geometric structure is present in several constructions of MUBs .	Mutually unbiased bases ( MUBs ) have been used in several cryptographic and communications applications .	There has been much speculation regarding connections between MUBs and finite geometries .	Most of which has focused on a connection with projective and affine planes .	We propose a connection with higher dimensional projective geometries and projective Hjelmslev geometries .
1	Here we report teleporting quantum states over a 30 km optical fiber network with the input single photon state and the EPR state prepared independently .	Quantum teleportation faithfully transfers a quantum state between distant nodes in a network , enabling revolutionary information processing applications .	By buffering photons in 10 km coiled optical fiber , we perform Bell state measurement after entanglement distribution .	With active feed-forward operation , the average quantum state fidelity and quantum process fidelity are measured to be 0.85 and 0.77 , exceeding classical limits of 0.67 and 0.5 , respectively .	The statistical hypothesis test shows that the probability of a classical process to predict an average state fidelity no less than the one observed in our experiment is less than 2.4E-14 , confirming the quantum nature of our quantum teleportation experiment .
3	In this paper we extend the Kaczmarz method for solving specifications containing soft constraints , using the prioritized IIS detection algorithm .	The Kaczmarz method is an iterative method for solving large systems of equations that projects iterates orthogonally onto the solution space of each equation .	In contrast to direct methods such as Gaussian elimination or QR-factorization , this algorithm is efficient for problems with sparse matrices , as they appear in constraint-based user interface ( UI ) layout specifications .	However , the Kaczmarz method as described in the literature has its limitations : it considers only equality constraints and does not support soft constraints , which makes it inapplicable to the UI layout problem .	Furthermore , the performance and convergence of the proposed algorithms are evaluated empirically using randomly generated UI layout specifications of various sizes .
3	Specifically , global contexts in photometric and depth channels are , respectively , captured by stacking several convolutional layers and a long short-term memory layer ; the memory layer encodes both short-range and long-range spatial dependencies in an image along the vertical direction .	Semantic labeling of RGB-D scenes is crucial to many intelligent applications including perceptual robotics .	It generates pixelwise and fine-grained label maps from simultaneously sensed photometric ( RGB ) and depth channels .	This paper addresses this problem by i ) developing a novel Long Short-Term Memorized Fusion ( LSTM-F ) Model that captures and fuses contextual information from multiple channels of photometric and depth data , and ii ) incorporating this model into deep convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) for end-to-end training .	Another long short-term memorized fusion layer is set up to integrate the contexts along the vertical direction from different channels , and perform bi-directional propagation of the fused vertical contexts along the horizontal direction to obtain true 2D global contexts .
3	The found approximation is for primary proton nuclei , inclined up to 70 degrees zenith angle .	In this work is obtained new approximation for the yield function Y for cosmic ray induced ionization in the Earth atmosphere on the basis of simulated data .	The parameterization is obtained using inverse nonlinear problem solution with afxy ( analyze fx=y ) -code .	Short description of the methods is given .	This permits to estimate the direct ionization by primary cosmic rays explicitly .
2	Although such methods are gaining in popularity , they are being adopted with caution in some quarters , in part because of an increasing number of examples of strong phylogenetic conflict between concatenation or supermatrix methods and species tree methods .	As researchers collect increasingly large molecular data sets to reconstruct the Tree of Life , the heterogeneity of signals in the genomes of diverse organisms poses challenges for traditional phylogenetic analysis .	A class of phylogenetic methods known as `` species tree methods '' have been proposed to directly address one important source of gene tree heterogeneity , namely the incomplete lineage sorting or deep coalescence that occurs when evolving lineages radiate rapidly , resulting in a diversity of gene trees from a single underlying species tree .	Here we review theory and empirical examples that help clarify these conflicts .	Thinking of concatenation as a special case of the more general model provided by the multispecies coalescent can help explain a number of differences in the behavior of the two methods on phylogenomic data sets .
1	The theoretical angular correlation function is derived for different bias functions , corresponding to different values of the ratio $ M_ { halo } /M_ { sph } $ between the mass of the dark halos hosting such galaxies and the mass in stars produced at the end of the major star-formation burst .	The clustering properties of SCUBA-selected galaxies are investigated within the framework of a unifying scheme relating the formation of QSOs and spheroids .	SCUBA sources are predicted to be strongly clustered , with a clustering strength increasing with mass .	Comparisons with the best available measurements show better fits for $ M_ { halo } /M_ { sph } \simeq 100 $ .	The model can also account for the clustering of Lyman-break galaxies , seen as the optical counterpart of low- to intermediate-mass primeval spheroidal galaxies .
1	As part of this research program , we have tested two 805 MHz vacuum RF cavities in a multi-Tesla magnetic field to study the effects of the static magnetic field on the cavity operation .	The MuCool Test Area ( MTA ) at Fermilab is a facility to develop the technology required for ionization cooling for a future Muon Collider and/or Neutrino Factory .	This study gives useful information on field emitters in the cavity , dark current , surface conditioning , breakdown mechanisms and material properties of the cavity .	All these factors determine the maximum accelerating gradient in the cavity .	This paper discusses the image processing technique for quantitative estimation of spark damage spot distribution on cavity interior surfaces .
3	We provide an analytical description for the nonlinear dependence of the velocity of the signal on the controlling field .	In the framework of the nonlinear $ \Lambda $ -model we investigate propagation of a slow-light soliton in atomic vapors and Bose-Einstein condensates .	The velocity of the slow-light soliton is controlled by a time-dependent background field created by a controlling laser .	For a fairly arbitrary time dependence of the field we find the dynamics of the slow-light soliton inside the medium .	If the background field is turned off at some moment of time , the signal stops .
4	We show that the average delay to resolve contention is related to the entropy of the random threshold .	We consider a slotted wireless network in an infrastructure setup with a base station ( or an access point ) and N users .	The wireless channel gain between the base station and the users is assumed to be i.i.d. , and the base station seeks to schedule the user with the highest channel gain in every slot ( opportunistic scheduling ) .	We assume that the identity of the user with the highest channel gain is resolved using a series of contention slots and with feedback from the base station .	In this setup , we formulate the contention resolution problem for opportunistic scheduling as identifying a random threshold ( channel gain ) that separates the best channel from the other samples .
1	A WIYN Gunn i-band image of the quasar field and spectroscopy of two galaxy candidates are also presented .	A high-resolution HST/STIS spectrum ( R=30,000 ) is presented of the three MgII-selected absorption systems ( A , B , and C , clustered within 1500km/s ) at z~0.93 toward the quasar PG 1206+459 .	A multi-phase medium is seen in all three systems , consistent with smaller , denser clouds producing low-ionization transitions ( MgII , FeII , and SiII ) and larger , diffuse clouds giving rise to high-ionization transitions ( CIV , NV , and/or OVI ) .	( 1 ) System A , a multi-cloud , weak MgII absorber at z=0.9254 , requires a super-solar metallicity in both low- and high-ionization phases , unless an alpha-group enhancement is included .	With the unusually complex velocity structure resolved in the NV profiles , this system is unlikely to represent a traditional galaxy disk/corona .
1	It is not easy to predict a list of the first priority problems which may appear , but the facilities potential is more predictable .	Some attempts to predict the very distant future of Radio Astronomy are given .	It is suggested , that in addition to the `` dedicated for Radio Astronomy '' , facilities may be extended greatly by integration with the next generation living standards facilities , connected with People-to-People communications through the global networks and by incorporating of the `` Natural facilities '' , such as grav .	lensing , maser amplification in the ISM etc .	As an examples of the extreme cases of the $ 10^9 m^2 $ class of the new generation Radio Telescopes , utilization of the personal dipole size communication facilities by SKA type instrument , and array from the asteroids first `` Frehnel zones '' will be mentioned .
2	We consider Dirac-like linearization of this form , with position and momentum satisfying standard commutation relations .	According to the Hamiltonian formalism , nonrelativistic phase space may be considered as an arena of physics , with momentum and position treated as independent variables .	Invariance of x^2+p^2 constitutes then a natural generalization of ordinary rotational invariance .	This leads to the identification of a quantum-level structure from which some phase space properties might emerge .	Genuine rotations and reflections in phase space are tied to the existence of new quantum numbers , unrelated to ordinary 3D space .
0	The relaxation dynamics of the contact angle between a viscous liquid and a smooth substrate is studied at the nanoscale .	Through atomic force microscopy measurements of polystyrene nanostripes we monitor simultaneously the temporal evolution of the liquid-air interface as well as the position of the contact line .	The initial configuration exhibits high curvature gradients and a non-equilibrium contact angle that drive liquid flow .	Both these conditions are relaxed to achieve the final state , leading to three successive regimes along time : i ) stationary-contact-line levelling ; ii ) receding-contact-line dewetting ; iii ) collapse of the two fronts .	For the first regime , we reveal the existence of a self-similar evolution of the liquid interface , which is in excellent agreement with numerical calculations from a lubrication model .
4	No evidence for dynamical phase transitions is found .	The additivity principle allows a calculation of current fluctuations and associated density profiles in large diffusive systems .	In order to test its validity in the weakly asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries , we use a numerical approach based on the density matrix renormalisation .	With this technique , we determine the cumulant generating function of the current and the density profile corresponding to atypical currents in finite systems .	We find that these converge to those predicted by the additivity principle .
4	Algebra of functions on the quantum group $ SU_ { q } ( 2 ) $ in the representation $ \Pi $ is a factor of a type II $ _ { \infty } $ .	An operation of a coproduct of representations of a bialgebra is defined .	The coproduct operation for representations of the Hopf algebra of functions on the quantum group $ SU_ { q } ( 2 ) $ is investigated .	A notion of a stable representation $ \Pi $ is introdused .	This means that the representation $ \Pi $ is invariant under coproduct by arbitrary representation .
2	In the chiral theory , we explore perturbative unitarity violation as a function of the number of colors and the number of flavors , holding the scale of the `` new physics '' ( i.e.QCD ) fixed .	In effective field theories it is common to identify the onset of new physics with the violation of tree-level unitarity .	However , we show that this is parametrically incorrect in the case of chiral perturbation theory , and is probably theoretically incorrect in general .	This demonstrates that the onset of new physics is parametrically uncorrelated with tree-unitarity violation .	When the latter scale is lower than that of new physics , the effective theory must heal its unitarity violation itself , which is expected because the field theory satisfies the requirements of unitarity .
1	DS theory has been widely used in computer science and engineering applications , but has yet to reach the statistical mainstream , perhaps because the DS belief functions do not satisfy long-run frequency properties .	The Dempster -- Shafer ( DS ) theory is a powerful tool for probabilistic reasoning based on a formal calculus for combining evidence .	Recently , two of the authors proposed an extension of DS , called the weak belief ( WB ) approach , that can incorporate desirable frequency properties into the DS framework by systematically enlarging the focal elements .	The present paper reviews and extends this WB approach .	We present a general description of WB in the context of inferential models , its interplay with the DS calculus , and the maximal belief solution .
4	The COS-Halos survey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalactic medium ( to impact parameters of $ & lt ; 150 $ kpc ) of low-redshift $ \sim L^* $ galaxies .	We present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forming galaxies at $ z\sim 0 $ .	We combine empirically derived star formation histories with updated supernova and AGB yields and rates to estimate the total mass of metals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of $ 10^ { 9.3 } $ -- $ 10^ { 11.6 } M_ { \odot } $ .	On the accounting side of the ledger , we show that a surprisingly constant 20 -- 25 % mass fraction of produced metals remain in galaxies ' stars , interstellar gas and interstellar dust , with little dependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass ( omitting those metals immediately locked up in remnants ) .	Thus , the bulk of metals are outside of galaxies , produced in the progenitors of today 's $ L^* $ galaxies .
4	Based on current ideas of stellar nucleosynthesis , these results can be understood if most of the metal enrichment in cB58 has taken place within the last 300 million years , the timescale for the release of N from intermediate mass stars .	We present the results of a detailed study of the interstellar medium of MS 1512-cB58 , an L* Lyman break galaxy at z = 2.7276 , based on new spectral observations obtained with the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager on the Keck II telescope at 58 km/s resolution .	We focus in particular on the chemical abundances and kinematics of the interstellar gas and our main findings are as follows .	Even at this relatively early epoch , the ISM of this galaxy is already highly enriched in elements released by Type II supernovae ; the abundances of O , Mg , Si , P , and S are all about 2/5 of their solar values .	In contrast , N and the Fe-peak elements Mn , Fe , and Ni are underabundant by a factor of about 3 .
1	These phases of the { \it nuclear pasta } are expected to exist in the crust of neutron stars and in core-collapse supernovae .	Neutron-rich matter at subnuclear densities may involve complex structures displaying a variety of shapes , such as spherical , slablike , and/or rodlike shapes .	The dynamics of core-collapse supernovae is very sensitive to the interactions between neutrinos and nucleons/nuclei .	Indeed , neutrino excitation of the low-energy modes of the pasta may allow for a significant energy transfer to the nuclear medium , thereby reviving the stalled supernovae shock .	The linear response of the nuclear pasta to neutrinos is modeled via a simple semi-classical simulation .
3	We also study the `` Stein factorisation '' of $ \psi_ { G , X } $ .	In this paper we deal with a Hamiltonian action of a reductive algebraic group $ G $ on an irreducible normal affine Poisson variety $ X $ .	We study the invariant moment map $ \psi_ { G , X } : X\to \g $ , that is , the composition of the moment map $ \mu_ { G , X } : X\to g : =Lie ( G ) $ and the quotient morphism $ g\to g\quo G $ .	We obtain some results on the dimensions of fibers of $ \psi_ { G , X } $ and the corresponding morphism of quotients $ X\quo G\to g\quo G $ .	Namely , let $ C_ { G , X } $ denote the spectrum of the integral closure of $ \psi_ { G , X } ^* ( K [ g ] ^G ) $ in $ K ( X ) ^G $ .
1	The UEs move around in the cell according to a random walk mobility model .	In this work , we consider the downlink of a single-cell multi-user MIMO system in which the base station ( BS ) makes use of $ N $ antennas to communicate with $ K $ single-antenna user equipments ( UEs ) .	We aim at determining the energy consumption distribution when different linear precoding techniques are used at the BS to guarantee target rates within a finite time interval $ T $ .	The analysis is conducted in the asymptotic regime where $ N $ and $ K $ grow large with fixed ratio under the assumption of perfect channel state information ( CSI ) .	Both recent and standard results from large system analysis are used to provide concise formulae for the asymptotic transmit powers and beamforming vectors for all considered schemes .
0	Multilevel quadrature methods for parametric operator equations such as the multilevel ( quasi- ) Monte Carlo method are closely related to the sparse tensor product approximation between the spatial variable and the stochastic variable .	In this article , we employ this fact and reverse the multilevel quadrature method via the sparse grid construction by applying differences of quadrature rules to finite element discretizations of different resolution .	Besides being more efficient if the underlying quadrature rules are nested , this way of performing the sparse tensor product approximation enables the use of non-nested and even adaptively refined finite element meshes .	Especially , the multilevel quadrature is non-intrusive and allows the use of standard finite element solvers .	Numerical results are provided to illustrate the approach .
4	A new estimate of the Sun 's distance to the Galactic center is provided , $ \rm R_O=7.2\pm0.3 kpc $ .	Updated data of the 153 Galactic globular clusters are used to readdress fundamental parameters of the Milky Way .	We build a reduced sample , decontaminated of the clusters younger than 10Gyr , those with retrograde orbits and/or evidence of relation to dwarf galaxies .	The 33 metal-rich globular clusters of the reduced sample extend basically to the Solar circle and distribute over a region with projected axial-ratios typical of an oblate spheroidal , $ \rm\Delta x : \Delta y : \Delta z\approx1.0:0.9:0.4 $ .	The 81 metal-poor globular clusters span a nearly spherical region of axial-ratios $ \approx1.0:1.0:0.8 $ extending from the central parts to the outer halo .
2	In this investigation , the theory of the Gauss hypergeomtric functions plays an important role .	We consider an appoximation of a catenoid constructed from `` odd '' truncated cones that maintains minimality in a certain sense .	Thorough this procedure , we obtain a discrete curve approximating a catenary by exploiting the fact that it is the function that generates a catenoid .	This work is a sequel to [ Y.Machigashira , Piecewise truncated conical minimal surfaces and the Gauss hypergeometric functions , Journal of Math-for-Industry 4 ( 2012 ) , pp.25-33 ] .	The paper covers an appoximation of a catenoid constructed from `` even '' truncated cones that maintains minimality in the same sense .
0	Motivated by the renewed interest in studying the pion production on nuclei with protons at few GeV incident energies , we investigate the pion production in proton-proton collisions over an energy range of 300 $ MeV $ to 2 $ GeV $ .	Starting from a realistic one-boson exchange model with parameters fitted to the amplitudes of the elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering , we perform fully covariant calculations for the total , double and triple differential cross-sections of the $ p ( p , n\pi^+ ) p $ and $ p ( p , p\pi^0 ) p $ reactions .	The calculations incorporate the exchange of $ \pi , \rho , \omega $ and $ \sigma $ mesons and treat nucleon and delta isobar as intermediate states .	We obtain a reasonably good agreement with the experimental data in the entire range of beam energies .	The form of the covariant delta propagator , the cut-off parameter for the $ \pi NN $ and $ \pi N\Delta $ vertex form factors and the energy dependence of the delta isobar decay width is investigated .
2	The oscillation periods range between 45 and 1180 days .	Excitation of radial oscillations in population I ( X=0.7 , Z=0.02 ) red supergiants is investigated using the solution of the equations of radiation hydrodynamics and turbulent convection .	The core helium burning stars with masses 8M_odot & lt ; = M & lt ; = 20M_odot end effective temperatures T_eff & lt ; 4000K are shown to be unstable against radial pulsations in the fundamental mode .	The pulsational instability is due to the kappa-mechanism in the hydrogen and helium ionization zones .	Radial pulsations of stars with mass M & lt ; 15M_odot are strictly periodic with the light amplitude Delta M_bol & lt ; = 0.5 mag .
4	We prove that this `` natural '' dynamic under quite general conditions converges to the Nash-Wardrop 's equilibrium .	In this work we widespread statistical physics ( chemical kinetic stochastic ) approach to the investigation of macrosystems , arise in economic , sociology and traffic flow theory .	The main line is a definition of equilibrium of macrosystem as most probable macrostate of invariant measure of Markov dynamic ( corresponds to the macrosystem ) .	We demonstrate new dynamical interpretations for the well known static model of correspondence matrix calculation .	Based on this model we propose a best response dynamics for the Beckmann 's traffic flow distribution model .
2	We observe the near UV region where the Beii resonance doublet and the NH bands are located .	The Li-rich turn-off star in the globular cluster NGC 6397 could represent the smoking gun for some very rare episode of Li enrichment in globular clusters .	We aim to understand the nature of the Li enrichment by performing a spectroscopic analysis of the star , in particular of its beryllium ( Be ) abundance , and by investigating its binary nature .	We could not detect the Beii lines and derive an upper limit of log ( Be/H ) & lt ; -12.2 , that is consistent with the Be observed in other stars of the cluster .	We could detect a weak G-band , which implies a mild carbon enhancement [ C/Fe ] $ +0.4\pm0.2 $ .
4	Saito 's formalism gives a functor i^* j_* from the bounded derived category of Hodge modules on M to that of Hodge modules on M ' .	We prove an analogue for Hodge modules of Pink 's theorem on the degeneration of l-adic sheaves ( Math.Ann.292 ) .	Let j be the open immersion of a Shimura variety M into its Baily-Borel compactification .	Its boundary has a natural stratification into locally closed subsets , each of which is itself a Shimura variety ( up to taking the quotient by the action of a finite group ) .	Let i be the inclusion of an individual such stratum M ' .
0	We present a new multi-fluid , grid MHD code PIERNIK , which is based on the Relaxing TVD scheme .	The original scheme has been extended by an addition of dynamically independent , but interacting fluids : dust and a diffusive cosmic ray gas , described within the fluid approximation , with an option to add other fluids in an easy way .	The code has been equipped with shearing-box boundary conditions , and a selfgravity module , Ohmic resistivity module , as well as other facilities which are useful in astrophysical fluid-dynamical simulations .	The code is parallelized by means of the MPI library .	In this paper we shortly introduce basic elements of the Relaxing TVD MHD algorithm , following Trac & amp ; Pen ( 2003 ) and Pen et al .
0	We study the dynamical regime of wave turbulence of a vibrated thin elastic plate based on experimental and numerical observations .	We focus our study to the strongly non linear regime described in a previous letter by N. Yokoyama & amp ; M. Takaoka .	At small forcing , a weakly non linear regime is compatible with the Weak Turbulence Theory when the dissipation is localized at high wavenumber .	When the forcing intensity is increased , a strongly non linear regime emerges : singular structures dominate the dynamics at large scale whereas at small scales the weak turbulence is still present .	A turbulence of singular structures , with folds and D-cones , develops that alters significantly the energy spectra and causes the emergence of intermittency .
3	A better approach would be to hide the very existence of the message using steganography .	Currently , cryptography is in wide use as it is being exploited in various domains from data confidentiality to data integrity and message authentication .	Basically , cryptography shuffles data so that they become unreadable by unauthorized parties .	However , clearly visible encrypted messages , no matter how unbreakable , will arouse suspicions .	Fundamentally , steganography conceals secret data into innocent-looking mediums called carriers which can then travel from the sender to the receiver safe and unnoticed .
4	The role of isoscalar two-body operators , not constrained by the continuity equation , is also investigated .	We present results for the nucleon magnetic moments in the context of an extended chiral constituent quark model based on the mechanism of the Goldstone boson exchange , as suggested by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD .	The electromagnetic charge-current operator is consistently deduced from the model Hamiltonian , which includes all force components for the pseudoscalar , vector and scalar meson exchanges .	Thus , the continuity equation is satisfied for each piece of the interaction , avoiding the introduction of any further parameter .	A good agreement with experimental values is found .
3	For \tau & lt ; 0 ( delayed heating ) the number and sign of real solutions for the growth rate depend on the values of the time lag and the ratio of heating response to pressure perturbations , \xi .	We derive and investigate the dispersion relation for accretion disks with retarded or advanced heating .	We follow the alpha-prescription but allow for a time offset ( \tau ) between heating and pressure perturbations , as well as for a diminished response of heating to pressure variations .	We study in detail solutions of the dispersion relation for disks with radiation-pressure fraction 1 - \beta .	If the delay is larger than a critical value ( e.g. , if \Omega \tau & lt ; -125 for \alpha =0.1 , \beta =0 and \xi =1 ) two real solutions exist , which are both negative .
4	The results show an overall agreement between the optical excitations based on MM/MD conformations and DFT conformations .	A combination of classical molecular dynamics ( MM/MD ) and quantum chemical calculations based on the density functional theory ( DFT ) was performed to describe conformational properties of diphenylethyne ( DPE ) , methylated-DPE and poly para phenylene ethynylene ( PPE ) .	DFT calculations were employed to improve and develop force field parameters for MM/MD simulations .	Many-body Green 's functions theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation were utilized to describe excited states of the systems .	Reliability of the excitation energies based on the MM/MD conformations was examined and compared to the excitation energies from DFT conformations .
2	Another mechanism of an enhancement of $ I_ { c1 } $ can come from decreasing the decay length of the charge imbalance $ \lambda_Q $ at weak magnetic fields because $ I_ { c1 } $ is inversely proportional to $ \lambda_Q $ .	We argue that the negative magnetoresistance of superconducting nanowires , which was observed in recent experiments , can be explained by the influence of the external magnetic field on the critical current of the phase slip process .	We show that the suppression of the order parameter in the bulk superconductors made by an external magnetic field can lead to an enhancement of both the first $ I_ { c1 } $ and the second $ I_ { c2 } $ critical currents of the phase slip process in nanowires .	The enhancement of the first critical current leads to a larger intrinsic dissipation of the phase slip process .	It suppresses the rate of both the thermo-activated and/or quantum fluctuated phase slips and results in decreasing the fluctuated resistance .
1	The transfer of this energy to Standard Model ( SM ) open string modes depends on where the SM branes and the brane annihilation are located : in the bulk , in the same throat or in different throats .	Towards the end of brane inflation , the brane pair annihilation produces massive closed strings .	We find that , in all cases as long as the brane annihilation and the SM branes are not both in the bulk , the transfer of energy to start the hot big bang epoch can be efficient enough to be compatible with big bang nucleosynthesis .	The suppression of the abundance of the graviton and its Kaluza-Klein ( KK ) thermal relics follows from the warped geometry in flux compactification .	This works out even in the scenarios where a long period of tunneling is expected .
1	Our choice of parameters of lattice Lagrangian corresponds to large values of the Higgs boson mass $ M_H & gt ; 2 M_W $ .	We investigated numerically properties of Nambu monopoles in lattice Electroweak theory at realistic values of $ \alpha $ and $ \theta_W $ .	We find that the density of Nambu monopoles can not be predicted by the choice of the initial parameters of Electroweak theory and should be considered as the new external parameter of the theory .	We also investigate the difference between the versions of Electroweak theory with the gauge groups $ SU ( 2 ) \otimes U ( 1 ) $ and $ SU ( 2 ) \otimes U ( 1 ) /Z_2 $ .	We do not detect any difference at $ \alpha \sim { 1/128 } $ .
0	We study the dynamics of a system of hard-core particles sliding downwards on a one dimensional fluctuating interface , which in a special case can be mapped to the problem of a passive scalar advected by a Burgers fluid .	Driven by the surface fluctuations , the particles show a tendency to cluster , but the hard-core interaction prevents collapse .	We use numerical simulations to measure the auto-correlation function in steady state and in the aging regime , and space-time correlation functions in steady state .	We have also calculated these quantities analytically in a related surface model .	The steady state auto-correlation is a scaling function of t/L^z , where L is the system size and z the dynamic exponent .
1	Using niobium thin films on silicon and sapphire substrates , we fabricated superconducting 180 { \deg } microstrip hybrid ring couplers , acting as beam splitters with center frequencies of about 6GHz .	Superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments with propagating microwaves require devices acting as beam splitters .	For the magnitude of the coupling and isolation we find -3.5+/-0.5dB and at least -15dB , respectively , in a bandwidth of 2GHz .	We also investigate the effect of reflections at the superconductor-normal conductor contact by means of low temperature laser scanning microscopy .	Our measurements show that our hybrid rings are well suited for on-chip applications in circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments .
3	The study is performed in the context of a general non-canonical scalar-tensor theory .	We provide a detailed quantitative description of singular inflation .	Its close analogy with finite-time future singularity which is associated to dark energy era is described .	Calling and classifying the singularities of such inflation as finite-time cosmological singularities we investigate their occurrence , with special emphasis on the Type IV singularity .	In addition , the impact of finite time singularities on the slow-roll parameters is also investigated .
2	One of ceramic samples ( I ) , in addition to the main phase ap x 2ap x 2ap , Pmmm , ( Z=2 ) , contained about 25 % of the phase ap x ap x 2ap , Pmmm , ( Z=1 ) , with statistical distribution of oxygen over the apical sites , where ap is parameter of perovskite cell .	Spin ordering in TbBaCo2O5.5 and its temperature transformation is studied .	Polymorphism due to the oxygen ordering with the average content close to 5.5 is investigated .	The other sample ( II ) contained only a main phase with well defined octahedral and pyramidal sublattices .	Treatment of neutron diffraction patterns of the sample I itself gives a sophisticated spin structure .
1	The frequency behavior of the system response is studied and compared with predictions from a variable range mean-field theory , which excludes turbulent fluctuations .	Numerical simulations of fully developed turbulence driven by a modulated energy input rate or driving force are performed within two dynamical cascade models , the GOY shell model and a reduced wave vector set approximation of the Navier-Stokes equation ( REWA ) .	In agreement with the mean-field approach we find a constant response amplitude for low driving frequencies and a 1/w-decay of the amplitude for high frequencies .	In the mean-field theory , the finite cascade time scale had lead to an oscillating behavior of the response amplitude as a function of the driving frequency .	In the simulations of both models we observe the main maximum .
4	The shape equations describing the equilibrium states of a surface curve described by an elastic energy accommodating environmental factors will be identified by adapting the method of Lagrange multipliers to the Darboux frame associated with the curve .	The behavior of an elastic curve bound to a surface will reflect the geometry of its environment .	This may occur in an obvious way : the curve may deform freely along directions tangent to the surface , but not along the surface normal .	However , even if the energy itself is symmetric in the curve 's geodesic and normal curvatures , which control these modes , very distinct roles are played by the two .	If the elastic curve binds preferentially on one side , or is itself assembled on the surface , not only would one expect the bending moduli associated with the two modes to differ , binding along specific directions , reflected in spontaneous values of these curvatures , may be favored .
3	We place sources in this effective gauge theory .	We consider giant gravitons on the maximally supersymmetric plane-wave background of type IIB string theory .	Fixing the light-cone gauge , we work out the low energy effective light-cone Hamiltonian of the three-sphere giant graviton .	At first order , this is a U ( 1 ) gauge theory on R x S^3 .	Although non-vanishing net electric charge configurations are disallowed by Gauss ' law , electric dipoles can be formed .
1	The two impurities are coupled by an inter-impurity exchange interaction $ J $ and direct interaction $ U_ { 12 } $ and are hybridized with separate conduction channels.The low energy behavior is described in terms of renormalized parameters , which can be deduced from numerical renormalization group ( NRG ) calculations .	We find the emergence of strong correlations and universality on the approach to the quantum critical points of a two impurity Anderson model .	We show that on the approach to the transitions to a local singlet and a local charged ordered state , the quasiparticle weight factor $ z\to 0 $ , and the renormalized parameters can be expressed in terms of a single energy scale $ T^* $ .	The values of the renormalized interaction parameters in terms of $ T^* $ can be predicted from the condition of continuity of the spin and charge susceptibilities , and correspond to strong correlation as they are greater than or equal to the effective band width .	These predictions are confirmed by the NRG calculations , including the case when the onsite interaction U=0 .
4	A possible transmission conduction electron spin resonance ( CESR ) experiment is suggested on the F/N junction to see if the predicted spin wave modes could indeed propagate through the junction .	We study the spin transport in the low temperature regime ( often referred to as the precession-dominated regime ) between a ferromagnetic Fermi liquid ( FFL ) and a normal metal metallic Fermi liquid ( NFL ) , also known as the F/N junction , which is considered as one of the most basic spintronic devices .	In particular , we explore the propagation of spin waves and transport of magnetization through the interface of the F/N junction where nonequilibrium spin polarization is created on the normal metal side of the junction by electrical spin injection .	We calculate the probable spin wave modes in the precession-dominated regime on both sides of the junction especially on the NFL side where the system is out of equilibrium .	Proper boundary conditions at the interface are introduced to establish the transport of the spin properties through the F/N junction .
3	The analysis of this fact warns us about the difficulties in the interpretation of numerical results obtained in cases where theoretical results are absent and a high statistics simulation is unreachable .	We study an ensemble of closed random paths , embedded in R^3 , with a curvature dependent action .	Previous analytical results indicate that there is no crumpling transition for any finite value of the curvature coupling .	Nevertheless , in a high statistics numerical simulation , we observe two different regimes for the specific heat separated by a rather smooth structure .	This may be the case of random surfaces .
0	In this paper , the self-propelled motion of Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces is numerically investigated with a thermal multiphase lattice Boltzmann model with liquid-vapor phase change .	The capability of the model for simulating evaporation is validated via the D2 law .	Using the model , we first study the performances of Leidenfrost droplets on horizontal ratchet surfaces .	It is numerically shown that the motion of self-propelled Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces is owing to the asymmetry of the ratchets and the vapor flows beneath the droplets .	It is found that the Leidenfrost droplets move in the direction toward the slowly inclined side from the ratchet peaks , which agrees with the direction of droplet motion in experiments [ Linke et al. , Phys.Rev .
4	Gluon production from a space-time dependent chromofield will play an important role in the production and evolution of the quark-gluon plasma in ultra relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC .	We describe gluon-pair production from a space-time dependent chromofield via vacuum polarization within the framework of the background field method of QCD .	The processes we consider are first order in the action .	We derive the corresponding source terms for gluon pair production for situations that can be described by a 1+1 dimensional approach .	Especially , we observe that within the range of applicability of our approach the principal contribution to gluon production is included .
3	The cosmic ray connection sets the scale of cosmic neutrino fluxes .	Kilometer-scale neutrino detectors such as IceCube are discovery instruments covering nuclear and particle physics , cosmology and astronomy .	Examples of their multidisciplinary missions include the search for the particle nature of dark matter and for additional small dimensions of space .	In the end , their conceptual design is very much anchored to the observational fact that Nature accelerates protons and photons to energies in excess of 10^ { 20 } and 10^ { 13 } eV , respectively .	In this context , we discuss the first results of the completed AMANDA detector and the reach of its extension , IceCube .
3	Compared to ordinary permutation source coding , FPQ produces a greater number of possible quantization rates and a higher maximum rate .	Frame permutation quantization ( FPQ ) is a new vector quantization technique using finite frames .	In FPQ , a vector is encoded using a permutation source code to quantize its frame expansion .	This means that the encoding is a partial ordering of the frame expansion coefficients .	Various representations for the partitions induced by FPQ are presented , and reconstruction algorithms based on linear programming , quadratic programming , and recursive orthogonal projection are derived .
4	In 3D we show how the initial data for the perturbation equations can be computed , and we compare with analytic solutions given from a perturbative expansion of the initial value problem .	We consider a series of distorted black hole initial data sets , and develop techniques to evolve them using the linearized equations of motion for the gravitational wave perturbations on a Schwarzschild background .	We apply this to 2D and 3D distorted black hole spacetimes .	In 2D , waveforms for different modes of the radiation are presented , comparing full nonlinear evolutions for different axisymmetric l-modes with perturbative evolutions .	We show how axisymmetric black hole codes solving the full , nonlinear Einstein equations are capable of very accurate evolutions , and also how these techniques aid in studying nonlinear effects .
0	Recent numerical analysis of Keplerian disk formation in turbulent , magnetized cloud cores by Santos-Lima , de Gouveia Dal Pino , & amp ; Lazarian ( 2012 ) demonstrated that reconnection diffusion is an efficient process to remove the magnetic flux excess during the build up of a rotationally supported disk .	This process is induced by fast reconnection of the magnetic fields in a turbulent flow .	In a similar numerical study , Seifried et al .	( 2012 ) concluded that reconnection diffusion or any other non-ideal MHD effects would not be necessary and turbulence shear alone would provide a natural way to build up a rotating disk without requiring magnetic flux loss .	Their conclusion was based on the fact that the mean mass-to-flux ratio ( { \mu } ) evaluated over a spherical region with a radius much larger than the disk is nearly constant in their models .
4	We also argue that dust-gas separation in the nebula is not plausible .	In this paper we study new infrared spectra of the evolved planetary nebula NGC 6445 obtained with ISO .	These data show that the thermal emission from the grains is very cool and has a low flux compared to H beta .	A model of the ionized region is constructed , using the photo-ionization code CLOUDY 90.05 .	Based on this model , we show from depletions in the gas phase elements that little grain destruction can have occurred in the ionized region of NGC 6445 .
1	Current GORE methodologies can be used to relate business goals to software goals through goal abstraction in goal graphs .	This paper builds on existing Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering ( GORE ) research by presenting a methodology with a supporting tool for analysing and demonstrating the alignment between software requirements and business objectives .	However , we argue that unless the extent of goal-goal contribution is quantified with verifiable metrics and confidence levels , goal graphs are not sufficient for demonstrating the strategic alignment of software requirements .	We introduce our methodology using an example software project from Rolls-Royce .	We conclude that our methodology can improve requirements by making the relationships to business problems explicit , thereby disambiguating a requirement 's underlying purpose and value .
0	Aims : Time series of high-resolution spectra of the late B-type star HD 11753 exhibiting HgMn chemical peculiarity are used to study the surface distribution of different chemical elements and their temporal evolution .	Methods : High-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra were obtained using the CORALIE spectrograph at La Silla in 2000 , 2009 , and 2010 .	Surface maps of YII , SrII , TiII , and CrII were calculated using the Doppler imaging technique .	The results were also compared to equivalent width measurements .	The evolution of chemical spots both on short and long time scales were investigated .
4	Typical dark matter-nucleon cross sections are 10^ { -45 } -10^ { -44 } cm^ { 2 } .	We explore dark matter in the Finely Tuned Minimal Supersymmetric Standard model recently proposed by Arkani-Hamed and Dimopoulos .	Relative to the MSSM , there are fewer particles at freeze-out , so the calculation of the relic abundance simplifies .	Similarly , the predictions for direct detection of the dark matter sharpen .	There is a large region of mixed bino -- higgsino dark matter where the lightest supersymmetric particle will be accessible at both the LHC and future direct detection experiments , allowing for a conclusive identification of the dark matter particle .
4	The ability to transparently access data in this way , as shown in prototype , is likely to be a very powerful facility for HENP and other grid users wishing to collate and analyze information distributed over Grid .	This paper examines how a `` Distributed Heterogeneous Relational Data Warehouse '' can be integrated in a Grid environment that will provide physicists with efficient access to large and small object collections drawn from databases at multiple sites .	This paper investigates the requirements of Grid-enabling such a warehouse , and explores how these requirements may be met by extensions to existing Grid middleware .	We present initial results obtained with a working prototype warehouse of this kind using both SQLServer and Oracle9i , where a Grid-enabled web-services interface makes it easier for web-applications to access the distributed contents of the databases securely .	Based on the success of the prototype , we proposes a framework for using heterogeneous relational data warehouse through the web-service interface and create a single `` Virtual Database System '' for users .
4	For a qubit , a commutativity-preserving channel is either a completely decohering channel or a mixing channel .	Quantum correlation can be created by a local operation from some initially classical states .	We prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for a local trace-preserving channel to create quantum correlation is that it is not a commutativity-preserving channel .	This condition is valid for arbitrary finite dimension systems .	We also derive the explicit form of commutativity-preserving channels .
4	The corrections are significant and result in a much better agreement with experiment .	The applicability of the quasi-static approximation for calculating the two-photon annihilation rate of the scalar f_0 ( 980 ) meson envisaged as a K\bar K molecule is critically re-examined .	It is shown that the validity of this approximation depends on the detailed interplay between the momentum dependence of the annihilation amplitude and the momentum transform of the bound state wave function of the annihilating pair .	The approximation becomes invalid when these two scales of variation are similar .	An improved method of calculation based on the inclusion of electromagnetic corrections to the kernel of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the interacting K\bar K pair is outlined to cover this case and applied to re-evaluate the two-photon decay width for f_0 ( 980 ) in a one boson exchange model for the interkaon interaction .
1	Instead of cooling , blocking and subsequent inverse blocking is applied to Monte Carlo configurations to capture topological features at a well-defined scale .	In an attempt to describe the change of topological structure of pure SU ( 2 ) gauge theory near deconfinement a renormalization group inspired method is tested .	We check that this procedure largely conserves long range physics like string tension .	UV fluctuations and lattice artefacts are removed which otherwise spoil topological charge density and Abelian monopole currents .	We report the behaviour of topological susceptibility and monopole current densities across the deconfinement transition and relate the two faces of topology to each other .
0	A detailed model of galactic evolution is proposed to explain both the iron content of the Intra-Cluster Medium ( ICM ) and of the ellipticals pertaining to the cluster .	SNII are responsible for the production of Fe in the galaxies and of its partial ejection in the surrounding medium .	A high formation rate of massive stars only ( $ m & gt ; 3~ { \rm M_ { \sun } } $ ) at the very early stage of evolution of ellipticals , reminiscent of starburst galaxies , is advocated .	The high rate of SNII explosions induces a powerful galactic wind , followed by a more quiescent evolution where stars are formed , with a normal Initial Mass Function ( IMF ) , from the enriched gas remaining after the wind phase and from the gas restored by the longest living stars produced during the early phase .	Most of the iron is produced by the high-mass stars created in the early burst phase .
3	Using a superconducting flux qubit , we implement scattering events as multiple Landau-Zener transitions by driving the qubit periodically back and forth through an avoided crossing .	In the presence of time-reversal symmetry , quantum interference gives strong corrections to the electric conductivity of disordered systems .	The self-interference of an electron wavefunction traveling time-reversed paths leads to effects such as weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations .	Here , we investigate the effects of broken time-reversal symmetry in a driven artificial two-level system .	Interference between different qubit trajectories give rise to a speckle pattern in the qubit transition rate , similar to the interference patterns created when coherent light is scattered off a disordered potential .
4	It is found that observations at sub-millimeter frequencies during the first day provide the best way of discriminating between the two models .	Assuming an adiabatic evolution of a Gamma-Ray Burst ( GRB ) remnant interacting with an external medium , we calculate the injection , cooling , and absorption break frequencies , and the afterglow flux for plausible orderings of the break and observing frequencies .	The analytical calculations are restricted to a relativistic remnant and , in the case of collimated ejecta , to the phase where there is an insignificant lateral expansion .	Results are given for both a homogeneous external medium and for a wind ejected by the GRB progenitor .	We compare the afterglow emission at different observing frequencies , for each type of external medium .
1	Quantum dots are coupled through hopping and each dot can accept zero , one or two electrons .	We introduce a model of quantum teleportation on a channel built on a quantum dot chain .	Vacuum and double occupation states have the same potential energy , while single occupation states are characterized by a lower potential energy .	A single dot initially decoupled from the others is weakly coupled with an external element ( Bob ) , where a pair of electrons has been previously localized .	Because of hopping after a suitable time the two dots charge states become maximally entangled .
4	To illustrate this new non-symmetric cross gramian , it is applied in the context of model order reduction .	The cross gramian matrix is a tool for model reduction and system identification , but it is only computable for square control systems .	For symmetric systems the cross gramian possesses a useful relation to the system 's associated Hankel singular values .	Yet , many real-life models are neither square nor symmetric .	In this work , concepts from decentralized control are used to approximate a cross gramian for non-symmetric and non-square systems .
3	The radius of gyration is the slowest mode in the standard local flip/shift algorithm .	We propose a new , very efficient algorithm for sampling of random surfaces in the Monte Carlo simulations , based on so-called baby universe surgery , i.e.cutting and pasting of baby universes .	It drastically reduces slowing down as compared to the standard local flip algorithm , thereby allowing simulations of large random surfaces coupled to matter fields .	As an example we investigate the efficiency of the algorithm for 2d simplicial gravity interacting with a one-component free scalar field .	The use of baby universe surgery decreases the autocorrelation time by three order of magnitude for a random surface of $ 0.5 \cdot 10^5 $ triangles , where it is found to be $ \tau_ { int } = 150 \pm 31 $ sweeps .
0	We present a systematic study of static solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant which asymptotically approach the generalized Kottler ( `` Schwarzschild -- anti-de Sitter '' ) solution , within ( mainly ) a conformal framework .	We show connectedness of conformal infinity for appropriately regular such space-times .	We give an explicit expression for the Hamiltonian mass of the ( not necessarily static ) metrics within the class considered ; in the static case we show that they have a finite and well defined Hawking mass .	We prove inequalities relating the mass and the horizon area of the ( static ) metrics considered to those of appropriate reference generalized Kottler metrics .	Those inequalities yield an inequality which is opposite to the conjectured generalized Penrose inequality .
4	In principle , the new spin terms should be smaller than the $ \cO ( q^3 ) $ spin-orbit components .	In the rest frame of a many-body system , used in the calculation of its static and scattering properties , the center of mass of a two-body subsystem is allowed to drift .	We show , in a model independent way , that drift corrections to the nucleon-nucleon potential are relatively large and arise from both one- and two-pion exchange processes .	As far as chiral symmetry is concerned , corrections to these processes begin respectively at $ \cO ( q^2 ) $ and $ \cO ( q^4 ) $ .	The two-pion exchange interaction also yields a new spin structure , that promotes the presence of $ P $ waves in trinuclei and is associated with profile functions which do not coincide with neither central nor spin-orbit ones .
0	We study the thermodynamic behaviour of Inozemtsev 's long-range elliptic spin chain using the Bethe ansatz equations describing the spectrum of the model in the infinite-length limit .	We classify all solutions of these equations in that limit and argue which of these solutions determine the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit .	Interestingly , some of the solutions are not selfconjugate , which puts the model in sharp contrast to one of the model 's limiting cases , the Heisenberg xxx spin chain .	Invoking the string hypothesis we derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations ( TBA-equations ) from which we determine the Helmholtz free energy in thermodynamic equilibrium and derive the associated Y-system .	We corroborate our results by comparing numerical solutions of the TBA-equations to a direct computation of the free energy for the finite-length hamiltonian .
1	The helical phase , the conical phase in an external magnetic field , and recent proposals for the structure of the A-phase and the non-Fermi-liquid region in the paramagnetic phase are discussed .	A field theory appropriate for magnets that display helical order due to the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya mechanism , a class that includes MnSi and FeGe , is used to derive the phase diagram in a mean-field approximation .	It is shown that the orientation of the helical pitch vector along an external magnetic field within the conical phase occurs via two distinct phase transitions .	The Goldstone modes that result from the long-range order in the various phases are determined , and their consequences for electronic properties , in particular the specific heat , the single-particle relaxation time , and the electrical and thermal conductivities , are derived .	Various aspects of the ferromagnetic limit , and qualitative differences between the transport properties of helimagnets and ferromagnets , are also discussed .
1	We consider the subset of these operators that is responsible for flavor diagonal anomalous color magnetic ( CMDM ) and electric ( CEDM ) dipole couplings between quarks and gluons .	Physics beyond the standard model ( SM ) can be parameterized with an effective Lagrangian that respects the symmetries of the standard model and contains many operators of dimension six .	Invariance of these operators under the SM implies that they contribute to Higgs boson production at the LHC and we study the corresponding constraints that can be placed on them .	For the case of the top-quark we first review constraints from top-quark pair production and decay , and then compare them to what can be achieved by studying $ t\bar { t } h $ production .	We also constrain the corresponding couplings for $ b $ -quarks and light quarks by studying $ pp \to b\bar { b } h $ and $ pp \to hX $ respectively .
3	This leads to a natural way of organizing all such limits in terms of transitions from semistable to unstable singular fibers .	We present new explicit constructions of weak coupling limits of F-theory generalizing Sen 's construction to elliptic fibrations which are not necessary given in a Weierstrass form .	These new constructions allow for an elegant derivation of several brane configurations that do not occur within the original framework of Sen 's limit , or which would require complicated geometric tuning or break supersymmetry .	Our approach is streamlined by first deriving a simple geometric interpretation of Sen 's weak coupling limit .	These constructions provide a new playground for model builders as they enlarge the number of supersymmetric configurations that can be constructed in F-theory .
2	Comparison with recent near-IR observations of a sample of HH objects indicates gas phase Fe abundances ranging from 15-50 % up to 100 % of the solar value in agreement with the moderate depletions previously derived from optical line ratios or shock models .	We investigate the emissivity properties of the main near-IR transitions of the Fe+ ion in the conditions prevailing in the inner regions of jets from young stars , based on a simplified 16-level atom model .	We present new diagnostic diagrams involving prominent near-IR line ratios that allow us to constrain the electronic density , temperature , and Fe gas phase abundance ratio , independently of the heating process .	Hence , it appears that Fe-bearing dust is efficiently destroyed in stellar jets .	We then use our Fe+ emissivity model to predict near-IR [ Fe II ] emission maps for self-similar , cold MHD disk wind models .
4	When the deposition speed is low , particles have time to arrange by Brownian motion , while at the end , high-speed particles are jammed into a disordered phase .	A colloidal dispersion droplet evaporating from a surface , such as a drying coffee drop , leaves a distinct ring-shaped stain .	Although this mechanism is frequently used for particle self-assembly , the conditions for crystallization have remained unclear .	Our experiments with monodisperse colloidal particles reveal a structural transition in the stain , from ordered crystals to disordered packings .	We show that this sharp transition originates from a temporal singularity of the flow velocity inside the evaporating droplet at the end of its life .
3	Our results provide improved fits to the light curves and constraints on physical parameters .	We present a sample of 27 GRBs with detailed Swift light curves supplemented by late time Chandra observations .	To answer the missing jet-break problem in general , we develop a numerical simulation based model which can be directly fit to the data using Monte Carlo methods .	Our numerical model takes into account all the factors that can shape a jet-break : ( i ) lateral expansion ( ii ) edge effects and ( iii ) off-axis effects .	More importantly , our results suggest that off-axis effects are important and must be included in interpretations of GRB jet breaks .
1	The first method involves an adiabatic doubling of the periodicity of the underlying lattice to probe neighboring singlet ( triplet ) correlations for fermions ( bosons ) by the occupation of the new vibrational ground state .	We suggest two experimental methods for probing both short- and long-range spin correlations of atoms in optical lattices using superlattice potentials .	The second method utilizes a time-dependent superlattice potential to generate spin-dependent transport by any number of prescribed lattice sites , and probes correlations by the resulting number of doubly occupied sites .	For experimentally relevant parameters , we demonstrate how both methods yield large signatures of antiferromagnetic ( AF ) correlations of strongly repulsive fermionic atoms in a single shot of the experiment .	Lastly , we show how this method may also be applied to probe d-wave pairing , a possible ground state candidate for the doped repulsive Hubbard model .
2	It has been proved ( Klauck , STOC'00 ) that the exact one-way quantum finite automata have no advantage comparing to classical finite automata in recognizing languages .	We explore bounds of { \em time-space tradeoffs } in language recognition on { \em two-way finite automata } for some special languages .	We prove : ( 1 ) a time-space tradeoff upper bound for recognition of the languages $ L_ { EQ } ( n ) $ on { \em two-way probabilistic finite automata } ( 2PFA ) : $ TS= { \bf O } ( n\log n ) $ , whereas a time-space tradeoff lower bound on { \em two-way deterministic finite automata } is $ { \bf \Omega } ( n^2 ) $ , ( 2 ) a time-space tradeoff upper bound for recognition of the languages $ L_ { INT } ( n ) $ on { \em two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states } ( 2QCFA ) : $ TS= { \bf O } ( n^ { 3/2 } \log n ) $ , whereas a lower bound on 2PFA is $ TS= { \bf \Omega } ( n^2 ) $ , ( 3 ) a time-space tradeoff upper bound for recognition of the languages $ L_ { NE } ( n ) $ on exact 2QCFA : $ TS= { \bf O } ( n^ { 1.87 } \log n ) $ , whereas a lower bound on 2PFA is $ TS= { \bf \Omega } ( n^2 ) $ .	However , the result ( 3 ) shows that the exact 2QCFA do have an advantage in comparison with their classical counterparts , which has been the first example showing that the exact quantum computing have advantage in time-space tradeoff comparing to classical computing .	Usually , two communicating parties , Alice and Bob , are supposed to have an access to arbitrary computational power in { \em communication complexity } model that is used .
0	We consider the action of mapping class groups , by pre- and post-composition , on branched coverings , and encode them algebraically as `` mapping class bisets '' .	We show how the mapping class biset of maps preserving a multicurve decomposes into mapping class bisets of smaller complexity , called `` small mapping class bisets '' .	We phrase the decision problem of `` Thurston equivalence '' between branched self-coverings of the sphere in terms of the conjugacy and centralizer problems in a mapping class biset , and use our decomposition results on mapping class bisets to reduce these decision problems to small mapping class bisets .	This is the main step in our proof of decidability of Thurston equivalence , as outlined in the first article of the series , since decidability of conjugacy and centralizer problems in the small mapping class bisets are well understood in terms of linear algebra , group theory and complex analysis .	Branched coverings themselves are also encoded into bisets , with actions of the fundamental groups .
0	I point to an interesting similarity in the morphology and some non-dimensional quantities between pairs of X-ray-deficient bubbles in clusters of galaxies and pairs of optical-deficient bubbles in planetary nebulae ( PNs ) .	This similarity leads me to postulate a similar formation mechanism .	This postulate is used to strengthen models for PN shaping by jets ( or collimated fast winds : CFW ) .	The presence of dense material in the equatorial plane observed in the two classes of bubbles constrains the jets and CFW activity in PNs to occur while the AGB star still blows its dense wind , or very shortly after .	I argue that only a stellar companion can account for such jets and CFW .
2	They are characterized by one of two possible tasks , which they update at a rate equal to the cost of the task they are performing by either defecting by switching to the other task or cooperating by anti-imitating a random neighbor in order to balance the amount of energy spent in each task .	Motivated by the study of social insects , we introduce a stochastic model based on interacting particle systems in order to understand the effect of communication on the division of labor .	Members of the colony are located on the vertex set of a graph representing a communication network .	We prove that , at least when the probability of defection is small , the division of labor is poor when there is no communication , better when the communication network consists of a complete graph , but optimal on bipartite graphs with bipartite sets of equal size , even when both tasks have very different costs .	This shows a non-monotonic relationship between the number of connections in the communication network and how well individuals organize themselves to accomplish both tasks equally .
3	A true jet rebound on a solid surface , for which the cylindrical geometry is preserved , has never been yet observed .	When a water jet impinges upon a solid surface it produces a so called hydraulic jump that everyone can observe in the sink of its kitchen .	It is characterized by a thin liquid sheet bounded by a circular rise of the surface due to capillary and gravitational forces .	In this phenomenon , the impact induces a geometrical transition , from the cylindrical one of the jet to the bi-dimensional one of the film .	Here we experimentally demonstrate that a water jet can impact a solid surface without being destabilized .
2	We calculate the solution of the equations of motion for one layer of small surface elements distributed along the equator of the star , as they respond to the forces due to gas pressure , centrifugal , coriolis , viscous forces , and the gravitational forces of both stars .	The X-ray source 2S0114+650=LSI+65 010 is a binary system containing a B-type primary and a low mass companion believed to be a neutron star .	The system has three reported periodicities : the orbital period , P { orb } ~11.6 d , X-ray flaring with P { flare } ~2.7 hr , and a `` superorbital '' X-ray periodicity P { super } ~30.7 d. The objective of this paper is to show that the puzzling periodicities in the system may be explained in the context of scenarios in which tidal interactions drive oscillations in the B-supergiant star .	This calculation provides variability timescales that can be compared with the observations .	In addition , we use observational data obtained at the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional en San Pedro M\'artir ( OAN/SPM ) between 1993-2004 to determine which of the periodicities may be present in the optical region .
1	Half of the chosen quasars are bright at mm wavelengths ( 250 or 350 GHz ) while the other half were not detected at mm wavelengths ; the former QSOs were detected at 1.4 GHz , in most cases at high significance ( S/N & gt ; ~7 ) , but only three of the latter sources were detected at radio frequencies , and only at lower significance ( S/N ~ 3 ) .	We present Very Large Array observations at 1.4 and 5 GHz of a sample of 16 quasi-stellar objects ( QSOs ) at z = 1.78 to 2.71 .	The data are consistent with a correlation between the mm and radio fluxes indicating a physical connection between the mechanisms responsible for the radio and mm emission .	However , this conclusion is based on data which includes many upper limits , and deeper observations are clearly needed to verify this correlation .	All eight mm detected QSOs are detected in the radio continuum , with radio flux densities consistent with the radio-to-FIR correlation for low z star forming galaxies .
1	The key innovation of our microscope is the usage of an ultrafast `white light ' supercontinuum fiber-laser source which provides access to the whole visible and near-infrared spectral range .	We describe a two-color pump-probe scanning magneto-optical Kerr effect ( MOKE ) microscope which we have developed to investigate electron spin phenomena in semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures with picosecond time and micrometer spatial resolution .	Our Kerr microscope allows for the independent selection of the excitation and detection energy while avoiding the necessity to synchronize the pulse trains of two separate picosecond laser systems .	The ability to independently tune the pump and probe wavelength enables the investigation of the influence of excitation energy on the optically induced electron spin dynamics in semiconductors .	We demonstrate picosecond real-space imaging of the diffusive expansion of optically excited electron spin packets in a ( 110 ) GaAs quantum well sample to illustrate the capabilities of the instrument .
4	To make a meaningful comparison with existing experimental measurements , we statistically average the large-scale theoretical PI cross sections from the levels associated with the ground state $ \rm 5p^6 5d^4 6s^2 \ ; { ^5 } D_ { \it J } [ { \it J } =0,1,2,3,4 ] $ levels and the $ \rm 5d^56s \ ; ^7S_3 $ excited metastable level .	Results from large-scale theoretical cross section calculations for the total photoionization of the 4f , 5s , 5p and 6s orbitals of the neutral tungsten atom using the Dirac Coulomb R-matrix approximation ( DARC : Dirac-Atomic R-matrix codes ) are presented .	Comparisons are made with previous theoretical methods and prior experimental measurements .	In previous experiments a time-resolved dual laser approach was employed for the photo-absorption of metal vapours and photo-absorption measurements on tungsten in a solid , using synchrotron radiation .	The lowest ground state level of neutral tungsten is $ \rm 5p^6 5d^4 6s^2 \ ; { ^5 } D_ { \it J } $ , with $ \it J $ =0 , and requires only a single dipole matrix for photoionization .
1	This paper proposes an alternative approach for approximate evaluation of queries with probabilistic databases : In our approach , every query is evaluated entirely in the database engine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans , each providing an upper bound on the true probability , then taking their minimum .	Probabilistic inference over large data sets is a challenging data management problem as exact inference is generally # P-hard and requires sampling-based methods .	We provide an algorithm that takes into account important schema information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among all possible plans .	Importantly , this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries : A query is in PTIME if and only if our algorithm returns one single plan .	Furthermore , our approach is a generalization of a family of efficient ranking functions from graphs to hypergraphs .
2	We show that the method leads to statistically unbiased mass reconstructions and exact coverage of credible intervals .	In a recent paper , a new parametrization for the dark matter ( DM ) speed distribution f ( v ) was proposed for use in the analysis of data from direct detection experiments .	This parametrization involves expressing the logarithm of the speed distribution as a polynomial in the speed v. We present here a more detailed analysis of the properties of this parametrization .	The method performs well over a wide range of DM masses , even when finite energy resolution and backgrounds are taken into account .	We also show how to select the appropriate number of basis functions for the parametrization .
0	We present a comprehensive analysis of the Non-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ( NMSSM ) for large values of $ \tan\beta $ , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets , which arise when we impose the constraint of the unification of Yukawa couplings in the model .	In this limit we show that the vacuum expectation value of the singlet is forced to be large , of the order of $ 10 $ TeV .	The singlet decouples from the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs boson and the neutralinos .	We compare our results with the corresponding particle spectrum of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in the same limit .	With the exception of the lightest Higgs boson , the particle spectrum in the model turns out to be heavy .
3	These results confirm our earlier finding that the WD in this system is hidden from view in the high state .	We present time-resolved , ultraviolet ( UV ) spectroscopy of the SW Sex star DW UMa in the high state .	We confirm that , shortward of 1500 \AA , the high-state , UV continuum level is lower than the white dwarf ( WD ) -dominated low-state level .	We also do not see the WD contact phases in the high state eclipse light curves .	Based on this , we caution that eclipse mapping of high-inclination SW Sex stars in the high state may yield incorrect or misleading results .
1	A partial-wave analysis ( PWA ) was performed in bins of $ 3\pi $ mass and four-momentum transfer using the isobar model and the so far largest PWA model consisting of 88~waves .	The COMPASS collaboration at CERN has measured diffractive dissociation of 190 GeV $ /c $ pions into the $ \pi^-\pi^-\pi^+ $ final state using a stationary hydrogen target .	A narrow $ J^ { PC } = 1^ { ++ } $ signal is observed in the $ f_0 ( 980 ) \ , \pi $ channel .	We present a resonance-model study of a subset of the spin-density matrix selecting $ 3\pi $ states with $ J^ { PC } = 2^ { ++ } $ and $ 4^ { ++ } $ decaying into $ \rho ( 770 ) \ , \pi $ and with $ J^ { PC } = 1^ { ++ } $ decaying into $ f_0 ( 980 ) \ , \pi $ .	We identify a new $ a_1 $ meson with mass $ ( 1414^ { +15 } _ { -13 } ) $ MeV $ /c^2 $ and width $ ( 153^ { +8 } _ { -23 } ) $ MeV $ /c^2 $ .
1	The quantum dot is defined electrostatically in a point contact channel and by the potential barriers from negatively charged interface traps .	We investigate a silicon single-electron transistor ( SET ) in a metal-oxide-semiconductor ( MOS ) structure by applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface .	The magnetic field dependence of the excitation spectrum is primarily driven by the Zeeman effect .	In the two-electron singlet-triplet ( ST ) transition , electron-electron Coulomb interaction plays a significant role .	The evolution of Coulomb blockade peaks with magnetic field B is also owing to the Zeeman splitting with no obvious orbital effect up to 9 T. The filling pattern shows an alternate spin-up-spin-down sequence .
1	Depending on the sign of $ \epsilon '' $ , the medium is absorbing or amplifying .	An analytical and numerical study is presented of transmission of radiation through a multi-mode waveguide containing a random medium with a complex dielectric constant $ \epsilon= \epsilon'+i\epsilon '' $ .	The transmitted intensity decays exponentially $ \propto\exp ( -L/\xi ) $ as the waveguide length $ L\to\infty $ , regardless of the sign of $ \epsilon '' $ .	The localization length $ \xi $ is computed as a function of the mean free path $ l $ , the absorption or amplification length $ |\sigma|^ { -1 } $ , and the number of modes in the waveguide $ N $ .	The method used is an extension of the Fokker-Planck approach of Dorokhov , Mello , Pereyra , and Kumar to non-unitary scattering matrices .
1	Besides the two groups or classes of block states considered in White 's formulation , the retained $ m $ states and the neglected ones , we introduce an intermediate group of block states having the following $ p $ largest eigenvalues $ \lambda_i $ of the reduced density matrix : $ \lambda_1 \ge & gt ; ... \lambda_m \ge \lambda_ { m+1 } \ge ... \ge \lambda_ { m+p } $ .	An extension of the the density matrix renormalization group ( DMRG ) method is presented .	These states are taken into account when they contribute to intrablock transitions but are neglected when they participate in more delocalized interblock fluctuations .	Applications to one-dimensional models ( Heisenberg , Hubbard and dimerized tight-binding ) show that in this way the involved computer resources can be reduced without significant loss of accuracy .	The efficiency and accuracy of the method is analyzed by varying $ m $ and $ p $ and by comparison with standard DMRG calculations .
3	This makes the electron root regime of stellarators , close to the transition to ion root , a propitious regime for the study of zonal-flow evolution .	The drift kinetic equation is solved for low density TJ-II plasmas employing slowly varying , time-dependent profiles .	This allows to simulate density ramp-up experiments and to describe from first principles the formation and physics of the radial electric field shear , which is associated to the transition from electron to ion root .	We show that the range of frequencies of plasma potential fluctuations in which zonal flows are experimentally observed is neoclassically undamped in a neighborhood of the transition .	We present simulations of collisionless relaxation of zonal flows , in the sense of the Rosenbluth and Hinton test , that show an oscillatory behaviour in qualitative agreement with the experiment close to the transition .
0	We present the detailed modelling of line spectra emitted from galaxies at redshifts 0.2 & lt ; z & lt ; 2.3 .	The spectra account only for a few oxygen to Hb line ratios .	The results show that [ OII ] 3727+3729/Hb and [ OIII ] 5007+4959/Hb are not sufficient to constrain the models .	The data at least of an auroral line , e.g . [ OIII ] 4363 , should be known .	We have found by modelling the spectra observed from ultrastrong emission line galaxy and faint galaxy samples , O/H relative abundances ranging between 1.8 X 10^ { -4 } and 6.6 X 10^ { -4 } .
4	It is easily observed that $ \mathsf d ( G ) +1\leq \mathsf D ( G ) $ , and if $ G $ is abelian , then equality holds .	Let $ G $ be a finite group written multiplicatively .	By a sequence over $ G $ , we mean a finite sequence of terms from $ G $ which is unordered , repetition of terms allowed , and we say that it is a product-one sequence if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity element of $ G $ .	The small Davenport constant $ \mathsf d ( G ) $ is the maximal integer $ \ell $ such that there is a sequence over $ G $ of length $ \ell $ which has no nontrivial , product-one subsequence .	The large Davenport constant $ \mathsf D ( G ) $ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence -- -this is a product-one sequence which can not be factored into two nontrivial , product-one subsequences .
2	Later this phenomenon was derived via more modern techniques of quantum field theory in curved space-times by Parker ( who apparently was not aware of Schr\ '' odinger 's work ) and subsequently has been studied in numerous publications .	One of the most striking examples for the production of particles out of the quantum vacuum due to external conditions is cosmological particle creation , which is caused by the expansion or contraction of the Universe .	Already in 1939 , Schr\ '' odinger understood that the cosmic evolution could lead to a mixing of positive and negative frequencies and that this `` would mean production or annihilation of matter , merely by the expansion '' .	Even though cosmological particle creation typically occurs on extremely large length scales , it is one of the very few examples for such fundamental effects where we actually may have observational evidence : According to the inflationary model of cosmology , the seeds for the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) and basically all large scale structures stem from this effect .	In this Chapter , we shall provide a brief discussion of this phenomenon and sketch a possibility for an experimental realization via an analogue in the laboratory .
0	Bohmian mechnaics is the most naively obvious embedding imaginable of Schr\ '' odingers 's equation into a completely coherent physical theory .	It describes a world in which particles move in a highly non-Newtonian sort of way , one which may at first appear to have little to do with the spectrum of predictions of quantum mechanics .	It turns out , however , that as a consequence of the defining dynamical equations of Bohmian mechanics , when a system has wave function $ \psi $ its configuration is typically random , with probability density $ \rho $ given by $ |\psi|^2 $ , the quantum equilibrium distribution .	It also turns out that the entire quantum formalism , operators as observables and all the rest , naturally emerges in Bohmian mechanics from the analysis of `` measurements . ''	This analysis reveals the status of operators as observables in the description of quantum phenomena , and facilitates a clear view of the range of applicability of the usual quantum mechanical formulas .
1	In the present paper we show how to obtain from this description a natural equivariant completion of these $ \C^* $ -surfaces .	Following an approach of Dolgachev , Pinkham and Demazure , we classified in math.AG/0210153 normal affine surfaces with hyperbolic $ \C^ { * } $ -actions in terms of pairs of $ \Q $ -divisors $ ( D_+ , D_- ) $ on a smooth affine curve .	Using elementary transformations we deduce also natural completions for which the boundary divisor is a standard graph in the sense of math.AG/0511063 and show in certain cases their uniqueness .	This description is especially precise in the case of normal affine surfaces completable by a zigzag i.e. , by a linear chain of smooth rational curves .	As an application we classify all zigzags that appear as boundaries of smooth or normal $ \C^* $ -surfaces .
3	We introduce a meaningful notion of Shannon capacity for such systems , evaluate this capacity as a function of signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , and develop a simple two-phase cooperative network protocol that achieves it .	A framework is developed for analyzing capacity gains from user cooperation in slow fading wireless networks when the number of nodes ( network size ) is large .	The framework is illustrated for the case of a simple multipath-rich Rayleigh fading channel model .	Both unicasting ( one source and one destination ) and multicasting ( one source and several destinations ) scenarios are considered .	We observe that the resulting capacity is the same for both unicasting and multicasting , but show that the network size required to achieve any target error probability is smaller for unicasting than for multicasting .
3	The problem is to find parameters of this set .	We consider linear reaction -- diffusion problems with mixed Diriclet-Neumann-Robin conditions .	The diffusion matrix , reaction coefficient , and the coefficient in the Robin boundary condition are defined with an uncertainty which allow bounded variations around some given mean values .	A solution to such a problem can not be exactly determined ( it is a function in the set of `` possible solutions '' formed by generalized solutions related to possible data ) .	In this paper , we show that computable lower and upper bounds of the diameter ( or radius ) of the set can be expressed throughout problem data and parameters that regulate the indeterminacy range .
4	Our approach relies crucially on the observation that the relative entropy function -- by virtue of its joint convexity with respect to both arguments -- provides a convex parametrization of certain sets of globally nonnegative signomials with efficiently computable nonnegativity certificates via the arithmetic-geometric-mean inequality .	Signomial programs ( SPs ) are optimization problems specified in terms of signomials , which are weighted sums of exponentials composed with linear functionals of a decision variable .	SPs are non-convex optimization problems in general , and families of NP-hard problems can be reduced to SPs .	In this paper we describe a hierarchy of convex relaxations to obtain successively tighter lower bounds of the optimal value of SPs .	This sequence of lower bounds is computed by solving increasingly larger-sized relative entropy optimization problems , which are convex programs specified in terms of linear and relative entropy functions .
3	The surface morphological examination with field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) revealed the fact that the grains are closely packed and pores/voids between the grains are very few .	The structural , optical and electrical properties of spray deposited antimony ( Sb ) doped tin oxide ( SnO2 ) thin films , prepared from SnCl4 precursor , have been studied as a function of antimony doping concentration .	The doping concentration was varied from 0 to 1.5 wt. % of Sb .	The analysis of x-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the as deposited doped and undoped tin oxide thin films are pure crystalline tetragonal rutile phase of tin oxide which belongs to the space group P42/mnm ( number 136 ) .	The transmittance spectra for as-deposited films were recorded in the wavelength range of 200 to 1000 nm .
4	In particular , we discuss Tsallis distribution with complex nonextensivity parameter q and argue that it is needed to describe log-oscillations as apparently observed in recent data on large momentum distributions in very high energy p-p collisions .	We review the ubiquitous presence in multiparticle production processes of quasi-power law distributions ( i.e. , distributions following pure power laws for large values of the argument but remaining finite , usually exponential , for small values ) .	Special emphasis is placed on the conjecture that this reflects the presence in the produced hadronic systems of some intrinsic fluctuations .	If described by parameter q they form , together with the scale parameter $ T $ ( `` temperature '' ) , basis of Tsallis distribution , $ { f ( X ) \sim [ 1 - ( 1-q ) X/T ] ^ { 1/ ( 1-q ) } } $ , frequently used to describe the relevant distributions ( the X being usually a transverse momentum ) .	We discuss the origin of such quasi-power law behavior based on our experience with the description of multiparticle production processes .
2	Although the construction resembles the Cuntz-Quillen approach to ordinary cyclic homology , a completely new feature in the equivariant setting is the fact that the basic ingredient in the theory is not a complex in the usual sense .	We define and study equivariant periodic cyclic homology for locally compact groups .	This can be viewed as a noncommutative generalization of equivariant de Rham cohomology .	As a consequence , in the equivariant context only the periodic cyclic theory can be defined in complete generality .	Our definition recovers particular cases studied previously by various authors .
1	As a consequence of this algorithm we conclude that the complexity of connected f -factor for the case we consider is unlikely to be NP-Complete unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis ( ETH ) is false .	Given an undirected graph G = ( V , E ) with n vertices , and a function f : V - & gt ; N , we consider the problem of finding a connected f -factor in G. In this work we design an algorithm to check for the existence of a connected f -factor , for the case where f ( v ) & gt ; = n/g ( n ) , for all v in V and g ( n ) is polylogarithmic in n. The running time of our algorithm is O ( n^ { 2g ( n ) } .	Secondly , under the assumption of the ETH , we show that it is also unlikely to be in P for g ( n ) in O ( ( log n ) ^ { 1+eps } ) for any eps & gt ; 0 .	Therefore , our results show that for all eps & gt ; 0 , connected f -factor for f ( v ) & gt ; = n/O ( log n ) ^ { 1+eps } ) is in NP-Intermediate unless the ETH is false .	Further , for any constant c & gt ; 0 , when g ( n ) = c , our algorithm for connected f -factor runs in polynomial time .
4	By combining the wavefunctions of the degenerate manifold with suitable symmetry and guided by the strong-coupling form of the Bethe-Ansatz solution for the homogeneous system we propose an analytic expression for the many-body wavefunction of the inhomogeneous system which well describes the ground state at finite , large and equal interactions strengths , as validated by numerical simulations .	We present the exact solution for the many-body wavefunction of a one-dimensional mixture of bosons and spin-polarized fermions with equal masses and infinitely strong repulsive interactions under external confinement .	Such a model displays a large degeneracy of the ground state .	Using a generalized Bose-Fermi mapping we find the solution for the whole set of ground-state wavefunctions of the degenerate manifold and we characterize them according to group-symmetry considerations .	We find that the density profile and the momentum distribution depends on the symmetry of the solution .
3	We report here that such a moving wall within an itinerant ferromagnet constitutes a seat of electro-motive-force ( or more accurately a spin-motive-force ) which induces a current flow in an external circuit .	Historically the role of eddy currents in the motion of Bloch walls has been extensively studied .	In contrast the direct interaction of currents with such a moving wall has received very little attention .	However recently it has been shown that a wall can be displaced by the effects of a current alone , a fact which is important to the development of spintronics .	While an external magnetic field is the most evident means by which to induce Bloch wall motion , it is not the only possibility and the forces intrinsic to certain geometries imply that the state of a spintronics memory device might be read via this mechanism using currents alone and that power amplification of spin polarized pulses is possible .
3	We refer to this type of assembly model as passive in that the constituent parts remain unchanged throughout the assembly process regardless of their interactions .	In this paper we show that passive self-assembly in the context of the tile self-assembly model is capable of performing fuel efficient , universal computation .	The tile self-assembly model is a premiere model of self-assembly in which particles are modeled by four-sided squares with glue types assigned to each tile edge .	The assembly process is driven by positive and negative force interactions between glue types , allowing for tile assemblies floating in the plane to combine and break apart over time .	A computationally universal system is said to be fuel efficient if the number of tiles used up per computation step is bounded by a constant .
2	The boundary conditions on the intermediate boundary are of Robin-type and represented in a differential form .	The paper is devoted to the generalized wall functions of Robin-type and their application to near-wall turbulent flows .	The wall functions are based on the transfer of a boundary condition from a wall to some intermediate boundary near the wall .	The wall functions are formulated in an analytical easy-to-implement form , can take into account the source terms of the momentum equation , and do not include free parameters .	The log-profile assumption is not used in this approach .
1	Localization is shown to be sensitive to the distribution of the random site energies .	A mean field theory of the localization transition for bosonic systems is developed .	It occurs in the presence of a triangular distribution , but not a uniform one .	The inverse participation ratio , the single site Green 's function , the superfluid order parameter and the corresponding susceptibility are calculated , and the appropriate exponents determined .	All of these quantities indicate the presence of a new phase , which can be identified as the { \it Bose-glass } .
2	Particular and complete solutions to these problems are defined and characterized in several equivalent ways in both formalisms , and the equivalence between them is proved .	The geometric framework for the Hamilton-Jacobi theory developed in previous works is extended for multisymplectic first-order classical field theories .	The Hamilton-Jacobi problem is stated for the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalisms of these theories as a particular case of a more general problem , and the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation for field theories is recovered from this geometrical setting .	The use of distributions in jet bundles that represent the solutions to the field equations is the fundamental tool in this formulation .	Some examples are analyzed and , in particular , the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for non-autonomous mechanical systems is obtained as a special case of our results .
4	A non-local , radiative transfer code based on the ALI formalism is used .	Aims : Spectrally resolved circumstellar H2O ( 1_10 - 1_01 ) lines have been obtained towards three M-type AGB stars using the Odin satellite .	This provides additional strong constrains on the properties of circumstellar H2O and the circumstellar envelope .	Methods : ISO and Odin satellite H2O line data are used as constraints for radiative transfer models .	Special consideration is taken to the spectrally resolved Odin line profiles , and the effect of excitation to the first excited vibrational states of the stretching modes ( nu1=1 and nu3=1 ) on the derived abundances is estimated .
0	Dipoles interference is studied when atomic systems are coupled to classical electromagnetic fields .	The interaction between the dipoles and the classical fields induces a time-varying Aharonov-Casher phase .	Averaging over the phase generates a suppression of fringe visibility in the interference pattern .	We show that , for suitable experimental conditions , the loss of contrast for dipoles can be observable and almost as large as the corresponding one for coherent electrons .	We analyze different trajectories in order to show the dependence of the decoherence factor with the velocity of the particles .
2	This may be achieved by having either ( A ) a metal-enriched IMF with and a lower mass cutoff of & gt ; = 30Msun or ( B ) 2-4 % of stellar mass being Population III massive metal-free stars at z~6 .	In the context stellar reionization in the standard cold dark matter model , we analyze observations at z~6 and are able to draw three significant conclusions with respect to star formation and the state of the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) at z~6 .	( 1 ) An initial stellar mass function ( IMF ) more efficient , by a factor of 10-20 , in producing ionizing photons than the standard Salpeter IMF is required at z~6 .	While there is no compelling physical reason or observational evidence to support ( A ) , ( B ) could be fulfilled plausibly by continued existence of some pockets of uncontaminated , metal-free gas for star formation .	( 2 ) The volume-weighted neutral fraction of the IGM of & lt ; f_HI & gt ; _V~ 10^-4 at z=5.8 inferred from the SDSS observations of QSO absorption spectra provides enough information to ascertain that reionization is basically complete with at most ~0.1-1 % of IGM that is un-ionized at z=5.8 .
4	For QF extensions , we establish that left and right depth two are equivalent notions as well as a converse endomorphism theorem , and characterize depth three in terms of separability and depth two .	For any k-coalgebra C it is shown that similar quasi-finite C-comodules have strongly equivalent coendomorphism coalgebras ; ( the converse is in general not true ) .	As an application we give a general result about codepth two coalgebra homomorphisms .	Also a notion of codepth two bicomodule is introduced .	The last section applies similarity to an endomorphism ring theorem for quasi-Frobenius ( QF ) bimodules and then to finite depth ring extensions .
0	Alkali doped aromatic compounds have shown evidence of metallic and superconducting phases whose precise nature is still mysterious .	In potassium and rubidium doped phenanthrene , superconducting temperatures around 5 K have been detected , but such basic elements as the stoichiometry , crystal structure , and electronic bands are still speculative .	We seek to predict the crystal structure of M3-phenanthrene ( M = K , Rb ) using ab-initio evolutionary simulation in conjunction with density functional theory ( DFT ) , and find metal but also insulator phases with distinct structures .	The original P21 herringbone structure of the pristine molecular crystal is generally abandoned in favor of different packing and chemical motifs .	The metallic phases are frankly ionic with three electrons acquired by each molecule .
2	In fact , we further find an interesting perturbed structure of the plasma velocity with a large peak in some narrow region located slightly inside of the fast-magnetosonic surface .	We have studied non-stationary and non-axisymmetric perturbations of a magnetohydrodynamic accretion onto a rotating ( Kerr ) black hole .	Assuming that the magnetic field dominates the plasma accretion , we find that the accretion suffers a large radial acceleration resulting from the Lorentz force , and becomes highly variable compared with the electromagnetic field there .	This is due to the concentrated propagation of the fluid disturbances in the form of fast-magnetosonic waves along the separatrix surface .	If the fast-magnetosonic speed is smaller in the polar regions than in the equatorial regions , the critical surface has a prolate shape for radial poloidal field lines .
0	Using molecular dynamics simulations and integral equations ( Rogers-Young , Percus-Yevick and hypernetted chain closures ) we investigate the thermodynamic of particles interacting with continuous core-softened intermolecular potential .	Dynamic properties are also analyzed by the simulations .	We show that , for a chosen shape of the potential , the density , at constant pressure , has a maximum for a certain temperature .	The line of temperatures of maximum density ( TMD ) was determined in the pressure-temperature phase diagram .	Similarly the diffusion constant at a constant temperature , $ D $ , has a maximum at a density $ \rho_ { max } $ and a minimum at a density $ \rho_ { min } & lt ; \rho_ { max } $ .
3	A checkerboard spatial order observable in the superconducting state in the cuprates is explained by a rise of the K - pair density wave .	Interrelation between the two-particle and mean-field problems is used to describe the strong pseudogap and superconducting states in cuprates .	We present strong pseudogap state as off-diagonal short-range order ( ODSRO ) originating from quasi-stationary states of the pair of repulsing particles with large total momentum ( K - pair ) .	Phase transition from the ODSRO state into the off-diagonal long-range ordered ( ODLRO ) superconducting state is associated with Bose-Einstein condensation of the K - pairs .	A competition between the ODSRO and ODLRO states leads to the phase diagram typical of the cuprates .
1	It is natural to expect that this suppression should be explained by a mechanism that explains the hierarchical structure of the fermion mass matrices .	In supersymmetry , there are gauge invariant dimension 5 proton decay operators which must be suppressed by a mass scale much larger than the Planck mass .	We apply this argument to the case where wave functions of chiral multiplets are localized under a kink background along an extra spatial dimension and the Yukawa couplings as well as the coefficients of the proton decay operators are determined by the overlap of the relevant wave functions .	A configuration is found in the context of SU ( 5 ) supersymmetric grand unified theory that yields realistic values of quark masses , mixing angles , CP phase and charged lepton masses and sufficiently small genuine dimension 5 proton decay operators .	Inclusion of SU ( 5 ) breaking effects is essential in order to obtain non-vanishing CP phase as well as correct lepton masses .
1	A wealth of observational information points to the existence of a non-baryonic component .	The need for dark matter is briefly reviewed .	To the theoretically favoured candidates today belong axions , supersymmetric particles , and to some extent massive neutrinos .	The theoretical foundation and experimental situation for each of these is reviewed .	In particular , indirect detection methods of supersymmetric dark matter are described .
0	This paper is one step toward infinite energy gauge theory and the geometry of infinite dimensional moduli spaces .	We generalize a gluing construction in the usual Yang-Mills gauge theory to an `` infinite energy '' situation .	We show that we can glue an infinite number of instantons , and that the resulting instantons have infinite energy in general .	Moreover we show that they have an infinite dimensional parameter space .	Our construction is a generalization of Donaldson 's `` alternating method '' .
1	The known mechanisms for this transition almost exclusively involve the dynamics of the scroll filament , i.e. , the line connecting the phase singularities .	The breakup of rotating scroll waves in three-dimensional excitable media has been linked to important biological processes .	In this paper , we describe a novel defect-induced route to breakup of a scroll wave pinned by an inexcitable obstacle partially extending through the bulk of the medium .	The wave is helically wound around the defect inducing sudden changes in velocity components of the wavefront at the obstacle boundary .	This results in breakup far from the filament , eventually giving rise to spatiotemporal chaos .
3	through the calculation of theoretical lag spectra for a range of source parameters in general relativistic ray tracing simulations , combined with knowledge of the observed variability of the X-ray emission from AGN .	The X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) is highly variable .	Measurements of time lags ( characterised by lag spectra ) between variability in the light curves in energy bands corresponding to directly observed continuum emission from the corona around the black hole and to X-rays reflected from the accretion disc adds a further dimension to studies of the structure and energetics of these systems .	We seek to understand these measurements in terms of the physical parameters of the X-ray source ( its location , extent , etc . )	Due to the proximity of the emission to the central black hole , Shapiro delays are important and the effects of general relativity should be considered when interpreting the lags as the light travel time between the source and reflector .
4	It has a non-analytic dependence on the strong coupling constant , allowing a non-singular continuation into the non-perturbative region .	We study the role of semi-classical QCD vacuum solutions in high energy scattering by considering the instanton contribution to hadronic cross sections .	We propose a new type of instanton-induced interactions ( `` instanton ladder '' ) that leads to the rising with energy hadronic cross section of Regge type ( the Pomeron ) .	We argue that this interaction may be responsible for the structure of the soft Pomeron .	The intercept is calculated .
4	We also present three dimensional graphics of the Horizon Run 3 spherical mock survey to show a wealth of large-scale structures of the universe that are predicted in surveys like BOSS .	We study the Physically Self Bound Cold Dark Matter Halo distribution which we associate with the massive galaxies within the Horizon Run 3 to estimate the accuracy in determination of the cosmological distance scale measured by the topology analysis .	We apply the routine `` Contour 3D '' to 108 Mock Survey of $ \pi $ steradians out to redshift z = 0.6 , which effectively correspond to the SDSS-III BOSS survey , and compare the topology with that of a Gaussian Random Phase Field .	We find that given three separate smoothing lengths $ \lambda = $ 15 , 21 , and 34 $ h^ { -1 } { \rm Mpc } $ , the least $ \chi^2 $ fit genus per unit volume g yields a 1.7 % fractional uncertainty in smoothing length and angular diameter distance to $ z = 0.6 $ .	This is an improvement upon former calibrations of and presents a competitive error estimate with next BAO scale techniques .
1	The inversion of the usual interference pattern represented by the HOM dip is equally observed when the wave packets are frequency displaced .	A peak in coincidence events has been observed in a modified Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer fed with weak coherent states inside the region of overlapping wave-packets .	The higher rate of coincidences indicates that photons are more likely to take on different output paths of the interferometer .	This effect was harnessed so a detection on one of the arms could herald the presence of a photon in the other .	The second order autocorrelation function at zero time was experimentally determined by means of the Hanburry-Brown and Twiss experiment and its value below 1 confirmed the sub-Poisson photon statistics of the heralded states .
3	In He3 ( He3,2p ) He4 we study the effects of a possible virtual state on the cross section .	We discuss microscopic cluster model descriptions of two solar nuclear reactions , Be7 ( p , gamma ) B8 and He3 ( He3,2p ) He4 .	The low-energy reaction cross section of Be7 ( p , gamma ) B8 , which determines the high-energy solar neutrino flux , is constrained by Be7 and B8 observables .	Our results show that a small value of the zero-energy cross section is rather unlikely .	Although , we have found no indication for such a state so far , its existence can not be ruled out yet .
3	For the MSE , there is potential to develop a distance indicator for these objects , based on their trend in $ S-r $ space .	The H $ \alpha $ surface brightness $ - $ radius ( $ S-r $ ) relation is a robust distance indicator for planetary nebulae ( PNe ) , further enhanced by different populations of PNe having distinct loci in $ S-r $ space .	Other types of photoionized nebulae also plot in quite distinct regions in the $ S-r $ plane , allowing its use as a diagnostic tool .	In particular , the nova shells and massive star ejecta ( MSE ) plot on relatively tight loci illustrating their evolutionary sequences .	As high-resolution , narrowband surveys of the nearest galaxies become more commonplace , the $ S-r $ plane is a potentially useful diagnostic tool to help identify the various ionized nebulae in these systems .
3	The key ingredient to determine the degree of magnesium depletion , and the amount of aluminium that can be produced , is the rate of proton capture on Mg25 , forming Al26 ; an increase in this cross-section by a factor 2 with respect to the highest value allowed by the NACRE compilation allows to reproduce the extent of the Mg-depletion observed , and is in qualitative agreement with the positive Al-Si correlation observed in a few clusters .	The stars in globular clusters are known to differ in their surface chemistry : the spectroscopic investigations in the last decades outlined the presence of star-to-star differences in the abundances of the light elements , up to aluminium ( and possibly silicon ) , suggesting that some stars were contaminated by an advanced proton-capture nucleosynthesis .	The AGB stars are one of the most promising candidates in producing the pollution of the intra-cluster medium , via the ejection of gas processed by Hot Bottom Burning , from which new stellar generations are formed .	This work is focused on the degree of nucleosynthesis involving magnesium , aluminium and silicon that these sources may experience .	The main uncertainties associated with the macro- and micro-physics input , are discussed and commented , and the comparison with recent spectroscopic results for the globular cluster showing some degree of Mg-Al anticorrelation and Al-Si correlation is presented .
4	At the end we proved existence theorems for mappings between different noncommutative tori .	We replaced the classical string theory notions of parameter space and world-time with noncommutative tori and consider maps between these spaces .	The dynamics of mappings between different noncommutative tori were studied and a noncommutative generalization of the Polyakov action was derived .	The quantum torus was studied in detail as well as *-homomorphisms between different quantum tori .	A finite dimensional representation of the quantum torus was studied and the partition function and other path integrals were calculated .
4	An apparent superluminal velocity of ( 8.2+/-1.5 ) c in the jet was inferred from 2011-2012 VLBA images , suggesting the presence of a highly relativistic jet .	We report Fermi-LAT observations of the radio-loud AGN SBS 0846+513 ( z=0.5835 ) , optically classified as a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy , together with new and archival radio-to-X-ray data .	The source was not active at gamma-ray energies during the first two years of Fermi operation .	A significant increase in activity was observed during 2010 October-2011 August .	In particular a strong gamma-ray flare was observed in 2011 June reaching an isotropic gamma-ray luminosity ( 0.1-300 GeV ) of 1.0x10^48 erg/s , comparable to that of the brightest flat spectrum radio quasars , and showing spectral evolution in gamma rays .
4	Both models provide good fits to the power spectra of all four AGN .	We have developed a Monte Carlo technique to test models for the true power spectra of intermittently sampled lightcurves against the noisy , observed power spectra , and produce a reliable estimate of the goodness of fit of the given model .	We apply this technique to constrain the broadband power spectra of a sample of four Seyfert galaxies monitored by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) over three years .	We show that the power spectra of three of the AGN in our sample ( MCG-6-30-15 , NGC5506 and NGC3516 ) flatten significantly towards low frequencies , while the power spectrum of NGC5548 shows no evidence of flattening .	We fit two models for the flattening , a `knee ' model , analogous to the low-frequency break seen in the power spectra of BHXRBs in the low state ( where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=0 ) and a `high-frequency break ' model ( where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=1 ) , analogous to the high-frequency break seen in the high and low-state power spectra of the classic BHXRB Cyg X-1 .
0	We theoretically demonstrate that nuclear spins can be harnessed to coherently control two-electron spin states in a double quantum dot .	Hyperfine interactions lead to an avoided crossing between the spin singlet state and the ms = +1 triplet state , T_+ .	We show that a coherent superposition of singlet and triplet states can be achieved using finite-time Landau-Zener-St\ '' uckelberg interferometry .	In this system the coherent rotation rate is set by the Zeeman energy , resulting in ~1 nanosecond single spin rotations .	We analyze the coherence of this spin qubit by considering the coupling to the nuclear spin bath and show that T_2^* ~ 16 ns , in good agreement with experimental data .
2	Such models are obtained in the present paper , for the case of a horizontally homogeneous foliage of Lambertian leaves , modeled as a turbid medium .	Various numerical methods exist for obtaining the radiances inside a canopy of leaves above a partly reflecting ground .	In view of testing the accuracy of these diverse methods , it is desirable to have at one 's disposal non-trivial models possessing analytical solutions , against which to compare numerical reuslts .	Our treatment is more general than usual in that we allow the top and under sides of leaves to have different optical coefficients .	Besides being more realistic , this enables artificial situations , such as extreme light trapping , testing the limits of various numerical methods .
4	At present , however , it is not possible to test QED to this precision because of the 1.34 kHz uncertainty due to the muon mass .	Terms contributing to the hyperfine structure of the muonium ground state at the level of few tenths of kHz have been evaluated .	The $ \alpha^2 ( Z\alpha ) $ radiative correction has been calculated numerically to the precision of 0.02 kHz .	Leading $ \ln ( Z\alpha ) $ terms of order $ \alpha^ { 4-n } ( Z\alpha ) ^n , n=1,2,3 , $ and some relativistic corrections have been evaluated analytically .	The theoretical uncertainty is now reduced to 0.17 kHz .
0	We propose a scheme for implementing cross Kerr nonlinearity between two superconducting transmission line resonators ( TLR ) via their interaction with a coupler which is constructed by two superconducting charge qubits connected to each other via a superconducting quantum interference device .	When suitably driven , the coupler can induce very strong cross phase modulation ( XPM ) between the two TLRs due to its N-type level structure and the consequent electromagnetically induced transparency in its lowest states .	The flexibility of our design can lead to various inter-TLR coupling configurations .	The obtained cross Kerr coefficient is large enough to allow many important quantum operations in which only few photons are involved .	We further show that this scheme is very robust against the fluctuations in solid state circuits .
0	This paper represents an approach to creating global knowledge systems , using new philosophy and infrastructure of global distributed semantic network ( frame knowledge representation system ) based on the space-time database construction .	The main idea of the space-time database environment introduced in the paper is to bind a document ( an information frame , a knowledge ) to a special kind of entity , that we call permanent entity , -- an object without history and evolution , described by a `` point '' in the generalized , informational space-time ( not an evolving object in the real space having history ) .	For documents ( information ) it means that document content is unchangeable , and documents are absolutely persistent .	This approach leads to new knowledge representation and retreival techniques .	We discuss the way of applying the concept to a global distributed scientific library and scientific workspace .
3	For pp collisions , this could be attributed , within a model of hadronizing strings , to multiple-parton interactions and to a final-state color reconnection mechanism .	The average transverse momentum $ \langle p_ { \rm T } \rangle $ versus the charged-particle multiplicity $ N_ { \rm ch } $ was measured in p-Pb collisions at a collision energy per nucleon-nucleon pair $ \sqrt { s_ { \rm NN } } =5.02 $ TeV and in pp collisions at collision energies of $ \sqrt { s } =0.9 $ , 2.76 , and 7 TeV in the kinematic range $ 0.15 & lt ; p_ { \rm T } & lt ; 10.0 $ GeV/ $ c $ and $ |\eta| & lt ; 0.3 $ with the ALICE apparatus at the LHC .	These data are compared to results in Pb-Pb collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { \rm NN } } =2.76 $ TeV at similar charged-particle multiplicities .	In pp and p-Pb collisions , a strong increase of $ \langle p_ { \rm T } \rangle $ with $ N_ { \rm ch } $ is observed , which is much stronger than that measured in Pb-Pb collisions .	The data in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions can not be described by an incoherent superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions and pose a challenge to most of the event generators .
3	Results about its uniqueness are showed , and applications and complementary properties are quickly studied .	We describe a construction process of a relevant measure in any non-empty compact metric space .	This probability measure has invariance properties with respect to isometric maps defined on open sets .	These properties imply that this measure is an appropriate generalisation of the Lebesgue one .	Peculiarly , we show an equivalence result in a general framework linked with the Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem .
2	Remarkably , such models can be realized even if the 75-plet Higgs is replaced by the standard 24-plet .	We present the supersymmetric $ SU ( 5 ) $ models which provide a simple `` all order '' solution to the doublet-triplet splitting problem through the missing doublet mechanism .	The crucial role is played by the anomalous $ U ( 1 ) _A $ gauge symmetry and no additional discrete or global symmetries are needed .	The same $ U ( 1 ) _A $ symmetry can also guarantee an exact or approximate conservation of R parity , by suppressing the B and L violating operators to the needed level .	The neutrino masses and the proton decay via $ d=5 $ operators are also examined .
0	The interplay between the thermal transport property and the topological aspect is investigated in a spin-triplet chiral p-wave superconductor Sr2RuO4 with the strong two-dimensionality .	We show the thermal Hall conductivity is well described by the temperature linear term and the exponential term in the low temperature region .	While the former term is proportional to the so-called Chern number directly , the latter is associated with the superconducting gap amplitude of the gamma band .	We also demonstrate that the coefficient of the exponential term changes the sign around Lifshitz transition .	Our obtained result may enable us access easily the physical quantities and the topological property of Sr2RuO4 in detail .
2	Our estimates for the critical exponents are nu= 0.6299 ( 3 ) and eta = 0.0359 ( 10 ) .	We present results from the simulation of a two-coupling spin-1 model with states 0 , +1 , -1 and nearest neighbour interaction .	By a suitable choice of couplings we are able to drastically reduce the effects of corrections to scaling .	For the Binder cumulant related universal ratio we obtain Q= 0.6240 ( 2 ) .	The universal ratio of partition functions with antiperiodic/periodic boundary conditions , respectively , is Z_a/Z_p = 0.5425 ( 2 ) .
2	The coulomb correlation energy in this system has been determined experimentally from the position of the $ 4f $ states above and below the Fermi level .	The occupied and the unoccupied electronic structure of CeAg $ _2 $ Ge $ _2 $ single crystal has been studied using high resolution photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy respectively .	High resolution photoemission reveals the clear signature of Ce $ 4f $ states in the occupied electronic structure which was not observed earlier due to the poor resolution .	Theoretically the correlation energy has been determined by using the first principles density functional calculations within the generalized gradient approximations taking into account the strong intra-atomic ( on-site ) interaction Hubbard $ U_ { eff } $ term .	Although the valence band calculated with different $ U_ { eff } $ does not show significant difference , but the substantial changes are observed in the conduction band .
3	Other causes for structure in the polarization maps are intrinsic to the radiative transfer of the emission in the warm ISM , which induces Faraday rotation and depolarization .	The polarized component of the diffuse radio synchrotron emission of our Galaxy shows structure , which is apparently unrelated to the structure in total intensity , on many scales .	The structure in the polarized emission can be due to several processes or mechanisms .	Some of those are related to the observational setup , such as beam depolarization -- the vector combination and ( partial ) cancellation of polarization vectors within a synthesized beam -- , or the insensitivity of a synthesis telescope to structure on large scales , also known as the 'missing short spacings problem ' .	We use data obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at 5 frequencies near 350 MHz to estimate the importance of the various mechanisms in producing structure in the linearly polarized emission .
1	We confirm the soft excess in both sources , even if for Mrk~841 a warm absorber provides a fit almost as good as the one with a true excess .	We present and discuss BeppoSAX observations of Mrk841 and Mrk335 , two Seyfert 1 galaxies in which previous observations have established the presence of soft excesses .	As far as the hard X-ray continuum is concerned , a Comptonization model provides a fit as good as a power law and a physically sound solution for Mrk841 .	For Mrk335 , the Comptonization model gives a result which is somewhat better on statistical ground , but rather problematic on physical ground .	The most interesting results regard the reprocessing components .
3	The precessing and spinning blazing nature reflects at smaller intensity the same behavior observed in brief GRBs Jetted Supernova , as well as re-brightening and bumps in afterglows .	Soft Gamma Repeaters are widely believed to occur as isotropic Magnetar explosion .	We suggest on the contrary that they may be described by thin collimated spinning and precessing Gamma Jets flashing and blazing along the line of sight .	The Jet ( for SGRs ) maybe powered by an accretion disk in binary system and it reproduces huge outflow and oscillating blazing mode as the observed ones in Giant Flare SGR 1806-20 .	The SGR gamma beam maybe powered by Inverse Compton Scattering or by Synchrotron Radiation of electron pair beam respectively at GeVs or PeVs energies .
3	The dimer thermal diffusive dynamics deviates from simple Arrhenius behavior , due to the coupling between vibrational and translational degrees of freedom .	The motion of molecules on solid surfaces is of interest for technological applications , but it is also a theoretical challenge .	We study the deterministic and thermal diffusive dynamics of a dimer moving on a periodic substrate .	The deterministic motion of the dimer displays strongly nonlinear features and chaotic behavior .	In the low-temperature limit the dimer diffusion can become orders of magnitude larger than that of a single atom , as also found experimentally .
4	For $ u\leq v\in ( S_n ) ^J $ in the Bruhat order and $ x\in \ { q , -1\ } $ , let $ R_ { u , v } ^ { J , x } ( q ) $ denote the parabolic $ R $ -polynomial indexed by $ u $ and $ v $ .	Parabolic $ R $ -polynomials were introduced by Deodhar as parabolic analogues of ordinary $ R $ -polynomials defined by Kazhdan and Lusztig .	In this paper , we are concerned with the computation of parabolic $ R $ -polynomials for the symmetric group .	Let $ S_n $ be the symmetric group on $ \ { 1,2 , \ldots , n\ } $ , and let $ S=\ { s_i\ , |\ , 1\leq i\leq n-1\ } $ be the generating set of $ S_n $ , where for $ 1\leq i\leq n-1 $ , $ s_i $ is the adjacent transposition .	For a subset $ J\subseteq S $ , let $ ( S_n ) _J $ be the parabolic subgroup generated by $ J $ , and let $ ( S_n ) ^ { J } $ be the set of minimal coset representatives for $ S_n/ ( S_n ) _J $ .
1	It is suggested that CP may be spontaneously broken , the two branes would correspond to ground states for matter and antimatter respectively .	Motivated by the AMS project , we assume that after the Big Bang or inflation epoch , antimatter was repelled onto one brane which is separated from our brane where all the observational matter resides .	Generally a complex scalar field which is responsible for the spontaneous CP violation , exists in the space between the branes and causes a repulsive force against the gravitation .	A possible potential barrier prevents the mater ( antimatter ) particles to enter the space between two branes .	However , by the quantum tunnelling , a sizable anti-matter flux may come to our brane .
0	In this notes we study $ k $ -jet ample line bundles $ L $ on a non singular toric variety $ X $ , i.e.line bundles with global sections having arbitrarily prescribed $ k $ -jets at a finite number of points .	We introduce the notion of an associated $ k $ -convex $ \D $ -support function , $ \psi_L $ , requiring that the polyhedra $ P_L $ has edges of length at least $ k $ .	This translates to the property that the intersection of $ L $ with the invariant curves , associated to every edge , is $ \geq k $ .	We also state an equivalent criterion in terms of a bound of the Seshadri constant $ \e ( L , x ) $ .	More precisely we prove the equivalence of the following : ( 1 ) $ L $ is $ k $ -jet ample ; ( 2 ) $ L\cdot C\geq k $ , for any invariant curve $ C $ ; ( 3 ) $ \psi_L $ is $ k $ -convex ; ( 4 ) the Seshadri constant $ \e ( L , x ) \geq k $ for each $ x\in X $ .
3	In the dual mode of operation , that is , while observed at the gate input , the SCPB looks like a capacitance .	Low-frequency susceptibility of the split Cooper-pair box ( SCPB ) is investigated for use in sensitive measurements of external phase or charge .	Depending on the coupling scheme , the box appears as either inductive or capacitive reactance which depends on external phase and charge .	While coupling to the source-drain phase , we review how the SCPB looks like a tunable inductance , which property we used to build a novel radio-frequency electrometer .	We concentrate on discussing the latter scheme , and we show how to do studies of fast phase fluctuations at a sensitivity of 1 mrad/ $ \sqrt { Hz } $ by measuring the input capacitance of the box .
0	In this paper we present the first algorithm with optimal average-case and close-to-best known worst-case performance for the classic on-line problem of bin packing .	It has long been observed that known bin packing algorithms with optimal average-case performance were not optimal in the worst-case sense .	In particular First Fit and Best Fit had optimal average-case ratio of 1 but a worst-case competitive ratio of 1.7 .	The wasted space of First Fit and Best Fit for a uniform random sequence of length $ n $ is expected to be $ \Theta ( n^ { 2/3 } ) $ and $ \Theta ( \sqrt { n } \log ^ { 3/4 } n ) $ , respectively .	The competitive ratio can be improved to 1.691 using the Harmonic algorithm ; further variations of this algorithm can push down the competitive ratio to 1.588 .
1	For smooth and monotonic fitness function this approach gives two dynamical phases : smooth dynamics , and discontinuous dynamics .	We introduce a new way to study molecular evolution within well-established Hamilton-Jacobi formalism , showing that for a broad class of fitness landscapes it is possible to derive dynamics analytically within the $ 1/N $ -accuracy , where $ N $ is genome length .	The latter phase arises naturally with no explicit singular fitness function , counter-intuitively .	The Hamilton-Jacobi method yields straightforward analytical results for the models that utilize fitness as a function of Hamming distance from a reference genome sequence .	We also show the way in which this method gives dynamical phase structure for multi-peak fitness .
2	Quite surprisingly , hopping to the third sublattice can even enhance Neel order .	Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in Na $ _x $ CoO $ _2\cdot y $ H $ _2 $ O , we use series expansion methods and cluster mean-field theory to study spontaneous charge order , Neel order , ferromagnetic order , dimer order and phase-separation in the triangular-lattice t-J-V model at 2/3 electron density .	We find that for t & lt ; 0 , the charge ordered state , with electrons preferentially occupying a honeycomb lattice , is very robust .	At large negative t and small V , the Nagaoka ferromagnetic state is obtained .	For large positive t , charge and Neel order vanish below a critical V , giving rise to an itinerant antiferromagnetically correlated state .
0	Let M be an N-function satisfying the $ \Delta_2 $ - condition , let $ \omega , \vp $ be two other functions , $ \omega\ge 0 $ .	We study Hardy-type inequalities \ [ \int_ { \rp } M ( \omega ( x ) |u ( x ) | ) { \rm exp } ( -\vp ( x ) ) dx \le C\int_ { \rp } M ( |u ' ( x ) | ) { \rm exp } ( -\vp ( x ) ) dx , \ ] where $ u $ belongs to some dilation invariant set $ { \cal R } $ contained in the space of locally absolutely continuous functions .	We give sufficient conditions the triple $ ( \omega , \vp , M ) $ must satisfy in order to have such inequalities valid for $ u $ from a given set $ { \cal R } $ .	The set $ { \cal R } $ can be smaller than the set of Hardy transforms .	Bounds for constants , retrieving classical Hardy inequalities with best constants , are also given .
1	Such channels are information stable , hence their Shannon capacity exists .	Memoryless channels with synchronization errors as defined by a stochastic channel matrix allowing for symbol insertions and deletions in addition to random errors are considered .	However , computation of the channel capacity is formidable , and only some upper and lower bounds on the capacity ( for some special cases ) exist .	In this short paper , using a simple methodology , we prove that the channel capacity is a convex function of the stochastic channel matrix .	Since the more widely studied model of an independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )
1	We take the field back to the drawing board , with straightforward implementations of both classic and novel structures using only standard , well-known optimizations .	The theory community has proposed several new heap variants in the recent past which have remained largely untested experimentally .	We study the behavior of each structure on a variety of inputs , including artificial workloads , workloads generated by running algorithms on real map data , and workloads from a discrete event simulator used in recent systems networking research .	We provide observations about which characteristics are most correlated to performance .	For example , we find that the L1 cache miss rate appears to be strongly correlated with wallclock time .
2	The development relies heavily on the use of the gauge condition different from the ordinary one .	Recently , Schnabl constructed the analytic solution of the open string tachyon .	Subsequently , the absence of the physical states at the vacuum was proved .	It was shown that the choice of gauge simplifies the analysis drastically .	When we perform the calculation of the amplitudes in Schnabl gauge , we find that the off-shell amplitudes of the Schnabl gauge is still very complicated .
3	We derive the plasma electron temperatures using the line-to-continuum ratios and use them as proxies for the nebular [ O/H ] abundances , because in thermal equilibrium the abundance of the coolants ( O , N , and other heavy elements ) in the ionized gas sets the electron temperature , with high abundances producing low temperatures .	Elemental abundance patterns in the Galactic disk constrain theories of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way .	HII region abundances are the result of billions of years of chemical evolution .	We made radio recombination line and continuum measurements of 21 HII regions located between Galactic azimuth Az = 90-130 degree , a previously unexplored region .	Combining these data with our previous work produces a sample of 90 HII regions with high quality electron temperature determinations .
3	This correlation is hardly explained by early DCBHs that , due to intergalactic absorption , can not contribute to the shortest wavelength bands .	The power spectrum of Near InfraRed Background ( NIRB ) fluctuations measured at 3.6 $ \mu $ m by { \tt Spitzer } shows a clustering excess over the known galaxies signal that has been interpreted in terms of early ( $ z\simgt 13 $ ) , accreting ( direct collapse ) black holes ( DCBH ) or low- $ z $ intrahalo light ( IHL ) .	In addition , these fluctuations correlate with the cosmic X-ray background ( CXB ) measured at ( 0.5-2 ) keV , supporting the black hole explanation .	This scenario has been questioned by the recent detection of a correlation between the two { \tt CIBER } 1.1/1.6 $ \mu $ m bands with the 3.6 $ \mu $ m { \tt Spitzer } one .	Here we show that the new correlation is caused instead by a Diffuse Galactic Light ( DGL ) component arising from Galactic stellar light scattered by dust .
1	Bulk-to boundary propagators for the free vector and spinor fields are presented , whose boundary values correspond to $ \rho $ meson and to the nucleon respectively .	In the framework of the soft-wall model of AdS/QCD we calculated the $ \rho $ meson nucleon coupling constant .	The interaction Lagrangian between these fields is written in the bulk of AdS space and includes magnetic type interactions as well .	Using the AdS/CFT correspondence from the bulk interaction action we derived the $ g_ { \rho NN } $ coupling constant in the boundary QCD .	We found that the soft-wall model result for the $ g_ { \rho NN } $ constant is more close to empirical values than the one obtained in the hard-wall model .
3	We construct the corresponding Hamiltonian constraint operators and show that the singularity is formally resolved .	We consider the loop quantization of the ( diagonal ) Bianchi type IX cosmological model .	We explore different quantization prescriptions that extend the work of Wilson-Ewing and Singh .	In particular , we study two different ways of implementing the so-called inverse triad corrections .	We find the effective equations associated with the different quantization prescriptions , and study the relation with the isotropic $ k $ =1 model that , classically , is contained within the Bianchi IX model .
4	The spectra of wandering times feature the pdf of particle flux in the model and qualitatively reproduce the experimental statistics of transport events .	Two dimensional stochastic time model of scrape-off layer ( SOL ) turbulent transport is studied .	Instability arisen in the system with respect to the stochastic perturbations of both either density or vorticity reveals itself in the strong outward bursts of particle density propagating ballistically across the SOL .	The stability and possible stabilization of the cross- field turbulent system depend very much upon the reciprocal correlation time between density and vorticity fluctuations .	Pdf of the particle flux for the large magnitudes of flux events can be modelled with a simple discrete time toy model of random walks concluding at a boundary .
1	Hand segmentation is a necessary pre-process to estimate hand pose and to recognize hand gesture or object in interaction .	Hand-object interaction is important for many applications such as augmented reality , medical application , and human-robot interaction .	However , current hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction is based on color information which is not robust to objects with skin color , skin pigment difference , and light condition variations .	Therefore , we propose the first hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction using depth map .	This is challenging because of only small depth difference between hand and object during interaction .
1	To test the dust hypothesis we have undertaken deep broad- ( K ' ) and narrow-band ( 5000 km/s , 2.177 micron ) imaging of the field towards the quasar PHL957 , in an attempt to detect H-alpha emission from a known galaxy of redshift z=2.313 .	The lack of success of Lyman-alpha searches for high-redshift ( z & gt ; 2 ) field galaxies may be due to extinction by dust , suggesting that surveys based on lines of longer wavelength , particularly H-alpha , may be more effective .	We cover an area of 4.9 square arcmin ( 0.28 h^ { -2 } Mpc^2 ) to a 4-sigma limiting narrow-band flux f=2.7x10^ { -16 } erg/s/cm^2 , a factor of several deeper than previously published surveys .	We detect the H-alpha+ [ N II ] emission line in this galaxy at the 3.3-sigma level , inferring a star formation rate of 18 h^ { -2 } solar masses per year .	This is a factor only a few times larger than the rate seen in some Sc galaxies today .
1	The purpose of this thesis is to extend the main ideas of classical network information theory to the study of classical-quantum channels .	Network information theory is the study of communication problems involving multiple senders , multiple receivers and intermediate relay stations .	We prove coding theorems for quantum multiple access channels , quantum interference channels , quantum broadcast channels and quantum relay channels .	A quantum model for a communication channel describes more accurately the channel 's ability to transmit information .	By using physically faithful models for the channel outputs and the detection procedure , we obtain better communication rates than would be possible using a classical strategy .
4	Interaction effects are more pronounced in i-DWNTs .	We analytically demonstrate helicity determined selection rules for intershell tunneling in double-walled nanotubes with commensurate ( c-DWNTs ) and incommensurate ( i-DWNTs ) shells .	For i-DWNTs the coupling is negligible between lowest energy subbands , but it becomes important as the higher subbands become populated .	In turn the elastic mean free path of i-DWNTs is reduced for increasing energy , with additional suppression at subband onsets .	At low energies , a Luttinger liquid theory for DWNTs with metallic shells is derived .
3	The results are compared to the predictions of Hauser-Feshbach statistical model calculations using the code NON-SMOKER .	The cross sections of the 70Ge ( p , gamma ) 71As and 76Ge ( p , n ) 76As reactions have been measured with the activation method in the Gamow window for the astrophysical p process .	The experiments were carried out at the Van de Graaff and cyclotron accelerators of ATOMKI .	The cross sections have been derived by measuring the decay gamma-radiation of the reaction products .	Good agreement between theoretical and experimental S factors is found .
1	We propose a novel parsimonious modeling framework for the repeatedly observed functional variables that allows to extract low dimensional features .	We consider analysis of dependent functional data that are correlated because of a longitudinal-based design : each subject is observed at repeated time visits and for each visit we record a functional variable .	The proposed methodology accounts for the longitudinal design , is designed for the study of the dynamic behavior of the underlying process , and is computationally fast .	Theoretical properties of this framework are studied and numerical investigation confirms excellent behavior in finite samples .	The proposed method is motivated by and applied to a diffusion tensor imaging study of multiple sclerosis .
0	News is a pertinent source of information on financial risks and stress factors , which nevertheless is challenging to harness due to the sparse and unstructured nature of natural text .	We propose an approach based on distributional semantics and deep learning with neural networks to model and link text to a scarce set of bank distress events .	Through unsupervised training , we learn semantic vector representations of news articles as predictors of distress events .	The predictive model that we learn can signal coinciding stress with an aggregated index at bank or European level , while crucially allowing for automatic extraction of text descriptions of the events , based on passages with high stress levels .	The method offers insight that models based on other types of data can not provide , while offering a general means for interpreting this type of semantic-predictive model .
2	Emergence of dominating mode is investigated to analyze frequency locking by eigenvalue spectrum .	We consider the nonlinear effects in Jahn-Teller system of two coupled resonators interacting simultaneously with flux qubit using Circuit QED .	Two frequency description of Jahn Teller system that inherits the networked structure of both nonlinear Josephson Junctions and harmonic oscillators is employed to describe the synchronous structures in multifrequency scheme .	Rabi Supersplitting is tuned for coupled and uncoupled synchronous con ? gurations in terms of frequency entrainment switched by coupling strength between resonators .	Second order coherence functions are employed to investigate self-sustained oscillations in resonator mode and qubit dephasing .
3	While few-qubit quantum information demonstrations have been performed with such macroscopic systems , a quantum algorithm showing exponential speedup over classical algorithms is yet to be shown .	Quantum computing implementations under consideration today typically deal with systems with microscopic degrees of freedom such as photons , ions , cold atoms , and superconducting circuits .	The quantum information is stored typically in low-dimensional Hilbert spaces such as qubits , as quantum effects are strongest in such systems .	It has however been demonstrated that quantum effects can be observed in mesoscopic and macroscopic systems , such as nanomechanical systems and gas ensembles .	Here we show that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can be implemented with macroscopic ensembles .
1	Decades after their discovery , however , their origin remains controversial .	Regions of the ocean 's thermocline unstable to salt fingering are often observed to host thermohaline staircases , stacks of deep well-mixed convective layers separated by thin stably-stratified interfaces .	In this paper we use 3D direct numerical simulations to shed light on the problem .	We study the evolution of an analogous double-diffusive system , starting from an initial statistically homogeneous fingering state and find that it spontaneously transforms into a layered state .	By analysing our results in the light of the mean-field theory developed in Paper I , a clear picture of the sequence of events resulting in the staircase formation emerges .
1	The problem is addressed from the point of view of both canonical quantum gravity and superstring theory .	In this paper the entropy of an eternal Schwarzschild black hole is studied in the limit of infinite black hole mass .	The entropy per unit area of a free scalar field propagating in a fixed black hole background is shown to be quadratically divergent near the horizon .	It is shown that such quantum corrections to the entropy per unit area are equivalent to the quantum corrections to the gravitational coupling .	Unlike field theory , superstring theory provides a set of identifiable configurations which give rise to the classical contribution to the entropy per unit area .
3	A { \bf 24 } , L363 ( 1991 ) ] , are studied on finite square lattices with open boundaries .	Abelian sandpile models , both deterministic , such as the Bak , Tang , Wiesenfeld ( BTW ) model [ P. Bak , C. Tang and K. Wiesenfeld , Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 59 } , 381 ( 1987 ) ] , and stochastic , such as the Manna model [ S.S .	Manna , J. Phys .	The avalanche size distribution $ P_L ( n ) $ is calculated for a range of system sizes , $ L $ .
1	$ d $ -dimensional random vectors when the number of points in the cloud tends to infinity .	We study the asymptotic behavior of the diameter or maximum interpoint distance of a cloud of i.i.d .	This is a non standard extreme value problem since the diameter is a max- $ U $ -statistic , hence a maximum of dependent random variables .	Therefore , the limiting distributions may not be extreme value distributions .	We obtain exhaustive results for the Euclidean diameter of a cloud of elliptical vectors whose Euclidean norm is in the domain of attraction for the maximum of the Gumbel distribution .
3	Then the number k of neighbors will fluctuate according to a Poisson distribution .	Scale-free networks are a recently developed approach to model the interactions found in complex natural and man-made systems .	Such networks exhibit a power-law distribution of node link ( degree ) frequencies n ( k ) in which a small number of highly connected nodes predominate over a much greater number of sparsely connected ones .	In contrast , in an Erdos-Renyi network each of N sites is connected to every site with a low probability p ( of the orde r of 1/N ) .	One can instead assume that each site selects exactly k neighbors among the other sites .
2	The combined spectrum obtained by adding up the two spectra allows a measurement of the excess at the level of ~ 4.8 sigma at energies above 20 keV .	We report the hard X-ray spectrum of the Coma cluster obtained using the PDS data of two independent BeppoSAX observations performed with a time interval of about three years .	In both the spectra a non thermal excess with respect to the thermal emission is present at a confidence level of ~ 3.4 sigma .	The analysis of the full BeppoSAX data set provides a revised non-thermal X-ray flux which is slightly lower than that previously estimated ( Fusco-Femiano et al .	1999 ) and in agreement with that measured by two RXTE observations .
0	The aim of this short paper is to motivate and encourage research in the field of Active Galactic Nuclei ( AGN ) .	Here we summarize the main open questions concerning the central engine .	Is the central black hole rapidly spinning and can we prove this ?	What is the dominant accretion mechanism in AGN ?	Why do some AGN form jets while others do n't and how do the jets originate ?
3	On basis of the conclusion , the zero-field splitting D for the NV center and the corresponding temperature could be determined .	We presented a high-sensitivity temperature detection using an implanted single Nitrogen-Vacancy center array in diamond .	The high-order Thermal Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill ( TCPMG ) method was performed on the implanted single nitrogen vacancy ( NV ) center in diamond in a static magnetic field .	We demonstrated that under small detunings for the two driving microwave frequencies , the oscillation frequency of the induced fluorescence of the NV center equals approximately to the average of the detunings of the two driving fields .	The experiment showed that the coherence time for the high-order TCPMG was effectively extended , particularly up to 108 { \mu } s for TCPMG-8 , about 14 times of the value 7.7 { \mu } s for thermal Ramsey method .
4	K-band spectroscopy of the brighter knots is used to supply radial velocities , estimate extinction , excitation temperature , and H $ _2 $ column densities towards these knots.Results .	Context .	To investigate the dynamical properties of protostellar jets.Aims .	Determine the proper motion of protostellar jets around Class 0 and Class I sources in an active star forming region in Serpens.Methods .	Multi-epoch deep images in the 2.122 $ \mu $ m line of molecular hydrogen , v=1-0 S ( 1 ) , obtained with the near-infrared instrument NOTCam over a time-scale of 10 years , are used to determine proper motion of knots and jets .
4	Forcing the planet to still larger eccentricities causes catastrophic eccentricity damping as the planet collides into gap walls .	Numerical hydrodynamics calculations are performed to determine conditions under which giant planet eccentricities can be excited by parent gas disks .	Unlike in other studies , Jupiter-mass planets are found to have their eccentricities amplified -- - provided their orbits start eccentric .	We disentangle the web of co-rotation , co-orbital , and external resonances to show that this finite-amplitude instability is consistent with that predicted analytically .	Ellipticities can grow until they reach of order the disk 's aspect ratio , beyond which the external Lindblad resonances that excite eccentricity are weakened by the planet 's increasingly supersonic epicyclic motion .
3	The vacuum force on the piston by a scalar field satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions is attractive in these geometries , but the strength and short-distance behavior of the force depends crucially on the shape of the piston casing .	The Casimir force due to a scalar field on a piston in a cylinder of radius $ r $ with a spherical cap of radius $ R & gt ; r $ is computed numerically in the world-line approach .	A geometrical subtraction scheme gives the finite interaction energy that determines the Casimir force .	The spectral function of convex domains is obtained from a probability measure on convex surfaces that is induced by the Wiener measure on Brownian bridges the convex surfaces are the hulls of .	For a cylindrical casing with a hemispherical head , the force for $ a/R\sim 0 $ does not depend on the dimension of the casing and numerically approaches $ \sim - 0.00326 ( 4 ) \hbar c/a^2 $ .
1	Its generalization to weighted trees , a.k.a .	The classical , ubiquitous , predecessor problem is to construct a data structure for a set of integers that supports fast predecessor queries .	the weighted ancestor problem , has been extensively explored and successfully reduced to the predecessor problem .	It is known that any solution for both problems with an input set from a polynomially bounded universe that preprocesses a weighted tree in O ( n polylog ( n ) ) space requires \Omega ( loglogn ) query time .	Perhaps the most important and frequent application of the weighted ancestors problem is for suffix trees .
0	A new higher-order accurate method is proposed that combines the advantages of the classical $ p $ -version of the FEM on body-fitted meshes with embedded domain methods .	A background mesh composed by higher-order Lagrange elements is used .	Boundaries and interfaces are described implicitly by the level set method and are within elements .	In the elements cut by the boundaries or interfaces , an automatic decomposition into higher-order accurate sub-elements is realized .	Therefore , the zero level sets are detected and meshed in a first step which is called reconstruction .
3	In particular , the recovery of $ \sigma_ { re } $ is faster than $ \sigma_ { im } $ , and the recovery of $ \sigma_ { im } $ decreases with increasing frequency .	We have measured the picosecond conductivity dynamics in Y1-xPrxBa2Cu3O7 thin films from 0.3-2.0 terahertz .	Our experimental technique measures the complex conductivity $ \sigma_ { re } ( \omega $ ) + i $ \sigma_ { im } ( \omega $ ) permitting the simultaneous observation of superconducting pair and quasiparticle dynamics .	We emphasize aspects of the conductivity dynamics which extend our previous results .	This suggests another carrier relaxation pathway , in addition to superconducting pair recovery , following optical excitation .
0	Modern GPUs support special protocols to exchange data directly across the PCI Express bus .	While these protocols could be used to reduce GPU data transmission times , basically by avoiding staging to host memory , they require specific hardware features which are not available on current generation network adapters .	In this paper we describe the architectural modifications required to implement peer-to-peer access to NVIDIA Fermi- and Kepler-class GPUs on an FPGA-based cluster interconnect .	Besides , the current software implementation , which integrates this feature by minimally extending the RDMA programming model , is discussed , as well as some issues raised while employing it in a higher level API like MPI .	Finally , the current limits of the technique are studied by analyzing the performance improvements on low-level benchmarks and on two GPU-accelerated applications , showing when and how they seem to benefit from the GPU peer-to-peer method .
4	We show in particular that the classes are not a trivial subset ( or superset ) of those of existing schemes , thus highlighting the novelty of the proposed solution .	Secure transmission between two agents , Alice and Bob , over block fading channels can be achieved similarly to conventional hybrid automatic repeat request ( HARQ ) by letting Alice transmit multiple blocks , each containing an encoded version of the secret message , until Bob informs Alice about successful decoding by a public error-free return channel .	In existing literature each block is a differently punctured version of a single codeword generated with a Wyner code that uses a common randomness for all blocks .	In this paper instead we propose a more general approach where multiple codewords are generated from independent randomnesses .	The class of channels for which decodability and secrecy is ensured is characterized , with derivations for the existence of secret codes .
0	We present results from a harmonic decomposition of two-particle azimuthal correlations measured with the STAR detector in Au+Au collisions for energies ranging from $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } =7.7 $ GeV to 200 GeV .	The third harmonic $ v_3^2\ { 2\ } =\langle \cos3 ( \phi_1-\phi_2 ) \rangle $ , where $ \phi_1-\phi_2 $ is the angular difference in azimuth , is studied as a function of the pseudorapidity difference between particle pairs $ \Delta\eta = \eta_1-\eta_2 $ .	Non-zero { \vthree } is directly related to the previously observed large- $ \Delta\eta $ narrow- $ \Delta\phi $ ridge correlations and has been shown in models to be sensitive to the existence of a low viscosity Quark Gluon Plasma ( QGP ) phase .	For sufficiently central collisions , $ v_3^2\ { 2\ } $ persist down to an energy of 7.7 GeV suggesting that QGP may be created even in these low energy collisions .	In peripheral collisions at these low energies however , $ v_3^2\ { 2\ } $ is consistent with zero .
0	Let R= ( r_1 , ... , r_m ) and C= ( c_1 , ... , c_n ) be positive integer vectors such that r_1 + ... + r_m=c_1 + ... + c_n .	We consider the set Sigma ( R , C ) of non-negative mxn integer matrices ( contingency tables ) with row sums R and column sums C as a finite probability space with the uniform measure .	We prove that a random table D in Sigma ( R , C ) is close with high probability to a particular matrix ( `` typical table '' ) Z defined as follows .	We let g ( x ) = ( x+1 ) ln ( x+1 ) -x ln x for non-negative x and let g ( X ) =sum_ij g ( x_ij ) for a non-negative matrix X= ( x_ij ) .	Then g ( X ) is strictly concave and attains its maximum on the polytope of non-negative mxn matrices X with row sums R and column sums C at a unique point , which we call the typical table Z .
1	The calculated total magnetic moments of these ferromagnets are all integer 2.00 { \mu } B per supercell , which are one of important characters of half-metallic ferromagnets .	Six half-metallic ferromagnets X0.75Y0.25C ( X=Si , Ge , Sn and Y =Ca and Sr ) with zinc-blende structure , resulting from alkaline-earth ( Ca , Sr ) substitution for X , are predicted based on the density functional theory .	Our calculations indicate that X0.75Y0.25C have wide spin gap and potentially have high Curie temperature .	Alkaline-earth doping results in the spin-polarization and half-metallicity of these compounds .	It is confirmed that the p-d exchange coupling is responsible for the ferromagnetism of X0.75Y0.25C except Sn0.75Ca0.25C .
4	By adopting the reference , state-of-the-art values for these , we find rho_0 = 0.43 ( 11 ) ( 10 ) GeV/cm3 , where the quoted uncertainties are respectively due to the uncertainty in the slope of the circular-velocity at the Sun location and the ratio between this radius and the length scale of the stellar exponential thin disk .	We derive the value of the dark matter density at the Sun 's location ( rho_0 ) without globally mass-modeling the Galaxy .	The proposed method relies on the local equation of centrifugal equilibrium and is independent of i ) the shape of the dark matter density profile , ii ) knowledge of the rotation curve from the galaxy center out to the virial radius , and iii ) the uncertainties and the non-uniqueness of the bulge/disk/dark halo mass decomposition .	The result can be obtained in analytic form .	It explicitly includes the dependence on the relevant observational quantities and takes their uncertainties into account .
4	Whether the G^1 is the LKP or not , the G^n tower thus produced can decay to the LKP , and depending on the reheating temperature , may lead to a modification of the relic density .	Models of Universal Extra Dimensions ( UED ) at the TeV scale lead to the presence of Kaluza Klein ( KK ) excitations of the ordinary fermions and bosons of the Standard Model that may be observed at hadron and lepton colliders .	A conserved discrete symmetry , KK-parity , ensures the stability of the lightest KK particle ( LKP ) , which , if neutral , becomes a good dark matter particle .	It has been recently shown that for a certain range of masses of the LKP a relic density consistent with the experimentally observed one may be obtained .	These works , however , ignore the impact of KK graviton production at early times .
3	From this result , we obtain that the Young integral is well defined along such SLE paths with probability one , and hence that SLE admits a path-wise notion of integration .	When studying stochastic processes , it is often fruitful to have an understanding of several different notions of regularity .	One such notion is the optimal H\ '' older exponent obtainable under reparametrization .	In this paper , we show that the chordal SLE_kappa path in the unit disk for kappa less than or equal to 4 can be reparametrized to be H\ '' older continuous of any order up to 1/ ( 1+kappa/8 ) .	This allows for us to consider the expected signature of SLE , as defined in rough path theory , and to give a precise formula for its first three gradings .
1	The mainstream approach would be to learn an overcomplete dictionary to provide good approximations of the training samples using sparse synthesis coefficients .	We consider the problem of learning a low-dimensional signal model from a collection of training samples .	This famous sparse model has a less well known counterpart , in analysis form , called the cosparse analysis model .	In this new model , signals are characterised by their parsimony in a transformed domain using an overcomplete ( linear ) analysis operator .	We propose to learn an analysis operator from a training corpus using a constrained optimisation framework based on L1 optimisation .
4	We illustrate this approach with the example of Ni $ _ { 13 } $ Ag $ _ { 38 } $ clusters adsorbed on the Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 $ \times $ 7 ) surface , which , having two distinctive halves to the unit cell , acts as a selective template for cluster deposition .	Molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations have been used to demonstrate the possibility of preserving high spin states of the magnetic cores within Ni-based core-shell bimetallic nanoalloys over a wide range of temperatures .	We show that , unlike the case of Ni-Al clusters , Ni-Ag clusters preserve high spin states ( up to 8 $ \mu_ { \mathrm { B } } $ in case of Ni $ _ { 13 } $ Ag $ _ { 32 } $ cluster ) due to small hybridization between the electronic levels of two species .	Intriguingly , such clusters are also able to maintain geometrical and electronic integrity of their cores at temperatures up to 1000 K ( e.g.for Ni $ _ { 7 } $ Ag $ _ { 27 } $ cluster ) .	Furthermore , we also show the possibility of creating ordered arrays of such magnetic clusters on a suitable support by soft-landing pre-formed clusters on the surface , without introducing much disturbance in geometrical and electronic structure of the cluster .
3	It is shown , that at resonance , the amplitude of one , or of several , components of the motion on the surface can be amplified with respect to the situation in which the surface impedance is either constant or vanishes .	When a flat stress-free surface ( i.e. , the ground in seismological applications ) separating air from a isotropic , homogeneous or horizontally-layered , solid substratum is solicited by a SH plane body wave incident in the substratum , the response in the substratum is a single specularly-reflected body wave .	When the stress-free condition , equivalent to vanishing surface impedance , is relaxed by the introduction of a { spatially- constant , non- vanishing surface impedance } , the response in the substratum is again a single reflected body wave whose amplitude is less than the one in the situation of a stress-free ground .	When the stress-free condition is relaxed by the introduction of a a { spatially-modulated surface impedance } , which simulates the action of an uneven ( i.e. , not entirely-flat ) ground , the frequency-domain response takes the form of a spectrum of { plane body waves } and { surface waves } and { resonances } are produced at the frequencies of which one or several surface wave amplitudes can become large .	Also , when the solicitation is pulse-like , the integrated time history of the square of surface displacement and of the square of velocity can be larger , and the duration of the signal can be considerably longer , for a spatially-modulated impedance surface than for a constant , or vanishing , impedance surface .
4	We perform a sensitivity analysis of the relevant anomalous quartic gauge couplings presenting their expected limits .	The absence of a light Higgs boson causes vector boson couplings to become strong at 1 TeV .	A general framework for a systematic and consistent treatment is provided by effective theories of electroweak symmetry breaking .	Already in next-to-leading order there appear quartic gauge couplings that go beyond the standard model and are hence called anomalous .	We investigate intermediate three gauge boson states $ W^+W^- Z $ and $ ZZZ $ occurring in six quark production in electron positron collisions under the conditions of the International Linear Collider .
1	Our work is motivated by applications that analyze low-dimensional spatial datasets captured by high resolution sensors , such as image datasets obtained from whole slide tissue specimens using microscopy image scanners .	We investigate and characterize the performance of an important class of operations on GPUs and Many Integrated Core ( MIC ) architectures .	We identify the data access and computation patterns of operations in object segmentation and feature computation categories .	We systematically implement and evaluate the performance of these core operations on modern CPUs , GPUs , and MIC systems for a microscopy image analysis application .	Our results show that ( 1 ) the data access pattern and parallelization strategy employed by the operations strongly affect their performance .
3	For this , we first prove that propagation of chaos holds by establishing the uniqueness of a new BBGKY hierarchy .	A new non-conservative stochastic reaction-diffusion system in which two families of random walks in two adjacent domains interact near the interface is introduced and studied in this paper .	Such a system can be used to model the transport of positive and negative charges in a solar cell or the population dynamics of two segregated species under competition .	We show that in the macroscopic limit , the particle densities converge to the solution of a coupled nonlinear heat equations .	A local central limit theorem for reflected diffusions in bounded Lipschitz domains is also established as a crucial tool .
4	Surprisingly , we found that the DDC is seen also in all observed wels , as well as in other PNe with central stars being neither [ WC ] nor wels .	We investigate the dual-dust chemistry ( DDC ) phenomenon in PNe and discuss reasons for its occurrence , by analyzing Spitzer/IRS spectra of a sample of 40 Galactic PNe among which 26 belong to the Galactic Bulge ( GB ) .	The mixed chemistry is derived from the simultaneous detection of PAH features in the 6-14 micron range and crystalline silicates ( CS ) beyond 20 microns in the Spitzer/IRS spectra .	Out of the 26 PNe observed in the GB , 21 show signatures of DDC .	Our observations reveal that the simultaneous presence of O- and C-rich dust features in the IR spectra of [ WC ] -type PNe is not restricted to late/cool [ WC ] -type stars , as previously suggested in the literature , but is a common feature associated with all [ WC ] -type PNe .
0	Three-dimensional topological insulators represent a new quantum phase of matter with spin-polarized surface states that are protected from backscattering .	The static electronic properties of these surface states have been comprehensively imaged by both photoemission and tunneling spectroscopies .	Theorists have proposed that topological surface states can also exhibit novel electronic responses to light , such as topological quantum phase transitions and spin-polarized electrical currents .	However , the effects of optically driving a topological insulator out of equilibrium have remained largely unexplored experimentally , and no photocurrents have been measured .	Here we show that illuminating the topological insulator Bi2Se3 with circularly polarized light generates a photocurrent that originates from topological helical Dirac fermions , and that reversing the helicity of the light reverses the direction of the photocurrent .
4	This fact allows us to apply QISM to generate the spectrum of quantum DNLS Hamiltonian for the full range of its coupling constant .	By using a variant of quantum inverse scattering method ( QISM ) which is directly applicable to field theoretical systems , we derive all possible commutation relations among the operator valued elements of the monodromy matrix associated with an integrable derivative nonlinear Schrodinger ( DNLS ) model .	From these commutation relations we obtain the exact Bethe eigenstates for the quantum conserved quantities of DNLS model .	We also explicitly construct the first few quantum conserved quantities including the Hamiltonian in terms of the basic field operators of this model .	It turns out that this quantum Hamiltonian has a new kind of coupling constant which is quite different from the classical one .
4	Further , we have established that modes A and B are associated with two orthogonal modes of polarisation , respectively .	The well known drifter PSR B0031-07 is known to exhibit drifting subpulses where the spacing between the drift bands ( P_3 ) shows three distinct modes A , B and C corresponding to 12 , 6 and 4 seconds respectively .	We have investigated periodicities and polarisation properties of PSR B0031-07 for a sequence of 2700 single pulses taken simultaneously at 328 MHz and 4.85 GHz .	We found that mode A occurs simultaneously at these frequencies , while modes B and C only occur at 328 MHz .	However , when the pulsar is emitting in mode B at the lower frequency there is still emission at the higher frequency , hinting towards the presence of mode B emission at a weaker level .
0	Pairing correlations and their influence on nuclear properties has been studied within BCS model .	Using this theoretical model with inclusion of pairing interaction between nucleons , nuclear level density and entropy of Pd ( 105,106,107 ) have been extracted .	The results well coincide with the empirical values of the nuclear level densities obtained by Oslo group .	Then the entropy excess of Pd107 and Pd105 compared to Pd106 as a function of the temperature has been studied .	Also the role of neutron and proton system in entropy excess have been investigated by the using of the entropy excess ratio proposed by Razavi et al .
0	Using the random intensity of noise ( RIN ) approach to the one-dimensional Laval-Dubrulle-Nazarenko type model for the Lagrangian acceleration in developed turbulence [ cond-mat/0305186 , cond-mat/0305459 ] we study the probability density function and mean acceleration conditional on velocity fluctuations .	The additive noise intensity and the cross correlation between the additive and multiplicative noises are assumed to be dependent on velocity fluctuations in an exponential way .	The obtained fit results are found to be in a good qualitative agreement with the recent experimental data on the conditional acceleration statistics by Mordant , Crawford , and Bodenschatz .	The fit to the observed conditional mean acceleration is of pure illustrative character which is performed to study influence of variation of the cross correlation parameter on the shape of conditional acceleration distribution and conditional acceleration variance .	The conditional mean acceleration should be zero for homogeneous isotropic turbulence .
2	It will confirm , or reject , predictions of a number of particle physics models by increasing the sensitivity of the search for decaying DM by about two orders of magnitude through a wide-field imaging X-ray spectrometer in combination with a dedicated observation program .	We propose an X-ray mission called Xenia to search for decaying superweakly interacting Dark Matter particles ( super-WIMP ) with a mass in the keV range .	The mission and its observation plan are capable of providing a major break through in our understanding of the nature of Dark Matter ( DM ) .	The proposed mission will provide unique limits on the mixing angle and mass of neutral leptons , right handed partners of neutrinos , which are important Dark Matter candidates .	The existence of these particles is strongly motivated by observed neutrino flavor oscillations and the problem of baryon asymmetry of the Universe .
3	It is reasonable to expect that states which are more mixed are less distinguishable than those which are less mixed .	The theory of monotone Riemannian metrics on the state space of a quantum system was established by Denes Petz in 1996 .	In a recent paper he argued that the scalar curvature of a statistically relevant - monotone - metric can be interpreted as an average statistical uncertainty .	The present paper contributes to this subject .	The manifestation of this behavior could be that for such a metric the scalar curvature has a maximum at the maximally mixed state .
0	We perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( SPH ) simulations for merging binary carbon-oxygen ( CO ) white dwarfs ( WDs ) with masses of $ 1.1 $ and $ 1.0 $ $ M_\odot $ , until the merger remnant reaches a dynamically steady state .	Using these results , we assess whether the binary could induce a thermonuclear explosion , and whether the explosion could be observed as a type Ia supernova ( SN Ia ) .	We investigate three explosion mechanisms : a helium-ignition following the dynamical merger ( `helium-ignited violent merger model ' ) , a carbon-ignition ( `carbon-ignited violent merger model ' ) , and an explosion following the formation of the Chandrasekhar mass WD ( `Chandrasekhar mass model ' ) .	An explosion of the helium-ignited violent merger model is possible , while we predict that the resulting SN ejecta are highly asymmetric since its companion star is fully intact at the time of the explosion .	The carbon-ignited violent merger model can also lead to an explosion .
3	The quantum mechanical time evolution of the system is rephrased in terms of a closed set of linear first-order differential equations coupling ( 2s+1 ) ^2 expectation values .	Each scheme of state reconstruction comes down to parametrize the state of a quantum system by expectation values or probabilities directly measurable in an experiment .	It is argued that the time evolution of these quantities provides an unambiguous description of the quantal dynamics .	This is shown explicitly for a single spin s , using a quorum of expectation values which contains no redundant information .	This `realization ' of the dynamical law refers neither to the wavefunction of the system nor to its statistical operator .
2	The results are combined with those from previous OPAL chargino and neutralino searches at lower energies to obtain limits .	A search for charginos and neutralinos , predicted by supersymmetric theories , has been performed using a data sample of 10.3 pb^-1 at centre-of-mass energies of sqrt ( s ) = 170 and 172 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP .	No evidence for these particles has been found .	Exclusion regions at 95 % C.L .	of parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model are determined .
2	We also give a one-parameter family of infinitely many hyperbolic knots in $ S^3 $ each of which is detected by its knot Floer homology and $ A $ -polynomial .	We say that a given knot $ J\subset S^3 $ is detected by its knot Floer homology and $ A $ -polynomial if whenever a knot $ K\subset S^3 $ has the same knot Floer homology and the same $ A $ -polynomial as $ J $ , then $ K=J $ .	In this paper we show that every torus knot $ T ( p , q ) $ is detected by its knot Floer homology and $ A $ -polynomial .	In addition we give a cabling formula for the A-polynomials of cabled knots in $ S^3 $ , which is of independent interest .	In particular we give explicitly the A-polynomials of iterated torus knots .
3	For the case of an antiferromagnetic layer on a topological insulator substrate , we show that a second-order quantum phase transition occurs at the interface , and compute the corresponding critical exponents .	We consider a theory for a two-dimensional interacting conduction electron system with strong spin-orbit coupling on the interface between a topological insulator and the magnetic ( ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ) layer .	For the ferromagnetic case we derive the Landau-Lifshitz equation , which features a contribution proportional to a fluctuation-induced electric field obtained by computing the topological ( Chern-Simons ) contribution from the vacuum polarization .	We also show that fermionic quantum fluctuations reduce the critical temperature $ \tilde T_c $ at the interface relative to the critical temperature $ T_c $ of the bulk , so that in the interval $ \tilde T_c\leq T & lt ; T_c $ is possible to have coexistence of gapless Dirac fermions at the interface with a ferromagnetically ordered layer .	In particular , we show that the electrons at the interface acquire an anomalous dimension at criticality .
4	These quantities are believed to be extremely sensitive to the underlying phase and are thus well suited for finite-size studies .	Ground- and excited-state quantum fidelities in combination with generalized quantum fidelity susceptibilites , obtained from exact diagonalizations , are used to explore the phase diagram of the anisotropic next-nearest-neighbour triangular Heisenberg model .	Specifically , the $ J'-J_2 $ plane of this model , which connects the $ J_1-J_2 $ chain and the anisotropic triangular lattice Heisenberg model , is explored using these quantities .	Through the use of a quantum fidelity associated with the first excited-state , in addition to the conventional ground-state fidelity , the BKT-type transition and Majumdar-Ghosh point of the $ J_1-J_2 $ chain ( $ J'=0 $ ) are found to extend into the $ J'-J_2 $ plane and connect with points on the $ J_2=0 $ axis thereby forming bounded regions in the phase diagram .	These bounded regions are then explored through the generalized quantum fidelity susceptibilities $ \chi_ { \rho } $ , $ \chi_ { 120^ { \circ } } $ , $ \chi_D $ and $ \chi_ { CAF } $ which are associated with the spin stiffness , $ 120^ { \circ } $ spiral order parameter , dimer order parameter and collinear antiferromagnetic order parameter respectively .
2	Since the LHC has started operation in 2009 , typical electron cloud phenomena have appeared also in this machine , when running with trains of closely packed bunches ( i.e.with spacings below 150ns ) .	Several indicators have pointed to the presence of an Electron Cloud ( EC ) in some of the CERN accelerators , when operating with closely spaced bunched beams .	In particular , spurious signals on the pick ups used for beam detection , pressure rise and beam instabilities were observed at the Proton Synchrotron ( PS ) during the last stage of preparation of the beams for the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , as well as at the Super Proton Synchrotron ( SPS ) .	Beside the above mentioned indicators , other typical signatures were seen in this machine ( due to its operation mode and/or more refined detection possibilities ) , like heat load in the cold dipoles , bunch dependent emittance growth and degraded lifetime in store and bunch-by-bunch stable phase shift to compensate for the energy loss due to the electron cloud .	An overview of the electron cloud status in the different CERN machines ( PS , SPS , LHC ) will be presented in this paper , with a special emphasis on the dangers for future operation with more intense beams and the necessary countermeasures to mitigate or suppress the effect .
4	There is an obvious exponential ( in the number of vertices ) time algorithm for deciding Markov equivalence of two directed cyclic graphs ; simply chech all of the d-separation relations in each graph .	Although the concept of d-separation was originally defined for directed acyclic graphs ( see Pearl 1988 ) , there is a natural extension of he concept to directed cyclic graphs .	When exactly the same set of d-separation relations hold in two directed graphs , no matter whether respectively cyclic or acyclic , we say that they are Markov equivalent .	In other words , when two directed cyclic graphs are Markov equivalent , the set of distributions that satisfy a natural extension of the Global Directed Markov condition ( Lauritzen et al .	1990 ) is exactly the same for each graph .
1	One of the key aspects of the detection process is the deployment of a set of templates , also called a template bank , to cover the astrophysically interesting region of the parameter space .	Matched filtering is used to search for gravitational waves emitted by inspiralling compact binaries in data from ground-based interferometers .	In a companion paper , we described the template-bank algorithm used in the analysis of LIGO data to search for signals from non-spinning binaries made of neutron star and/or stellar-mass black holes ; this template bank is based upon physical template families .	In this paper , we describe the phenomenological template bank that was used to search for gravitational waves from non-spinning black hole binaries ( from stellar mass formation ) in the second , third and fourth LIGO science runs .	We briefly explain the design of the bank , whose templates are based on a phenomenological detection template family .
0	We present a detailed study of the effects of L\'evy $ \alpha $ -stable disorder distributions on the optical and localization properties of excitonic systems .	These distributions are a generalization of commonly studied Gaussian randomness ( $ \alpha = 2 $ ) .	However , the more general case ( $ \alpha & lt ; 2 $ ) includes also heavy-tailed behavior with a divergent second moment .	These types of distributions give rise to novel effects , such as exchange broadening of the absorption spectra and anomalous localization of the excitonic states , which has been found in various excitonic systems .	We provide a thorough examination of the localization behavior and the absorption spectra of excitons in chains with L\'evy $ \alpha $ -stable diagonal disorder .
0	The renormalization group method of Goldenfeld , Oono and their collaborators is applied to asymptotic analysis of vector fields .	The method is formulated on the basis of the theory of envelopes , as was done for scalar fields .	This formulation actually completes the discussion of the previous work for scalar equations .	It is shown in a generic way that the method applied to equations with a bifurcation leads to the Landau-Stuart and the ( time-dependent ) Ginzburg-Landau equations .	It is confirmed that this method is actually a powerful theory for the reduction of the dynamics as the reductive perturbation method is .
0	A relativistic quark model is extended to incorporate chiral and gauge symmetries .	We obtain the DD*pi and DD*gamma couplings and find that the ratio Gamma ( D*0- & gt ; D0pi0 ) /Gamma ( D*0- & gt ; D0gamma ) constrains the charm-quark mass close to 1.45 GeV .	Large 1/mc corrections appear in the heavy-quark contribution to the DD*gamma coupling .	The model is extended further to describe seven excited D meson states .	We find that semileptonic B decays into the ground and excited D meson states do not account for the total semileptonic decay width of the B0 .
4	Compared with magnetic field spatial distribution , electric field shows some different features in relativistic heavy-ion collisions .	It was proposed that the electric fields may lead to chiral separation in QGP , which is called the chiral electric separation effect .	The strong electromagnetic field and the QCD vacuum can both completely be produced in the off-central nuclear-nuclear collision .	We used the Wood-Saxon nucleon distribution to calculate the electric field distributions of the off-central collisions .	The chiral electro field spatial distribution at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider ( RHIC ) and Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) energy regions are systematically studied in this paper .
1	In particular , several complex phenomena have been directly observed : interactions between cluster galaxies and the Intra Cluster Medium ( ICM ) , cold fronts in the ICM , hot bubbles due to relativistic jets from radio loud AGN , the lack of cold gas in `` cool-cores '' , and non-thermal X-ray emission .	In the last eight years , the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites changed significantly our view of X-ray clusters of galaxies .	Still , this increasing complexity does not prevent us from using X-ray clusters as a tool to constrain cosmological parameters .	In addition , observations of clusters up to redshift ~1.3 allowed us to trace the thermodynamical and chemical evolution of the ICM on a time interval as large as 8 Gyr .	In this presentation , I will give a personal introduction to the most debated topics in this field , to end with some prospects for the next-generation X-ray satellites .
3	The scaling functions are related to the continuum renormalization-group functions .	We study the crossover between classical and nonclassical critical behaviors .	The critical crossover limit is driven by the Ginzburg number G. The corresponding scaling functions are universal with respect to any possible microscopic mechanism which can vary G , such as changing the range or the strength of the interactions .	The critical crossover describes the unique flow from the unstable Gaussian to the stable nonclassical fixed point .	We show these features explicitly in the large-N limit of the O ( N ) phi^4 model .
3	Significant differences are found .	In the local density approximation ( LDA ) for electronic time-dependent current-density functional theory ( TDCDFT ) many-body effects are described in terms of the visco-elastic constants of the homogeneous three-dimensional electron gas .	In this paper we critically examine the applicability of the three-dimensional LDA to the calculation of the viscous damping of 1-dimensional collective oscillations of angular frequency $ \omega $ in a quasi 2-dimensional quantum well .	We calculate the effective viscosity $ \zeta ( \omega ) $ from perturbation theory in the screened Coulomb interaction and compare it with the commonly used three-dimensional LDA viscosity $ Y ( \omega ) $ .	At low frequency $ Y ( \omega ) $ is dominated by a shear term , which is absent in $ \zeta ( \omega ) $ .
0	Pattern-Based Constraint Satisfaction and Logic Puzzles develops a pure logic , pattern-based perspective of solving the finite Constraint Satisfaction Problem ( CSP ) , with emphasis on finding the `` simplest '' solution .	Different ways of reasoning with the constraints are formalised by various families of `` resolution rules '' , each of them carrying its own notion of simplicity .	A large part of the book illustrates the power of the approach by applying it to various popular logic puzzles .	It provides a unified view of how to model and solve them , even though they involve very different types of constraints : obvious symmetric ones in Sudoku , non-symmetric but transitive ones ( inequalities ) in Futoshiki , topological and geometric ones in Map colouring , Numbrix and Hidato , and even much more complex non-binary arithmetic ones in Kakuro ( or Cross Sums ) .	It also shows that the most familiar techniques for these puzzles can indeed be understood as mere application-specific presentations of the general rules .
1	These inequalities imply that the natural projection from a reduced free product onto the subspace generated by the words of a fixed length $ d $ is completely bounded with norm depending linearly on $ d $ .	We prove Khintchine type inequalities for words of a fixed length in a reduced free product of $ C^* $ -algebras ( or von Neumann algebras ) .	We then apply these results to various approximation properties on reduced free products .	As a first application , we give a quick proof of Dykema 's theorem on the stability of exactness under the reduced free product for $ C^* $ -algebras .	We next study the stability of the completely contractive approximation property ( CCAP ) under reduced free product .
3	The present study achieves laser trapping on a single DNA molecule under a `good ' solvent condition without any microbeads .	During the last decade , the laser trapping technique has been actively applied to elucidate the property of macromolecules , DNA , RNA , cytoskeleton fibres , etc .	Due to the inherent difficulty in the direct trapping of single molecules at approximately 300 K , most of the current studies on laser trapping utilize the experimental technique to grasp microbeads that are attached to a single macromolecule , instead of using direct trapping .	A few studies have demonstrated the applicability of laser trapping for highly packed compact DNA under a `poor ' solvent condition without any beads .	The time-dependent change of the conformation accompanied by ON/OFF laser irradiation was measured and analysed in terms of the entrapment and release of a coiled polymer around a micrometer-sized potential .
0	We use Kepler short cadence light curves to constrain the oblateness of planet candidates in the Kepler sample .	The transits of rapidly rotating planets that are deformed in shape will lead to distortions in the ingress and egress of their light curves .	We report the first tentative detection of an oblate planet outside of the solar system , measuring an oblateness of $ 0.22 \pm 0.11 $ for the 18 $ M_J $ mass brown dwarf Kepler 39b ( KOI-423.01 ) .	We also provide constraints on the oblateness of the planets ( candidates ) HAT-P-7b , KOI-686.01 , and KOI-197.01 to be & lt ; 0.067 , & lt ; 0.251 , and & lt ; 0.186 , respectively .	Using the Q'-values from Jupiter and Saturn , we expect tidal synchronization for the spins of HAT-P-7b , KOI-686.01 and KOI-197.01 , and for their rotational oblateness signatures to be undetectable in the current data .
1	We apply this method to the case of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field with fixed $ z $ -component of the angular momentum .	We give a method to compute the smooth part of the density of states in a semi-classical expansion , when the Hamiltonian contains a Coulomb potential and non-cartesian coordinates are appropriate .	This is then compared with numerical results obtained by a high precision finite element approach .	The agreement is excellent especially in the \emph { chaotic } region of the spectrum .	The need to go beyond the Thomas-Fermi model is clearly established .
1	In this paper , we present CENet , a new method for estimating the slope vector and simultaneously performing variable selection in the high-dimensional sparse linear transformation model .	In a linear transformation model , there exists an unknown monotone nonlinear transformation function such that the transformed response variable and the predictor variables satisfy a linear regression model .	CENet is the solution to a convex optimization problem and can be computed efficiently from an algorithm with guaranteed convergence to the global optimum .	We show that under a pairwise elliptical distribution assumption on each predictor-transformed-response pair and some regularity conditions , CENet attains the same optimal rate of convergence as the best regression method in the high-dimensional sparse linear regression model .	To the best of our limited knowledge , this is the first such result in the literature .
2	These statistical quantities are simple , easy to calculate from the observed visibility and thus suitable for the early exploration of the EoR with ongoing telescopes such as the Murchison Widefield Array ( MWA ) and LOw Frequency ARray ( LOFAR ) .	Redshifted 21cm-line signal from neutral hydrogens in the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) gives a direct probe of the epoch of reionization ( EoR ) .	In this paper , we investigate the potential of the variance and skewness of the probability distribution function of the 21cm brightness temperature for constraining EoR models .	We show , by performing Fisher analysis , that the variance and skewness at $ z=7-9 $ are complementary to each other to constrain the EoR model parameters such as the minimum virial temperature of halos which host luminous objects , ionizing efficiency and mean free path of ionizing photons in the IGM .	Quantitatively , the constraining power highly depends on the quality of the foreground subtraction and calibration .
3	The twin paradox is naturally explained as an instantaneous reconfiguration of particle position 4-vectors in the frame of the accelerated object .	To clarify some aspects of the application of Special Relativity , spacetime is sliced into null geodesic hypersurfaces as an alternative to the hypersurfaces of simultaneity normally adopted .	Events at particle locations on the hypersurface are identified as the causal event set .	It is demonstrated that a Lorentz boost applied to the causal event set maintains the property of connectedness and with this formalism it is simple to derive the redshift equation .	The metaphysical implications are examined with the tentative conclusion that a relationist view of spacetime is more consistent with this treatment than the substantivalist viewpoint .
0	In this paper the heat signaling in microtubules ( MT ) is investigated .	It is argued that for the description of the heat signaling phenomena in MT , the hyperbolic heat transport ( HHT ) equation must be used .	It is shown that HHT is the Klein-Gordon ( K-G ) equation .	The general solution for the K-G equation for MT is obtained .	For the undistorted signal propagation in MT the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is formulated and discussed .
1	It is shown that the correlation ratio is a good estimator to determine the critical point of the second-order transition using the FSS analysis .	We study the finite-size scaling ( FSS ) property of the correlation ratio , the ratio of the correlation functions with different distances .	The correlation ratio is especially useful for the analysis of the Kosterlitz-Thouless ( KT ) transition .	We also present a generalized scheme of the probability-changing cluster algorithm , which has been recently developed by the present authors , based on the FSS property of the correlation ratio .	We investigate the two-dimensional quantum XY model of spin 1/2 with this generalized scheme , obtaining the precise estimate of the KT transition temperature with less numerical effort .
2	Any such double groupoid characteristically has associated to it `homotopy groups ' , which are defined using only its algebraic structure .	This work contributes to clarifying several relationships between certain higher categorical structures and the homotopy types of their classifying spaces .	Double categories ( Ehresmann , 1963 ) have well-understood geometric realizations , and here we deal with homotopy types represented by double groupoids satisfying a natural `filling condition ' .	Thus arises the notion of `weak equivalence ' between such double groupoids , and a corresponding `homotopy category ' is defined .	Our main result in the paper states that the geometric realization functor induces an equivalence between the homotopy category of double groupoids with filling condition and the category of homotopy 2-types ( that is , the homotopy category of all topological spaces with the property that the $ n^ { \text { th } } $ homotopy group at any base point vanishes for $ n\geq 3 $ ) .
1	This model is constructed from string-like quantum solitons introduced previously , and exploits the well-known relation between string partition functions and scalar field theories in d=3 .	In d=3 SU ( N ) gauge theory , we study a scalar field theory model of center vortices that furnishes an approach to the determination of so-called k-string tensions .	Center vortices corresponding to magnetic flux J ( in units of 2\pi /N ) are composites of J elementary J=1 constituent vortices that come in N-1 types , with repulsion between like constituents and attraction between unlike constituents .	The scalar field theory involves N scalar fields \phi_i ( one of which is eliminated ) that can merge , dissociate , and recombine while conserving flux mod N. The properties of these fields are deduced directly from the corresponding gauge-theory quantum solitons .	Every vacuum Feynman graph of the theory corresponds to a real-space configuration of center vortices .
3	In total 44 metastable phases are presented , of which 11 exhibit direct or quasi-direct band-gaps in the range of $ \approx $ 1.0-1.8 eV , close to the optimal Shockley-Queisser limit of $ \approx $ 1.4 eV , with a stronger overlap of the absorption spectra with the solar spectrum compared to conventional diamond silicon .	Silicon materials play a key role in many technologically relevant fields , ranging from the electronic to the photovoltaic industry .	A systematic search for silicon allotropes was performed by employing a modified ab initio minima hopping crystal structure prediction method .	The algorithm was optimized to specifically investigate the hitherto barely explored low-density regime of the silicon phase diagram by imitating the guest-host concept of clathrate compounds .	Due to the structural resemblance to known clathrate compounds it is expected that the predicted phases can be synthesized .
0	Chern insulators are band insulators which exhibit a gap in the bulk and gapless excitations in the edge .	Detection of Chern insulators is a serious challenge in cold atoms since the Hall transport measurements are technically unrealistic for neutral atoms .	By establishing a natural correspondence between the time-reversal invariant topological insulator and quantum anomalous Hall system , we show for a class of Chern insulators that the topology can be determined by only measuring Bloch eigenstates at highly symmetric points of the Brillouin zone ( BZ ) .	Furthermore , we introduce two experimental schemes including the spin-resolved Bloch oscillation to carry out the measurement .	These schemes are highly feasible under realistic experimental conditions .
0	The dynamics of a random ( quenched ) field Ising model ( in two dimension ) at zero temperature in the presence of an additional sinusoidally oscillating homogeneous ( in space ) magnetic field has been studied by Monte Carlo simulation using the Metropolis single spin flip dynamics .	The instantaneous magnetisation is found to be periodic with the same periodicity of the oscillating magnetic field .	For very low values of amplitude of oscillating field and the width of randomly quenched magnetic field , the magnetisation oscillates asymmetrically about a nonzero value and the oscillation becomes symmetric about a zero value for higher values of amplitude of oscillating field and the width of the quenched disorder .	The time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of the oscillating magnetic field defines the dynamic order parameter .	This dynamic order parameter is nonzero for very low values of amplitude of oscillating magnetic field and the width of randomly quenched field .
0	Stellar bars are important internal drivers of secular evolution in disk galaxies .	Using a sample of nearby spiral galaxies with weak and strong bars , we explore the relationships between the star formation feature and stellar bars in galaxies .	We find that galaxies with weak bars tend to be coincide with low concentrical star formation activity , while those with strong bars show a large scatter in the distribution of star formation activity .	We find enhanced star formation activity in bulges towards stronger bars , although not predominantly , consistent with previous studies .	Our results suggest that different stages of the secular process and many other factors may contribute to the complexity of the secular evolution .
2	This discrepancy can be traced to an overall normalization error in our non-perturbative formula for the energy .	We comment on the relation of our previous work on the classical gluodynamics of high energy nuclear collisions to recent work by Lappi ( hep-ph/0303076 ) .	While our results for the non-perturbative number liberation coefficient agree , those for the energy disagree by a factor of 2 .	When corrected for , all previous results are in excellent agreement with those of Lappi .	The implications of the results of these two independent computations for RHIC phenomenology are noted .
3	Near Tc low field deviations of the MR with respect to a H^2 variation permit us to extract the superconducting fluctuation contribution to the conductivity .	The resistivity , Hall effect and transverse magnetoresistance ( MR ) have been measured in low residual resistivity single crystals of LiFeAs .	A comparison with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation data implies that four carrier bands unevenly contribute to the transport .	However the scattering rates of the carriers all display the T^2 behavior expected for a Fermi liquid .	Though below Tc the anisotropy of superconductivity is rather small , the superconducting fluctuations display a quasi ideal two-dimensional behavior which persists up to 1.4 Tc .
0	We introduce a naturally-defined totally invariant spacetime energy expression for general relativity incorporating the contribution from gravity .	The extension links seamlessly to the action integral for the gravitational field .	The demand that the general expression for arbitrary systems reduces to the Tolman integral in the case of stationary bounded distributions , leads to the matter-localized Ricci integral for energy-momentum in support of the energy localization hypothesis .	The role of the observer is addressed and as an extension of the special relativistic case , the field of observers comoving with the matter is seen to compute the intrinsic global energy of a system .	The new localized energy supports the Bonnor claim that the Szekeres collapsing dust solutions are energy-conserving .
0	The DNA microarray technology has modernized the approach of biology research in such a way that scientists can now measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously in a single experiment .	Gene expression profiles , which represent the state of a cell at a molecular level , have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool .	But compared to the number of genes involved , available training data sets generally have a fairly small sample size for classification .	These training data limitations constitute a challenge to certain classification methodologies .	Feature selection techniques can be used to extract the marker genes which influence the classification accuracy effectively by eliminating the un wanted noisy and redundant genes This paper presents a review of feature selection techniques that have been employed in micro array data based cancer classification and also the predominant role of SVM for cancer classification .
0	A spectrally tunable VCSEL ( vertical cavity surface-emitting laser ) was used as part of sensing hardware for measurements of the radial-integrated gas temperature inside an inductively coupled plasma reactor .	The data were obtained by profiling the Doppler-broadened absorption of metastable Ar atoms at 763.51 nm in argon and argon/nitrogen plasmas ( 3 , 45 , and 90 % N2 in Ar ) at pressure 0.5-70 Pa and inductive power of 100 and 300 W. The results were compared to rotational temperature derived from the N2 emission at the ( 0,0 ) transition of the C - B system .	The differences in integrated rotational and Doppler temperatures were attributed to non-uniform spatial distributions of both temperature and thermometric species ( Ar* and N2* ) that varied depending on conditions .	A two-dimensional , two-temperature fluid plasma simulation was employed to explain these differences .	This work should facilitate further development of a miniature sensor for non-intrusive acquisition of data ( temperature and densities of multiple plasma species ) during micro- and nano-fabrication plasma processing , thus enabling the diagnostic-assisted continuous optimization and advanced control over the processes .
3	The measurement of the absorption , corresponding to the excitation of SPP modes is realized with a new goniometer-based experimental setup for oblique incidence laser beam scattering at a single wavelength .	This work reports on the experimental investigation of surface plasmon polaritons ( SPP ) on cylindrical wires of small diameters .	Applying a new technique that was developed by this group and recently reported , single wire and wire array samples of gold ( Au ) and silver ( Ag ) with small diameters 400nm & lt ; D & lt ; 3 mum and high aspect ratios & lt ; = 75000 in photonic crystal fibers and single hole capillaries are fabricated .	Additionally , effective bulk metal wires of Au and Ag are created by a hybrid technique , including fiber tapering and magnetron sputter deposition for a large number of different diameters between 13 mum to 50 mum .	A device is developed that allows a simultaneous measurement of the scattering amplitude in s- and p-polarization under varied incident angle .
2	The core level spectrum shows that the 3d $ _ { 5/2 } $ level is split into two components of multiplicity 4 and 2 , respectively due to coupling of the spin states of the hole in 3d $ _ { 5/2 } $ with Pr 4f holes spin state .	Electronic states of PrCoO $ _3 $ are studied using x-ray photoemission spectroscopy .	Pr 3d $ _ { 5/2 } $ core level and valence band ( VB ) were recorded using Mg K $ _\beta $ source .	The observed splitting is 4.5 eV .	The VB spectrum is interpreted using density of states ( DOS ) calculations under LDA and LDA+U .
3	For both BOSS data and mock catalogs , we use the ZOBOV algorithm to identify voids , we stack together all voids with effective radii of 30-100Mpc/h in the redshift range 0.43-0.7 , and we accurately measure the shape of the stacked voids .	We apply the Alcock-Paczynski ( AP ) test to the stacked voids identified using the large-scale structure galaxy catalog from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey ( BOSS ) .	This galaxy catalog is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) Data Release 12 and is the final catalog of SDSS-III .	We also use 1000 mock galaxy catalogs that match the geometry , density , and clustering properties of the BOSS sample in order to characterize the statistical uncertainties of our measurements and take into account systematic errors such as redshift space distortions .	Our tests with the mock catalogs show that we measure the stacked void ellipticity with a statistical precision of 2.6 % .
3	In this work , we use K-band integral field spectroscopy to map the emission line flux distributions and kinematics and investigate the origin of the molecular and ionized gas line emission from inner 1.4x2.4 kpc2 of the LIRG NGC6240 , known to be the galaxy with strongest H2 line emission .	The understating of the origin of the H2 line emission from the central regions of galaxies represent an important key to improve our knowledge about the excitation and ionization conditions of the gas in these locations .	Usually these lines can be produced by Starburts , shocks and/or radiation from an active galactic nucleus ( AGN ) .	Luminous Infrared Galaxies ( LIRG ) represent ideal and challenging objects to investigate the origin of the H2 emission , as all processes above can be observed in a single object .	The emission lines show complex profiles at locations between both nuclei and surrounding the northern nucleus , while at locations near the southern nucleus and at 1 '' west of the northern nucleus , they can be reproduced by a single gaussian component .
3	If we fit the Fe lines with a blend of two Gaussians centered at 6.39 keV and 6.73 keV , the intensity of the 6.7 keV line decreases , while the intensity of the 6.4 keV line increases , within an interval of 3.5 yr .	We present results of new ASCA observations of the low-luminosity AGN ( LLAGN ) NGC 4579 obtained on 1998 December 18 and 28 , and we report on detection of variability of an iron K emission line .	The X-ray luminosities in the 2 -- 10 keV band for the two observations are nearly identical ( LX $ \approx $ 2 $ \times10^ { 41 } $ ergs/s ) , but they are $ \sim $ 35 % larger than that measured in 1995 July by Terashima et al .	An Fe K emission line is detected at $ 6.39\pm0.09 $ keV ( source rest frame ) which is lower than the line energy $ 6.73^ { +0.13 } _ { -0.12 } $ keV in the 1995 observation .	This variability rules out thermal plasmas in the host galaxy as the origin of the ionized Fe line in this LLAGN .
3	We considered the major failures produced between 2002 and 2009 in the European power grid ; analyzed those reliability indicators : ENS , TLP and RT ; fitted six alternative models : Pareto II , Fisk , Lognormal , Pareto , Weibull and Gamma distributions , to the data by maximum likelihood ; compared these models by the Bayesian information criterion ; tested the goodness-of-fit of those models by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test method based on bootstrap resampling ; and validated them graphically by rank-size plots .	Empirical research with electricity transmission networks reliability data shows that the size of major failures - in terms of energy not supplied ( ENS ) , total loss of power ( TLP ) or restoration time ( RT ) - appear to follow a power law behaviour in the upper tail of the distribution .	However , this pattern - also known as Pareto distribution - is not valid in the whole range of those major events .	We aimed to find a probability distribution that we could use to model them , and hypothesized that there is a two-parameter model that fits the pattern of those data well in the entire domain .	We found that Pareto II distribution is , in the case of ENS and TLP , an adequate model to describe major events reliability data of power grids in the whole range , and in the case of RT , is the best choice of the six alternative models analyzed .
0	We use self-consistent numerical simulations of the evolution and disruption of the Sun 's birth cluster in the Milky Way potential to investigate the present-day phase space distribution of the Sun 's siblings .	The simulations include the gravitational N-body forces within the cluster and the effects of stellar evolution on the cluster population .	In addition the gravitational forces due to the Milky Way potential are accounted for in a self-consistent manner .	Our aim is to understand how the astrometric and radial velocity data from the Gaia mission can be used to pre-select solar sibling candidates .	We vary the initial conditions of the Sun 's birth cluster , as well as the parameters of the Galactic potential .
2	A particular focus is given to the anomalous splitting of the sharpest resonance line near the [ 110 ] direction under in-plane magnetic-field rotation , which implies peculiar electronic structure in the hidden order phase .	The observation of cyclotron resonance in ultra-clean crystals of URu2Si2 [ S. Tonegawa et al. , PRL 109 , 036401 ( 2012 ) ] provides another route besides quantum oscillations to the determination of the bulk electronic structure in the hidden order phase .	We report detailed analyses of the resonance lines , which fully resolve the cyclotron mass structure of the main Fermi surface sheets .	The results under the field rotation from [ 110 ] toward [ 001 ] direction reveal that the splitting is a robust feature against field tilting from the basal plane .	This is in sharp contrast to the reported frequency branch alpha in the quantum oscillation experiments showing a three-fold splitting that disappears by a small field tilt , which can be explained by the magnetic breakdown between the large hole sphere and small electron pockets .
2	These ratios unambiguously determine the spectrum index and core temperature .	The burn-up for SC56-1472 sample of the natural Oklo reactor zone 3 was calculated using the modern Monte Carlo codes .	We reconstructed the neutron spectrum in the core by means of the isotope ratios : $ ^ { 147 } $ Sm/ $ ^ { 148 } $ Sm and $ ^ { 176 } $ Lu/ $ ^ { 175 } $ Lu .	The effective neutron absorption cross section of $ ^ { 149 } $ Sm calculated using this spectrum was compared with experimental one .	The disagreement between these two values allows to limit a possible shift of the low laying resonance of $ ^ { 149 } $ Sm even more .
1	When slow particles are sufficiently rare the system has a phase transition .	We study the large space and time scale behavior of a totally asymmetric , nearest-neighbor exclusion process in one dimension with random jump rates attached to the particles .	At low densities there are no equilibrium distributions , and on the hydrodynamic scale the initial profile is transported rigidly .	We elaborate this situation further by finding the correct order of the correction from the hydrodynamic limit , together with distributional bounds averaged over the disorder .	We consider two settings , a macroscopically constant low density profile and the outflow from a large jam .
3	Namely , for almost all participating countries , female students are over-represented in the ERASMUS program when compared to the entire population of tertiary students .	Studying abroad has become very popular among students .	The ERASMUS mobility program is one of the largest international student exchange programs in the world , which has supported already more than three million participants since 1987 .	We analyzed the mobility pattern within this program in 2011-12 and found a gender gap across countries and subject areas .	The same tendency is observed across different subject areas .
4	The second result proves the conjecture for the Torelli locus of hyperelliptic curves .	Oort has conjectured that there do not exist Shimura curves lying generically in the Torelli locus of curves of genus $ g \geq 8 $ .	We show that there do not exist one-dimensional Shimura families of semi-stable curves of genus $ g\geq 5 $ of Mumford type .	We also show that there do not exist Shimura curves lying generically in the Torelli locus of hyperelliptic curves of genus $ g\geq 8 $ .	The first result proves a slightly weaker form of the conjecture for the case of Shimura curves of Mumford type .
3	It has been revealed that the image positions , amplifications and time delays of this lensing system can not be explained by the single transparent lens model .	The mass distribution of the lensing galaxy of the multiple quasar PG1115+080 has been studied .	Using the observational data of Christian et al .	( 1987 , ApJ 464 , 92 ) , we applied a single elliptical lens model with a softened power-law behavior .	We compare this elliptical lens model with a multipole expansion model .
0	Generators and relations are given for the subalgebra of cocommutative elements in the quantized coordinate rings of the classical groups , where the deformation parameter q is transcendental .	This is a ring theoretic formulation of the well known fact that the representation theory of the quantized group is completely analogous to its classical counterpart .	The subalgebras of cocommutative elements in the corresponding FRT-bialgebras ( defined by Faddeev , Reshetikhin , and Takhtadzhyan ) are explicitly determined , using a bialgebra embedding of the FRT-bialgebra into the tensor product of the quantized coordinate ring and the one-variable polynomial ring .	A parallel analysis of the subalgebras of adjoint coinvariants is carried out as well , yielding similar results with similar proofs .	The basic adjoint coinvariants are interpreted as quantum traces of representations of the corresponding quantized universal enveloping algebra .
1	Some application areas of such kind of simulator like musical synthesis , animation or more general , instrumental art have specific requirements as for the `` haptic rendering '' of small movements that go beyond the usual haptic interfaces allow .	The quality of a simulator equipped with a haptic interface is given by the dynamical properties of its components : haptic interface , simulator and control system .	Object properties variability and different situations of object combination represent important aspects of such type of application which makes that the user can be interested as much in the restitution of certain global properties of an entire object domain as in the restitution of properties that are specific to an isolate object .	In the traditional approaches , the usual criteria are founded on the paradigm of transparency and are related to the impedance error introduced by the technical aspects of the system .	As a general aim , rather than to minimize these effects , we look to characterize them by physical metaphors conferring to haptic medium the role of a tool .
2	However , the presence of magneto-dipole interaction influences the order-disorder transition : depending on the strength of magneto-dipole interaction the transition from the ferromagnetic to the superparamagnetic state is accompanied either by creation of vortices or domains of opposite magnetization .	We study the competition of magneto-dipole , anisotropy and exchange interactions in composite three dimensional multiferroics .	Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that magneto-dipole interaction does not suppress the ferromagnetic state caused by the interaction of the ferroelectric matrix and magnetic subsystem .	We show that the temperature hysteresis loop occurs due to non-monotonic behavior of exchange interaction versus temperature .	The origin of this hysteresis is related to the presence of stable magnetic domains which are robust against thermal fluctuations .
4	We show that if sliding occurs in a discontinuous systems , there exists a differentiable slow-fast system with equivalent slow invariant dynamics .	This paper studies the equivalence between differentiable and non-differentiable dynamics in Rn .	Filippov 's theory of discontinuous differential equations allows us to find flow solutions of dynamical systems whose vector fields undergo switches at thresholds in phase space .	The canonical convex combination at the discontinuity is only the linear part of a nonlinear combination that more fully explores Filippov 's most general problem : the differential inclusion .	Here we show how recent work relating discontinuous systems to singular limits of continuous ( or regularized ) systems extends to nonlinear combinations .
1	We start with a general analysis of the conditions for the Runge-Gross argument , especially the time-differentiability of the density .	We investigate when Taylor expansions can be used to prove the Runge-Gross Theorem , which is at the foundation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory ( TDDFT ) .	The latter should be questioned in the presence of singular ( e.g.Coulomb ) potentials .	Then , we show that a singular potential in a one-body operator considerably decreases the class of time-dependent external potentials to which the original argument can be applied .	A two-body singularity has an even stronger impact and an external potential is essentially incompatible with it .
0	Laser Interference Lithography ( LIL ) is a versatile fabrication method for patterning sub-micron structures in arrays covering large areas .	It is a facile and fast mask-less lithography process to produce large area periodic patterns .	The objective in this study is to simulate and design periodic and quasi-periodic 1D , 2D and 3D nanostructures using two-beam interference technique .	We designed and simulated periodic and quasi-periodic structures by two-beam interference patterning using a MATLAB program by varying angle of incidence , wavelength and geometry .	The generated patterns/features depend on the interference intensity , wavelength , slit separation and angle of incidence .
4	However , it is only recently that reconstruction algorithms with computational complexity that is sub-linear in $ N $ have started being investigated ( recent work by \cite { GurI:04 , IndN:10 , NgoP:11 } gave some of the first such algorithms ) .	Group-testing refers to the problem of identifying ( with high probability ) a ( small ) subset of $ D $ defectives from a ( large ) set of $ N $ items via a `` small '' number of `` pooled '' tests .	For ease of presentation in this work we focus on the regime when $ D = \cO { N^ { 1-\gap } } $ for some $ \gap & gt ; 0 $ .	The tests may be noiseless or noisy , and the testing procedure may be adaptive ( the pool defining a test may depend on the outcome of a previous test ) , or non-adaptive ( each test is performed independent of the outcome of other tests ) .	A rich body of literature demonstrates that $ \Theta ( D\log ( N ) ) $ tests are information-theoretically necessary and sufficient for the group-testing problem , and provides algorithms that achieve this performance .
0	We study the absolute continuity of the convolution $ \delta_ { e^X } ^\natural \star \delta_ { e^Y } ^\natural $ of two orbital measures on the symmetric space $ SO_0 ( p , q ) /SO ( p ) \timesSO ( q ) $ , $ q & gt ; p $ .	We prove sharp conditions on $ X $ , $ Y\in\a $ for the existence of the density of the convolution measure .	This measure intervenes in the product formula for the spherical functions .	We show that the sharp criterion developed for $ \SO_0 ( p , q ) /\SO ( p ) \times\SO ( q ) $ will also serve for the spaces $ SU ( p , q ) /S ( U ( p ) \timesU ( q ) ) $ and $ Sp ( p , q ) /Sp ( p ) \timesSp ( q ) $ , $ q & gt ; p $ .	We also apply our results to the study of absolute continuity of convolution powers of an orbital measure $ \delta_ { e^X } ^\natural $ .
2	For a Non-radiative model , we find scaling relations in good agreement with self-similar predictions : $ Y\propto T_X^ { 5/2 } $ and $ Y \propto L_X^ { 5/4 } $ .	The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is a powerful new tool for finding and studying clusters at high redshift , particularly in combination with their X-ray properties .	In this paper we quantify the expected scaling relations between these properties using numerical simulations with various models for heating and cooling of the cluster gas .	Our main results focus on predictions from Cooling and Preheating simulations , shown by Muanwong et al .	( 2002 ) to provide a good match to the X-ray scaling relations at z=0 .
4	In Stage 1 , we carry out an F test of the null hypothesis that the slopes are all zero against the alternative hypothesis that they are not all zero .	Consider a one-way analysis of covariance model .	Suppose that the parameter of interest theta is a specified linear contrast of the expected responses , for a given value of the covariate .	Also suppose that the inference of interest is a 1-alpha confidence interval for theta .	The following two-stage procedure has been proposed to determine the form of the model .
3	This result together with existing research proves a conjecture of Verwoerd and Mason ( 2007 ) that for the complete network and homogeneous model the zero fixed point has a basin of attraction consisting of the entire space minus a set of measure zero .	This paper is concerned with the existence of multiple stable fixed point solutions of the homogeneous Kuramoto model .	We develop a necessary condition for the existence of stable fixed points for the general network Kuramoto model .	This condition is applied to show that for sufficiently dense n-node networks , with node degrees at least 0.9395 ( n-1 ) , the homogeneous ( equal frequencies ) model has no non-zero stable fixed point solution over the full space of phase angles in the range -Pi to Pi .	The necessary conditions are also tested to see how close to sufficiency they might be by applying them to a class of regular degree networks studied by Wiley , Strogatz and Girvan ( 2006 ) .
1	The nIR source is highly variable , with K_s-band magnitudes varying between 15.2 and 17.3 and additional J- and H-band observations revealing color variations .	We report the discovery of a near-infrared ( nIR ) counterpart to the persistent neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1705-440 , at a location consistent with its recently determined Chandra X-ray position .	A comparison with contemporaneous X-ray monitoring observations shows that the nIR brightness correlates well with X-ray flux and X-ray spectral state .	We also find possible indications for a change in the slope of the nIR/X-ray flux relation between different X-ray states .	We discuss and test various proposed mechanisms for the nIR emission from neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries and conclude that the nIR emission in 4U 1705-440 is most likely dominated by X-ray heating of the outer accretion disk and the secondary star .
0	We prove an existence theorem for gauge invariant $ L^2 $ -normal neighborhoods of the reduction loci in the space $ { \cal A } _a ( E ) $ of oriented connections on a fixed Hermitian 2-bundle $ E $ .	We use this to obtain results on the topology of the moduli space $ { \cal B } _a ( E ) $ of ( non-necessarily irreducible ) oriented connections , and to study the Donaldson $ \mu $ -classes globally around the reduction loci .	In this part of the article we use essentially the concept of harmonic section in a sphere bundle with respect to an Euclidean connection .	Second , we concentrate on moduli spaces of instantons on definite 4-manifolds with arbitrary first Betti number .	We prove strong generic regularity results which imply ( for bundles with `` odd '' first Chern class ) the existence of a connected , dense open set of `` good '' metrics for which all the reductions in the Uhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space are simultaneously regular .
4	Comparing different Monte Carlo simulations , we observe a sensitivity of some variables to the underlying event ; however , even with a conservative estimates , the multivariate approach is very powerful .	A method is proposed for distinguishing highly boosted hadronically decaying W 's ( W-jets ) from QCD-jets using jet substructure .	Previous methods , such as the filtering/mass-drop method , can give a factor of ~2 improvement in S/sqrt ( B ) for jet pT & gt ; 200 GeV .	In contrast , a multivariate approach including new discriminants such as R-cores , which characterize the shape of the W-jet , subjet planar flow , and grooming-sensitivities is shown to provide a much larger factor of ~5 improvement in S/sqrt ( B ) .	For longitudinally polarized W 's , such as those coming from many new physics models , the discrimination is even better .
0	We use the Herschel ATLAS ( H-ATLAS ) Phase I data to study the conditional luminosity function of far-IR ( 250 um ) selected galaxies in optically-selected galaxy groups from the GAMA spectroscopic survey , as well as environmental effects on the far-IR-to-optical colour .	We applied two methods , which gave consistent results for the far-IR conditional luminosity functions .	The direct matching method matches H-ATLAS sources to GAMA/SDSS galaxies , then links the optical counterparts to GAMA groups .	The stacking method counts the number of far-IR sources within the projected radii of GAMA groups , subtracting the local background .	We investigated the dependence of the far-IR ( 250 um ) luminosity function on group mass in the range 10d12 & lt ; M_h & lt ; 10d14Msun/h and on redshift in the range 0 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.4 , using a sample of 3000 groups containing H-ATLAS sources with GAMA redshifts over an area of 126 sq.deg .
3	Noether 's theorem can then be applied .	A general theorem on conservation laws for arbitrary difference equations is proved .	The theorem is based on an introduction of an adjoint system related with a given difference system , and it does not require the existence of a difference Lagrangian .	It is proved that the system , combined by the original system and its adjoint system , is governed by a variational principle , which inherits all symmetries of the original system .	With some special techniques , e.g.self-adjointness properties , this allows us to obtain conservation laws for difference equations , which are not necessary governed by Lagrangian formalisms .
0	We report the discovery of variability in the linear polarization from the Galactic Center black hole source , Sagittarius A* .	New polarimetry obtained with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at a wavelength of 1.3 mm shows a position angle that differs by 28 +/- 5 degrees from observations 6 months prior and then remains stable for 15 months .	This difference may be due to a change in the source emission region on a scale of 10 Schwarzschild radii or due to a change of 3 x 10^5 rad m^-2 in the rotation measure .	We consider a change in the source physics unlikely , however , since we see no corresponding change in the total intensity or polarized intensity fraction .	On the other hand , turbulence in the accretion region at a radius ~ 10 to 1000 R_s could readily account for the magnitude and time scale of the position angle change .
2	For the data assimilation scheme , the supervised NN , the multilayer perceptrons ( MLP-NN ) , is applied .	This paper presents an approach for employing artificial neural networks ( NN ) to emulate an ensemble Kalman filter ( EnKF ) as a method of data assimilation .	The assimilation methods are tested in the Simplified Parameterizations PrimitivE-Equation Dynamics ( SPEEDY ) model , an atmospheric general circulation model ( AGCM ) , using synthetic observational data simulating localization of balloon soundings .	The MLP-NN are able to emulate the analysis from the local ensemble transform Kalman filter ( LETKF ) .	After the training process , the method using the MLP-NN is seen as a function of data assimilation .
1	This ability can be sustained with addition of distracting dots around the object .	When the boundary of a familiar object is shown by a series of isolated dots , humans can often recognize the object with ease .	However , such capability has not been reproduced algorithmically on computers .	We introduce a new algorithm that groups a set of dots into multiple non-disjoint subsets .	It connects the dots into a spanning tree using the proximity cue .
3	We prove that each of the two estimates is reliable to measure the true error norm , and the second one theoretically justifies an empirical claim by Saad .	Krylov subspace methods for approximating a matrix function $ f ( A ) $ times a vector $ v $ are analyzed in this paper .	For the Arnoldi approximation to $ e^ { -\tau A } v $ , two reliable a posteriori error estimates are derived from the new bounds and generalized error expansion we establish .	One of them is similar to the residual norm of an approximate solution of the linear system , and the other one is determined critically by the first term of the error expansion of the Arnoldi approximation to $ e^ { -\tau A } v $ due to Saad .	In the paper , by introducing certain functions $ \phi_k ( z ) $ defined recursively by the given function $ f ( z ) $ for certain nodes , we obtain the error expansion of the Krylov-like approximation for $ f ( z ) $ sufficiently smooth , which generalizes Saad 's result on the Arnoldi approximation to $ e^ { -\tau A } v $ .
4	We focus on spikes associated with large excitations .	Using Monte Carlo simulations , we study the character of the spin-glass ( SG ) state of a site-diluted dipolar Ising model .	We consider systems of dipoles randomly placed on a fraction x of all L^3 sites of a simple cubic lattice that point up or down along a given crystalline axis .	For x & lt ; 0.65 these systems are known to exhibit an equilibrium spin-glass phase below a temperature T_sg proportional to x .	At high dilution and very low temperatures , well deep in the SG phase , we find spiky distributions of the overlap parameter q that are strongly sample-dependent .
0	Ripplons -- gravity-capillary waves on the free surface of a liquid or at the interfaces between two superfluids -- are the most favourable excitations for simulation of the general-relativistic effects related to horizons and ergoregions .	The white-hole horizon for the `` relativistic '' ripplons at the surface of the shallow liquid is easily simulated using the kitchen-bath hydraulic jump .	The same white-hole horizon is observed in quantum liquid -- superfluid 4He .	The ergoregion for the `` non-relativistic '' ripplons is generated in the experiments with two sliding 3He superfluids .	The common property experienced by all these ripplons is the Miles instability inside the ergoregion or horizon .
1	We study the convergence of the associated Taylor series .	An analogue of Taylor 's formula , which arises by substituting the classical derivative by a divided difference operator of Askey-Wilson type , is developed here .	Our results complement a recent work by Ismail and Stanton .	Quite surprisingly , in some cases the Taylor polynomials converge to a function which differs from the original one .	We provide explicit expressions for the integral remainder .
1	This is believed to be more generic than the common derivations based upon Einstein 's energy relationship for moving particles .	A derivation is presented of the quantummechanical wave equations based upon the Equity Principle of Einstein 's General Relativity Theory .	It is shown that Schrodinger 's Equation , if properly formulated , is relativisticly covariant .	This makes the critisized Klein-Gordon Equation for spinless massparticles obsolete .	Therefore Dirac 's Equation is presented from a different viewpoint and it is shown that the relativistic covariance of Schrodinger 's Equation gives a natural explanation for the dual energy outcome of Dirac 's derivation and for the nature of antiparticles .
2	A penalty like Total Variation ( TV ) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map .	The use of machine-learning in neuroimaging offers new perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases .	Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data , traditional approaches provide irregular ( l2 penalty ) or scattered ( l1 penalty ) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance .	However , TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize .	We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of l1 , l2 , and TV penalties while preserving the exact l1 penalty .
3	We use the stellar SEDs to estimate the spectral types of the three newly-identified O stars in RCW49 and one previously undiscovered O star in M17 .	We report the discovery of six infrared stellar-wind bowshocks in the Galactic massive star formation regions M17 and RCW49 from Spitzer GLIMPSE ( Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire ) images .	The InfraRed Array Camera ( IRAC ) on the Spitzer Space Telescope clearly resolves the arc-shaped emission produced by the bowshocks .	We combine Two Micron All-Sky Survey ( 2MASS ) , Spitzer , MSX , and IRAS observations to obtain the spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) of the bowshocks and their individual driving stars .	One of the bowshocks in RCW49 reveals the presence of a large-scale flow of gas escaping the H II region at a few 10^2 km/s .
3	We study $ U_q ( \widehat { sl } ( 2 ) ) $ spin chain with a triangular boundary , which gives a generalization of diagonal boundary [ Baseilhac and Belliard 2013 , Baseilhac and Kojima 2014 ] .	Vertex operator approach is a powerful method to study exactly solvable models .	We review recent progress of vertex operator approach to semi-infinite spin chain .	( 1 ) The first progress is a generalization of boundary condition .	We give a bosonization of the boundary vacuum state .
2	It is explained in terms of the decay instability of homogeneous transverse NMR mode into spin waves of the longitudinal NMR .	The quantitative analysis of the `` catastrophic relaxation '' of the coherent spin precession in $ ^3 $ He-B is presented .	This phenomenon has been observed below the temperature about 0.5 T $ _c $ as an abrupt shortening of the induction signal decay .	Recently the cross interaction amplitude between the two modes has been calculated by Sourovtsev and Fomin \cite { SF } for the so-called Brinkman-Smith configuration , i.e.for the orientation of the orbital momentum of Cooper pairs along the magnetic field , $ { \bf L } \parallel { \bf H } $ .	In their treatment , the interaction is caused by the anisotropy of the speed of the spin waves .
4	We derive and test a new implementation which eliminates the need for calibration and utilizes only the observables : the galaxy velocities with respect to the cluster mean v , the projected positions r_p , an estimate of the Navarro-Frenk-White ( NFW ) density concentration and an estimate of the velocity anisotropies , beta .	We use the Millennium Simulation to quantify the statistical accuracy and precision of the escape velocity technique for measuring cluster-sized halo masses at z~0.1 .	We show that in 3D , one can measure nearly unbiased ( & lt ; 4 % ) halo masses ( & gt ; 1.5x10^14 M_solar h^-1 ) with 10-15 % scatter .	Line-of-sight projection effects increase the scatter to ~25 % , where we include the known velocity anisotropies .	The classical `` caustic '' technique incorporates a calibration factor which is determined from N-body simulations .
2	We show that the quantum tunneling can be quasi-periodic and in this way one could generate coherent Bose condensed atomic pulses .	In this report we investigate the macroscopic quantum tunneling of a Bose condensate falling under gravity and scattering on a Gaussian barrier that could model a mirror of far-detuned sheet of light .	We analyze the effect of the inter-atomic interaction and that of a transverse confining potential .	In the second part of the report , we discuss an effective 1D time-dependent non-polynomial nonlinear Schrodinger equation ( NPSE ) , which describes cigar-shaped condensates .	NPSE is obtained from the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation by using a variational approach .
2	The formalism of DQG presents us with a decoherence matrix $ D_n ( x , y ) $ , $ x , y\in Q_n $ .	The basic framework for this article is the causal set approach to discrete quantum gravity ( DQG ) .	Let $ Q_n $ be the collection of causal sets with cardinality not greater than $ n $ and let $ K_n $ be the standard Hilbert space of complex-valued functions on $ Q_n $ .	There is a growth order in $ Q_n $ and a path in $ Q_n $ is a maximal chain relative to this order .	We denote the set of paths in $ Q_n $ by $ \Omega_n $ .
2	We define the conditions when the 5D vacuum Einstein equations have as solutions anisotropic Taub-NUT spaces .	By using anholonomic frames in ( pseudo ) Riemannian spaces we define anisotropic extensions of Euclidean Taub-NUT spaces .	With respect to coordinate frames such spaces are described by off-diagonal metrics which could be diagonalized by corresponding anholonomic transforms .	The generalized Killing equations for the configuration space of anisotropically spinning particles ( anisotropic spinning space ) are analyzed .	Simple solutions of the homogeneous part of these equations are expressed in terms of some anisotropically modified Killing-Yano tensors .
2	The most sensitive is the `` bright '' singlet , whose binding energy decreases quickly with increasing $ \delta $ even at relatively small B .	We study photoluminescence ( PL ) of charged excitons ( $ X^- $ ) in narrow asymmetric quantum wells in high magnetic fields B .	The binding of all $ X^- $ states strongly depends on the separation $ \delta $ of electron and hole layers .	As a result , the value of B at which the singlet -- triplet crossing occurs in the $ X^- $ spectrum also depends on $ \delta $ and decreases from 35 T in a symmetric 10 nm GaAs well to 16 T for $ \delta=0.5 $ nm .	Since the critical values of $ \delta $ at which different $ X^- $ states unbind are surprisingly small compared to the well width , the observation of strongly bound $ X^- $ states in an experimental PL spectrum implies virtually no layer displacement in the sample .
3	Results suggest that the IRL approach performs much worse than the MIRL approach .	We compare the performance of Inverse Reinforcement Learning ( IRL ) with the relative new model of Multi-agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning ( MIRL ) .	Before comparing the methods , we extend a published Bayesian IRL approach that is only applicable to the case where the reward is only state dependent to a general one capable of tackling the case where the reward depends on both state and action .	Comparison between IRL and MIRL is made in the context of an abstract soccer game , using both a game model in which the reward depends only on state and one in which it depends on both state and action .	We speculate that the underperformance of IRL is because it fails to capture equilibrium information in the manner possible in MIRL .
1	It is assumed that the SF interface is smooth on the atomic scale and the mean free path is not too short .	We study a change in the spin magnetization of a superconductor-ferromagnet ( SF ) heterostructure , when temperature is lowered below the superconducting transition temperature .	Solving the Eilenberger equation we show that the spin magnetic moment induced in the superconductor is an oscillating sign-changing function of the product $ hd $ of the exchange field $ h $ and the thickness $ d $ of the ferromagnet .	Therefore the total spin magnetic moment of the system in the superconducting state can be not only smaller ( screening ) but also greater ( anti-screening ) than that in the normal state , in contrast with the case of highly disordered ( diffusive ) systems , where only screening is possible .	This surprising effect is due to peculiar periodic properties of localized Andreev states in the system .
3	The new general form of the OPS split allows us to find new geometric interpretations for the action of the QFT on the signal .	The two-sided quaternionic Fourier transformation ( QFT ) was introduced in \cite { Ell:1993 } for the analysis of 2D linear time-invariant partial-differential systems .	In further theoretical investigations \cite { 10.1007/s00006-007-0037-8 , EH : DirUP_QFT } a special split of quaternions was introduced , then called $ \pm $ split .	In the current \change { chapter } we analyze this split further , interpret it geometrically as \change { an } \emph { orthogonal 2D planes split } ( OPS ) , and generalize it to a freely steerable split of $ \H $ into two orthogonal 2D analysis planes .	The second major result of this work is a variety of \emph { new steerable forms } of the QFT , their geometric interpretation , and for each form\change { , } OPS split theorems , which allow fast and efficient numerical implementation with standard FFT software .
0	A number of writers have been attracted to the idea that some of the peculiarities of quantum theory might be manifestations of 'backward ' or 'retro ' causality , underlying the quantum description .	This idea has been explored in the literature in two main ways : firstly in a variety of explicit models of quantum systems , and secondly at a conceptual level .	This note introduces a third approach , intended to complement the other two .	It describes a simple toy model , which , under a natural interpretation , shows how retrocausality can emerge from simple global constraints .	The model is also useful in permitting a clear distinction between the kind of retrocausality likely to be of interest in QM , and a different kind of reverse causality , with which it is liable to be confused .
0	Bayesian Optimization ( BO ) is a data-efficient method for global black-box optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate fitness function .	BO typically assumes that computation cost of BO is cheap , but experiments are time consuming or costly .	In practice , this allows us to optimize ten or fewer critical parameters in up to 1,000 experiments .	But experiments may be less expensive than BO methods assume : In some simulation models , we may be able to conduct multiple thousands of experiments in a few hours , and the computational burden of BO is no longer negligible compared to experimentation time .	To address this challenge we introduce a new Dimension Scheduling Algorithm ( DSA ) , which reduces the computational burden of BO for many experiments .
4	As an alternative we consider matching copies of the exterior solution related by symmetry .	We study solutions of Einstein 's equations corresponding codimension n & gt ; 2 global topological defects with de Sitter slices .	We analyze a class of solutions that are cylindrically symmetric and admit positive , negative or zero bulk cosmological constant .	We derive the relevant graviton equations .	For an extended brane , the properties of the solution depend on apropriate boundary conditions that the exterior solutions have to satisfy near the core .
1	of Theor. , Phys 2009 , 48:1003-1018 ) .	In this work , we examine in depth the cosmological physical aspects of the archaic universe described by Euclidean 5-sphere geometry . ( see Int.Jour .	We hypothesize that the big bang consisted of a spatially extended nucleation process which took place at the end of a pre-cosmic phase , characterized by the evolution parameter x0 .	This parameter , which can be considered a quantum precursor of ordinary physical time , is a coordinate of Euclidean 5-sphere metrics .	We must now examine what the privileged role of the x0 axis consists in .
4	We find -- in agreement with previous results -- that the CF-method is on the average accurate up to a factor of 2 , while a single estimate can be off by a factor of 7 .	The currently most viable methods to estimate magnetic field strengths in molecular cloud cores are Zeeman measurements and the Chandrasekhar-Fermi ( CF ) method .	The CF-method estimates magnetic field strengths from polarimetry and relies on equipartition between the turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energy in the observed region .	Thus , its application to objects not dominated by hydromagnetic turbulence is questionable .	We calibrate the CF-method and Zeeman measurements against numerical models of self-gravitating molecular cloud cores .
1	This feeling is exacerbated given the success of the Big Bang model .	It is only human nature to be reluctant to accept something new and different .	However , there are cogent reasons for considering this new model .	Some of the advantages of this new model over the existing Big Bang model are as follows : ( 1 ) It does not violate any known laws of physics .	This contrasts with the Big Bang model where all known laws of physics break down in the consideration of the universe beginning as a singular point of infinite density .
0	A new sample of stars , representative of the solar neighbourhood luminosity function , is constructed from the Hipparcos catalogue and the Fifth Catalogue of Nearby Stars .	We have cross-matched to sources in the 2MASS catalogue so that for all stars individually determined Near Infrared photometry ( NIR ) is available on a homogeneous system ( typically K_s ) .	The spatial completeness of the sample has been carefully determined by statistical methods , and the NIR luminosity function of the stars has been derived by direct star counts .	We find a local volume luminosity of 0.121 +/- 0.004 L_K_sun/ ( pc**3 ) , corresponding to a volumetric mass-to-light ratio of M/L_K = 0.31 +/- 0.02 M_sun/L_K_sun , where giants contribute 80 per cent to the light but less than 2 per cent to the stellar mass .	We derive the surface brightness of the solar cylinder with the help of a vertical disc model .
4	The quadrature is a high-order Gaussian rule that is modified near the diagonal to retain high-order accuracy for singular kernels .	A scheme for rapidly and accurately computing solutions to boundary integral equations ( BIEs ) on rotationally symmetric surfaces in R^3 is presented .	The scheme uses the Fourier transform to reduce the original BIE defined on a surface to a sequence of BIEs defined on a generating curve for the surface .	It can handle loads that are not necessarily rotationally symmetric .	Nystrom discretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the generating curve .
4	Correspondingly , the memory consists of three independent linear systems .	Transferring a quantum state of a light field to a memory is of particular importance .	However , this transfer is usually hampered because the memory system is subjected to some noise and this can limit the performance of the state transfer to a great extent .	In this paper , we consider the transfer of a Gaussian state of light to a linear medium memory such as an opto-mechanical oscillator and propose a dynamical feedback controller that suppresses the noise in the memory system .	To protect an unknown state , the feedback scheme employs the specific configuration of the quantum error correction ; that is , a three-mode Gaussian state having appropriate syndromes is taken as the input .
4	We find that along the magnetization direction the density decreases as the scattering length is reduced but presents two symmetric density peaks in the perpendicular axis .	We study a Bose-Einstein condensate of 52Cr atoms confined in a toroidal trap with a variable strength of s-wave contact interactions .	We analyze the effects of the anisotropic nature of the dipolar interaction by considering the magnetization axis to be perpendicular to the trap symmetry axis .	In the absence of a central repulsive barrier , when the trap is purely harmonic , the effect of reducing the scattering length is a tuning of the geometry of the system : from a pancake-shaped condensate when it is large , to a cigar-shaped condensate for small scattering lengths .	For a condensate in a toroidal trap , the interaction in combination with the central repulsive Gaussian barrier produces an azimuthal dependence of the particle density for a fixed radial distance .
0	We study competition and cooperation among a group of storage units .	We show that as the number of storages increases , the profit of storages approaches zero under Nash competition .	We propose two ways in which storages can achieve non-zero profit and show that they are optimal in the sense that storages achieve the maximum possible profit .	The first is a decentralized approach in which storages are exposed to artificial cost functions that incentivize them to behavior as a coalition .	No private information needs to be exchanged between the storages to calculate the artificial function .
0	A numerical algorithm for studying strongly correlated electron systems is proposed .	The groundstate wavefunction is projected out after numerical renormalization procedure in the path integral formalism .	The wavefunction is expressed from the optimized linear combination of retained states in the truncated Hilbert space with numerically chosen basis .	This algorithm does not suffer from the negative sign problem and can be applied to any type of Hamiltonian in any dimension .	The efficiency is tested in examples of the Hubbard model where the basis of Slater determinants is numerically optimized .
0	We present a simple and powerful method for extracting transit signals associated with a known transiting planet from noisy light curves .	Assuming the orbital period of the planet is known and the signal is periodic , we illustrate that systematic noise can be removed in Fourier space at all frequencies , by only using data within a fixed time frame with a width equal to an integer number of orbital periods .	This results in a reconstruction of the full transit signal which on average is unbiased , despite that no prior knowledge of either the noise or the transit signal itself is used in the analysis .	The method has therefore clear advantages over standard phase folding , which normally requires external input such as nearby stars or noise models for removing systematic components .	In addition , we can extract the full orbital transit signal ( $ 360 $ degrees ) simultaneously , and \emph { Kepler } like data can be analyzed in just a few seconds .
3	The general case of generic manifolds of higher codimension , which we treat in this paper , had remained an open problem since then .	We prove here new results about transversality and related geometric properties of a holomorphic , formal , or CR mapping , sending one generic submanifold of $ \bC^N $ into another .	One of our main results is that a finite mapping is transversal to the target manifold provided this manifold is of finite type .	For the case of hypersurfaces , transversality in this context was proved by Baouendi and the second author in 1990 .	Applications of this result include a sufficient condition for a finite mapping to be a local diffeomorphism .
0	Modern networks are large , highly complex and dynamic .	Add to that the mobility of the agents comprising many of these networks .	It is difficult or even impossible for such systems to be managed centrally in an efficient manner .	It is imperative for such systems to attain a degree of self-management .	Self-healing i.e.the capability of a system in a good state to recover to another good state in face of an attack , is desirable for such systems .
3	When the volume is above $ 300 \mu\rm { l } $ , the droplet splits into smaller drops .	An alcohol ( pentanol ) droplet exhibits spontaneous agitation on an aqueous solution , driven by a solutal Marangoni effect .	We found that the droplet 's mode of motion is controlled by its volume .	A droplet with a volume of less than $ 0.1 \mu\rm { l } $ shows irregular translational motion , whereas intermediate-sized droplets of $ 0.1-200 \mu\rm { l } $ show vectorial motion .	These experimental results regarding mode selection are interpreted in terms of the wave number selection depending on the droplet volume .
0	Color fluctuations in hadron-hadron collisions are responsible for the presence of inelastic diffraction and lead to distinctive differences between the Gribov picture of high energy scattering and the low energy Glauber picture .	We find that color fluctuations give a larger contribution to the fluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons than the fluctuations of the number of nucleons at a given impact parameter .	The two contributions for the impact parameter averaged fluctuations are comparable .	As a result , standard procedures for selecting peripheral ( central ) collisions lead to selection of configurations in the projectile which interact with smaller ( larger ) than average strength .	We suggest that studies of pA collisions with a hard trigger may allow to observe effects of color fluctuations .
2	At large distances and long times , fluctuations of the order parameter ( s ) are described by a continuum field theory , and these dominate the physics near such phase transitions .	The theory of second order phase transitions is one of the foundations of modern statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory .	A central concept is the observable `order parameter ' , whose non-zero average value characterizes one or more phases and usually breaks a symmetry of the Hamiltonian .	In this paper we show that near second order quantum phase transitions , subtle quantum interference effects can invalidate this paradigm .	We present a theory of quantum critical points in a variety of experimentally relevant two-dimensional antiferromagnets .
3	We compare these with the corresponding quantities of the sticky gas ( inelastic gas with zero coefficient of restitution ) .	A freely cooling granular gas with velocity dependent restitution coefficient is studied in one dimension .	The restitution coefficient becomes near elastic when the relative velocity of the colliding particles is less than a velocity scale $ \delta $ .	Different statistical quantities namely density distribution , occupied and empty cluster length distributions , and spatial density and velocity correlation functions , are obtained using event driven molecular dynamic simulations .	We find that in the inhomogeneous cooling regime , for times smaller than a crossover time $ t_1 $ where $ t_1 \sim \delta^ { -1 } $ , the behaviour of the granular gas is equivalent to that of the sticky gas .
0	During 2014 the second experimental area EAR2 was completed at the n-TOF neutron beam facility at CERN .	As the neutrons are produced via spallation , by means of a high-intensity 20 GeV pulsed proton beam impinging on a thick target , the resulting neutron beam covers an enormous energy range , from thermal to several GeV .	In this paper we describe two beam diagnostic devices , designed and built at INFN-LNS , both exploiting silicon detectors coupled with neutron converter foils containing 6Li .	The first one is based on four silicon pads and allows to monitor the neutron beam flux as a function of the neutron energy .	The second one , based on position sensitive silicon detectors , is intended for the reconstruction of the beam profile , again as a function of the neutron energy .
1	In this paper we discuss the software infrastructure we use , and create self-consistent ugrizYJHK photometry for all sources within the GAMA sample .	In order to generate credible 0.1-2 { \mu } m SEDs , the GAMA project requires many Gigabytes of imaging data from a number of instruments to be re-processed into a standard format .	Using UKIDSS and SDSS archive data , we outline the pre-processing necessary to standardise all images to a common zeropoint , the steps taken to correct for seeing bias across the dataset , and the creation of Gigapixel-scale mosaics of the three 4x12 deg GAMA regions in each filter .	From these mosaics , we extract source catalogues for the GAMA regions using elliptical Kron and Petrosian matched apertures .	We also calculate S\'ersic magnitudes for all galaxies within the GAMA sample using SIGMA , a galaxy component modelling wrapper for GALFIT 3 .
3	As a master , the clock module sends out messages in response to an external synchronization signal over a serial fiber optic line .	This paper presents the requirements and design of a Timing Synchronization System ( TSS ) for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility ( CEBAF ) control system at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility .	A clock module has been designed which resides in a VME crate .	The clock module can be a communications master or a slave depending on its configuration , which is software and jumper selectable .	As a slave , it receives the messages and interrupts an associated computer in its VME crate .
2	Using 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations we model the long term evolution of a representative Be/X-ray binary system .	Be/X-ray binary systems exhibit both periodic ( Type I ) X-ray outbursts and giant ( Type II ) outbursts , whose origin has remained elusive .	We suggest that Type II X-ray outbursts occur when a highly misaligned decretion disk around the Be star becomes eccentric , allowing the compact object companion to capture a large amount of material at periastron .	We find that periodic ( Type I ) X-ray outbursts occur when the neutron star is close to periastron for all disk inclinations .	Type II outbursts occur for large misalignment angles and are associated with eccentricity growth that occurs on a timescale of about 10 orbital periods .
2	This experimental setting corresponds to a hazardous tracer release inside the engineering structure ( building , ship , aircarft etc ) .	An experimental study of the tracer dispersion in a complex structure is presented .	A point source of tracer ( dyed salt ) was placed inside a multi-compartment structure embedded in water tank .	A system of conductivity sensors was deployed to monitor the propagation of a tracer plume in the structure , including tracer trapping inside some compartments and its release to the outside environment through the external openings .	The experimental data is processed by employing the ideas of scaling and self-similarity of underlying transport processes .
3	The splitting structure is defined without recourse to coordinates or frames .	We introduce a relativistic splitting structure as a means to map fields and equations of electromagnetism from curved four-dimensional space-time to three-dimensional observer 's space .	We focus on a minimal set of mathematical structures that are directly motivated by the language of the physical theory .	Space-time , world-lines , time translation , space platforms , and time synchronization all find their mathematical counterparts .	This is noteworthy since , in much of the prevalent literature , observers are identified with adapted coordinates and frames .
4	Conditions for well-posedness are given and the related issues of plug-in estimation and regularization are examined .	This paper provides a nonparametric analysis for several classes of models , with cases such as classical measurement error , regression with errors in variables , factor models and other models that may be represented in a form involving convolution equations .	The focus here is on conditions for existence of solutions , nonparametric identification and well-posedness in the space of generalized functions ( tempered distributions ) .	This space provides advantages over working in function spaces by relaxing assumptions and extending the results to include a wider variety of models , for example by not requiring existence of density .	Classes of ( generalized ) functions for which solutions exist are defined ; identification conditions , partial identification and its implications are discussed .
2	Then , a short state of the art in AmI research is presented .	The paper tries to point out the benefits that can be derived from research advances in the implementation of concepts such as ambient intelligence ( AmI ) and ubiquitous or pervasive computing for promoting Universal Access ( UA ) to the Information Society , that is , for contributing to enable everybody , especially Physically Disabled ( PD ) people , to have easy access to all computing resources and information services that the coming worldwide Information Society will soon make available to the general public .	Following definitions of basic concepts relating to multimodal interaction , the significant contribution of multimodality to developing UA is briefly argued .	In the last section we bring out the potential contribution of advances in AmI research and technology to the improvement of computer access for PD people .	This claim is supported by the following observations : ( i ) most projects aiming at implementing AmI focus on the design of new interaction modalities and flexible multimodal user interfaces which may facilitate PD users ' computer access ; ( ii ) targeted applications will support users in a wide range of daily activities which will be performed simultaneously with supporting computing tasks ; therefore , users will be placed in contexts where they will be confronted with similar difficulties to those encountered by PD users ; ( iii ) AmI applications being intended for the general public , a wide range of new interaction devices and flexible processing software will be available , making it possible to provide PD users with human-computer facilities tailored to their specific needs at reasonable expense..
0	We apply the method of defensive forecasting , based on the use of game-theoretic supermartingales , to prediction with expert advice .	In the traditional setting of a countable number of experts and a finite number of outcomes , the Defensive Forecasting Algorithm is very close to the well-known Aggregating Algorithm .	Not only the performance guarantees but also the predictions are the same for these two methods of fundamentally different nature .	We discuss also a new setting where the experts can give advice conditional on the learner 's future decision .	Both the algorithms can be adapted to the new setting and give the same performance guarantees as in the traditional setting .
3	Selected recent information-theoretic works dealing directly with such channels are reviewed .	The open problem of calculating the limiting spectrum ( or its Shannon transform ) of increasingly large random Hermitian finite-band matrices is described .	In general , these matrices include a finite number of non-zero diagonals around their main diagonal regardless of their size .	Two different communication setups which may be modeled using such matrices are presented : a simple cellular uplink channel , and a time varying inter-symbol interference channel .	Finally , several characteristics of the still unknown limiting spectrum of such matrices are listed , and some reflections are touched upon .
4	We describe some of the simplest extensions of the SM , emphasising novel flavour aspects which arise in their framework .	We present the invited lectures given at the Third IDPASC School which took place in Santiago de Compostela in January 2013 .	The students attending the school had very different backgrounds , some of them were doing their Ph.D. in experimental particle physics , others in theory .	As a result , and in order to make the lectures useful for most of the students , we focused on basic topics of broad interest , avoiding the more technical aspects of Flavour Physics and CP Violation .	We make a brief review of the Standard Model , paying special attention to the generation of fermion masses and mixing , as well as to CP violation .
3	The quiescence variability of this object is dominated by semiregular pulsations of the red giant secondary ( with periods of 136.5 and 77.4 d ) .	We analyse long-term optical photometry for two Galactic recurrent novae ( V745 Sco and V3890 Sgr ) and one Large Magellanic Cloud object ( Nova LMC 1990b ) observed over several years by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) sky survey .	We do not find variability with the previously claimed orbital period of V745 Sco .	This voids previous findings based on this value ( e.g.the distance determination ) .	The photometry of Nova LMC 1990b reveals an unnoticed eruption in 2010 and eclipse-like variability in quiescence with a period of 1.26432 ( 8 ) d. The photometric properties make this object very similar to U Sco .
1	In this way , we show that the main common problems of previous models of this sort , namely the prediction of a too light Higgs and top mass , as well as of a too low compactification scale , are all solved .	We reconsider the idea of identifying the Higgs field as the internal component of a gauge field in the flat space R^4XS^1/Z_2 , by relaxing the constraint of having unbroken SO ( 4,1 ) Lorentz symmetry in the bulk .	We mainly focus our attention on a previously constructed model .	We show how , with few minor modifications and by relaxing the requirement of SO ( 4,1 ) symmetry , a potentially realistic model can be obtained with a moderate tuning in the parameter space of the theory .	In this model , the Higgs potential is stabilized and the hierarchy of fermion masses explained .
4	The models span the range of stellar , dust shell and grain properties relevant to evolved stars .	The total dust return rate from AGB and RSG star outflows is an important constraint to galactic chemical evolution models .	However , this requires detailed radiative transfer ( RT ) modeling of individual stars , which becomes impractical for large data sets .	Another approach is to select the best-fit spectral energy distribution ( SED ) from a grid of dust shell models , allowing for a faster determination of the luminosities and mass-loss rates for entire samples .	We have developed the Grid of RSG and AGB ModelS ( GRAMS ) to measure the mass-loss return from evolved stars .
2	The nonlinear temperature dependence of thermopower below 150 K is explained by the electron-phonon interaction renormalization effects .	The thermopower and thermal conductivity of superconducting perovskite $ MgCNi_3 $ ( $ T_c \approx $ 8 K ) have been studied .	The thermopower is negative from room temperature to 10 K. Combining with the negative Hall coefficient reported previously , the negative thermopower definetly indicates that the carrier in $ MgCNi_3 $ is electron-type .	The thermal conductivity is of the order for intermetallics , larger than that of borocarbides and smaller than $ MgB_2 $ .	In the normal state , the electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity is slightly larger than the lattice contribution .
1	We confirm the previously-reported excess of co-rotating satellite pairs located near diametric opposition with respect to the host , but show that this signal is unlikely to be due to rotating discs ( or planes ) of satellites .	We compare the dynamics of satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to simple models in order to test the hypothesis that a large fraction of satellites co-rotate in coherent planes .	In particular , no overabundance of co-rotating satellites pairs is observed within $ \sim 20^ { \circ } -50^ { \circ } $ of direct opposition , as would be expected for planar distributions inclined relative to the line-of-sight .	Instead , the excess co-rotation for satellite pairs within $ \sim 10^ { \circ } $ of opposition is consistent with random noise associated with undersampling of an underlying isotropic velocity distribution .	We conclude that at most $ 10\ % $ of the hosts in our sample harbor co-rotating satellite planes ( as traced by the luminous satellite population ) .
0	A summary is given of an analysis of the Hipparcos trigonometrical parallaxes and proper motions of classical Cepheids .	It is possible for the first time to derive zero-points for the period-luminosity and period-luminosity-colour relations from parallaxes alone , avoiding the problems of less direct methods .	The results imply an increase of 8 to 10 percent in the extragalactic distance scale based on Cepheids .	The proper motions are used to derive the constants of galactic rotation .	Comparison with radial velocity data leads to a confirmation of the Cepheid distance scale derived from the parallaxes and indicates a kinematic distance to the galactic centre of 8.5 +/- 0.5 kpc .
3	With respect to detuning dependence , we identify a crossover between the regimes of spectral sideband narrowing or broadening .	We present both experimental and theoretical investigations of a laser-driven quantum dot ( QD ) in the dressed-state regime of resonance fluorescence .	We explore the role of phonon scattering and pure dephasing on the detuning-dependence of the Mollow triplet and show that the triplet sidebands may spectrally broaden or narrow with increasing detuning .	Based on a polaron master equation approach which includes electron-phonon interaction nonperturbatively , we derive a fully analytical expression for the spectrum .	A comparison of the theoretical predictions to detailed experimental studies on the laser detuning-dependence of Mollow triplet resonance emission from single In ( Ga ) As QDs reveals excellent agreement .
1	Trapping is caused by the random walker coming close to a local energy extremum , although the mechanism is different from that of critical slowing down encountered in conventional molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations .	We study the mechanism behind dynamical trappings experienced during Wang-Landau sampling of continuous systems reported by several authors .	When trapped , the random walker misses entire or even several stages of Wang-Landau modification factor reduction , leading to inadequate sampling of configuration space and a rough density-of-states even though the modification factor has been reduced to very small values .	Trapping is dependent on specific systems , the choice of energy bins , and Monte Carlo step size , making it highly unpredictable .	A general , simple , and effective solution is proposed where the configurations of multiple parallel Wang-Landau trajectories are inter-swapped to prevent trapping .
3	We conjecture that the difference , 0.003 , is due to the extra dimensions that may modify the area spectrum .	By pointing out an error in the previous derivation of the area spectrum based on Ashtekar 's variables , we suggest a new area spectrum ; instead of the norm of Ashtekar 's gravitational electric field , we show that the norm of our `` new '' gravitational electric field based on our `` newer '' variables , which we construct in this paper for this purpose , gives the correct area spectrum .	In particular , our `` newer '' variables are mathematically consistent ; the constraint algebra is closed .	Moreover , by using our new area spectrum , we `` almost correctly '' predict the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy without having to adjust the Immirzi parameter ; we show that a numerical formula actually yielded $ 0.997\cdots $ , which is very close to 1 , the expected value with the black hole entropy given as $ A/4 $ .	Then , we derive a formula for the degeneracy for a single-partition black hole , i.e. , a black hole made of a single unit area , and explicitly show that our area spectrum correctly reproduces the degeneracy .
2	and currently hosts two main physics projects : the LUX dark matter experiment and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment .	The former Homestake gold mine in Lead , South Dakota has been transformed into a dedicated facility to pursue underground research in rare-process physics , as well as offering research opportunities in other disciplines such as biology , geology and engineering .	A key component of the Sanford Underground Research Facility ( SURF ) is the Davis Campus , which is in operation at the 4850-foot level ( 4300 m.w.e . )	In addition , two low-background counters currently operate at the Davis Campus in support of current and future experiments .	Expansion of the underground laboratory space is underway at the 4850L Ross Campus in order to maintain and enhance low-background assay capabilities as well as to host a unique nuclear astrophysics accelerator facility .
1	We find that in an experimentally accessible low temperature regime the symmetry allowed spin orbit potential converts graphene from an ideal two dimensional semimetallic state to a quantum spin Hall insulator .	We study the effects of spin orbit interactions on the low energy electronic structure of a single plane of graphene .	This novel electronic state of matter is gapped in the bulk and supports the quantized transport of spin and charge in gapless edge states that propagate at the sample boundaries .	The edge states are non chiral , but they are insensitive to disorder because their directionality is correlated with spin .	The spin and charge conductances in these edge states are calculated and the effects of temperature , chemical potential , Rashba coupling , disorder and symmetry breaking fields are discussed .
2	For an individual observation , the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity in spectral features range from 0.01 ( where the observed and rest-frame filters are aligned ) to 0.04 ( where the observed and rest-frame filters are misaligned ) .	With the advent of large dedicated Type Ia supernova ( SN Ia ) surveys , K-corrections of SNe Ia and their uncertainties have become especially important in the determination of cosmological parameters .	While K-corrections are largely driven by SN Ia broad-band colors , it is shown here that the diversity in spectral features of SNe Ia can also be important .	To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia spectral energy distribution ( SED ) , we outline a prescription for deriving a mean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneous sample of observed spectra .	We then remove the effects of broad-band colors and measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the diversity in spectral features .
3	This is due to the fact that the gap vanishes in quadratic manner around the point on the Fermi surface .	It is shown that the density of states ( DOS ) proportional to the excitation energy , the so-called polar like DOS , can arise in the odd-parity states with the superconducting gap vanishing at points even if the spin-orbit interaction for Cooper pairing is strong enough .	Such gap stuructures are realized in the non-unitary states , F_ { 1u } ( 1 , i,0 ) , F_ { 1u } ( 1 , varepsilon , varepsilon^ { 2 } ) , and F_ { 2u } ( 1 , i,0 ) , classified by Volovik and Gorkov , Sov .	Phys.-JETP Vol.61 ( 1985 ) 843 .	It is also shown that the region of quadratic energy dependence of DOS , in the state F_ { 2u } ( 1 , varepsilon , varepsilon^ { 2 } ) , is restricted in very small energy region making it difficult to distinguish from the polar-like DOS .
4	Our results are valid for Pauli channels and stabilizer codes but based on some numerical results we believe that very similar conclusions can be drawn also in the general case .	A quantum channel models the interaction between the system we are interested in and its environment .	Such a model can capture the main features of the interaction but because of the complexity of the environment we can not assume that it is fully accurate .	We study the robustness of quantum error correction operations against completely unexpected and subsequently undetermined type of channel uncertainties .	We find that a channel-adapted optimal error correction operation does not only give the best possible channel fidelity but it is more robust against channel alterations than any other error correction operation .
4	First results concerning the Class 0 source IRAS04368+2557 ( L1527 IRS ) are presented , including a study of this source 's 8.46 GHz continuum variability over short and long time baselines and an indication that its protoplanetary disk may have a dearth of pebble-sized grains .	We are undertaking a multi-frequency Expanded Very Large Array ( EVLA ) survey of edge-on protoplanetary disks to probe the growth of solids in each disk , sedimentation of such material into the disk midplane , and the connection of these phenomena to the planet formation process .	The projection of edge-on disk systems along our line of sight enables a study of the vertical stratification of large grains with fewer model dependencies than would be required for disks that are more face-on .	Robust studies of the spatial distribution of grains up to ~1 cm in size are possible with the wavelength range and sensitivity of the EVLA .	In this contribution we describe target selection and observational strategies .
4	We focus our investigation , using direct numerical simulations with a standard and fully parallelized pseudo-spectral method and periodic boundary conditions in two space dimensions , on the role that such a modeling of the small scales using the Lagrangian-averaged framework plays in the large-scale dynamics of MHD turbulence .	We explore some consequences of the `` alpha model , '' also called the `` Lagrangian-averaged '' model , for two-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD ) turbulence .	This model is an extension of the smoothing procedure in fluid dynamics which filters velocity fields locally while leaving their associated vorticities unsmoothed , and has proved useful for high Reynolds number turbulence computations .	We consider several known effects ( selective decay , dynamic alignment , inverse cascades , and the probability distribution functions of fluctuating turbulent quantities ) in magnetofluid turbulence and compare the results of numerical solutions of the primitive MHD equations with their alpha-model counterparts ' performance for the same flows , in regimes where available resolution is adequate to explore both .	The hope is to justify the use of the alpha model in regimes that lie outside currently available resolution , as will be the case in particular in three-dimensional geometry or for magnetic Prandtl numbers differing significantly from unity .
0	Nonlinear imaging systems can surpass the limits of linear optics , but to date they have all relied on physical media ( e.g.crystals ) to work .	These materials are all constrained by their physical properties , such as frequency selectivity , environmental sensitivity , time behavior , and fixed nonlinear response .	Here , we show that electro-optic spatial light modulators ( SLMs ) can take the place of traditional nonlinear media , provided that there is a feedback between the shape of the object and the pattern on the modulator .	This feedback creates a designer illumination that generalizes the field of adaptive optics to include object-dependent patterns .	Unlike physical media , the SLM response can provide arbitrary mathematical functions , operate over broad bandwidths at high speeds , and work equally well at high power and single-photon levels .
4	So we obtain a direct relation between the non-relativistic gravity and the relativistic model : every classical exact solution leads to a solution of the field equation .	The wave type field equation $ \square \vt^a=\la \vt^a $ , where $ \vt^a $ is a coframe field on a space-time , was recently proposed to describe the gravity field .	This equation has a unique static , spherical-symmetric , asymptotically-flat solution , which leads to the viable Yilmaz-Rosen metric .	We show that the wave type field equation is satisfied by the pseudo-conformal frame if the conformal factor is determined by a scalar 3D-harmonic function .	This function can be related to the Newtonian potential of classical gravity .
0	It is argued that an electronically charged dilaton black hole can support a long range field of a Nielsen-Olesen string .	Combining both numerical and perturbative techniques we examine the properties of an Abelian-Higgs vortex in the presence of the black hole under consideration .	Allowing the black hole to approach extremality we found that all fields of the vortex are expelled from the extreme black hole .	In the thin string limit we obtained the metric of a conical electrically charged dilaton black hole .	The effect of the vortex can be measured from infinity justifying its characterization as black hole hair .
3	For the flat wall , interfacial free energies as a function of different densities of the LJ liquid and as a function of temperature along the coexistence curve are calculated .	Different computational techniques in combination with molecular dynamics computer simulation are used to to determine the wall-liquid and the wall-crystal interfacial free energies of a modified Lennard-Jones ( LJ ) system in contact with a solid wall .	Two different kinds of solid walls are considered : a flat structureless wall and a structured wall consisting of an ideal crystal with the particles rigidly attached to fcc lattice sites .	Interfacial free energies are determined by a thermodynamic integration scheme , the anisotropy of the pressure tensor , the non-equilibrium work method based on Bennett acceptance criteria , and a method using Cahn 's adsorption equations based on the interfacial thermodynamics of Gibbs .	In case of a structured wall , the interaction strength between the wall and the LJ system and the lattice constant of the structured wall are varied .
1	An English translation of the report by the latter was given before ( Stephenson & amp ; Green 2002 ) , but the original Arabic text was not yet published .	We present two Arabic texts of historic observations of supernova SN 1006 from Yemen as reported by al-Yamani and Ibn al-Dayba ( 14th to 16th century AD ) .	In addition , we present for the first time the earlier report , also from Yemen , namely by al-Yamani in its original Arabic and with our English translation .	It is quite obvious that the report by Ibn al-Dayba is based on the report by al-Yamani ( or a common source ) , but the earlier report by al-Yamani is more detailed and in better ( Arabic ) language .	We discuss in detail the dating of these observations .
0	We present a systematic analysis of point-contact Andreev reflection ( PCAR ) spectra for ferromagnetic materials , using both modeling and experimental data .	We consider the relationship between ballistic and diffusive transport , the effect of different transport regimes on spin polarization measurements , and the importance of unambiguous identification of the type of transport regime .	We find that in a realistic parameter range , the analysis of PCAR spectra of purely diffusive character by a ballistic model yield approximately the same ( within ~3 % ) values of the spin polarization and the barrier strength Z larger by ~ 0.5-0.6 .	We also consider the dependence of polarization values on Z , and have shown by simple modeling that letting the superconducting gap vary as an adjustable parameter can result in a spurious dependence of the spin-polarization Pc on Z .	At the same time we analyzed the effects of finite Z on the apparent value of Pc measured by the PCAR technique , using a large number of examples from both our own measurements and from the literature .
2	To address this problem , we propose a general direction of the use of computer games for pairing .	The secure `` pairing '' of wireless devices based on auxiliary or out-of-band ( OOB ) communication , such as audio , visual , or tactile channels , is a well-established research direction .	However , prior work shows that this approach to pairing can be prone to human errors of different forms that may directly or indirectly translate into man-in-the-middle attacks .	Since games are a popular means of entertainment , our hypothesis is that they may serve as an incentive to users and make the pairing process enjoyable for them , thus improving the usability , as well as the security , of the pairing process .	We consider an emerging use case of pairing whereby two different users are involved , each in possession of his or her own device ( e.g. , Alice and Bob pairing their smartphones for social interactions ) .
0	This paper is concerned with the development and analysis of an iterative solver for high-dimensional second-order elliptic problems based on subspace-based low-rank tensor formats .	Both the subspaces giving rise to low-rank approximations and corresponding sparse approximations of lower-dimensional tensor components are determined adaptively .	A principal obstruction to a simultaneous control of rank growth and accuracy turns out to be the fact that the underlying elliptic operator is an isomorphism only between spaces that are not endowed with cross norms .	Therefore , as central part of this scheme , we devise a method for preconditioning low-rank tensor representations of operators .	Under standard assumptions on the data , we establish convergence to the solution of the continuous problem with a guaranteed error reduction .
4	The development of mor e realistic models is needed in order to tune the criteria for searches of new such objects , a s well as to interpret data on the known objects .	We present hydrodynamical simulations , using a 2-D two component model ( ambient medium and pul sar wind have different specific heat ratios ) , of bow shocks in a representative regime for pu lsar wind driven bow-shock nebulae .	We also investigate the behaviour of a passive toroidal ma gnetic field wound around the pulsar velocity direction .	Moreover we estimate the opacity of t he bow-shock to penetration of ISM neutral hydrogen : this quantity affects observable properti es of the nebula , like its size , shape , velocity and surface brightness distribution .	Finally we compare these numerical results with those from an analytical model .
1	Let $ C ( X , E ) $ denote the Banach lattice of all continuous $ E $ -valued functions on $ X $ equipped with the pointwise ordering and the sup norm .	Let $ X $ and $ Y $ be compact Hausdorff spaces , and $ E $ , $ F $ be Banach lattices .	We prove that if there exists a Riesz isomorphism $ \mathnormal { \Phi } : C ( X , E ) \to C ( Y , F ) $ such that $ \mathnormal { \Phi } f $ is non-vanishing on $ Y $ if and only if $ f $ is non-vanishing on $ X $ , then $ X $ is homeomorphic to $ Y $ , and $ E $ is Riesz isomorphic to $ F $ .	In this case , $ \mathnormal { \Phi } $ can be written as a weighted composition operator : $ \mathnormal { \Phi } f ( y ) =\mathnormal { \Pi } ( y ) ( f ( \varphi ( y ) ) ) $ , where $ \varphi $ is a homeomorphism from $ Y $ onto $ X $ , and $ \mathnormal { \Pi } ( y ) $ is a Riesz isomorphism from $ E $ onto $ F $ for every $ y $ in $ Y $ .	This generalizes some known results obtained recently .
1	We study the structure of the push-forward of such a measure by a Hamiltonian flow .	Consider in the phase space of classical mechanics a Radon measure that is a probability density carried by the graph of a Lipschitz continuous ( or even less regular ) vector field .	In particular , we provide an estimate on the number of folds in the support of the transported measure that is the image of the initial graph by the flow .	We also study in detail the type of singularities in the projection of the transported measure in configuration space ( averaging out the momentum variable ) .	We study the conditions under which this projected measure can have atoms , and give an example in which the projected measure is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and diffuse .
2	In contrast to SC systems with periodic boundary conditions , where uniform configurations are maintained during the switching process , we found that domain structures appear with open boundary conditions .	We investigated domain growth in switching processes between the low-spin and high-spin phases in thermally induced hysteresis loops of spin-crossover ( SC ) solids .	Elastic interactions among the molecules induce effective long-range interactions , and thus the boundary condition plays a significant role in the dynamics .	Unlike Ising-like models with short-range interactions , domains always grow from the corners of the system .	The present clustering mechanism provides an insight into the switching dynamics of SC solids , in particular , in nano-scale systems .
0	Using a maximum-likelihood criterion , we derive optimal correlation strategies for signals with and without digitization .	We assume that the signals are drawn from zero-mean Gaussian distributions , as is expected in radio-astronomical applications , and we present correlation estimators both with and without a priori knowledge of the signal variances .	We demonstrate that traditional estimators of correlation , which rely on averaging products , exhibit large and paradoxical noise when the correlation is strong .	However , we also show that these estimators are fully optimal in the limit of vanishing correlation .	We calculate the bias and noise in each of these estimators and discuss their suitability for implementation in modern digital correlators .
0	Google 's Android is a comprehensive software framework for mobile communication devices ( i.e. , smartphones , PDAs ) .	The Android framework includes an operating system , middleware and a set of key applications .	The incorporation of integrated access services to the Internet on such mobile devices , however , increases their exposure to damages inflicted by various types of malware .	This paper provides a comprehensive security assessment of the Android framework and the security mechanisms incorporated into it .	A methodological qualitative risk analysis that we conducted identifies the high-risk threats to the framework and any potential danger to information or to the system resulting from vulnerabilities that have been uncovered and exploited .
3	A collection of combinatorial and statistical algorithms for locating , matching , prototyping , and classifying cellular populations from multi-parametric FC data is developed .	Flow cytometry ( FC ) is a single-cell profiling platform for measuring the phenotypes of individual cells from millions of cells in biological samples .	FC employs high-throughput technologies and generates high-dimensional data , and hence algorithms for analyzing the data represent a bottleneck .	This dissertation addresses several computational challenges arising in modern cytometry while mining information from high-dimensional and high-content biological data .	The algorithmic pipeline , flowMatch , developed in this dissertation consists of five well-defined algorithmic modules to ( 1 ) transform data to stabilize within-population variance , ( 2 ) identify cell populations by robust clustering algorithms , ( 3 ) register cell populations across samples , ( 4 ) encapsulate a class of samples with templates , and ( 5 ) classify samples based on their similarity with the templates .
2	This leads to the `` gluing equations '' and the Neumann-Zagier symplectic space .	We study here the space of representations of a fundamental group of a 3-manifold into PGL ( n , C ) .	Thurston , Neumann and Zagier initiated a strategy ( in the case of PGL ( 2 , C ) ) consisting in : triangulate the manifold , assign shapes to each pieces and then try to glue back .	Building on the works of Dimofte-Gabella-Goncharov and Bergeron-Falbel-Guilloux , we complete the picture in the case of PGL ( n , C ) .	We recover a situation very similar to the case of PGL ( 2 , C ) .
4	We next extend this model to incorporate the relevant Zeeman hyperfine states as well as a simple description of the pumping processes in the presence of polarization gradients and atomic motion .	Our recent paper reports the experimental realization of a one-atom laser in a regime of strong coupling ( Ref . [ 1 ] ) .	Here we provide the supporting theoretical analysis relevant to the operating regime of our experiment .	By way of a simplified four-state model , we investigate the passage from the domain of conventional laser theory into the regime of strong coupling for a single intracavity atom pumped by coherent external fields .	The four-state model is also employed to exhibit the vacuum-Rabi splitting and to calculate the optical spectrum .
4	Second , the properties of the stationary concentration field in the fully controlled case are studied to derive the remaining nucleation probability and thus to characterize the loss of nucleation control .	The properties of template-directed nucleation are studied close to the transition where full nucleation control is lost and additional nucleation occurs beyond the pre-patterned regions .	First , kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are performed to obtain information on a microscopic level .	Here the experimentally relevant cases of 1D stripe patterns and 2D square lattice symmetry are considered .	The nucleation properties in the transition region depend in a complex way on the parameters of the system , i.e.the flux , the surface diffusion constant , the geometric properties of the pattern and the desorption rate .
0	A representation of complex rational numbers in quantum mechanics is described that is not based on logical or physical qubits .	It stems from noting that the zeros in a product qubit state do not contribute to the number .	They serve only as place holders .	The representation is based on the distribution of four types of systems on an integer lattice .	The four types , labelled as positive real , negative real , positive imaginary , and negative imaginary , are represented by creation and annihilation operators acting on the system vacuum state .
4	An asymptotic theorem about Durfee squares , due to E.R .	The h-index was introduced by the physicist J.E .	Hirsch in 2005 as measure of a researcher 's productivity .	We consider the `` combinatorial Fermi problem '' of estimating h given the citation count .	Using the Euler-Gauss identity for integer partitions , we compute confidence intervals .
2	A DC pure spin current flowing in one superconducting wire towards another superconductor via a ferromagnet contact induces AC voltage oscillations caused by Josephson tunneling of condensate electrons .	Pure spin currents can be injected and detected in conductors via ferromagnetic contacts .	We consider the case when the conductors become superconducting .	Quasiparticles simultaneously counterflow resulting in zero total electric current through the contact .	The Josephson oscillations can be accompanied by Carlson-Goldman collective modes leading to a resonance in the voltage oscillation amplitude .
1	However , applications with input-dependent noise ( heteroscedastic residuals ) frequently arise in practice , as do applications in which the residuals do not have a Gaussian distribution .	Gaussian Process ( GP ) regression models typically assume that residuals are Gaussian and have the same variance for all observations .	In this paper , we propose a GP Regression model with a latent variable that serves as an additional unobserved covariate for the regression .	This model ( which we call GPLC ) allows for heteroscedasticity since it allows the function to have a changing partial derivative with respect to this unobserved covariate .	With a suitable covariance function , our GPLC model can handle ( a ) Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance , or ( b ) non-Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance , or ( c ) Gaussian residuals with constant variance .
0	A wealth of Galactic accreting X-ray binaries have been observed both in low/hard state and high/soft state .	The transition between these two states was often detected .	Observation shows that the transition luminosity between these two states is different for different sources , ranging from 1 % to 4 % of the Eddington luminosity .	Even for the same source the transition luminosity at different outbursts is also different .	The transition can occur from 0.0069 to 0.15 Eddington luminosity .
0	We improve on our earlier dynamical estimate of the virial masses of the haloes of Lyman-break galaxies ( LBGs ) at redshift z=3 by accounting for the effects of seeing , slit width , and observational uncertainties .	From an analysis of the small number of available rotation curves for LBGs we determine a relation Vc7= ( 1.9+/-0.2 ) sigma between circular velocity at a radius of 7kpc , and central line velocity width .	We use this relation to transform the measured velocity widths of 32 LBGs to the distribution of circular velocities , for the population of LBGs brighter than R=25.5 .	We compare this distribution against the predicted distribution for the 'massive-halo ' model in which LBGs pinpoint all of the highest mass dark matter haloes at that epoch .	The observed LBG circular velocities are smaller than the predicted circular velocities by a factor & gt ; 1.4+/-0.15 .
3	A numerical method is given for finding spherically symmetric compactly supported potentials which produce practically the same set of fixed-energy phase shifts for all values of angular momentum .	It is shown that the Newton-Sabatier procedure for inverting the fixed-energy phase shifts for a potential is not an inversion method but a parameter-fitting procedure .	Theoretically there is no guarantee that this procedure is applicable to the given set of the phase shifts , if it is applicable , there is no guaran- tee that the potential it produces generates the phase shifts from which it was reconstructed .	Moreover , no generic potential , specifically , no potential which is not analytic in a neighborhood of the positive real semiaxis can be reconstructed by the Newton-Sabatier procedure .	Concrete example of such potentials is given .
4	In fact , we prove that the sets of solutions to these inequalities have positive lower density .	This paper concerns the values of the Euler phi-function evaluated simultaneously on k arithmetic progressions a_1 n + b_1 , a_2 n + b_2 , ... , a_k n + b_k .	Assuming the necessary condition that no two of the polynomials a_i x + b_i are constant multiples of each other , we show that there are infinitely many integers n for which phi ( a_1 n + b_1 ) & gt ; phi ( a_2 n + b_2 ) & gt ; ... & gt ; phi ( a_k n + b_k ) .	In particular , there exist infinitely many strings of k consecutive integers whose phi-values are arranged from largest to smallest in any prescribed manner .	Also , under the necessary condition ad \ne bc , any inequality of the form phi ( an+b ) & lt ; phi ( cn+d ) infinitely often has k consecutive solutions .
4	Even though this leads to finite gate failure rates , the scheme is comparable with other quantum computing proposals .	It is commonly believed that decoherence is the main obstacle to quantum information processing .	In contrast to this , we show how decoherence in the form of dissipation can improve the performance of certain quantum gates .	As an example we consider the realisations of a controlled phase gate and a two-qubit SWAP operation with the help of a single laser pulse in atom-cavity systems .	In the presence of spontaneous decay rates , the speed of the gates can be improved by a factor 2 without sacrificing high fidelity and robustness against parameter fluctuations .
2	The stellar atmospheric parameters indicate that they all have surface gravities consistent with a present location on the red-giant branch , and metallicities of [ Fe/H ] = -2.0 ( HE 1305+0007 , HD 5223 ) and [ Fe/H ] = -1.3 ( HE 1152-0355 ) .	We present results of an analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with the Subaru Telescope High Dispersion Spectrograph , of two Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor stars , HE 1305+0007 and HE 1152-0355 , and of the classical CH star HD 5223 .	All of these stars have relatively low effective temperatures ( 4000-4750 K ) and high carbon abundances .	In addition to their large enhancements of carbon all three stars exhibit strong enhancements of the s-process elements relative to iron .	HE 1305+0007 exhibits a large enhancement of the 3rd-peak s-process element lead , with [ Pb/Fe ] = +2.37 , as well as a high abundance of the r-process element europium , [ Eu/Fe ] = +1.97 .
4	Consequently , the energy current between particles could be calculated even if the multi -- body interaction appeared .	Energy density and energy flux was introduced along Takesue 's method .	Particle energies were localized at particle positions using Dirac delta function .	The energy density was connected with the energy flux by continuity equation .	New method was proposed to deal with multi -- body interaction .
0	In this paper we study a two person zero sum stochastic differential game in weak formulation .	Unlike standard literature which uses strategy type of controls , the weak formulation allows us to consider the game with control against control .	We shall prove the existence of game value under natural conditions .	Another main feature of the paper is that we allow for non-Markovian structure , and thus the game value is a random process .	We characterize the value process as the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding path dependent Bellman-Isaacs equation , a notion recently introduced by Ekren , Keller , Touzi and Zhang ( arXiv:1109.5971 ) and Ekren , Touzi and Zhang .
2	In this limit , it is possible to engineer the potential and achieve coherent control of the output channels .	We provide a theoretical framework to describe the interaction of a propagating guided matter wave with a localized potential in terms of quantum scattering in a confined environment .	We analyze how this scattering correlates the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom and work out analytically the output state under the Born approximation using a Gaussian localized potential .	The robustness of this approximation is studied by comparing the stationary scattering theory to numerical simulations involving incident wave packets .	It remains valid in a domain of weak localized potential that is achievable experimentally .
2	The expected relationship between enhanced C , increasing C/O ratio and enhanced s-process elements has been quantified .	The results of a study of the AGB phase of stellar evolution are presented .	Abundances have been determined for Fe , C , O , the light s-process elements , Y and Zr , the heavy s-process elements , La and Nd , and the r-process element , Eu .	Results are presented to provide observational data with which to compare theoretical predictions .	The results in this paper confirm previously suggested relationships between C , C/O and s-process element enhancements .
2	Therefore , to apply the diquark picture to the phenomenological calculations , at the effective vertices for the diquark-gauge boson interactions , suitable form factors must be introduced to compensate the effects caused by the inner structure of the diquark .	The diquark structure in baryons is commonly accepted as a reasonable approximation which can much simplify the picture and reduce the length of calculations .	However , a diquark by no means is a point-like particle , even though it is treated as a whole object .	It is crucial to derive the appropriate form factors for various interactions .	In this work , we use the Bethe-Salpeter equation to derive such form factors and numerically evaluate their magnitudes .
0	The growing complexity of software systems as well as changing conditions in their operating environment demand systems that are more flexible , adaptive and dependable .	The service-oriented computing paradigm is in widespread use to support such adaptive systems , and , in many domains , adaptations may occur dynamically and in real time .	In addition , services from heterogeneous , possibly unknown sources may be used .	This motivates a need to ensure the correct behaviour of the adapted systems , and its continuing compliance to time bounds and other QoS properties .	The complexity of dynamic adaptation ( DA ) is significant , but currently not well understood or formally specified .
1	The fibers are assumed to share the load equally , and to obey Hookean elasticity up to the breaking point .	A bundle of many fibers with stochastically distributed breaking thresholds is considered as a model of composite materials .	The bundle is slightly overloaded , which leads to complete failure .	We study the properties of emission bursts in which an amount of energy $ E $ is released .	The analysis shows that the size of the energy bursts has a minimum when the system is half-way from the collapse point .
1	They are an expanded version of lectures given in Stony Brook in Spring 1992 .	The following notes provide an introduction to recent work of Branner , Hubbard and Yoccoz on the geometry of polynomial Julia sets .	I am indebted to help from the audience .	Section 1 describes unpublished work by J.-C. Yoccoz on local connectivity of quadratic Julia sets .	It presents only the `` easy '' part of his work , in the sense that it considers only non-renormalizable polynomials , and makes no effort to describe the much more difficult arguments which are needed to deal with local connectivity in parameter space .
4	In IIA , this corresponds to a dielectric D2-brane carrying only D0-charge .	We present a sample microstate for a black ring in four and five dimensional language .	The microstate consists of a black string microstate with an additional D6-brane .	We show that with an appropriate choice of parameters the piece involving the black string microstate falls down a long AdS throat , whose M-theory lift is AdS_3 X S^2 .	We wrap a spinning dipole M2-brane on the S^2 in the probe approximation .
0	Recent study of gamma rays originating from the region of galactic centre has confirmed an anomalous $ \gamma $ -ray excess within the energy range 1-3 GeV .	This can be explained as the consequence of pair annihilation of a 31-40 GeV dark matter into $ b \bar b $ with thermal annihilation cross-section $ \sigma v \sim 1.4-2.0 \times 10^ { -26 } ~\rm { cm^3/s } $ .	In this work we revisit the Inert Doublet Model ( IDM ) in order to explain this gamma ray excess .	Taking the lightest inert particle ( LIP ) as a stable DM candidate we show that a 31-40 GeV dark matter derived from IDM will fail to satisfy experimental limits on dark matter direct detection cross-section obtained from ongoing direct detection experiments and is also inconsistent with LHC findings .	We show that a singlet extended inert doublet model can easily explain the reported $ \gamma $ -ray excess which is as well in agreement with Higgs search results at LHC and other observed results like DM relic density and direct detection constraints .
4	The CO ( 2-1 ) / ( 1-0 ) ratio in this envelope is & gt ; ~3 , a value consistent with optically thin CO emission .	We present a study of carbon in N159/N160 , an HII region complex in the low metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud .	We have mapped this region , which comprises four distinct molecular clouds spanning a wide range of star-formation activity , in four transitions : 13CO ( 1-0 ) CO ( 2-1 ) and ( 4-3 ) , and [ CI ] ( 1-0 ) .	Combining these data with existing [ CII ] observations provides a complete picture of the predominant forms of carbon in the gas phase of the ISM .	The new CO ( 2-1 ) data show that the complex is immersed in an envelope of extended , low level emission , undetected by previous ( 1-0 ) mapping efforts .
1	Our method has six different but equivalent interpretations : sketch-and-project , constrain-and-approximate , random intersect , random linear solve , random update and random fixed point .	We develop a novel , fundamental and surprisingly simple randomized iterative method for solving consistent linear systems .	By varying its two parameters $ - $ a positive definite matrix ( defining geometry ) , and a random matrix ( sampled in an independently and identically distributed fashion in each iteration ) $ - $ we recover a comprehensive array of well-known algorithms as special cases , including the randomized Kaczmarz method , randomized Newton method , randomized coordinate descent method and random Gaussian pursuit .	We naturally also obtain variants of all these methods using blocks and importance sampling .	However , our method allows for a much wider selection of these two parameters , which leads to a number of new specific methods .
0	State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods are based on expressing each data point as a linear combination of other data points while regularizing the matrix of coefficients with $ \ell_1 $ , $ \ell_2 $ or nuclear norms .	$ \ell_1 $ regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity ( i.e. , there are no connections between points from different subspaces ) under broad theoretical conditions , but the clusters may not be connected .	$ \ell_2 $ and nuclear norm regularization often improve connectivity , but give a subspace-preserving affinity only for independent subspaces .	Mixed $ \ell_1 $ , $ \ell_2 $ and nuclear norm regularizations offer a balance between the subspace-preserving and connectedness properties , but this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity .	This paper studies the geometry of the elastic net regularizer ( a mixture of the $ \ell_1 $ and $ \ell_2 $ norms ) and uses it to derive a provably correct and scalable active set method for finding the optimal coefficients .
0	Electron-like carriers in bismuth are described by the Dirac Hamiltonian , with a band mass becoming a thousandth of the bare electron mass along one crystalline axis .	The existence of three anisotropic valleys offers electrons an additional degree of freedom , a subject of recent attention .	Here , we map the Landau spectrum by angle-resolved magnetostriction , and quantify the carrier number in each valley : while the electron valleys keep identical spectra , they substantially differ in their density of states at the Fermi level .	Thus , the electron fluid does not keep the rotational symmetry of the lattice at low temperature and high magnetic field , even in the absence of internal strain .	This effect , reminiscent of the Coulomb pseudo-gap in localized electronic states , affects only electrons in the immediate vicinity of the Fermi level .
3	We analyze the resultant RG equations , derive an analytical condition for such a drive to take the system out of the gaussian regime , and show that the onset of the non-gaussian regime occurs concomitantly with appearance of non-perturbative mode coupling terms in the effective action of the system .	We use a perturbative momentum shell renormalization group ( RG ) approach to study the properties of a driven quantum system at zero temperature .	To illustrate the technique , we consider a bosonic $ \phi^4 $ theory with an arbitrary time dependent interaction parameter $ \lambda ( t ) =\lambda f ( \omega_0 t ) $ , where $ \omega_0 $ is the drive frequency and derive the RG equations for the system using a Keldysh diagrammatic technique .	We show that the scaling of $ \omega_0 $ is analogous to that of temperature for a system in thermal equilibrium and its presence provides a cutoff scale for the RG flow .	We supplement the above-mentioned results by obtaining them from equations of motions of the bosons and discuss their significance for systems near critical points described by time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg theories .
2	Hipparcos astrometry reveals the orbital inclinations and masses for three of the ( more massive ) companions , and it provides upper limits to the masses for the rest .	Ten new low mass companions have emerged from the Keck precision Doppler velocity survey , with minimum ( msini ) masses ranging from 0.8 mjup to 0.34 msun .	Five of these are planet candidates with msini & lt ; 12 mjup , two are brown dwarf candidates with msini ~30 mjup , and three are low mass stellar companions .	A new class of extrasolar planet is emerging , characterized by nearly circular orbits and orbital radii greater than 1 AU .	The planet HD 4208b appears to be a member of this new class .
0	It is well known that carriers of astrophysical information are massless spinning particles .	These carriers are photons , neutrinos and , expectedly , gravitons .	All these particles are emitted during supernova events .	Information carried by these particles characterize their sources , but such information are affected by the trajectories of the carriers .	Recently , it is shown that these trajectories are spin dependent .
0	The standard theory of metals , Fermi liquid theory , hinges on the key assumption that although the electrons interact , the low-energy excitation spectrum stands in a one-to-one correspondence with that of a non-interacting system .	In the normal state of the copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors , drastic deviations from the Fermi liquid picture obtain , highlighted by a pseudogap , broad spectral features and $ T- $ linear resistivity .	This article focuses on the series of experiments on the copper-oxide superconductors which reveal that the number of low-energy addition states per electron per spin exceeds unity , in direct violation of the key Fermi liquid tenet .	These experiments point to new degrees of freedom , not made out of the elemental excitations , as the key mechanism by which Fermi liquid theory breaks down in the cuprates .	A recent theoretical advance which permits an explicit integration of the high energy scale in the standard model for the cuprates reveals the source of the new dynamical degrees of freedom at low energies , a charge 2e bosonic field which has nothing to do with pairing but rather represents the mixing with the high energy scales .
2	Specifically we achieve explicit and tractable forms of the posterior and the marginal distributions , including an explicit and easily used description of generalizations of the important Blackwell-MacQueen P\'olya urn distribution .	One of the main research areas in Bayesian Nonparametrics is the proposal and study of priors which generalize the Dirichlet process .	Here we exploit theoretical properties of Poisson random measures in order to provide a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of random probabilities which are obtained by an appropriate normalization .	Such simplifications are achieved by the use of a latent variable which admits quite interesting interpretations which allow to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of these random probability measures .	It is noteworthy that these models are generalizations of models considered by Kingman ( 1975 ) in a non-Bayesian context .
0	We examine the radial asymptotic behavior of spherically symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi dust models by looking at their covariant scalars along radial rays , which are spacelike geodesics parametrized by proper length $ \ell $ , orthogonal to the 4-velocity and to the orbits of SO ( 3 ) .	By introducing quasi-local scalars defined as integral functions along the rays , we obtain a complete and covariant representation of the models , leading to an initial value parametrization in which all scalars can be given by scaling laws depending on two metric scale factors and two basic initial value functions .	Considering regular `` open '' LTB models whose space slices allow for a diverging $ \ell $ , we provide the conditions on the radial coordinate so that its asymptotic limit corresponds to the limit as $ \ell\to\infty $ .	The `` asymptotic state '' is then defined as this limit , together with asymptotic series expansion around it , evaluated for all metric functions , covariant scalars ( local and quasi-local ) and their fluctuations .	By looking at different sets of initial conditions , we examine and classify the asymptotic states of parabolic , hyperbolic and open elliptic models admitting a symmetry center .
1	{ \bf 98 } , 044502 ( 2007 ) ] .	The VKS experiment has evidenced dynamo action in a highly turbulent liquid sodium von K\'arm\'an flow [ R. Monchaux et al. , Phys.Rev.Lett .	However , the existence and the onset of a dynamo happen to depend on the exact experimental configuration .	By performing kinematic dynamo simulations on real flows , we study their influence on dynamo action , in particular the sense of rotation and the presence of an annulus in the shear layer plane .	The 3 components of the mean velocity fields are measured in a water prototype for different VKS configurations through Stereoscopic Particle Imaging Velocimetry .
0	We carry out a study of the hardness of the radiation of ionizing clusters in HII regions .	Firstly , we explore the applicability of the softness parameter , originally defined in the optical for pairs of consecutive ionization stages of the same species .	With the advent of the infrared space observatories , this definition has been extended to the mid-infrared .	We show that the softness parameters , as determined both in the optical and the mid-infrared wavelengths , are sensitive to the effective temperature using a sample of data in both spectral regimes .	This is confirmed by comparing the data with a grid of photoionization models , although no complete agreement has been found even for different stellar model atmospheres .
3	According to theoretical simulations and experimental results the TM-rich regions appear either in the form of nanodots ( the { \em dairiseki } phase ) or nanocolumns ( the { \em konbu } phase ) buried in the host semiconductor .	This review presents the recent progress in computational materials design , experimental realization , and control methods of spinodal nanodecomposition under three- and two-dimensional crystal-growth conditions in spintronic materials , such as magnetically doped semiconductors .	The computational description of nanodecomposition , performed by combining first-principles calculations with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations , is discussed together with extensive electron microscopy , synchrotron radiation , scanning probe , and ion beam methods that have been employed to visualize binodal and spinodal nanodecomposition ( chemical phase separation ) as well as nanoprecipitation ( crystallographic phase separation ) in a range of semiconductor compounds with a concentration of transition metal ( TM ) impurities beyond the solubility limit .	The role of growth conditions , co-doping by shallow impurities , kinetic barriers , and surface reactions in controlling the aggregation of magnetic cations is highlighted .	Particular attention is paid to Mn-doped group III arsenides and antimonides , TM-doped group III nitrides , Mn- and Fe-doped Ge , and Cr-doped group II chalcogenides , in which ferromagnetic features persisting up to above room temperature correlate with the presence of nanodecomposition and account for the application-relevant magneto-optical and magnetotransport properties of these compounds .
3	Further , we have Monte-Carlo simulated the data from this run on a star-by-star basis to produce robust detection constraints .	We report first results from the Anglo-Australian Telescope Rocky Planet Search - an intensive , high-precision Doppler planet search targeting low-mass exoplanets in contiguous 48 night observing blocks .	On this run we targeted 24 bright , nearby and intrinsically stable Sun-like stars selected from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search 's main sample .	These observations have already detected one low-mass planet reported elsewhere ( HD16417b ) , and here we reconfirm the detection of HD4308b .	These simulations demonstrate clear differences in the exoplanet detectability functions from star to star due to differences in sampling , data quality and intrinsic stellar stability .
4	These observations reveal complex jet dynamics which are well explained by a spine-sheath structure supported by the downstream acceleration occurring where the jet becomes optically thin .	The jet-counterjet system of the closest radio-loud active galaxy Centaurus A ( Cen A ) can be studied with Very Long Baseline Interferometry ( VLBI ) on unprecedented small linear scales of ~0.018pc .	These high-resolution observations provide essential information on jet emission and propagation within the inner parsec of an AGN jet .	We present the results of a kinematic study performed within the framework of the Southern-hemisphere AGN monitoring program TANAMI .	Over 3.5years , the evolution of the central-parsec jet structure of Cen A was monitored with VLBI .
1	Cavitation can spontaneously occur , nucleating a bubble .	Water under tension , as can be found in several systems including tree vessels , is metastable .	We investigate the dynamics of spon- taneous or triggered cavitation inside water filled microcavities of a hydrogel .	Results show that a stable bubble is created in only a microsecond timescale , after transient oscillations .	Then , a diffusion driven expansion leads to filling of the cavity .
0	We study the influence of a high density behaviour of the nuclear symmetry energy on a kaon condensation in neutron stars .	We find that the symmetry energy typical for several realistic nuclear potentials , which decreases at high densities , inhibits kaon condensation for weaker kaon-nucleon couplings .	There exists a threshold coupling above which the kaon condensate forms at densities exceeding some critical value .	This is in contrast to the case of rising symmetry energy , as e.g.for relativistic mean field models , when the kaon condensate can form for any coupling at a sufficiently high density .	Properties of the condensate are also different in both cases .
3	The first transformation considered is that of Geronimus type , two different methods are developed .	In this paper transformations for matrix orthogonal polynomials in the real line are studied .	The orthogonality is understood in a broad sense , and is given in terms of a nondegenerate continuous sesquilinear form , which in turn is determined by a quasidefinite matrix of bivariate generalized functions with a well defined support .	The discussion of the orthogonality for such a sesquilinear form includes , among others , matrix Hankel cases with linear functionals , general matrix Sobolev orthogonality and discrete orthogonal polynomials with an infinite support .	A spectral one , based on the spectral properties of the perturbing polynomial , and constructed in terms of the second kind functions .
0	Galaxies above redshift 1 can be very clumpy , with irregular morphologies dominated by star complexes as large as 2 kpc and as massive as a few 10^8 or 10^9 Mo .	Their co-moving densities and rapid evolution suggest that most present-day spirals could have formed through a clumpy phase .	The clumps may form by gravitational instabilities in gas-rich turbulent disks ; they do not appear to be separate galaxies merging together .	We show here that the formation of the observed clumps requires initial disks of gas and stars with almost no stabilizing bulge or stellar halo .	This can not be achieved in models where disk galaxies grow by mergers .
0	The relative importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors determining the variety of geometric shapes exhibited by dendritic trees remains unclear .	This question was addressed by developing a model of the growth of dendritic trees based on diffusion-limited aggregation process .	The model reproduces diverse neuronal shapes ( i.e. , granule cells , Purkinje cells , the basal and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells , and the axonal trees of interneurons ) by changing only the size of the growth area , the time span of pruning , and the spatial concentration of 'neurotrophic particles ' .	Moreover , the presented model shows how competition between neurons can affect the shape of the dendritic trees .	The model reveals that the creation of complex ( but reproducible ) dendrite-like trees does not require precise guidance or an intrinsic plan of the dendrite geometry .
4	This makes it easy to preserve the perturbative unification .	We present a new , simple supersymmetry breaking model with direct gauge mediation .	Supersymmetry breaking sector is based on the model with an Affine quantum moduli space .	The model has no gauge messengers and no light scalars charged under the Standard Model which give a negative contribution to the soft masses .	Large expectation value at the minimum is obtained by balancing the runaway potential and the dimension six nonrenormalizable term .
4	It allows , starting with divergent perturbation series in powers of an asymptotically small parameter , to construct expressions extrapolating asymptotic series to arbitrary values of the parameter , including its infinite limit .	Nuclear matter at finite temperature and barion density exhibits several phase transitions that could happen at the early stages of the Universe evolution and could be realized in heavy-ion or hadron-hadron collisions .	Microscopic description of phase transitions is notoriously difficult because of the absence of small parameters .	Here we present a general approach allowing to treat situations , when there are no small parameters .	The approach is based on optimized perturbation theory and self-similar approximation theory .
0	The production of the heavy $ ( c\bar { c } ) $ -quarkonium , $ ( c\bar { b } ) $ -quarkonium and $ ( b\bar { b } ) $ -quarkonium states ( $ ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) $ -quarkonium for short ) , via the $ W^+ $ semi-inclusive decays , has been systematically studied within the framework of the non-relativistic QCD .	In addition to the two color-singlet $ S $ -wave states , we also discuss the production of the four color-singlet $ P $ -wave states $ | ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) ( ^1P_1 ) _ { \bf 1 } & gt ; $ and $ ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) ( ^3P_J ) _ { \bf 1 } & gt ; $ ( with $ J= ( 1,2,3 ) $ ) together with the two color-octet components $ | ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) ( ^1S_0 ) _ { \bf 8 } & gt ; $ and $ | ( Q\bar { Q ' } ) ( ^3S_1 ) _ { \bf 8 } & gt ; $ .	Improved trace technology is adopted to derive the simplified analytic expressions at the amplitude level , which shall be useful for dealing with the following cascade decay channels .	At the LHC with the luminosity $ { \cal L } \propto 10^ { 34 } cm^ { -2 } s^ { -1 } $ and the center-of-mass energy $ \sqrt { S } =14 $ TeV , sizable heavy-quarkonium events can be produced through the $ W^+ $ boson decays , i.e. $ 2.57\times10^6 $ $ \eta_c $ , $ 2.65\times10^6 $ $ J/\Psi $ and $ 2.40\times10^6 $ $ P $ -wave charmonium events per year can be obtained ; and $ 1.01\times10^5 $ $ B_c $ , $ 9.11\times10^4 $ $ B^*_c $ and $ 3.16\times10^4 $ $ P $ -wave $ ( c\bar { b } ) $ -quarkonium events per year can be obtained .	Main theoretical uncertainties have also been discussed .

3	This resolves a conjecture of Bohman and Keevash for the K_4-free process and improves on previous bounds obtained by Bollob\'as and Riordan and by Osthus and Taraz .	The K_4-free process starts with the empty graph on n vertices and at each step adds a new edge chosen uniformly at random from all remaining edges that do not complete a copy of K_4 .	Let G be the random maximal K_4-free graph obtained at the end of the process .	We show that for some positive constant C , with high probability as $ n \to \infty $ , the maximum degree in G is at most $ C n^ { 3/5 } \sqrt [ 5 ] { \log n } $ .	Combined with results of Bohman and Keevash this shows that with high probability G has $ \Theta ( n^ { 8/5 } \sqrt [ 5 ] { \log n } ) $ edges and is `nearly regular ' , i.e. , every vertex has degree $ \Theta ( n^ { 3/5 } \sqrt [ 5 ] { \log n } ) $ .
4	An estimate of the transducer conversion efficiency on the order of unity comes out of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for an extreme type II , dissipationless superconductor with minimal coupling to weak gravitational and electromagnetic radiation fields , whose frequency is smaller than the BCS gap frequency , thus satisfying the quantum adiabatic theorem .	One of the conceptual tensions between quantum mechanics ( QM ) and general relativity ( GR ) arises from the clash between the spatial nonseparability of entangled states in QM , and the complete spatial separability of all physical systems in GR , i.e. , between the nonlocality implied by the superposition principle , and the locality implied by the equivalence principle .	Experimental consequences of this conceptual tension will be explored for macroscopically coherent quantum fluids , such as superconductors , superfluids , and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates ( BECs ) , subjected to tidal and Lense-Thirring fields arising from gravitational radiation .	A Meissner-like effect is predicted , in which the Lense-Thirring field is expelled from the bulk of a quantum fluid .	Superconductors are predicted to be macroscopic quantum gravitational antennas and transducers , which can directly convert upon reflection a beam of quadrupolar electromagnetic radiation into gravitational radiation , and vice versa , and thus serve as both sources and receivers of gravitational waves .
2	We apply this g-theorem to the D5-brane solution which is an asymptotically AdS_4 x S^2 brane in AdS_5 x S^5 .	We investigate relevant deformation and the renormalization group flow in a defect conformal field theory from the point of view of the holography .	We propose a candidate of g-function in the context of the holography , and prove the g-theorem : the g-function is monotonically non-increasing along the RG flow .	This solution corresponds to the mass deformation of the defect CFT .	We checked that the g-function is monotonically non-increasing in this solution .
1	By this definition , we can consider the stochastic reflection problem associated with a self-adjoint operator $ A $ and a cylindrical Wiener process on a convex set $ \Gamma $ in a Hilbert space $ H $ .	In this paper , we introduce a definition of BV functions in a Gelfand triple which is an extension of the definition of BV functions in [ 2 ] by using Dirichlet form theory .	We prove the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution of this problem when $ \Gamma $ is a regular convex set .	The result is also extended to the non-symmetric case .	Finally , we extend our results to the case when $ \Gamma=K_\alpha $ , where $ K_\alpha= { f\in L^2 ( 0,1 ) |f\geq -\alpha } , \alpha\geq0 $ .
4	The obtained transfer equation can be considered as a generalization of the classic vector radiative transfer equation that is only valid for uniform refractive index media .	Light transport in graded index media follows a curved trajectory determined by the Fermat 's principle .	Besides the effect of variation of the refractive index on the transport of radiative intensity , the curved ray trajectory will induce geometrical effects on the transport of polarization ellipse .	This paper presents a complete derivation of vector radiative transfer equation for polarized radiation transport in absorption , emission and scattering graded index media .	The derivation is based on the analysis of the conserved quantities for polarized light transport along curved trajectory and a novel approach .
2	More importantly , sphingolipid metabolism disorders were observed in various pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegeneration .	Background : Sphingolipids - as suggested by the prefix in their name - are mysterious molecules , which play surprisingly various roles in opposable cellular processes , like autophagy , apoptosis , proliferation and differentiation .	Recently they have been also recognized as important messengers in cellular signalling pathways .	Results : Existing formal models of sphingolipids metabolism concentrates mostly on de novo ceramide synthesis or restrict their focus to biochemical transformations of a particular subspecies .	We propose first comprehensive computational model of sphingolipid metabolism in human tissue .
3	We solve the Euler-Lagrange equations numerically with the appropriate boundary conditions for the director and density field and investigate the orientation and density profile within a sphere .	We investigate the tight packing of nematic polymers inside a confining hard sphere .	We model the polymer { \sl via } the continuum Frank elastic free energy augmented by a simple density dependent part as well as by taking proper care of the connectivity of the polymer chains when compared with simple nematics .	The free energy { \sl ansatz } is capable of describing an orientational ordering transition within the sample between an isotropic polymer solution and a polymer nematic phase .	Two important parameters of the solution are the exact locations of the beginning and the end of the polymer chain .
3	We developed a mathematical model to understand the physics of the system .	We observed the effect of radiation pressure on the angular sensing and control system of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) interferometer 's core optics at LIGO Hanford Observatory .	This is the first measurement of this effect in a complete gravitational wave interferometer .	Only one of the two angular modes survives with feedback control , since the other mode is suppressed when the control gain is sufficiently large .	This model matches well the dynamics that we observe .
0	Nuclear liquid drop model is revisited and an explicit introduction of the surface-curvature terms is presented .	The corresponding parameters of the extended classical energy formula are adjusted to the contemporarily known nuclear binding energies and fission barrier heights .	Using 2766 binding energies of nuclei with $ Z\geq 8 $ and $ N\geq 8 $ it is shown that the performance of the new approach is improved by a factor of about 6 , compared to the previously published liquid drop model results , in terms of both the masses ( new r.m.s .	deviation $ & lt ; \delta M & gt ; = 0.698 $ MeV ) and the fission barriers ( new r.m.s .	deviation of the fission barriers of isotopes with $ Z & gt ; 70 $ is $ & lt ; \delta V_B & gt ; = 0.88 $ MeV ) .
3	Namely : ( $ i $ ) - physically meaningless part of standard cold curve $ ( U ( \rho ) $ at $ T \rightarrow 0 ) $ disappears totally from new version of GCC .	Non-standard representation for so-called `` cold curve '' of matter ( i.e.isotherm $ T = 0 $ ) is proposed as Global Cold Curve ( GCC ) .	The main point is that chemical potential of substance , $ \mu $ , plays role of ruling parameter in basic GCC-dependence of internal energy under compression , $ U = U ( \mu ) $ , in contrast to the standard form $ U = U ( \rho ) $ .	This substitution changes radically low-density ( `` gaseous '' ) part of GCC .	This deleted part corresponded to absolutely thermodynamically unstable states in standard representation $ U ( \rho ) $ ; ( $ ii $ ) - new gaseous branch of cold curve , $ U = U ( \mu ) $ , comes in GCC .
3	As an application of the `` constant '' t-structures techniques we prove that every bounded nondegenerate t-structure on $ D ( X ) $ with Noetherian heart is invariant under the action of a connected group of autoequivalences of $ D ( X ) $ .	We generalize the construction given in math.AG/0309435 of a `` constant '' t-structure on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $ D ( X\times S ) $ starting with a t-structure on $ D ( X ) $ .	Namely , we remove smoothness and quasiprojectivity assumptions on $ X $ and $ S $ and work with t-structures that are not necessarily Noetherian but are close to Noetherian in the appropriate sense .	The main new tool is the construction of induced t-structures that uses unbounded derived categories of quasicoherent sheaves and relies on the results of \cite { AJS } .	Also , we show that if $ X $ is smooth then the only local t-structures on $ D ( X ) $ , i.e. , those for which there exist compatible t-structures on $ D ( U ) $ for all open $ U\subset X $ , are the perverse t-structures considered in math.AG/0005152 .
4	For many years , methods based on bisector techniques were used but they give a reliable results only for some specific conditions and in most cases can not be applied .	For many years various asymmetrical profiles of different spectral lines emitted from solar flares have been frequently observed .	These asymmetries or line shifts are caused predominantly by vertical mass motions in flaring layers and they provide a good diagnostics for plasma flows during solar flares .	There are many controversial results of observations and theoretical analysis of plasma flows in solar chromospheric flares .	The main difficulty is the interpretation of line shifts or asymmetries .
4	We analyse the current and the cross correlation of currents in a superconductor ferromagnet beamsplitter including spin-active scattering .	Splitting of Cooper pairs has recently been realized experimentally for s-wave Cooper pairs .	A split Cooper pair represents an entangled two-electron pair state which has possible application in on-chip quantum computation .	Likewise the spin-activity of interfaces in nanoscale tunnel junctions has been investigated theoretically and experimentally in recent years .	However , the possible implications of spin-active interfaces in Cooper pair splitters so far have not been investigated .
4	We analyze how close we are to obtaining the continuum results .	We study the dynamics of $ \phi^4 $ theory and the FPU $ \beta $ model under thermal gradients , from first principles .	We analyze quantitatively how local equilibrium and linear response are violated , paying special care to how we find observables that unambiguously display these violations .	Relations between these quantities to equations of state are also examined .	Further , we discuss how we can approach similar dynamical problems in continuum quantum field theory .
3	Very good agreement between the experiment and theory is found .	The orthoperovskites TbCoO $ _3 $ and DyCoO $ _3 $ with Co $ ^ { 3+ } $ in a non-magnetic low-spin state have been investigated by neutron diffraction down to 0.25 K. Magnetic ordering is evidenced below $ T_N=3.3 $ K and 3.6 K , respectively , and the ordered arrangements are of canted type , A $ _x $ G $ _y $ for TbCoO $ _3 $ and G $ _x $ A $ _y $ for DyCoO $ _3 $ in Bertaut 's notation .	The experiments are confronted with the first-principle calculations of the crystal field and magnetism of Tb $ ^ { 3+ } $ and Dy $ ^ { 3+ } $ ions , located in the $ Pbnm $ structure on sites of $ C_s $ point symmetry .	Both these ions exhibit an Ising behavior , which originates in the lowest energy levels , in particular in accidental doublet of non-Kramers Tb $ ^ { 3+ } $ ( $ 4f^8 $ configuration ) and in ground Kramers doublet of Dy $ ^ { 3+ } $ ( $ 4f^9 $ ) and it is the actual reason for the non-collinear AFM structures .	For comparison , calculations of the crystal field and magnetism for other systems with Kramers ions , NdCoO $ _3 $ and SmCoO $ _3 $ , are also included .
2	In this picture the evolution of the universe is represented by motion of a fictitious particle in the one-dimensional potential $ V ( a ) $ or V ( z ) $ where $ a $ is the scale factor and $ z $ is the redshift .	We show the effectiveness of using the procedure of the potential reconstruction ( the V-method ) in the estimation of the transition redshift corresponding to switch from deceleration to acceleration phase of the Universe .	We investigate the FRW models with dark energy by applying the particle-like description of their dynamics .	The V-method solves the inverse problem where we reconstruct the potential function from empirical data .	We use the Riess et al .
3	This result is also valid if these domains contain an inner `` elliptic '' region with positive curvature undergoing local collapse .	We provide a comprehensive analytic study ( rigorous and qualitative ) of the conditions for the existence of a a positive kinematic back reaction term $ \QQ & gt ; 0 $ , in the context of Buchert 's scalar averaging formalism applied to spherically symmetric Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi ( LTB ) dust solutions in which averaging domains are given as spherical comoving regions containing a symmetry center .	We introduce proper volume and quasi-local average functionals and functions in order to examine the conditions for $ \QQ\geq 0 $ , and in the process we also explore the relation between back reaction , spatial curvature and binding energy for a wide variety of LTB configurations .	The back reaction term is positive for all `` hyperbolic '' regular domains with negative spatial curvature , either in the full radial range or in the radial asymptotic range .	For some cases in which positive spatial curvature decreases asymptotically , the conditions for a positive back reaction can still be met but seem to be more restrictive .
3	This means that small excitations moving in only one direction may be very long lived , and so the size of the smallest scales in a string network might be much smaller than what one would expect from gravitational back reaction .	We calculate the gravitational radiation emitted by an infinite cosmic string with two oppositely moving wave-trains , in the small amplitude approximation .	After comparing our result to the previously studied cases we extend the results to a new regime where the wavelengths of the opposing wave-trains are very different .	We show that in this case the amount of power radiated vanishes exponentially .	This result allows for a potential host of interesting cosmological possibilities involving ultra-high energy cosmic rays , gamma ray bursts and gravitational wave bursts .
0	We illustrate how to apply modern effective field theory techniques and dimensional regularization to factorise the various scales which appear in QED bound states at finite temperature .	We focus here on the muonic hydrogen atom .	Vacuum polarization effects make the physics of this atom at finite temperature very close to that of heavy quarkonium states .	We comment on the implications of our results for these states in the quark gluon plasma .	In particular , we estimate the effects of a finite charm quark mass in the dissociation temperature of bottomonium .
0	In a recent preprint ( arXiv:1401.1128v1 ) Cilibrizzi and co-workers report experiments and simulations showing the scattering of polaritons against a localised obstacle in a semiconductor microcavity .	The authors observe in the linear excitation regime the formation of density and phase patterns reminiscent of those expected in the non-linear regime from the nucleation of dark solitons .	Based on this observation , they conclude that previous theoretical and experimental reports on dark solitons in a polariton system should be revised .	Here we comment why the results from Cilibrizzi et al .	take place in a very different regime than previous investigations on dark soliton nucleation and do not reproduce all the signatures of its rich nonlinear phenomenology .
0	The galactic neighborhood , extending from the Milky Way to redshifts of about 0.1 , is our unique local laboratory for detailed study of galaxies and their interplay with the environment .	Such study provides a foundation of knowledge for interpreting observations of more distant galaxies and their environment .	The Astro 2010 Science Frontier Galactic Neighborhood Panel identified four key scientific questions : 1 ) What are the flows of matter and energy in the circumgalactic medium ?	2 ) What controls the mass-energy-chemical cycles within galaxies ?	3 ) What is the fossil record of galaxy assembly from first stars to present ?
3	In this work , we have studied the chaoticity properties of FIGARCH ( p , d , q ) processes by computing mutual information , correlation dimensions , FNNs ( False Nearest Neighbour ) , the Lyapunov exponents , and for both the stochastic difference equation given above and for the financial time series .	Fractionally integrated generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( FIGARCH ) arises in modeling of financial time series .	FIGARCH is essentially governed by a system of nonlinear stochastic difference equations $ { u_t } $ = $ { z_t } $ $ ( 1-\sum\limits_ { j=1 } ^q \beta_j L^j ) \sigma_ { t } ^2 = \omega+ ( 1-\sum\limits_ { j=1 } ^q \beta_j L^j - ( \sum\limits_ { k=1 } ^p \varphi_k L^k ) ( 1-L ) ^d ) u_t^2 $ , where $ \omega\in $ R , and $ \beta_j\in $ R are constant parameters , $ \ { u_t\ } _ { { t\in } ^+ } $ and $ \ { \sigma_t\ } _ { { t\in } ^+ } $ are the discrete time real valued stochastic processes which represent FIGARCH ( p , d , q ) and stochastic volatility , respectively .	Moreover , L is the backward shift operator , i.e. $ L^d u_t \equiv u_ { t-d } $ ( d is the fractional differencing parameter 0 $ & lt ; $ d $ & lt ; $ 1 ) .	We have observed that maximal Lyapunov exponents are negative , therefore , it can be suggested that FIGARCH ( p , d , q ) is not deterministic chaotic process .
0	Product quality level is become a key factor for companies ' competitiveness .	A lot of time and money are required to ensure and guaranty it .	Besides , motivated by the need of traceability , collecting production data is now commonplace in most companies .	Our paper aims to show that we can ensure the required quality thanks to an `` on-line quality approch '' and proposes a neural network based process to determine the optimal setting for production machines .	We will illustrate this with the Acta-Mobilier case , which is a high quality lacquerer company .
1	Growing dynamic length scales due to cooperative motion of particles are believed to be central to the understanding of both the slow dynamics and the emergence of rigidity .	Glasses behave as solids due to their long relaxation time ; however the origin of this slow response remains a puzzle .	Here , we provide experimental evidence of a growing dynamical heterogeneity length scale that increases with increasing waiting time in an aging colloidal glass of Laponite .	The signature of heterogeneity in the dynamics follows from dynamic light scattering measurements in which we study both the rotational and translational diffusion of the disk-shaped particles of Laponite in suspension .	These measurements are accompanied by simultaneous microrheology and macroscopic rheology experiments .
1	We study the composition of interacting process components in the setting of process algebra .	We take a process component as a pair of an interface and a behaviour .	We formalize the interfaces of interacting process components by means of an interface group .	An interesting feature of the interface group is that it allows for distinguishing between expectations and promises in interfaces of process components .	This distinction comes into play in case components with both client and server behaviour are involved .
0	Using powerful Multicanonical Ensemble Monte Carlo methods from statistical physics we explore the realization space of random K satisfiability ( KSAT ) in search for computational hard problems , most likely the 'hardest problems ' .	We search for realizations with unique satisfying assignments ( USA ) at ratio of clause to spin number $ \alpha=M/N $ that is minimal .	USA realizations are found for $ \alpha $ -values that approach $ \alpha=1 $ from above with increasing number of spins $ N $ .	We consider small spin numbers in $ 2 \le N \le 18 $ .	The ensemble mean exhibits very special properties .
1	We consider magnetic oscillations of the critical current in stacks of intrinsic Josephson junctions , which are realized in mesas fabricated from layered high-temperature superconductors .	A key phenomenon related to the Josephson effect is oscillations of different properties of superconducting tunneling junctions with magnetic field .	The oscillation behavior is very different from the case of a single junction .	Depending on the stack lateral size , oscillations may have either the period of half flux quantum per junction ( wide-stack regime ) or one flux quantum per junction ( narrow-stack regime ) .	We study in detail the crossover between these two regimes .
1	Using the Kauffman bracket at $ A=e^ { \pi i/4 } $ , an invariant for a special type of $ n $ -punctured ball tangles is defined .	We consider a class of topological objects in the 3-sphere $ S^3 $ which will be called { \it $ n $ -punctured ball tangles } .	The invariant $ F $ takes values in $ PM_ { 2\times2^n } ( \mathbb Z ) $ , that is the set of $ 2\times 2^n $ matrices over $ \mathbb Z $ modulo the scalar multiplication of $ \pm1 $ .	This invariant leads to a generalization of a theorem of D. Krebes which gives a necessary condition for a given collection of tangles to be embedded in a link in $ S^3 $ disjointly .	We also address the question of whether the invariant $ F $ is surjective onto $ PM_ { 2\times2^n } ( \mathbb Z ) $ .
2	By mapping the two-dimensional linear stability theory into a one-dimensional eigenfunction problem for an ordinary differential equation , we solve the problem numerically .	We study the superheating field of a bulk superconductor within Ginzburg-Landau theory , which is valid near the critical temperature .	We calculate , as functions of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $ \kappa $ , the superheating field $ \Hsh $ and the critical momentum $ k_c $ characterizing the wavelength of the instability of the Meissner state to flux penetration .	We demonstrate agreement between the numerics and analytics , and show convergence to the known results at both small and large $ \kappa $ .	We discuss the implications of the results for superconducting RF cavities used in particle accelerators .
1	Observationally , there are many short-period sdB systems known , but only very few long-period sdB binaries are identified .	The predicted orbital period histogram of an sdB population is bimodal with a peak at short ( & lt ; 10 days ) and long ( & gt ; 250 days ) periods .	As these predictions are based on poorly understood binary interaction processes , it is of prime importance to confront the predictions to observational data .	In this contribution we aim to determine the absolute dimensions of the long-period sdB+MS binary system PG1104+243 .	High-resolution spectroscopy time-series were obtained with HERMES at the Mercator telescope at La Palma , and analyzed to obtain radial velocities of both components .
3	The characteristics of the JHK spectra are very similar to those observed in a nova outburst occurring on a carbon-oxygen white dwarf .	We present near-infrared ( 1 - 2.5 micron ) spectroscopic and photometric results of Nova V2615 Ophiuchi which was discovered in outburst in 2007 March .	Our observations span a period of ~ 80 days starting from 2007 March 28 when the nova was at its maximum light .	The evolution of the spectra are shown from the initial P-Cygni phase to an emission-line phase and finally to a dust formation stage .	We analyse an observed line at 2.088 micron and suggest it could be due to FeII excited by Lyman alpha fluorescence .
0	It is generally believed that the inhomogeneous Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell ( LOFF ) phase appears in a color superconductor when the pairing between different quark flavors is under the circumstances of mismatched Fermi surfaces .	However , the real crystal structure of the LOFF phase is still unclear because an exact treatment of 3D crystal structures is rather difficult .	In this work we present a solid-state-like calculation of the ground-state energy of the body-centered cubic ( BCC ) structure for two-flavor pairing by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the Bloch space without assuming a small amplitude of the order parameter .	We develop a computational scheme to overcome the difficulties in diagonalizing huge matrices .	Our results show that the BCC structure is energetically more favorable than the 1D modulation in a narrow window around the conventional LOFF-normal phase transition point , which indicates the significance of the higher-order terms in the Ginzburg-Landau approach .
4	The location of positive parity cluster states are also identified in 71,73Ni .	Low-energy excited states in 71,73Ni populated via the { \beta } decay of 71,73Co were investigated in an experiment performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory ( NSCL ) at Michigan State University ( MSU ) .	Detailed analysis led to the construction of level schemes of 71,73Ni , which are interpreted using systematics and analyzed using shell model calculations .	The 5/2- states attributed to the the f5/2 orbital and positive parity 5/2+ and 7/2+ states from the g9/2 orbital have been identified in both 71,73Ni .	In 71Ni the location of a 1/2- { \beta } -decaying isomer is proposed and limits are suggested as to the location of the isomer in 73Ni .
3	Due to the massively parallel nature of GPU hardware , Fireflies is able to simulate millions of trajectories in parallel ( even on standard desktop computer hardware ) , producing `` swarms '' of particles that move around the screen in real-time according to the equations of the system .	In non-linear systems , where explicit analytic solutions usually ca n't be found , visualisation is a powerful approach which can give insights into the dynamical behaviour of models ; it is also crucial for teaching this area of mathematics .	In this paper we present new software , Fireflies , which exploits the power of graphical processing unit ( GPU ) computing to produce spectacular interactive visualisations of arbitrary systems of ordinary differential equations .	In contrast to typical phase portraits , Fireflies draws the current position of trajectories ( projected onto 2D or 3D space ) as single points of light , which move as the system is simulated .	Particles that move forwards in time reveal stable attractors ( e.g.fixed points and limit cycles ) , while the option of integrating another group of trajectories backwards in time can reveal unstable objects ( repellers ) .
0	Muon spin rotation ( { \mu } +SR ) measurements of square-root second moments of local magnetic fields { \sigma } in superconducting mixed states , as published for oriented crystals and powder samples of YBa2Cu3O7- { \delta } ( { \delta } { \approx } 0.05 ) , YBa2Cu4O8 and La2-xSrxCuO4 ( x ~ 0.15-0.17 ) , are subjected to comparative analysis for superconducting gap symmetry .	For oriented crystals it is shown that anomalous dependences of { \sigma } on temperature T and applied field H , as-measured and extracted a- and b-axial components , are attributable to fluxon depinning and disorder that obscure the intrinsic character of the superconducting penetration depth .	Random averages derived from oriented-crystal data differ markedly from corresponding non-oriented powders , owing to weaker influence of pinning in high-quality crystals .	Related indicators for pinning perturbations such as non-monotonic H dependence of { \sigma } , irreproducible data and strong H dependence of apparent transition temperatures are also evident .	Strong intrinsic pinning suppresses thermal anomalies in c-axis components of { \sigma } , which reflect nodeless gap symmetries in YBa2Cu3O7- { \delta } and YBa2Cu4O8 .
3	We also discuss the general strategy on the experimental side as well as on the theoretical side for a search for quantum gravity effects .	We give an overview of ongoing searches for effects motivated by the study of the quantum-gravity problem .	We describe in greater detail approaches which have not been covered in recent `` Quantum Gravity Phenomenology '' reviews .	In particular , we outline a new framework for describing Lorentz invariance violation in the Maxwell sector .	The role of test theories , kinematical and dymamical , in this general context is emphasized .
4	Due to zigzag configuration there are interactions between both nearest and next nearest neighboring waveguides exist .	We consider the coupled electromagnetic waves propagating in a nonlinear coupler and in nonlinear waveguide array , which consists of alternating waveguides of positive and negative refraction indexes .	The forward wave and backward wave interaction is realized in these devices .	Gap solitons in a nonlinear oppositely directional coupler with one channel or both channels fabricated from nonlinear medium having negative refraction index are discussed .	Generalization of the usually waveguide array is zigzag array .
3	An intrinsic theory of quantum measurement naturally arises based on Schr\ '' { o } dinger evolution that is local , consistent with relativity and extends to the case of noninertial and deformable measurement devices that can have time changing internal properties .	Using the kinematic constraints of classical bodies we construct the allowable wavefunctions corresponding to classical solids .	These are shown to be long lived metastable states that are qualitatively far from eigenstates of the true Hamiltonian .	Extensions of this give an explicit description of phonon oscillations in terms of the wavefunction itself and some consequences for the general validity of the quasiparticle picture are presented .	This theory agrees with the Born interpretation in the limit of static measuring devices .
1	It is known that this roton minimum is qualitatively responsible for density oscillations close to any singularity , such as vortex cores , or close to solid boundaries .	Dense Bose superfluids , as HeII , differ from dilute ones by the existence of a roton minimum in their excitation spectrum .	We show that the period of these oscillations , and their exponential decrease with the distance to the singularity , are fully determined by the position and the width of the roton minimum .	Only an overall amplitude factor and a phase shift are shown to depend on the details of the interaction potential .	Reciprocally , it allows for determining the characteristics of this roton minimum from static `` observations '' of a disturbed ground state , in cases where the dynamics is not easily accessible .
3	We are forced to consider related distribution functions that are steady but not self-similar.Results .	Aims .	In this paper we continue our study of density cusps that may contain central black holes.Methods .	We recall our attempts to use distribution functions with a memory of self-similar relaxation , but mostly they apply only in restricted regions of the global system .	One remarkably simple distribution function that has a filled loss cone describes a bulge that transits from a near black hole domain to an outer 'zero flux ' regime where $ \rho\propto r^ { -7/4 } $ .
0	Proposed 21 cm cosmology observatories for studying the epoch of reionization ( z ~6-15 ) and dark energy ( z ~0-6 ) envision compact arrays with tens of thousands of antenna elements .	Fully correlating this many elements is computationally expensive using traditional XF or FX correlators , and has led some groups to reconsider direct imaging/FFT correlators .	In this paper we develop a variation of the direct imaging correlator we call the MOFF correlator .	The MOFF correlator shares the computational advantages of a direct imaging correlator , while avoiding a number of its shortcomings .	In particular the MOFF correlator makes no constraints on the antenna arrangement or type , provides a fully calibrated output image including widefield polarimetry and non-coplanar baseline effects , and can be orders-of-magnitude more efficient than XF or FX correlators for compact radio cosmology arrays .
0	The tadpole galaxy Kiso 5639 has a slowly rotating disk with a drop in metallicity at its star-forming head , suggesting that star formation was triggered by the accretion of metal-poor gas .	We present multi-wavelength HST WFC3 images of UV through I band plus Halpha to search for peripheral emission and determine the properties of various regions .	The head has a mass in young stars of ~10^6 Mo and an ionization rate of 6.4x10^51 s^ { -1 } , equivalent to ~2100 O9-type stars .	There are four older star-forming regions in the tail , and an underlying disk with a photometric age of ~1 Gyr .	The mass distribution function of 61 star clusters is a power law with a slope of -1.73+-0.51 .
1	Et decreases with x and almost disappears at about x=0.4 .	In contrast to ordinary ferroelectrics where the temperature , Tm , of the permittivity maximum monotonically increases with bias field , E , in ( 1-x ) PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3- ( x ) PbTiO3 ( 0 & lt ; x & lt ; 0.35 ) single crystals , Tm was found to remain constant or decrease with E up to a certain threshold field , Et , above which Tm starts increasing .	We explain this field dependence by the quenched random fields and coupling between the orientable dipoles with average polarization .	For crystals with 0.06 & lt ; x & lt ; 0.13 , the T-E phase diagrams are constructed , which include the relaxor , ferroelectric , glass and mixed ferroelectric-glass phases .	The boundary between the ferroelectric and relaxor phases corresponds to a first-order phase transition and is characterized by thermal hysteresis with a large curvature of the line obtained in the field cooling mode , and by the presence of the end-point above which there is no difference between the ferroelectric and relaxor phases .
1	We predict the quantum phase transition between the photonic Coulomb blocked induce insulating phase and anisotropic exchange induced photonic superfluid phase in the system due to the existence of two Rabi frequency oscillations .	We study the quantum phase transition of light of a system when atom trapped in microcavities and interacting through the exchange of virtual photons .	The renormalization group equation shows explicitly that for this system there is no self-duality .	The system also shows two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless ( BKT ) transitions for the different physical situation of the system .	The presence of single Rabi frequency oscillation in the system leads to the BKT transition where system shows the quantum phase transition from photonic metallic state to the Coulomb blocked induced insulating phase .
1	The discussed experiments include the conventional beam experiments MINOS , ICARUS , and OPERA , which are under construction , the planned superbeam experiments J-PARC to Super-Kamiokande and NuMI off-axis , as well as new reactor experiments with near and far detectors , represented by the Double-Chooz project .	We analyze the physics potential of long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments planned for the coming ten years , where the main focus is the sensitivity limit to the small mixing angle $ \theta_ { 13 } $ .	We perform a complete numerical simulation including systematics , correlations , and degeneracies on an equal footing for all experiments using the GLoBES software .	After discussing the improvement of our knowledge on the atmospheric parameters $ \theta_ { 23 } $ and $ \Delta m^2_ { 31 } $ by these experiments , we investigate the potential to determine $ \theta_ { 13 } $ within the next ten years in detail .	Furthermore , we show that under optimistic assumptions and for $ \theta_ { 13 } $ close to the current bound , even the next generation of experiments might provide some information on the Dirac CP phase and the type of the neutrino mass hierarchy .
4	The hot-carrier generation manifests itself through elevated electronic temperatures which can be accessed in a variety of ways , in particular optical conductivity measurements .	Long lifetimes of hot carriers can lead to qualitatively new types of responses in materials .	The magnitude and time scales for these responses reflect the mechanisms governing energy flows .	We examine the microscopics of two processes which are key for energy transport , focusing on the unusual behavior arising due to graphene 's unique combination of material properties .	One is hot carrier generation in its photoexcitation dynamics , where hot carriers multiply through an Auger type carrier-carrier scattering cascade .
0	In nanocontacts between normal and ferromagnetic metals ( N -- F ) abrupt changes of the order of 1 % are detected in differential resistance , dV/dI ( V ) , versus bias voltage , V , on achieving of high current densities , ~10^9 A/cm^2 .	These features in dV/dI ( V ) are observed when the electron flow is directed from the nonmagnetic metal into the ferromagnet and connected with magnetization excitations in the ferromagnet induced by the current .	Applying an external magnetic field leads to a shift of the observed features to higher biasing current , confirming the magnetic nature of the effect .	Such effects are observed for the non-ballistic ( not spectral ) regime of current flow in the nanocontacts .	Thus , the current induced magneto-conductance effects in multilayered N -- F structures ( nanopillars ) extensively studied in the recent literature have much more general character and can be stimulated by elastic electron scattering at single N -- F interfaces .
0	In this letter , we propose a new symbol detection method for faster-than-Nyquist signaling ( FTNS ) systems .	Based on frame theory , we formulate a symbol detection problem as a under-determined linear equation on a finite set .	The problem is reformulated as a sum-of-absolute-values ( SOAV ) optimization that can be efficiently solved by the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm ( FISTA ) .	The proximity operator for the convex optimization is derived analytically .	Simulation results are given to show that the proposed method can successfully detect symbols in faster-than-Nyquist signaling systems and has lower complexity in terms of computation time .
2	The matching of the metamaterial 's impedance to that of vacuum is responsible for the observed spectrally selective `` perfect '' absorption of infrared light .	A simple metamaterial-based wide-angle plasmonic absorber is introduced , fabricated , and experimentally characterized using angle-resolved infrared spectroscopy .	The metamaterials are prepared by nano-imprint lithography , an attractive low-cost technology for making large-area samples .	The impedance is theoretically calculated in the single-resonance approximation , and the responsible resonance is identified as a short-range surface plasmon .	The spectral position of the absorption peak ( which is as high as 95 % ) is experimentally shown to be controlled by the metamaterial 's dimensions .
1	The topological nature of such a conductor , however , is revealed in its transport properties , especially in the presence of disorder .	Features of a topological phase , and edge states in particular , may be obscured by overlapping in energy with a trivial conduction band .	In this work , we explore the conductance behavior of such a system with disorder present , and contrast it with the quantized conductance in an ideal 2D topological insulator .	Our analysis relies on numerics on a lattice system and analytics on a simple toy model .	Interestingly , we find that as disorder is increased from zero , the edge conductivity initially falls from its quantized value ; yet as disorder continues to increase , the conductivity recovers , and saturates at a value slightly below the quantized value of the clean system .
2	The basic object in our framework is that of a parameterized problem , which here is a language along with a parameterization -- -a map which provides , for each instance , a so-called parameter on which compilation may be performed .	In resolving instances of a computational problem , if multiple instances of interest share a feature in common , it may be fruitful to compile this feature into a format that allows for more efficient resolution , even if the compilation is relatively expensive .	In this article , we introduce a formal framework for classifying problems according to their compilability .	Our framework is positioned within the paradigm of parameterized complexity , and our notions are relatable to established concepts in the theory of parameterized complexity .	Indeed , we view our framework as playing a unifying role , integrating together parameterized complexity and compilability theory .
4	The resulting flux contamination for some well-known relics are non-negligible already at 10 GHz , and at 30 GHz the observed synchrotron fluxes can be diminished by a factor of several from their true values .	( Abridged ) Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to be associated with powerful shock fronts that originate during cluster mergers , and are a testbed for the acceleration of relativistic particles in the intracluster medium .	Recently , radio relic observations have pushed into the cm-wavelength domain ( 1-30 GHz ) where a break from the standard synchrotron power-law spectrum has been found , most noticeably in the famous 'Sausage ' relic .	In this paper , we point to an important effect that has been ignored or considered insignificant while interpreting these new high-frequency radio data , namely the contamination due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ( SZ ) effect that changes the observed synchrotron flux .	Even though the radio relics reside in the cluster outskirts , the shock-driven pressure boost increases the SZ signal locally by roughly an order of magnitude .
1	We present a catalog of 374 carefully chosen stars among the all-sky network of infrared sources provided by Cohen et al.1999 .	The calibration process of long baseline stellar interferometers requires the use of reference stars with accurately determined angular diameters .	The catalog benefits from a very good sky coverage and a median formal error on the angular diameters of only 1.2 % .	Besides , its groups together in a homogeneous handy set stellar coordinates , uniform and limb-darkened angular diameters , photometric measurements , and other parameters relevant to optical interferometry .	In this paper , we describe the selection criteria applied to qualify stars as reference sources .
4	We also include angular momentum , and find solutions describing slowly-rotating black holes .	Black hole configurations offer insights on the non-linear aspects of gravitational theories , and can suggest testable predictions for modifications of General Relativity .	In this work , we examine exact black hole configurations in vector-tensor theories , originally proposed to explain dark energy by breaking the Abelian symmetry with a non-minimal coupling of the vector to gravity .	We are able to evade the no-go theorems by Bekenstein on the existence of regular black holes in vector-tensor theories with Proca mass terms , and exhibit regular black hole solutions with a profile for the longitudinal vector polarization , characterised by an additional charge .	We analytically find the most general static , spherically symmetric black hole solutions with and without a cosmological constant , and study in some detail their features , such as how the geometry depends on the vector charges .
1	Then there is a positive integer $ e $ so that $ |G| = d ( d+e ) $ .	Let $ G $ be a nonabelian finite group and let $ d $ be an irreducible character degree of $ G $ .	Snyder has shown that if $ e & gt ; 1 $ , then $ |G| $ is bounded by a function of $ e $ .	This bound has been improved by Isaacs and by Durfee and Jensen .	In this paper , we will show for groups that have a nontrivial , abelian normal subgroup that $ |G| \le e^4 - e^3 $ .
1	The baryon number is almost conserved at zero temperature by means of a localization mechanism recently analyzed by Arkani-Hamed and Schmaltz : leptons and quarks are located at two slightly displaced positions in the extra space , and this naturally suppresses the interactions which `` convert '' the latter in the former .	We propose a new scenario of baryogenesis in the context of theories with large extra dimensions .	We show that this is expected to be no longer true when finite temperature effects are taken into account .	The whole scenario is first presented in its generality , without referring to the bulk geometry or to the specific mechanism which may generate the baryon asymmetry .	As an example , we then focus on a baryogenesis model reminiscent of GUT baryogenesis .
1	However , sequential regular expression matching may be time-prohibitive for large problem sizes .	Regular expression matching is essential for many applications , such as finding patterns in text , exploring substrings in large DNA sequences , or lexical analysis .	In this paper , we describe a novel algorithm for parallel regular expression matching via deterministic finite automata .	Furthermore , we present our tool PaREM that accepts regular expressions and finite automata as input and automatically generates the corresponding code for our algorithm that is amenable for parallel execution on shared-memory systems .	We evaluate our parallel algorithm empirically by comparing it with a commonly used algorithm for sequential regular expression matching .
4	In these potential host materials , some of them have already been confirmed by experiments while the others are not yet .	In recent years , three-dimensional topological insulators ( 3DTI ) as a novel state of quantum matter have become a hot topic in the fields of condensed matter physics and materials sciences .	To fulfill many spectacularly novel quantum phenomena predicted in 3DTI , real host materials are of crucial importance .	In this review paper , we first introduce general methods of searching for new 3DTI based on the density-functional theory .	Then , we review the recent progress on materials realization of 3DTI including simple elements , binary compounds , ternary compounds , and quaternary compounds .
3	In this framework , leptogenesis becomes viable once this degeneracy is lifted either by renormalization group effects or by a soft breaking of the A4 symmetry .	We investigate the viability of thermal leptogenesis in type-I seesaw models with leptonic flavour symmetries that lead to tribimaximal neutrino mixing .	We consider an effective theory with an A4 x Z3 x Z4 symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale .	At the high scale , leptonic Yukawa interactions lead to exact tribimaximal mixing and the heavy Majorana neutrino mass spectrum is exactly degenerate .	The implications for low-energy neutrino physics are discussed .
0	We consider the tensor product of modules over the polynomial algebra corresponding to the usual tensor product of linear operators .	We present a general description of the representation ring in case the ground field k is perfect .	It is made explicit in the special cases when k is real closed respectively algebraically closed .	Furthermore , we discuss the generalisation of this problem to representations of quivers .	In particular the representation ring of quivers of extended Dynkin type A is provided .
1	In many cases , in the investigation of natural processes , stochasticity arises every time one considers the dynamics of a system in contact with a somehow bigger system , an environment , that is considered in thermal equilibrium .	Stochastic methods are ubiquitous to a variety of fields , ranging from Physics to Economy and Mathematics .	Any small fluctuation of the environment has some random effect on the system .	In Physics , stochastic methods have been applied to the investigation of phase transitions , thermal and electrical noise , thermal relaxation , quantum information , Brownian motion etc .	In this review , we will focus on the so-called stochastic Schr\ '' odinger equation .
2	We present a re-reduction of the archival optical and infrared data of the Vela pulsar , together with the existing infrared and UV spectrum of Vela , and model their unpulsed components with the blackbody spectrum of a supernova debris disk .	Fallback disks are expected to form around young neutron stars .	The presence of these disks can be revealed by their blackbody spectrum in the infrared , optical and UV bands .	We invoke the quiescent disk solution of Sunyaev and Shakura for the description of the disk in the propeller stage and find the inner radius of the disk to be inside the light cylinder radius .	We perform a high resolution X-ray analysis with XMM-Newton and find a narrow absorption feature at 0.57 keV which can be interpreted as K $ _ { \alpha } $ line of He-like oxygen ( OVII ) .
0	We introduce a stable , well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) proposed by Goodman & amp ; Weare ( 2010 ) .	The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature .	The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time ( or function calls per independent sample ) .	One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to $ \sim N^2 $ for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space .	In this document , we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API .
4	For the systemic components , the relatively low temperature gas is extended more than the high temperature gas .	We present the results of ammonia observations toward the center of NGC 3079 .	The NH3 ( J , K ) = ( 1 , 1 ) and ( 2 , 2 ) inversion lines were detected in absorption with the Tsukuba 32-m telescope , and the NH3 ( 1,1 ) through ( 6,6 ) lines with the VLA , although the profile of NH3 ( 3,3 ) was in emission in contrast to the other transitions .	The background continuum source , whose flux density was ~50 mJy , could not be resolved with the VLA beam of ~ & lt ; 0 . `` 09 x 0 . `` 08 .	All ammonia absorption lines have two distinct velocity components : one is at the systemic velocity and the other is blueshifted , and both components are aligned along the nuclear jets .
2	A particularly paradoxical situation involves an event deep in the interior of the bulk space .	There is substantial evidence that string theory on AdS_5 x S_5 is a holographic theory in which the number of degrees of freedom scales as the area of the boundary in Planck units .	Precisely how the theory can describe bulk physics using only surface degrees of freedom is not well understood .	The event must be recorded in the ( Schroedinger Picture ) state vector of the boundary theory long before a signal , such as a gravitational wave , can propagate from the event to the boundary .	In a previous paper with Polchinski , we argued that the `` precursor '' operators which carry information stored in the wave during the time when it vanishes in a neighborhood of the boundary are necessarily non-local .
2	Both NGC 1333 and NGC 2068 have no previously-published analysis of near-infrared spectra .	We present near-infrared spectroscopy of fluorescent molecular hydrogen ( H_2 ) emission from NGC 1333 , NGC 2023 , NGC 2068 , and NGC 7023 and derive the physical properties of the molecular material in these reflection nebulae .	Our observations of NGC 2023 and NGC 7023 and the physical parameters we derive for these nebulae are in good agreement with previous studies .	Our study reveals that the rotational-vibrational states of molecular hydrogen in NGC 1333 are populated quite differently from NGC 2023 and NGC 7023 .	We determine that the relatively weak UV field illuminating NGC 1333 is the primary cause of the difference .
1	More precisely , we develop the theory of connections on Lie groupoid $ G $ -extensions , which we call `` connections on gerbes '' , and study the induced connections on various associated bundles .	We study non-abelian differentiable gerbes over stacks using the theory of Lie groupoids .	We also prove analogues of the Bianchi identities .	In particular , we develop a cohomology theory which measures the existence of connections and curvings for $ G $ -gerbes over stacks .	We also introduce $ G $ -central extensions of groupoids , generalizing the standard groupoid $ S^1 $ -central extensions .
1	We find that the high-redshift samples are dominated by galaxies with concentrations similar to local late-type disk galaxies ; however , they are significantly more asymmetric than most local galaxies but are similar in both regards to local LIRGs .	We have studied the morphologies of luminous infrared galaxies ( LIRGs ; L_IR ( 8-1000um ) & gt ; 10^11 Lsun ) at 0.3 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.4 in the HST Ultradeep Field ( UDF ) by calculating concentration and asymmetry indices and comparing the results with similar calculations for : ( 1 ) galaxies at similar redshift that are less infrared-active ; and ( 2 ) local LIRGs .	On average , the high-redshift infrared-active galaxies are slightly more asymmetric than the less-active ones , although they do include a significantly higher portion of highly asymmetric ( merging ? )	systems and a lower portion of more concentrated , symmetric ones .	The morphological similarity of infrared-active and typical infrared-inactive galaxies at high-redshift suggests that they may be from the same parent population , but are in different stages of an episodic star formation process .
0	The experimental evidence for the Hall-Petch dependence of strength on the inverse square-root of grain size is reviewed critically .	Both the classic data and more recent results are considered .	While the data can be fitted to the inverse square-root dependence excellently ( but using two free fitting parameters for each dataset ) , it is also consistent with a dependence on the simple inverse of grain size ( with one free fitting parameter for each dataset ) .	There have been difficulties , recognised for half-a-century , in explaining the inverse square-root expression .	A Bayesian analysis shows that the data strongly supports the simple inverse expression proposed .
4	The results further suggest that either morphological mass deposition rates systematically overestimate the actual cooling rate or the emission measure of cooling-flows has a much steeper distribution than that predicted by a simple isobaric multi-phase model .	We present high resolution X-ray spectra of 14 cooling-flow X-ray clusters and groups obtained with the Reflection Grating Spectrometers ( RGS ) on XMM-Newton .	The spectra exhibit line emission from a number of Fe L charge states as well as O VIII , Mg XII , Ne X , Si XIV & amp ; XIII , N VII , and C VI .	All spectra show a deficit of soft X-ray lines predicted from the isobaric multi-phase spectral model as compared with morphological mass deposition rates from spatially-resolved spectroscopy with the European Photon Imaging Cameras ( EPIC ) .	We present some weak detections of plasma several times cooler than the ambient cluster temperatures .
2	A statistical analysis of 700 seconds of pre-flare quiescence data for both CR Dra and SDSS J084425.9+513830.5 failed to reveal the presence of significant micro-flare activity in time bins of 0.2 , 1 and 10 second intervals .	We present near ultraviolet ( NUV:1750 - 2800\AA ) and far ultraviolet ( FUV : 1350 - 1750\AA ) light-curves for flares on 4 nearby dMe-type stars ( GJ 3685A , CR Dra , AF Psc and SDSS J084425.9+513830.5 ) observed with the GALEX satellite .	Taking advantage of the time-tagged events recorded with the GALEX photon counting detectors , we present high temporal resolution ( & lt ; 0.01 sec ) analysis of these UV flare data .	Using an appropriate differential emission measure for both the quiescent and flaring state , it is possible to reproduce the observed FUV : NUV flux ratios .	A major determinant in reproducing this flux ratio is found to be the value of plasma electron density during the flare .
0	We systematically study an extended Bose-Hubbard model with atom hopping and atom-pair hopping in the presence of a three-body constraint on the triangular lattice .	By means of large-scale Quantum Monte Carlo simulations , the ground-state phase diagram are studied .	We find a continuous transition between the atomic superfluid phase and the pair superfluid when the ratio of the atomic hopping and the atom-pair hopping is adapted .	We then focus on the interplay among the atom-pair hopping , the on-site repulsion and the nearest-neighbor repulsion .	With on-site repulsion present , we observe first order transitions between the Mott Insulators and pair superfluid driven by the pair hopping .
2	The narrowness of the lines requires that the scatterers be dust grains or cool ( $ & lt ; 1.6\times $ 10 $ ^4 $ ~K ) electrons .	Optical spectropolarimetry of the luminous IRAS source FSC10214 $ + $ 4724 ( z $ =2.286 $ ) reveals that the strong ( \twid17\ % ) linear polarization detected by Lawrence \etal\/ is shared by both the narrow UV emission lines and the underlying continuum .	This observation and the brightness of the source rule out synchrotron emission and dichroic extinction by dust as the polarizing mechanism , leaving scattering as the only plausible cause of the polarized emission .	We can recover the spectrum that is incident on the scattering medium provided we make some reasonable assumptions regarding the source geometry .	The scattered UV spectrum has a power law index $ \alpha $ ~ of $ -1.2 \pm 0.6 $ ( $ F_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha $ ) , steeper than what would be expected from a young burst of star formation , but similar to many AGN .
0	Measuring culture and its dynamics through surveys has important limitations , but the emerging field of computational social science allows us to overcome them by analyzing large-scale datasets .	In this article , we study cultural dynamics through the votes in the Eurovision song contest , which are decided by a crowd-based scheme in which viewers vote through mobile phone messages .	Taking into account asymmetries and imperfect perception of culture , we measure cultural relations among European countries in terms of cultural affinity .	We propose the Friend-or-Foe coefficient , a metric to measure voting biases among participants of a Eurovision contest .	We validate how this metric represents cultural affinity through its relation with known cultural distances , and through numerical analysis of biased Eurovision contests .
0	This paper presents an analysis of the architectural design of two distributed open source systems ( OSS ) developed in Java : Distributed Modular Audio Recognition Framework ( DMARF ) and General Intensional Programming System ( GIPSY ) .	The research starts with a background study of these frameworks to determine their overall architectures .	Afterwards , we identify the actors and stakeholders and draft a domain model for each framework .	Next , we evaluated and proposed a fused DMARF over GIPSY Run-time Architecture ( DoGRTA ) as a domain concept .	Later on , the team extracted and studied the actual class diagrams and determined classes of interest .
1	To validate the Einstein equivalence principle ( local position invariance ) by limiting the fractional changes in the electron-to-proton mass ratio , mu = m_e/m_p , measured in Galactic plane objects.Methods .	Aims .	High resolution spectral observations of dark clouds in the inversion line of NH3 ( 1,1 ) and pure rotational lines of other molecules ( the so-called ammonia method ) were performed at the Medicina 32-m and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescopes to measure the radial velocity offsets , Delta RV = V_rot - V_inv , between the rotational and inversion transitions which have different sensitivities to the value of mu.Results .	In our previous observations ( 2008-2010 ) , a mean offset of & lt ; Delta RV & gt ; = 0.027+/-0.010 km/s [ 3 sigma confidence level ( C.L . ) ] was measured .	To test for possible hidden errors , we carried out additional observations of a sample of molecular cores in 2010-2013 .
1	In a multicarrier CVQKD scheme , the information is granulated into Gaussian subcarrier CVs and the physical Gaussian link is divided into Gaussian sub-channels .	We propose the subcarrier domain of multicarrier continuous-variable ( CV ) quantum key distribution ( QKD ) .	The sub-channels are dedicated for the conveying of the subcarrier CVs .	The angular domain utilizes the phase-space angles of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs to construct the physical model of a Gaussian sub-channel .	The subcarrier domain injects physical attributes to the description of the subcarrier transmission .
4	Moreover , finite-size scaling analysis enables identification of two different types of non-spanning avalanches ( critical and supercritical ) and two different types of 3d-spanning avalanches ( critical and subcritical ) , whose numbers increase with L as a power-law with different exponents .	A numerical study is presented of the 3d Gaussian Random Field Ising Model at T=0 driven by an external field .	Standard synchronous relaxation dynamics is employed to obtain the magnetization versus field hysteresis loops .	The focus is on the analysis of the number and size distribution of the magnetization avalanches .	They are classified as being non-spanning , 1d-spanning , 2d-spanning or 3d-spanning depending on whether or not they span the whole lattice in the different space directions .
3	At one-loop level we find abundances of 10 % -- 100 % with $ 106 GeV & lt ; M_s & lt ; 120 GeV $ .	We consider generation of dark matter mass via radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in an extension of the conformal Standard Model containing a singlet scalar field with a Higgs portal interaction .	Generating the mass from a sequential process of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking followed by a conventional Higgs mechanism can account for less than 35 % of the cosmological dark matter abundance for dark matter mass $ M_s & gt ; 80 GeV $ .	However in a dynamical approach where both Higgs and scalar singlet masses are generated via radiative electroweak symmetry breaking we obtain much higher levels of dark matter abundance .	However , when the higher-order effects needed for consistency with a $ 125 GeV $ Higgs mass are estimated , the abundance becomes 10 % -- 80 % for $ 80 GeV & lt ; M_s & lt ; 96 GeV $ , representing a significant decrease in the dark matter mass .
4	We extend this notion of barrier to the mixed case and prove that it can be constructed via a minimum-like principle involving the Karush-K\ '' uhn-Tucker multipliers associated to the constraints and a generalised gradient condition at its endpoints .	In this paper , we propose an extension to mixed multidimensional constraints of the problem of state and input constrained control introduced in DeDona and L\'evine , SIAM J .	Control and Optimiz. , Vol .	51 , 2013 , where the admissible set , namely the subset of the state space where the state and input constraints can be satisfied for all times , was studied , with focus on its boundary .	The latter may be divided in two parts , one of them being called barrier , a semipermeable surface .
1	By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models , we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD .	We investigate galaxy bias in the framework of the `` Halo Occupation Distribution '' ( HOD ) , which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by the conditional probability P ( N|M ) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies , together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos .	The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P ( N|M ) on different scales .	Obtaining the observed power-law form of xi ( r ) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters , implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation ; the success of numerical and semi-analytic models in reproducing this form is entirely non-trivial .	Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function , the bispectrum , the void probability function , the pairwise velocity dispersion , and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias .
3	The main new ingredient for our results is the observation that the canonical bundle of the ( apriori , orbifold ; but the orbifold structure is actually trivial ) base of the family of leaves must be torsion .	We prove that the characteristic foliation $ F $ on a non-singular divisor $ D $ in an irreducible projective hyperkaehler manifold $ X $ can not be algebraic , unless the leaves of $ F $ are rational curves or $ X $ is a surface .	More generally , we show that if $ X $ is an arbitrary projective manifold carrying a holomorphic symplectic $ 2 $ -form , and $ D $ and $ F $ are as above , then $ F $ can be algebraic with non-rational leaves only when , up to a finite \'etale cover , $ X $ is the product of a symplectic projective manifold $ Y $ with a symplectic surface and $ D $ is the pull-back of a curve on this surface .	When $ D $ is of general type , the fact that $ F $ can not be algebraic unless $ X $ is a surface was proved by Hwang and Viehweg .	This implies , in particular , the isotriviality of the family of leaves of $ F $ .
1	The prior may be correlated across items and budgets of the same bidder , but is assumed independent across bidders .	We consider the problem of a revenue-maximizing seller with m items for sale to n additive bidders with hard budget constraints , assuming that the seller has some prior distribution over bidder values and budgets .	We target mechanisms that are Bayesian Incentive Compatible , but that are ex-post Individually Rational and ex-post budget respecting .	Virtually no such mechanisms are known that satisfy all these conditions and guarantee any revenue approximation , even with just a single item .	We provide a computationally efficient mechanism that is a $ 3 $ -approximation with respect to all BIC , ex-post IR , and ex-post budget respecting mechanisms .
0	Inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons produces a major component of the diffuse emission from the Galaxy .	The photon fields involved are the cosmic microwave background and the interstellar radiation field from stars and dust .	Calculations of the inverse Compton distribution have usually assumed a smooth ISRF , but in fact a large part of the Galactic luminosity comes from the most luminous stars which are rare .	Therefore we expect the ISRF , and hence the inverse Compton emission , to be clumpy at some level which could be detectable by instruments such as GLAST .	Even individual nearby luminous stars could be detectable assuming just the normal cosmic-ray electron spectrum .
3	Excess Ni preferentially occupies X sites forcing Mn to the Z sites of X $ _2 $ YZ Heusler composition resulting in a transition from ferromagnetic ground state to a state dominated by ferromagnetic Mn ( Y ) - Mn ( Y ) and antiferromagnetic Mn ( Y ) -Mn ( Z ) interactions .	The magnetic properties of Mn $ _ { 2 } $ Ni $ _ { ( 1+x ) } $ In $ _ { ( 1-x ) } $ ( $ x $ = 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 ) and Mn $ _ { ( 2-y ) } $ Ni $ _ { ( 1.6+y ) } $ In $ _ { 0.4 } $ ( $ y $ = -0.08 , -0.04 , 0.04 , 0.08 ) shape memory alloys have been studied .	Magnetic interactions in the martensitic phase of these alloys are found to be quite similar to those in Ni $ _2 $ Mn $ _ { ( 1+x ) } $ In $ _ { ( 1-x ) } $ type alloys .	Doping of Ni for In not only induces martensitic instability in Mn $ _2 $ NiIn type alloys but also affects magnetic properties due to a site occupancy disorder .	These changes in magnetic ground state manifest themselves in observation of exchange bias effect even in zero field cooled condition and virgin magnetization curve lying outside the hysteresis loop .
1	to constrain dark energy properties and possible deviations from the General Relativity .	We use the joint measurement of geometry and growth from anisotropic galaxy clustering in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 9 CMASS sample reported by Reid et al .	Assuming GR and taking a prior on the linear matter power spectrum at high redshift from the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , anisotropic clustering of the CMASS DR9 galaxies alone constrains $ \Omega_ { \rm m } = 0.308 \pm 0.022 $ and $ 100\Omega_ { \rm k } = 5.9 \pm 4.8 $ for $ w = -1 $ , or $ w = -0.91 \pm 0.12 $ for $ \Omega_k = 0 $ .	When combined with the full CMB likelihood , the addition of the anisotropic clustering measurements to the spherically-averaged BAO location increases the constraining power on dark energy by a factor of 4 in a flat CDM cosmology with constant dark energy equation of state $ w $ ( giving $ w = -0.87 \pm 0.05 $ ) .	This impressive gain depends on our measurement of both the growth of structure and Alcock-Paczynski effect , and is not realised when marginalising over the amplitude of redshift space distortions .
4	For a vanishingly small boson density , we derive , within our approximation , the asymptotic expressions for the critical coupling in the limits of small and large mass ratios .	We consider a homogeneous Bose-Fermi mixture , with the boson-fermion interaction tuned by a Fano-Feshbach resonance , in the presence of mass and density imbalance between the two species .	By using many-body diagrammatic methods , we first study the finite-temperature phase diagram for the specific case of the mass-imbalanced mixture $ ^ { 87 } $ Rb $ -^ { 40 } $ K for different values of the density imbalance .	We then analyse the quantum phase transition associated with the disappearance at zero temperature of the boson condensate above a critical boson-fermion coupling .	We find a pronounced dependence of the critical coupling on the mass ratio and a weak dependence on the density imbalance .
1	A new efficient algorithm for solving this problem is presented .	In the paper , the global optimization problem of a multidimensional `` black-box '' function satisfying the Lipschitz condition over a hyperinterval with an unknown Lipschitz constant is considered .	At each iteration of the method a number of possible Lipschitz constants is chosen from a set of values varying from zero to infinity .	This idea is unified with an efficient diagonal partition strategy .	A novel technique balancing usage of local and global information during partitioning is proposed .
0	We show that the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic gravitational clustering is approximately spatial local in the $ x $ - $ k $ ( position-scale ) phase space if the initial perturbations are Gaussian .	That is , if viewing the mass field with modes in the phase space , the nonlinear evolution will cause strong coupling among modes with different scale $ k $ , but at the same spatial area $ x $ , while the modes at different area $ x $ remain uncorrelated , or very weakly correlated .	We first study the quasi-local clustering behavior with the halo model , and demonstrate that the quasi-local evolution in the phase space is essentially due to the self-similar and hierarchical features of the cosmic gravitational clustering .	The scaling of mass density profile of halos insures that the coupling between $ ( x-k ) $ modes at different physical positions is substantially suppressed .	Using high resolution N-body simulation samples in the LCDM model , we justify the quasi-locality with the correlation function between the DWT ( discrete wavelet transform ) variables of the cosmic mass field .
1	To determine the cosmic star-formation history , we use an extension of the Press-Schechter formalism for Cold Dark Matter ( CDM ) cosmologies that incorporates gas pressure .	We calculate the observable signatures of the first generation of stars at high redshift ( 5 & lt ; z & lt ; 100 ) .	We calibrate the fraction of gas converted into stars to be 6 % so as to reproduce the 1 % solar C/H ratio observed in the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) at z=3 .	With this star-formation efficiency , we find that NGST would be able to image more than 10^4 star clusters from high redshifts ( z & gt ; 10 ) within its 4'x4 ' field of view .	If stars occupy a region comparable to the virial radius of the cluster , then 1 % of these clusters could be resolved .
1	Kimble , J. Opt .	We describe and analyse numerically schemes ( i ) for entangling orthogonal motional modes of one or a few harmonically-trapped atoms or ions , and ( ii ) for transferring the entanglement from one of these local modes to a distant trapped atom ( or atoms ) via a light-mediated quantum state transfer procedure proposed in previous work [ A.S. Parkins and H.J .	B : Quantum Semiclass.Opt .	1 , 496 ( 1999 ) ] .	Possibilities arising from these schemes include the generation of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state in the positions and momenta of distantly-separated trapped atoms and the preparation of delocalized mesoscopic vibrational states .
2	Burst retransmission is used to reduce the Burst Loss Ratio ( BLR ) by retransmitting dropped bursts .	Burst contention is a well-known challenging problem in Optical Burst Switching ( OBS ) networks .	Deflection routing is used to resolve contention .	Previous works show that combining deflection and retransmission outperforms both pure deflection and pure retransmission approaches .	This paper proposes a new Adaptive Hybrid Deflection and Retransmission ( AHDR ) approach that dynamically combines deflection and retransmission approaches based on network conditions such as BLR and link utilization .
2	The resolution is achieved by replacing these transverse spaces with Eguchi-Hanson or Taub-NUT spaces , both of which admit a normalisable self-dual ( or anti-self-dual ) harmonic 2-form .	We obtain singularity resolutions for various overlapping brane configurations , including those of two heterotic 5-branes , type II 5-branes or D4-branes .	In these solutions , the `` harmonic '' function H for each brane component depends only on the associated four-dimensional relative transverse space .	Due to the manner in which the interaction terms for the form fields modify their Bianchi identities or equations of motion , these normalisable harmonic 2-forms provide regular sources for the branes .	We also obtain resolved 5-branes and D4-branes wrapped on S^1 , which is fibred over the transverse Eguchi-Hanson or Taub-NUT spaces .
2	Such behaviors are exactly the same as those in the anomalous proximity effect of odd-parity spin-triplet superconductors .	We discuss a strong relationship between Majorana fermions and odd-frequency Cooper pairs which appear at a disordered normal ( N ) nano wire attached to a topologically nontrivial superconducting ( S ) one .	The transport properties in superconducting nano wire junctions show universal behaviors irrespective of the degree of disorder : the quantized zero-bias differential conductance at 2e^ { 2 } /h in NS junction and the fractional current-phase ( J-\varphi ) relationship of the Josephson effect in SNS junction J\propto \sin ( \varphi/2 ) .	We show that odd-frequency Cooper pairs support the universal transport properties .	The odd-frequency pairs exist wherever the Majorana fermions stay .
2	Here we show , using gyrencephaly index ( GI ) and other physiological and life-history data for 102 mammalian species , that gyrencephaly is an ancestral mammalian trait .	Expansion of the neocortex is a hallmark of human evolution .	However , it remains an open question what adaptive mechanisms facilitated its expansion .	We provide evidence that the evolution of a highly folded neocortex , as observed in humans , requires the traversal of a threshold of 10^9 neurons , and that species above and below the threshold exhibit a bimodal distribution of physiological and life-history traits , establishing two phenotypic groups .	We identify , using discrete mathematical models , proliferative divisions of progenitors in the basal compartment of the developing neocortex as evolutionarily necessary and sufficient for generating a fourteen-fold increase in daily prenatal neuron production and thus traversal of the neuronal threshold .
4	Key words : Monte Carlo algorithms , flat histogram sampling , HP model , lattice polymer systems	We demonstrate the use of a new algorithm called the Flat Histogram sampling algorithm for the simulation of lattice polymer systems .	Thermodynamics properties , such as average energy or entropy and other physical quantities such as end-to-end distance or radius of gyration can be easily calculated using this method .	Ground-state energy can also be determined .	We also explore the accuracy and limitations of this method .
4	High temperature annealing in nitrogen ambient restores the peak position of YL band by removing nitrogen vacancies .	Optical photoluminescence studies are performed in self-ion ( Ga+ ) -implanted nominally doped n-GaN nanowires .	A 50-keV Ga+ focused ion beam ( FIB ) in the fluence range of 1x1014 -2x10^16 ions cm^-2 is used for the irradiation process .	A blueshift is observed for the yellow luminescence ( YL ) band with increasing fluence .	Donor-acceptor pair ( DAP ) model with emission involving shallow donor introduced by point-defect clusters related to nitrogen vacancies and probable deep acceptor created by gallium interstitial clusters is made responsible for the shift .
1	We propose a minimal model in which the equations of motion of the particles , including a short-range repulsive force , are self-consistently coupled with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation .	Particles of low velocity , travelling without dissipation in a superfluid , can interact and emit sound when they collide .	We use this model to demonstrate the existence of an effective superfluid-mediated attractive interaction between the particles ; and we study numerically the collisional dynamics of particles as a function of their incident kinetic energy and the length-scale of the repulsive force .	We find a transition from almost elastic to completely inelastic ( sticking ) collisions as the parameters are tuned .	We find that aggregation and clustering result from this sticking transition in multi-particle systems .
3	It is shown that dual slope path loss models change the tradeoffs inherent in biasing and reduce gains from both biasing and uplink/downlink decoupling .	Intelligent load balancing is essential to fully realize the benefits of dense heterogeneous networks .	Current techniques have largely been studied with single slope path loss models , though multi-slope models are known to more closely match real deployments .	This paper develops insight into the performance of biasing and uplink/downlink decoupling for user association in HetNets with dual slope path loss models .	The results show that with the dual slope path loss models , the bias maximizing the median rate is not optimal for other users , e.g. , edge users .
4	These results could clarify the concepts of the `` magnetic highway '' and the `` heliosheath depletion region '' recently proposed to explain recent Voyager 1 observations .	We study processes related to magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence occurring in the presence of the heliopause ( HP ) and the heliospheric current sheet .	It is shown that the interaction of plasmoids initiated by magnetic reconnection may provide connections between the inner and outer heliosheath and lead to an exchange of particles between the interstellar medium and the solar wind plasma shocked at the heliospheric termination shock .	The magnetic reconnection may also cause plasma density and magnetic field compressions in the proximity of the HP .	We argue that these phenomena could possibly be detected by the Voyager spacecraft approaching and crossing the HP .
1	By applying appropriate boundary conditions , we derive relations between the soliton velocities before and after collisions .	We study the stepwise sine-Gordon equation , in which the system parameter is different for positive and negative values of the scalar field .	We investigate the possibility of formation of heavy soliton pairs from light ones and vise versa .	The concept of soliton gun is introduced for the first time ; a light pair is produced moving with high velocity , after the annihilation of a bound , heavy pair .	We also apply boundary conditions to static , periodic and quasi-periodic solutions .
2	We perform linear analyses of collisionless plasma instabilities between the cold beam and the hot downstream plasma .	H-alpha emission from supernova remnants ( SNRs ) implies the existence of neutral hydrogen in the circumstellar medium .	Some of the neutral particles penetrating the shock are ionized by the charge exchange process and make a cold ion beam in the shock downstream region .	We find that , under typical SNR conditions , either the resonant instability or the Weibel instability is the most unstable .	This mechanism may amplify the magnetic field to more than 100 micro G and changes the shock structure .
0	A technique is presented to characterize the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio ( SINR ) of a representative link with a multiantenna linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error receiver in a wireless network with transmitting nodes distributed according to a doubly stochastic process , which is a generalization of the Poisson point process .	The cumulative distribution function of the SINR of the representative link is derived assuming independent Rayleigh fading between antennas .	Several representative spatial node distributions are considered , including networks with both deterministic and random clusters , strip networks ( used to model roadways , e.g . ) , hard-core networks and networks with generalized path-loss models .	In addition , it is shown that if the number of antennas at the representative receiver is increased linearly with the nominal node density , the signal-to-interference ratio converges in distribution to a random variable that is non-zero in general , and a positive constant in certain cases .	This result indicates that to the extent that the system assumptions hold , it is possible to scale such networks by increasing the number of receiver antennas linearly with the node density .
0	We review the perturbative approach to multiparticle production in hard collision processes .	It is investigated to what extent parton level analytical calculations at low momentum cut-off can reproduce experimental data on the hadronic final state .	Systematic results are available for various observables with the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy ( the so-called modified leading logarithmic approximation - MLLA ) .	We introduce the analytical formalism and then discuss recent applications concerning multiplicities , inclusive spectra , correlations and angular flows in multi-jet events .	In various cases the perturbative picture is surprisingly successful , even for very soft particle production .
3	The range of possible materials which could be incorporated into such stacks is very large .	The celebrated electronic properties of graphene have opened way for materials just one-atom-thick to be used in the post-silicon electronic era .	An important milestone was the creation of heterostructures based on graphene and other two-dimensional ( 2D ) crystals , which can be assembled in 3D stacks with atomic layer precision .	These layered structures have already led to a range of fascinating physical phenomena , and also have been used in demonstrating a prototype field effect tunnelling transistor - a candidate for post-CMOS technology .	Indeed , there are many other materials where layers are linked by weak van der Waals forces , which can be exfoliated and combined together to create novel highly-tailored heterostructures .
3	Toward the end of the AGB the mass loss rate increases , and wind velocity possibly decreases , making the conditions for the formation of an accretion disk around the wide companion , more favorable .	We discuss the formation of planetary nebulae ( PNe ) having a pair of lobes , or multi-lobes , in their inner region surrounded by an elliptical or spherical shell or halo .	We suggest that most of these PNe are formed by wide binary systems , with final orbital periods in the range of 40-10,000 years , such that there is no strong tidal interaction .	The outer more spherical structure is formed from the early asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) wind .	We assume that the accreting companion blows jets or a collimated fast wind ( CFW ) , which lead to the formation of a pair of lobes in the inner region .
4	Since GD 358 is the best-studied member of this class of variables , we examine fits to its observed pulsation spectrum .	We consider envelopes of DB white dwarfs which are not composed of pure 4-He , but rather a mixture of 3-He and 4-He .	Given this assumption , the same diffusive processes which produce a relatively pure H layer overlying a He layer in the DA 's should work to produce a 3-He layer overlying a 4-He layer in the DB 's .	We examine the relevant timescales for diffusion in these objects , and compare them to the relevant evolutionary timescales in the context of the DBV white dwarfs .	We then explore the consequences which 3-He separation has on the pulsational spectra of DBV models .
1	Combined with our previous spectrum of the primary alone ( Paper I ) , the new observations yield the spectrum of the secondary alone .	We present high-resolution optical spectra of the young brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2M0535-05 , obtained during eclipse of the higher-mass ( primary ) brown dwarf .	We investigate , through a differential analysis of the two binary components , whether cool surface spots are responsible for suppressing the temperature of the primary .	In Paper I , we found a significant discrepancy between the empirical surface gravity of the primary and that inferred via fine analysis of its spectrum .	Here we find precisely the same discrepancy in surface gravity , both qualitatively and quantitatively .
0	The scientific interest in directly image and identifying Earth-like planets within the Habitable Zone ( HZ ) around nearby stars is driving the design of specialized direct imaging mission such as ACESAT , EXO-C , EXO-S and AFTA-C .	The inner edge of Alpha Cen A and B Habitable Zone is found at exceptionally large angular separations of 0.7 and 0.4 arcseconds respectively .	This enables direct imaging of the system with a 0.3m class telescope .	Contrast ratios in the order of 1e-10 are needed to image Earth-brightness planets .	Low-resolution ( 5-band ) spectra of all planets , will allow establishing the presence and amount of an atmosphere .
1	Using combined neutron scattering measurements and first-principles calculations of the phonons in NVO , we determine eleven phonons which can induce the observed spontaneous polarization .	We develop a microscopic magnetoelectric coupling in Ni $ _3 $ V $ _2 $ O $ _8 $ ( NVO ) which gives rise to the trilinear phenomenological coupling used previously to explain the phase transition in which magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters appear simultaneously .	Among these eleven phonons , we find that a few of them can actually induce a significant dipole moment .	Using the calculated atomic charges , we find that the required distortion to induce the observed dipole moment is very small ( ~0.001 \AA ) and therefore it would be very difficult to observe the distortion by neutron-powder diffraction .	Finally , we identify the derivatives of the exchange tensor with respect to atomic displacements which are needed for a microscopic model of a spin-phonon coupling in NVO and which we hope will be obtained from a fundamental quantum calculation such as LDA+U .
4	Finally , we show that all possible solutions of the field equations can be written in terms of these scalars .	We investigate some structure scalars developed through Riemann tensor for self-gravitating cylindrically symmetric charged dissipative anisotropic fluid .	We show that these scalars are directly related to the fundamental properties of the fluid .	We formulate dynamical-transport equation as well as the mass function by including charge which are then expressed in terms of structure scalars .	The effects of electric charge are investigated in the structure and evolution of compact objects .
2	Ruin occurs when the total of the value of the risky and riskless assets and the surrender value of the life annuity reaches zero .	We find the minimum probability of lifetime ruin of an investor who can invest in a market with a risky and a riskless asset and who can purchase a reversible life annuity .	The surrender charge of a life annuity is a proportion of its value .	We find the optimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender strategies in two situations : ( i ) the value of the risky and riskless assets is allowed to be negative , with the imputed surrender value of the life annuity keeping the total positive ; or ( ii ) the value of the risky and riskless assets is required to be non-negative .	In the first case , although the individual has the flexiblity to buy or sell at any time , we find that the individual will not buy a life annuity unless she can cover all her consumption via the annuity and she will never sell her annuity .
1	It allows one to sum up the leading logarithms in all orders of perturbation theory .	We develop a method for the construction of the effective potential at high temperatures based on the effective field theory approach and renormalization group .	The method reproduces the known one-loop and two-loop results in a very simple and economic way and clarifies the issue of the convergence of the perturbation theory .	We also discuss the assumptions being made for the determination of the critical temperature of the electroweak phase transition , and analyse different perturbative uncertainties in its determination .	These results are then used for the non-perturbative lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the EW phase transition in forthcoming paper .
0	We present a novel , real-time algorithm to track the trajectory of each pedestrian in moderately dense crowded scenes .	Our formulation is based on an adaptive particle-filtering scheme that uses a combination of various multi-agent heterogeneous pedestrian simulation models .	We automatically compute the optimal parameters for each of these different models based on prior tracked data and use the best model as motion prior for our particle-filter based tracking algorithm .	We also use our `` mixture of motion models '' for adaptive particle selection and accelerate the performance of the online tracking algorithm .	The motion model parameter estimation is formulated as an optimization problem , and we use an approach that solves this combinatorial optimization problem in a model independent manner and hence scalable to any multi-agent pedestrian motion model .
4	We present new spectroscopic observations for 98 of the radio sources , and supplement these spectroscopic redshifts with photometric ones calculated from 5-band optical imaging .	The Australia Telescope Hubble Deep Field-South ( ATHDFS ) survey of the Hubble Deep Field South reaches sensitivities of ~10 miceoJyJy at 1.4 , 2.5 , 5.2 and 8.7 GHz , making the ATHDFS one of the deepest surveys ever performed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array .	Here we present the optical identifications of the ATHDFS radio sources using data from the literature .	We find that ~66 % of the radio sources have optical counterparts to I = 23.5 mag .	Deep HST imaging of the area identifies a further 12 % of radio sources .
2	Here we study the switching characteristics of nanoscale junctions created between a tungsten tip and a silver film covered by a thin ionic conductor layer .	Solid state ionic conductors are good candidates for the next generation of nonvolatile computer memory elements .	Such devices have to show reproducible resistance switching at reasonable voltage and current values even if scaled down to the nanometer sizes .	Atomic-sized junctions show spectacular current induced switching characteristics , but both the magnitude of the switching voltage and the direction of the switching vary randomly for different junctions .	In contrast , for somewhat larger junctions with diameters of a few nanometers a well defined , reproducible switching behavior is observed which is associated with the formation and destruction of nanoscale channels in the ionic conductor surface layer .
3	UBVRIK ' multi-band imaging of the afterglow ~12 days after the GRB reveals a blue spectral energy distribution ( SED ) .	We report on ground-based and HST ( +STIS ) imaging of the afterglow and host galaxy of the Gamma-Ray Burst ( GRB ) of March 5 2002 .	The GRB occurred in a R=25.17+/-0.14 galaxy , which apparently is part of an interacting system .	The lightcurve of the optical afterglow shows a rebrightening , or at least a plateau , 12 -- 16 days after the gamma-ray event .	The SED is consistent with a power-law with a spectral index of \beta=-0.63+/-0.16 , but there is tentative evidence for deviations away from a power-law .
3	However , in order to promote its use and understanding , we must first have a pragmatic understanding of complexity and self-organization .	Our technologies complexify our environments .	Thus , new technologies need to deal with more and more complexity .	Several efforts have been made to deal with this complexity using the concept of self-organization .	This paper presents a conceptual framework for speaking about self-organizing systems .
2	Therefore it is a suitable target for a study of triggered star formation ( e.g.Sandell & amp ; Knee 2001 , SK 1 ) .	According to a triggered star formation scenario ( e.g.Martin-Pintado & amp ; Cernicharo 1987 ) outflows powered by young stellar objects shape the molecular clouds , can dig cavities , and trigger new star formation .	NGC 1333 is an active site of low- and intermediate star formation in Perseus and is a suggested site of self-regulated star formation Norman & amp ; Silk 1980 .	On the other hand , continuum sub-mm observations of star forming regions can detect dust thermal emission of embedded sources ( which drive outflows ) , and further detailed structures .	Within the framework of our wide-field mapping of star formation regions in the Perseus and Orion molecular clouds using SCUBA at 850 and 450 micrometers , we map NCG 1333 with an area of around 14 ' x 21 ' .
2	Moreover , it is shown that for the the Chern ( Rund ) and Hashiguchi connections , the associated semispray coincides with the canonical spray and the associated nonlinear connection coincides with the Barthel connection .	Adopting the pullback approach to global Finsler geometry , the aim of the present paper is to provide intrinsic ( coordinate-free ) proofs of the existence and uniqueness theorems for the Chern ( Rund ) and Hashiguchi connections on a Finsler manifold .	To accomplish this , we introduce and investigate the notions of semispray and nonlinear connection associated with a given regular connection , in the pullback bundle .	Explicit intrinsic expressions relating these connections and the Cartan connection are deduced .	Although our investigation is entirely global , the local expressions of the obtained results , when calculated , coincide with the existing classical local results .
3	The scheme has the asymptotic preserving ( AP ) properties for both diffusive and ballistic regimes , and can present accurate solutions in the whole transition regime as well .	Numerical prediction of multiscale heat transfer is a challenging problem due to the wide range of time and length scales involved .	In this work a discrete unified gas kinetic scheme ( DUGKS ) is developed for heat transfer in materials with different acoustic thickness based on the phonon Boltzmann equation .	With discrete phonon direction , the Boltzmann equation is discretized with a second-order finite-volume formulation , in which the time-step is fully determined by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy ( CFL ) condition .	The DUGKS is a self-adaptive multiscale method for the capturing of local transport process .
2	We derive upper and lower bounds for the trace distance and for the fidelity between two quantum states , which imply bounds for the Bures distance between the unitary orbits of both states .	We analyse the problem of finding sets of quantum states that can be deterministically discriminated .	From a geometric point of view this problem is equivalent to that of embedding a simplex of points whose distances are maximal with respect to the Bures distance ( or trace distance ) .	We thus show that when analysing minimal and maximal distances between states of fixed spectra it is sufficient to consider diagonal states only .	Hence considering optimal discrimination , given freedom up to unitary orbits , it is sufficient to consider diagonal states .
2	In-spite of significantly correlated production due to baryon number , electric charge conservation and kinematical correlations of protons and anti-protons , the measured cumulants of the net-proton distribution follow the independent production model .	We study the effects of correlations on cumulants and their ratios of net-proton multiplicity distributions which have been measured for central ( 0\ % -5\ % ) Au + Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) .	This effect has been studied assuming individual proton and anti-proton distributions as a Poisson or Negative Binomial Distribution ( NBD ) .	In the present work we demonstrate how the introduction of the correlations will affect the cumulants and their ratios for the difference distributions .	We have also demonstrated this study using the proton and anti-proton distributions obtained from the HIJING event generator .
3	Such operational models provide support to civil and environmental protection activities ( e.g. , driving sub-models for oil-spill dispersion , storm surge , coastal morphodynamic changes during storms , saline wedge intrusion along Po River ) , in a growing context of stake-holders at regional , national and international level .	From the first implementation in its purely hydrodynamic configuration , to the last configuration under the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport ( COAWST ) system , several specific modelling applications of the Regional Ocean Modelling Systems ( ROMS , www.myroms.org ) have been put forward within the Adriatic Sea ( Italy ) region .	Covering now a wide range of spatial and temporal scales , they developed in a growing number of fields supporting Integrated Coastal Zone Management ( ICZM ) and Marine Spatial Planning ( MSP ) activities in this semi-enclosed sea of paramount importance including the Gulf of Venice .	Presently , a ROMS operational implementation provides every day hydrodynamic and sea level 3-days forecasts , while a second one models the most relevant biogeochemical properties , and a third one ( two-way coupled with the Simulating Waves Nearshore ( SWAN ) model ) deals with extreme waves forecast .	Besides , ROMS and COAWST research based activities are also carried out , mostly aiming at investigating sediment transport , eggs and larvae dispersion , hypoxic events in the basin ; through successive nesting very high resolutions nearshore the Italian coast can be reached , allowing to simulate river mouth environments and artificial reefs .
0	We report on the first measurement of inclusive J/ $ \psi $ elliptic flow , $ v_2 $ , in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC .	The measurement is performed with the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { \rm NN } } = 2.76 $ TeV in the rapidity range $ 2.5 & lt ; y & lt ; 4.0 $ .	The dependence of the J/ $ \psi $ $ v_2 $ on the collision centrality and on the J/ $ \psi $ transverse momentum is studied in the range $ 0 & lt ; p_ { \rm T } & lt ; 10 $ GeV/ $ c $ .	For semi-central Pb-Pb collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { \rm NN } } = 2.76 $ TeV , an indication of non-zero $ v_2 $ is observed with a maximum value of $ v_2 = 0.116 \pm 0.046 { \rm ( stat . ) }	\pm 0.029 { \rm ( syst .
0	The distribution of human linguistic groups presents a number of interesting and non-trivial patterns .	The distributions of the number of speakers per language and the area each group covers follow log-normal distributions , while population and area fulfill an allometric relationship .	The topology of networks of spatial contacts between different linguistic groups has been recently characterized , showing atypical properties of the degree distribution and clustering , among others .	Human demography , spatial conflicts , and the construction of networks of contacts between linguistic groups are mutually dependent processes .	Here we introduce an adaptive network model that takes all of them into account and successfully reproduces , using only four model parameters , not only those features of linguistic groups already described in the literature , but also correlations between demographic and topological properties uncovered in this work .
0	It has recently been shown that small quantum subsystems generically equilibrate , in the sense that they spend most of the time close to a fixed equilibrium state .	This relies on just two assumptions : that the state is spread over many different energies , and that the Hamiltonian has non-degenerate energy gaps .	Given the same assumptions , it has also been shown that closed systems equilibrate with respect to realistic measurements .	We extend these results in two important ways .	First , we prove equilibration over a finite ( rather than infinite ) time-interval , allowing us to bound the equilibration time .
3	Earlier work by Fisch , Gravner , and Griffeath studied the ergodic behavior of these excitable cellular automata on Z^2 , and identified two distinct ( but closely-related ) elaborate phase portraits as the parameters vary .	We study two families of excitable cellular automata known as the Greenberg-Hastings Model ( GHM ) and the Cyclic Cellular Automaton ( CCA ) .	Each family consists of local deterministic oscillating lattice dynamics , with parallel discrete-time updating , parametrized by the range of interaction , the `` shape '' of its neighbor set , threshold value for contact updating , and number of possible states per site .	GHM and CCA are mathematically tractable prototypes for the spatially distributed periodic wave activity of so-called excitable media observed in diverse disciplines of experimental science .	In particular , they noted the emergence of asymptotic phase diagrams ( and Euclidean dynamics ) in a well-defined threshold-range scaling limit .
0	The integrable quantum models , associated to the transfer matrices of the 6-vertex reflection algebra for spin 1/2 representations , are studied in this paper .	In the framework of Sklyanin 's quantum separation of variables ( SOV ) , we provide the complete characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the transfer matrix and the proof of the simplicity of the transfer matrix spectrum .	Moreover , we use these integrable quantum models as further key examples for which to develop a method in the SOV framework to compute matrix elements of local operators .	This method has been introduced first in [ 1 ] and then used also in [ 2 ] , it is based on the resolution of the quantum inverse problem ( i.e.the reconstruction of all local operators in terms of the quantum separate variables ) plus the computation of the action of separate covectors on separate vectors .	In particular , for these integrable quantum models , which in the homogeneous limit reproduce the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions , we have obtained the SOV-reconstructions for a class of quasi-local operators and determinant formulae for the covector-vector actions .
4	We find that the system relaxes into canonical equilibrium for almost all initial pure bath states of macroscopically well-defined energy .	We consider a quantum system weakly coupled to a large heat bath of harmonic oscillators .	It is well known that such a boson bath initially at thermal equilibrium thermalises the system .	We show that assuming a priori an equilibrium state is not necessary to obtain the thermalisation of the system .	We determine the complete Schr\ '' odinger time evolution of the subsystem of interest for an initial pure product state of the composite system consisting of the considered system and the bath .
0	Two examples of asymptotic $ \ell_ { 1 } $ Banach spaces are given .	The first , $ X_ { u } $ , has an unconditional basis and is arbitrarily distortable .	The second , $ X $ , does not contain any unconditional basic sequence .	Both are spaces of the type of Tsirelson .	We thus answer a question raised by W.T.Gowers .
4	Escape rate constants are reported and comparisons with experiment are discussed .	We report the results of molecular dynamics simulations of the release of five species of noble gas atoms trapped inside a small cluster of fullerenes in the temperature range 4000K & lt ; T & lt ; 5000K .	We find that larger noble gas atoms are generally released at a slower rate and that helium is released considerably more rapidly than any of the other noble gases .	The differing release rates are due not only to the differences in the size and mass of a given endohedral species but also because larger trapped atoms tend to stabilize the fullerene cage against thermal fluctuations .	Unlike with the case of atoms entering fullerenes , we find that any atom escaping from the cage results in a window which does not close .
0	We search the COSMOS survey for pairs of galaxies consistent with the gravitational lensing signature of a cosmic string .	The COSMOS survey imaged 1.64 square degrees using the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) .	Our technique includes estimates of the efficiency for finding the lensed galaxy pair .	We find no evidence for cosmic strings with a mass per unit length of G mu/c^2 & lt ; 3.0E-7 out to redshifts greater than 0.6 and set 95 % upper limits .	This corresponds to a global 95 % upper limit of Omega_string & lt ; 0.0028 .
3	Traditional network control algorithms introduce high overhead and delay in this setup as the network control and cooperation decisions are made in a source-centric manner .	The increasing popularity of applications such as video streaming in today 's mobile devices introduces higher demand for throughput , and puts a strain especially on cellular links .	Cooperation among mobile devices by exploiting both cellular and local area connections is a promising approach to meet the increasing demand .	In this paper , we consider that a group of cooperative mobile devices , exploiting both cellular and local area links and within proximity of each other , are interested in the same video content .	Instead , we develop a device-centric stochastic cooperation scheme .
2	Nevertheless , substantial recent progress in measuring the CIB and its structure has been made .	Cosmic infrared background ( CIB ) contains information about galaxy luminosities over the entire history of the Universe and can be a powerful diagnostic of the early populations otherwise inaccessible to telescopic studies .	Its measurements are very difficult because of the strong IR foregrounds from the Solar system and the Galaxy .	The measurements now allow to set significant constraints on early galaxy evolution and , perhaps , even detect the elusive Population III era .	We discuss briefly the theory behind the CIB , review the latest measurements of the CIB and its structure , and discuss their implications for detecting and/or constraining the first stars and their epochs .
0	Quasi-particle spin susceptibility ( $ \chi^ { qp } $ ) for various heavy-fermion ( HF ) superconductors are discussed on the basis of the experimental results of electronic specific heat ( $ \gamma_ { el } $ ) , NMR Knight shift ( $ K $ ) and NMR relaxation rate ( $ 1/T_1 $ ) within the framework of the Fermi liquid model for a Kramers doublet crystal electric field ( CEF ) ground state .	$ \chi^ { qp } _ { \gamma } $ is calculated from the enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $ \gamma_ { el } $ and $ \chi^ { qp } _ { T_1 } $ from the quasi-particle Korringa relation $ T_1T ( K^ { qp } _ { T_1 } ) ^2=const. $ via the relation of $ \chi^ { qp } _ { T_1 } = ( N_A\mu_B/A_ { hf } ) K^ { qp } _ { T_1 } $ where $ A_ { hf } $ is the hyperfine coupling constant , $ N_A $ the Abogadoro 's number and $ \mu_B $ the Bohr magneton .	For the even-parity ( spin-singlet ) superconductors CeCu $ _2 $ Si $ _2 $ , CeCoIn $ _5 $ and UPd $ _2 $ Al $ _3 $ , the fractional decrease in the Knight shift , $ \delta K^ { obs } $ , below the superconducting transition temperature ( $ T_c $ ) is due to the decrease of the spin susceptibility of heavy quasi-particle estimated consistently from $ \chi^ { qp } _ { \gamma } $ and $ \chi^ { qp } _ { T_1 } $ .	This result allows us to conclude that the heavy quasi-particles form the spin-singlet Cooper pairs in CeCu $ _2 $ Si $ _2 $ , CeCoIn $ _5 $ and UPd $ _2 $ Al $ _3 $ .	On the other hand , no reduction in the Knight shift is observed in UPt $ _3 $ and UNi $ _2 $ Al $ _3 $ , nevertheless the estimated values of $ \chi^ { qp } _ { \gamma } $ and $ \chi^ { qp } _ { T_1 } $ are large enough to be probed experimentally .
1	In this paper , we generalize the concept to a multi-shift setting : a multi-shift de Bruijn sequence tau ( m , n ) of shift m and order n is a word such that every word of length n appears exactly once in w as a factor that starts at index im+1 for some integer i & gt ; =0 .	A ( non-circular ) de Bruijn sequence w of order n is a word such that every word of length n appears exactly once in w as a factor .	We show the number of the multi-shift de Bruijn sequence tau ( m , n ) is ( a^n ) ! a^ { ( m-n ) ( a^n-1 ) } for 1 & lt ; =n & lt ; =m and is ( a^m !	) ^ { a^ { n-m } } for 1 & lt ; =m & lt ; =n , where a=|Sigma| .	We provide two algorithms for generating a tau ( m , n ) .
3	The $ s $ dependence of the cross section has been directly studied and our result indicates that the $ 1/s^3 $ scaling is more favored than $ 1/s^4 $ .	The exclusive processes $ e^+e^-\to VP $ , in the region of which the final state meson momentum is much larger than the hadronic scale $ \Lambda_ { QCD } $ , are studied in the framework of PQCD approach based on the $ k_T $ factorization .	Including the transverse momentum distribution in the light cone wave functions , our results are consistent with the experimental measurements .	According to our results , many processes have large enough cross sections to be detected at $ \sqrt s=10.58 $ GeV .	We also find that the gluonic contribution for the processes involving $ \eta^ { ( ' ) } $ is tiny .
2	Since the problem formulated this way is NP-hard , most effort has gone into the construction of search algorithms , and less to the question of other measures of community structures , similarities between various partitionings and the validation with respect to external information .	The issue of partitioning a network into communities has attracted a great deal of attention recently .	Most authors seem to equate this issue with the one of finding the maximum value of the modularity , as defined by Newman .	Here we concentrate on a class of computer generated networks and on three well-studied real networks which constitute a bench-mark for network studies ; the karate club , the US college football teams and a gene network of yeast .	We utilize some standard ways of clustering data ( originally not designed for finding community structures in networks ) and show that these classical methods sometimes outperform the newer ones .
3	We prove convergence and give convergence rates for smooth objectives assuming that the one-dimensional optimization can be solved exactly or approximately by an oracle .	We consider unconstrained randomized optimization of convex objective functions .	We analyze the Random Pursuit algorithm , which iteratively computes an approximate solution to the optimization problem by repeated optimization over a randomly chosen one-dimensional subspace .	This randomized method only uses zeroth-order information about the objective function and does not need any problem-specific parametrization .	A convenient property of Random Pursuit is its invariance under strictly monotone transformations of the objective function .
4	As an application we improve the lower bound on the complexity of $ W ( { \bf\Delta } _1^1 ) $ given by Lecomte .	A dictionary is a set of finite words over some finite alphabet X .	The omega-power of a dictionary V is the set of infinite words obtained by infinite concatenation of words in V. Lecomte studied in [ Omega-powers and descriptive set theory , JSL 2005 ] the complexity of the set of dictionaries whose associated omega-powers have a given complexity .	In particular , he considered the sets $ W ( { \bf\Si } ^0_ { k } ) $ ( respectively , $ W ( { \bf\Pi } ^0_ { k } ) $ , $ W ( { \bf\Delta } _1^1 ) $ ) of dictionaries $ V \subseteq 2^\star $ whose omega-powers are $ { \bf\Si } ^0_ { k } $ -sets ( respectively , $ { \bf\Pi } ^0_ { k } $ -sets , Borel sets ) .	In this paper we first establish a new relation between the sets $ W ( { \bf\Sigma } ^0_ { 2 } ) $ and $ W ( { \bf\Delta } _1^1 ) $ , showing that the set $ W ( { \bf\Delta } _1^1 ) $ is `` more complex '' than the set $ W ( { \bf\Sigma } ^0_ { 2 } ) $ .
3	We argue that this is primarily due to the loss of coherence and reduced mobility of the hole quasiparticles caused by impurity scattering .	We investigate magnetic properties of lightly doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators in the presence of non-magnetic impurities .	Within the framework of the t-J model we calculate the doping dependence of the antiferromagnetic order parameter using the self-consistent diagrammatic techniques .	We show that in the presence of non-magnetic impurities the antiferromagnetic order is more robust against hole doping in comparison with the impurity-free host , implying that magnetic order can re-appear upon Zn doping into lightly hole-doped cuprates .	These results are consistent with experimental data on Zn-doped LaSrCuO .
4	The inferred z_phot value is also robust compared to a Bayesian redshift estimator which gives z_phot=0.94+/-0.13 .	No optical afterglow was found for the dark burst GRB 981226 and hence no absorption redshift has been obtained .	We here use ground-based and space imaging observations to analyse the spectral energy distribution ( SED ) of the host galaxy .	By comparison with synthetic template spectra we determine the photometric redshift of the GRB 981226 host to be z_phot = 1.11+/-0.06 ( 68 % confidence level ) .	While the age-metallicity degeneracy for the host SED complicates the determination of accurate ages , metallicity , and extinction , the photometric redshift is robust .
4	We construct action functionals for real scalar fields on noncommutative curved spacetimes , and derive the corresponding deformed wave equations .	We study classical scalar field theories on noncommutative curved spacetimes .	Following the approach of Wess et al .	[ Classical Quantum Gravity 22 ( 2005 ) , 3511 and Classical Quantum Gravity 23 ( 2006 ) , 1883 ] , we describe noncommutative spacetimes by using ( Abelian ) Drinfel 'd twists and the associated *-products and *-differential geometry .	In particular , we allow for position dependent noncommutativity and do not restrict ourselves to the Moyal-Weyl deformation .
1	Through a two-dimensional realization of this algebra for a gauge field including electromagnetic vector potential and two spin-orbit-like coupling terms , a Dirac-like Hamiltonian in noncommutative coordinates is introduced .	A generalized algebra of noncommutative coordinates and momenta embracing non-Abelian gauge fields is proposed .	We established the corresponding energy spectrum and from that we derived the relation between the energy level quantum number and the magnetic field at the maxima of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations .	By tuning the non-commutativity parameter \theta in terms of the values of magnetic field at the maxima of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations we accomplished the experimentally observed Landau plot of the peaks for graphene .	Accepting that the experimentally observed behavior is due to the confinement of carriers , we conclude that our method of introducing noncommutative coordinates provides another formulation of the confined massless Dirac fermions in graphene .
0	The Milky Way has been estabished to emit gamma rays .	These gamma rays are presumably dominated by decays of neutral pions , although inverse Compton scatterings and bremsstrahlung also contribute .	It is plausible that other galaxies can be diffuse sources of gamma rays in a similar manner .	Starburst galaxies are particularly interesting to study as they are expected to have much higher cosmic-ray fluxes and interstellar matter densities .	The neutral pions are created in cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar matter .
3	Only more precise data can determine whether the CKM matrix opens new vistas beyond the standard model or not .	The unitarity of the CKM matrix is examined in the light of the latest available accurate data .	The analysis shows that for the elements in the first row , there are two types of experimental measurements leading to different results for the violation of unitarity .	A conclusive result can not be derived at present .	The experimental data for the elements in the second row are not as precise as for those in the first row , and within the measured uncertainty , the unitarity is not violated .
1	Such games can be formulated as the search for sections to the complement of a coverage region in a ( trivial ) vector bundle over a timeline .	Considered is a class of pursuit-evasion games , in which an evader tries to avoid detection .	Prior results give homological criteria for evasion in the general case that are not necessary and sufficient .	This paper provides a necessary and sufficient positive cohomological criterion for evasion in a general case .	The principal tools are ( 1 ) a refinement of the cohomology of a coverage region with a positive cone encoding spatial orientation , ( 2 ) a refinement of the homology of the coverage gaps with a positive cone encoding time orientation , and ( 3 ) a positive variant of Alexander Duality in homological degrees 0,1 .
0	The lunar surface has historically been considered an optimal site for a broad range of astronomical telescopes .	That assumption , which has come to be somewhat reflexive , is critically examined in this paper and found to be poorly substantiated .	The value of the lunar surface for astronomy may be broadly compelling only in comparison to terrestrial sites .	It is suggested here that the development and successful operation of the Hubble Space Telescope marked a turning point in the perception of value for free-space siting of astronomical telescopes , and for telescopes on the Moon .	As the astronomical community considers the scientific potential of the Vision for Space Exploration ( VSE ) and the return to the Moon in particular , it should construct a value proposition that includes the tools , technology , and architecture being developed for this return , as these can well be seen as being more astronomically enabling than the lunar surface itself - a destination that offers little more than rocks and gravity .
0	Following findings by Ormerod and Mounfield , Wright rises the problem whether a power or an exponential law describes the distribution of occurrences of economic recession periods .	In order to clarify the controversy a different set of GDP data is hereby examined .	The conclusion about a power law distribution of recession periods seems better though the matter is not entirely settled .	The case of prosperity duration is also studied and is found to follow a power law .	Universal but also non universal features between recession and prosperity cases are emphasized .
1	In particular , a state of asynchronous activity with low firing rates and low pairwise correlations emerges in sparsely connected networks .	The population activity of random networks of excitatory and inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF ) neurons has been studied extensively .	We apply linear response theory to evaluate the influence of detailed network structure on neuron dynamics .	It turns out that pairwise correlations induced by direct and indirect network connections can be related to the matrix of direct linear interactions .	Furthermore , we study the influence of characteristics of the neuron model .
2	When averaged , two independent analyses find the charge ratio underground to be 1.374 +/- 0.004 ( stat . )	The 5.4 kton MINOS far detector has been taking charge-separated cosmic ray muon data since the beginning of August , 2003 at a depth of 2070 meters-water-equivalent in the Soudan Underground Laboratory , Minnesota , USA .	The data with both forward and reversed magnetic field running configurations were combined to minimize systematic errors in the determination of the underground muon charge ratio .	+0.012 -0.010 ( sys . ) .	Using the map of the Soudan rock overburden , the muon momenta as measured underground were projected to the corresponding values at the surface in the energy range 1-7 TeV .
4	Chiral symmetry is partially restored inside the flux , and the reduction of the condensate is about 20 % at the center of the tube .	Using the eigenmodes of the overlap-Dirac operator , we study the topological structure of the QCD vacuum .	We investigate the space-time profile of the low-lying eigenmodes and their contribution to the vacuum action density and chiral condensate under the existence of static color sources .	We demonstrate that the low-lying Dirac eigenmode shows the flux-tube structure , which suggests the relevance to confinement .	We also analyze the chiral condensate in the flux-tube .
1	In many applications data are correlated , so that the observed test statistic used for detecting a non-null case , or signal , at each location in a dataset carries some information about the chances of a true signal at other locations .	Over the last decade , large-scale multiple testing has found itself at the forefront of modern data analysis .	Brown , Lazar , Datta , Jang , and McDowell ( 2014 ) proposed in the neuroimaging context a Bayesian multiple testing model that accounts for the dependence of each volume element on the behavior of its neighbors through a conditional autoregressive ( CAR ) model .	Here , we propose a generalized CAR model that allows for inclusion of points with no neighbors at all , something that is not possible under conventional CAR models .	We consider also neighborhoods based on criteria other than physical location , such as genetic pathways in microarray determined from existing biological knowledge .
1	This structure was first introduced by Randers ~\cite { [ 8 ] } from the standpoint of general relativity .	By a Randers ' structure on a manifold $ M $ we mean a Finsler structure $ L^*=L+\alpha $ , where $ L $ is a Riemannian structure and $ \alpha $ is a 1-form on $ M $ .	In this paper , we replace $ L $ by a Finsler structure , calling the resulting manifold a generalized Randers manifold .	On one hand , we develop in some depth generalized Randers manifolds .	On the other hand , we apply the results obtained in a foregoing paper ~\cite { [ 12 ] } to generalized Randers manifolds to obtain some new results in that domain .
2	Here we report on such a source that provides a method for generating quantum correlated beams that can be extended to a large number of modes by using multiple four-wave mixing ( FWM ) processes in hot rubidium vapor .	Quantum correlations and entanglement shared among multiple quantum modes are important for both fundamental science and the future development of quantum technologies .	This development will also require an efficient quantum interface between multimode quantum light sources and atomic ensembles , which makes it necessary to implement multimode quantum light sources that match the atomic transitions .	Experimentally we show that two cascaded FWM processes produce strong quantum correlations between three bright beams but not between any two of them .	In addition , the intensity-difference squeezing is enhanced with the cascaded system to -7.0 $ \pm $ 0.1 dB from the -5.5 $ \pm $ 0.1/-4.5 $ \pm $ 0.1 dB squeezing obtained with only one FWM process .
3	With respect to a cognitive motivated situation like a conversation between partners , mind-maps become interesting as they are able to process stimulating signals whenever they occur .	The explorative mind-map is a dynamic framework , that emerges automatically from the input , it gets .	It is unlike a verificative modeling system where existing ( human ) thoughts are placed and connected together .	In this regard , explorative mind-maps change their size continuously , being adaptive with connectionist cells inside ; mind-maps process data input incrementally and offer lots of possibilities to interact with the user through an appropriate communication interface .	If these signals are close to an own understanding of the world , then the conversational partner becomes automatically more trustful than if the signals do not or less match the own knowledge scheme .
4	We interpret these imperfections as due to the interaction of FCDs with dislocations .	It is usual to think of Focal Conic Domains ( FCD ) as perfect geometric constructions in which the layers are folded into Dupin cyclides , about an ellipse and a hyperbola that are conjugate .	This ideal picture is often far from reality .	We have investigated in detail the FCDs in several materials that have a transition from a smectic A ( SmA ) to a nematic phase ( N ) .	The ellipse and the hyperbola are seldom perfect , and the FCD textures also suffer large transformations ( in shape or/and in nature ) when approaching the transition to the nematic phase , or appear imperfect on cooling from the nematic phase .
3	We have combined our submillimeter images with Spitzer data at 70 microns to produce 2-d maps of line-of-sight optical depth ( relative column density ) .	We have used the SHARC II camera at Caltech Submillimeter Observatory to make 350 and 450 micron images of the Vega dust disk at spatial resolutions ( FWHM ) of 9.7 '' and 11.1 '' , respectively .	The images show a ring-like morphology ( radius \~ 100 AU ) with inhomogeneous structure that is qualitatively different from that previously reported at 850 microns and longer wavelengths .	We attribute the 350/450 micron emission to a grain population whose characteristic size ( ~ 1 mm ) is intermediate between that of the cm-sized grains responsible for emission longward of 850 microns and the much smaller grains ( & lt ; 18 microns ) in the extensive halo , visible at 70 microns , discussed by Su et al . ( 2005 ) .	These `` tau maps '' suggest that the mm-sized grains are located preferentially in three symmetrically-located concentrations .
4	These properties will guide $ \Lambda $ CDM Cosmology to evolve to match the challenge that observations presently pose .	In the past years a wealth of observations has allowed us to unravel the structural properties of the Dark and Luminous mass distribution in spirals .	As result , it has been found that their rotation curves follow , out their virial radius , an Universal function ( URC ) made by two terms : one due to the gravitational potential of a Freeman stellar disk and the other due to that of a dark halo .	The importance of the latter is found to decrease with galaxy mass .	Individual objects reveal in detail that dark halos have a density core , whose size correlates with its central value .
3	In this work , we extend the settings of the above approaches , by adding another dimension to the problem .	Many challenging tasks in sensor networks , including sensor calibration , ranking of nodes , monitoring , event region detection , collaborative filtering , collaborative signal processing , { \em etc .	} , can be formulated as a problem of solving a linear system of equations .	Several recent works propose different distributed algorithms for solving these problems , usually by using linear iterative numerical methods .	Specifically , we are interested in { \em self-stabilizing } algorithms , that continuously run and converge to a solution from any initial state .
4	We find that there is no significant optical variability with a firm upper limit of 2 per cent and conclude that the primary soft X-ray emission region produces little of the observed optical emission .	We report on a short optical monitoring programme of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy IRAS 13224-3809 .	Previous X-ray observations of this object have shown persistent giant variability .	The degree of variability at other wavelengths may then be used to constrain the conditions and emission processes within the nucleus .	Optical variability is expected if the electron population responsible for the soft X-ray emission is changing rapidly and Compton-upscattering infrared photons in the nucleus , or if the mechanism responsible for X-ray emission causes all the emission processes to vary together .
0	A pressing problem for supersymmetry ( SUSY ) phenomenologists is how to incorporate Large Hadron Collider search results into parameter fits designed to measure or constrain the SUSY parameters .	Owing to the computational expense of fully simulating lots of points in a generic SUSY space to aid the calculation of the likelihoods , the limits published by experimental collaborations are frequently interpreted in slices of reduced parameter spaces .	For example , both ATLAS and CMS have presented results in the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Model ( CMSSM ) by fixing two of four parameters , and generating a coarse grid in the remaining two .	We demonstrate that by generating a grid in the full space of the CMSSM , one can interpolate between the output of an LHC detector simulation using machine learning techniques , thus obtaining a superfast likelihood calculator for LHC-based SUSY parameter fits .	We further investigate how much training data is required to obtain usable results , finding that approximately 2000 points are required in the CMSSM to get likelihood predictions to an accuracy of a few per cent .
4	We therefore , attempt to model the X-ray data with a `` scatterer '' model in which the intrinsic X-ray emission along our line of sight is obscured by an absorbing screen while some fraction , f , is scattered into our line of sight by an ionized medium ; this is the standard model for the X-ray emission in obscured ( but non Compton-thick ) Seyfert galaxies .	We present ROSAT HRI and ASCA observations of the well known ULIRG IRAS19254-7245 ( the Superantennae ) .	The object is not detected by ROSAT yielding a 3\sigma upper limit of L_x ~8x10^ { 41 } erg/s in the 0.1-2 keV band .	However , we obtain a clear detection by ASCA yielding a luminosity in the 2-10 keV band of 2 \times 10^ { 42 } erg/s .	Its X-ray spectrum is very hard , equivalent to a photon index of Gamma=1.0+-0.35 .
0	Ultracold atom-based electron sources have recently been proposed as an alternative to the conventional photo-injectors or thermionic electron guns widely used in modern particle accelerators .	The advantages of ultracold atom-based electron sources lie in the fact that the electrons extracted from the plasma ( created from near threshold photo-ionization of ultracold atoms ) have a very low temperature , i.e.down to tens of Kelvin .	Extraction of these electrons has the potential for producing very low emittance electron bunches .	These features are crucial for the next generation of particle accelerators , including free electron lasers , plasma-based accelerators and future linear colliders .	The source also has many potential direct applications , including ultrafast electron diffraction ( UED ) and electron microscopy , due to its intrinsically high coherence .
0	Goncalves et al .	derived a non-relativistic limit of the generalised Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of a gravitational wave , using the exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation .	This gave rise to the intriguing notion that spin-precession may occur even in the absence of a magnetic field .	We argue that this effect is not physical as it is the result of a gauge-variant term that was an artefact of a flawed application of the exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation .	In this paper we derive the correct non-relativistic limit of the generalised Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of a gravitational wave , using both the exact and standard Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation .
4	The procedure consists in taking into account the proliferation or dilution of these charges and defects and its consequences for the low energy description of the electromagnetic response of the system .	In this work we investigate the description of superconducting systems with multiple Fermi surfaces .	For the case of one Fermi surface we re-obtain the result that the superconductor is more precisely described as a topological state of matter .	Studying the case of more than one Fermi surface , we obtain the effective theory describing a time reversal symmetric topological superconductor .	These results are obtained by employing a general procedure to construct effective low energy actions describing states of electromagnetic systems interacting with charges and defects .
1	The derived bound on the largest permissible time step is tight for any mesh and any diffusion matrix within a factor of $ 2 ( d+1 ) $ , where $ d $ is the spatial dimension .	We study the stability of explicit one-step integration schemes for the linear finite element approximation of linear parabolic equations .	Both full mass matrix and mass lumping are considered .	The bound reveals that the stability condition is affected by two factors .	The first one depends on the number of mesh elements and corresponds to the classic bound for the Laplace operator on a uniform mesh .
4	The most distant radio galaxies within the USS sample have the steepest radio spectra .	We present spectroscopic observations for 64 radio galaxies having ultra steep radio spectra .	Twenty-nine objects have redshifts $ z & gt ; 2 $ , the largest redshifts being almost 4 .	Our ultra steep spectrum ( USS ) criterion ( $ \alpha & lt ; -1 $ ) has proven to be the most efficient way of finding distant radio galaxies .	We find that even among the USS sources , there is a strong statistical correlation between the spectral index and redshift .
0	A minor change to the standard epistemic logical language , replacing $ K_ { i } $ with $ K_ { \node { i , t } } $ where $ t $ is a time instance , gives rise to a generalized and more expressive form of knowledge and common knowledge operators .	We investigate the communication structures that are necessary for such generalized epistemic states to arise , and the inter-agent coordination tasks that require such knowledge .	Previous work has established a relation between linear event ordering and nested knowledge , and between simultaneous event occurrences and common knowledge .	In the new , extended , formalism , epistemic necessity is decoupled from temporal necessity .	Nested knowledge and event ordering are shown to be related even when the nesting order does not match the temporal order of occurrence .
3	By using these , as well as other world data , we evaluated the F2 structure function and its moments .	We report on the measurement of inclusive electron scattering off a carbon target performed with CLAS at Jefferson Laboratory .	A combination of three different beam energies 1.161 , 2.261 and 4.461 GeV allowed us to reach an invariant mass of the final-state hadronic system W~2.4 GeV with four-momentum transfers Q2 ranging from 0.2 to 5 GeV2 .	These data , together with previous measurements of the inclusive electron scattering off proton and deuteron , which cover a similar continuous two-dimensional region of Q2 and Bjorken variable x , permit the study of nuclear modifications of the nucleon structure .	Using an OPE-based twist expansion , we studied the Q2-evolution of the moments , obtaining a separation of the leading-twist and the total higher-twist terms .
0	Wireless networks are becoming the key building block of our communications infrastructure .	Examples range from cellular networks to ad hoc and sensor networks in wildlife monitoring and environmental scenarios .	With the rise of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) millions of physical and virtual objects will communicate wireless and enhance the daily life .	The adaptivity and scalability of wireless networks in the IoT is one of the most challenging tasks .	Bio-inspired networking algorithms are a way to tackle these issues .
4	It is shown that the given bound is not tight for certain classes of parameters , implying a nonexistence result for the corresponding locally repairable almost affine codes , that are coined perfect in this paper .	This paper provides a link between matroid theory and locally repairable codes ( LRCs ) that are either linear or more generally almost affine .	Using this link , new results on both LRCs and matroid theory are derived .	The parameters $ ( n , k , d , r , \delta ) $ of LRCs are generalized to matroids , and the matroid analogue of the generalized Singleton bound in [ P. Gopalan et al. , `` On the locality of codeword symbols , '' IEEE Trans.Inf .	Theory ] for linear LRCs is given for matroids .
1	Two trajectory classes are considered : a straight cord between two surface points , and the brachistochrone path that minimizes the falling time between two points .	We explore the gravitational dynamics of falling through planetary interiors .	The times taken to fall along these paths , and the shapes of the brachistochrone paths , are examined for the Moon , Mars , Earth , Saturn , and the Sun , based on models of their interiors .	A toy model of the internal structure , a power-law gravitational field , characterizes the dynamics with one parameter , the exponent of the power-law , with values from -2 for a point-mass to +1 for a uniform sphere .	Smaller celestial bodies behave like a uniform sphere , while larger bodies begin to approximate point-masses , consistent with an effective exponent describing their interior gravity .
4	We compare the cluster properties derived from our SZE observations with and without Chandra spatial and spectral information and find them to be in good agreement .	We present Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect ( SZE ) scaling relations for 38 massive galaxy clusters at redshifts 0.14 & lt ; z0.89 , observed with both the Cchandra X-ray Observatory and the centimeter-wave SZE imaging system at the BIMA and OVRO interferometric arrays .	An isothermal beta-model with central 100 kpc excluded from the X-ray data is used to model the intracluster medium and to measure global cluster properties .	For each cluster , we measure the X-ray spectroscopic temperature , SZE gas mass , total mass and integrated Compton-y parameters within r_2500 .	Our measurements are in agreement with the expectations based on a simple self-similar model of cluster formation and evolution .
3	It manifests itself in an oscillatory behavior of the pairing amplitude in the ferromagnet and spontaneously generated spin polarized current in the ground state .	We discuss the properties of a ferromagnet - superconductor heterostructure on the basis of a Hubbard model featuring exchange splitting in the ferromagnet and electron - electron attraction in the superconductor .	We have solved the spin - polarized Hartree - Fock - Gorkov equations together with the Maxwell 's equation ( Ampere 's law ) fully self-consistently .	We have found that a Proximity Effect - Fulde - Ferrell - Larkin - Ovchinnikov state is realized in such a heterostructure .	We argue that it is built up from the Andreev bound states , whose energy can be tuned by the exchange splitting and hence can coincide with the Fermi energy giving rise to a current carrying $ \pi $ -state .
4	These expressions facilitate robust estimation of the compressive yield and wall adhesion strength via nonlinear regression of experimental data in the presence of small measurement errors .	The batch settling test is widely used to estimate the compressive rheology of strongly flocculated colloidal suspensions , in particular the compressive yield strength and hydraulic permeability .	Recently it has been discovered that wall adhesion effects in these tests may be significantly greater than previously appreciated , which can introduce unbounded errors in the estimation of these rheological functions .	Whilst a methodology to solve the underlying static problem and correct for wall adhesion effects has been developed , this method is quite complex and unwieldy , involving solution of a 2D hyper-elastic constitutive model for strong colloidal gels .	In this paper we develop a highly simplified 1D visco-plastic approximation to the hyper-elastic model which admits analytic expressions for the equilibrium solids concentration profile and bed height .
4	The ATPM explicitly incorporates 1D heat conduction , shadowing , multiple scattering of sunlight , global self-heating , and rough surface thermal-infrared beaming in the model predictions .	Near-Earth asteroid ( 1862 ) Apollo has strong detections of both orbital semimajor axis drift and rotational acceleration .	We produce a unified model that can accurately match both observed effects using a single set of thermophysical properties derived from ground-based observations , and we determine Apollo 's long term evolution .	We use light-curve shape inversion techniques and the ATPM on published light-curve , thermal-infrared , and radar observations to constrain Apollo 's thermophysical properties .	The derived properties are used to make detailed predictions of Apollo 's Yarkovsky and YORP effects , which are then compared with published measurements of orbital drift and rotational acceleration .
2	In the social interactions test , sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory activity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice .	It is well known that psychoemotional disorders may be accompanied by decreased sociability in humans .	It has been shown that repeated social defeats in 10 daily agonistic interactions in male mice led to development of the expressed level of anxiety and to reduction of communication estimated in the elevated plus-maze and partition tests , respectively .	Avoidance of approaching partner was significantly increased .	Demonstration of self-grooming behavior was increased in defeated males .
2	We determine $ { \rm Ext } ^i ( L_I , L_J ) $ for arbitrary rank 1 modules $ L_I $ and $ L_J $ .	In this paper we study extensions between Cohen-Macaulay modules for algebras arising in the categorifications of Grassmannian cluster algebras .	We prove that rank 1 modules are periodic , and we give explicit formulas for the computation of the period based solely on the rim of the rank 1 module in question .	An explicit combinatorial algorithm is given for computation of $ { \rm Ext } ^i ( L_I , L_J ) $ when $ i $ is odd , and for $ i $ even , we show that $ { \rm Ext } ^i ( L_I , L_J ) $ is cyclic over the centre , and we give an explicit formula for its computation .	At the end of the paper we give a vanishing condition of $ { \rm Ext } ^i ( L_I , L_J ) $ for any $ i & gt ; 0 $ .
2	This and other considerations lead to the conclusion that the notion of internal time as it is usually implemented has no satisfactory physical interpretation .	The problem of time evolution in quantum cosmology is studied in the context of a dust-filled , spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe .	In this model , two versions of the commonly-adopted notion of internal time can be implemented in the same quantization , and are found to yield contradictory views of the same quantum state : with one choice , the big-bang singularity appears to be resolved , but with another choice it does not .	A recently proposed variant of the relational-time construction , using a test clock that is regarded as internal to a specific observer , appears to provide an improved account of time evolution relative to the proper time that elapses along the observer 's worldline .	This construction permits the derivation of consistent joint probability densities for observable quantities , which can be viewed either as evolving with proper time or as describing correlations in a timeless manner .
3	At 3.6 and 4.5 um , the galaxy counts follow the expectations of a Euclidean world model down to ~16 mag and drop below the Euclidean curve for fainter magnitudes .	Infrared source counts at wavelengths 3 & lt ; lambda & lt ; 10 um cover more than 10 magnitudes in source brightness , four orders of magnitude in surface density , and reach an integrated surface density of 10^5 sources/deg^2 .	At m & lt ; 14 mag , most of the sources are Galactic stars , in agreement with models .	After removal of Galactic stars , galaxy counts are consistent with what few measurements exist at nearby wavelengths .	Counts at these wavelengths begin to show decreasing completeness around magnitude 19.5 .
0	This paper presents a possible explanation for the enhanced singlet exciton yield in light emitting polymers .	We propose a theory of electron-hole recombination via inter-molecular inter-conversion from inter-molecular weakly bound polaron pairs ( or charge-transfer excitons ) to intra-molecular excitons .	This theory is applicable to parallel polymer chains .	A crucial aspect of the theory is that both the intra-molecular and inter-molecular excitons are effective-particles , which are described by both a relative-particle wavefunction and a center-of-mass wavefunction .	This implies two electronic selection rules .
3	Deformations of Weyl 's original denominator formula to other root systems have been discovered by Okada and Simpson , and it is thus natural to ask for versions of Tokuyama 's factorisation formula involving other root systems .	Half turn symmetric alternating sign matrices ( HTSASMs ) are special variations of the well-known alternating sign matrices which have a long and fascinating history .	HTSASMs are interesting combinatorial objects in their own right and have been the focus of recent study .	Here we explore counting weighted HTSASMs with respect to a number of statistics to derive an orthogonal group version of Tokuyama 's factorisation formula , which involves a deformation and expansion of Weyl 's denominator formula multiplied by a general linear group character .	Here we obtain such a formula involving a deformation of Weyl 's denominator formula for the orthogonal group multiplied by a deformation of an orthogonal group character .
1	Let sper A denote the real spectrum of A .	Let R be a real closed field and A=R [ x_1 , ... , x_n ] .	There are two kinds of points in sper A : finite points ( those for which all of |x_1| , ... , |x_n| are bounded above by some constant in R ) and points at infinity .	In this paper we study the structure of the set of points at infinity of sper A and their associated valuations .	Let T be a subset of { 1 , ... , n } .
2	Here we study the evolution of representative droplets using a model that includes rotation and stretching effects from the surrounding fluid , and restoration effects from surface tension including a constant droplet volume constraint , while assuming that the droplets maintain an ellipsoidal shape .	Small droplets in turbulent flows can undergo highly variable deformations and orientational dynamics .	For neutrally buoyant droplets smaller than the Kolmogorov scale , the dominant effects from the surrounding turbulent flow arise through Lagrangian time histories of the velocity gradient tensor .	The model is combined with Lagrangian time histories of the velocity gradient tensor extracted from DNS of turbulence to obtain simulated droplet evolutions .	These are used to characterize the size , shape and orientation statistics of small droplets in turbulence .
1	WFC3 images show complex dust absorption near the nucleus of IC 2497 .	We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy for the extended high-ionization cloud known as Hanny 's Voorwerp , near the spiral galaxy IC 2497 .	STIS spectra show a type 2 Seyfert AGN of rather low luminosity .	The ionization parameter log U = -3.5 is in accord with its weak X-ray emission .	We find no high-ionization gas near the nucleus , adding to evidence that the AGN is currently at low radiative output ( perhaps now dominated by kinetic energy ) .
3	We interpolate the data to fixed Q^2 , and extract the ratio of neutron to proton structure functions .	Neutron structure functions can be extracted from proton and deuteron data and a representation of the deuteron structure .	This procedure does not require DIS approximations or quark structure assumptions .	We find that the results depend critically on properly accounting for the Q^2 dependence of proton and deuteron data .	The extracted ratio decreases with increasing x , up to x \approx 0.9 , while there are no data available to constrain the behavior at larger x .
4	First , we study a connection of the \cNcs systems $ \Omega_ { F_t } $ $ ( F_t\in \ataz ) $ ( \cite { GTS-I } , \cite { GTS-II } ) over the differential operators algebra $ \cDazz $ and the \cNcs system $ \Omega_\bT^W $ ( \cite { GTS-IV } ) over the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra $ \cH_ { GL } ^W $ ( \cite { GL } , \cite { F1 } , \cite { F2 } ) of $ W $ -labeled rooted trees .	Let $ K $ be any unital commutative $ \bQ $ -algebra and $ W $ any non-empty subset of $ \bN^+ $ .	Let $ z= ( z_1 , ... , z_n ) $ be commutative or noncommutative free variables and $ t $ a formal central parameter .	% Denote uniformly by $ \kzz $ and $ \kttzz $ the formal power series algebras % of $ z $ over $ K $ and $ K [ [ t ] ] $ , respectively .	Let $ \cDazz $ $ ( \alpha\geq 1 ) $ be the unital algebra generated by the differential operators of $ \kzz $ which increase the degree in $ z $ by at least $ \alpha-1 $ and $ \ataz $ the group of automorphisms $ F_t ( z ) =z-H_t ( z ) $ of $ \kttzz $ with $ o ( H_t ( z ) ) \geq \alpha $ and $ H_ { t=0 } ( z ) =0 $ .
1	For the SDSS sample , galaxy color is the galaxy property most predictive of the local environment .	We examine the relationship between environment and the luminosities , surface brightnesses , colors , and profile shapes of luminous galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) .	Galaxy color and luminosity jointly comprise the most predictive pair of properties .	At fixed luminosity and color , density is not closely related to surface brightness or to Sersic index -- the parameter in this study that astronomers most often associate with morphology .	In the text , we discuss what measureable residual relationships exist , generally finding that at red colors and fixed luminosity , the mean density decreases at the highest surface brightnesses and Sersic indices .
1	The resulting spacetime may be statistically uniform on average , or have random , non-repeating variation .	A new method for constructing exact inhomogeneous universes is presented , that allows variation in 3 dimensions .	The construction utilises the Darmois junction conditions to join many different component spacetime regions .	In the initial simple example given , the component parts are spatially flat and uniform , but much more general combinations should be possible .	Further inhomogeneity may be added via swiss cheese vacuoles and inhomogeneous metrics .
1	In the three-body system , these properties include the existence of a geometric spectrum of three-body Efimov states and a discrete scaling symmetry leading to log-periodic dependence of observables on the scattering length .	Particles with resonant short-range interactions have universal properties that do not depend on the details of their structure or their interactions at short distances .	Similar universal properties appear in the four-body system and possibly higher-body systems as well .	For example , universal four-body states have recently been predicted and observed in experiment .	These phenomena are often referred to as `` Efimov Physics '' .
3	Among them , there are topologically nontrivial solutions with finite energy among them .	We consider the Skyrme model using the explicit parameterization of the rotation group SO ( 3 ) through elements of its algebra .	Topologically nontrivial solutions already arise even in the one-dimensional case because the fundamental group of SO ( 3 ) is Z_2 .	We explicitly find and analyze one-dimensional static solutions .	We propose a new class of projective models whose target spaces are arbitrary real projective spaces RP^d .
4	Boolean algebras are replaced by Boolean categories presented by theories in first-order logic , and spaces of models are replaced by topological groupoids of models and their isomorphisms .	From a logical point of view , Stone duality for Boolean algebras relates theories in classical propositional logic and their collections of models .	The theories can be seen as presentations of Boolean algebras , and the collections of models can be topologized in such a way that the theory can be recovered from its space of models .	The situation can be cast as a formal duality relating two categories of syntax and semantics , mediated by homming into a common dualizing object , in this case 2 .	In the present work , we generalize the entire arrangement from propositional to first-order logic .
2	For each Lagrangian particle at position $ \bmath { q } $ and each smoothing radius $ R $ , the collapse time , the velocities and ellipsoidal truncation are computed using Lagrangian Perturbation Theory .	Subject of this paper is a detailed analysis of the PINOCCHIO algorithm for studying the relative velocity statistics of merging haloes in Lagrangian perturbation theory .	Given a cosmological background model , a power spectrum of fluctuations as well as a Gaussian linear density contrast field $ \delta_ { \rm l } $ is generated on a cubic grid , which is then smoothed repeatedly with Gaussian filters .	The collapsed medium is then fragmented into isolated objects by an algorithm designed to mimic the accretion and merger events of hierarchical collapse .	Directly after the fragmentation process the mass function , merger histories of haloes and the statistics of the relative velocities at merging are evaluated .
0	The reduced-density-matrix method is an promising candidate for the next generation electronic structure calculation method ; it is equivalent to solve the Schr\ '' odinger equation for the ground state .	The number of variables is the same as a four electron system and constant regardless of the electrons in the system .	Thus many researchers have been dreaming of a much simpler method for quantum mechanics .	In this chapter , we give a overview of the reduced-density matrix method ; details of the theories , methods , history , and some new computational results .	Typically , the results are comparable to the CCSD ( T ) which is a sophisticated traditional approach in quantum chemistry .
1	The data are analyzed in terms of an effective interface Hamiltonian for a system with several order parameters in the framework of the linear renormalization approach due to Brezin , Halperin and Leibler .	We present Monte Carlo simulations of surface induced disordering in a model of a binary alloy on a bcc lattice which undergoes a first order bulk transition from the ordered DO3 phase to the disordered A2 phase .	We show that the model provides a good description of the system in the vicinity of the interface .	In particular , we recover the logarithmic divergence of the thickness of the disordered layer as the bulk transition is approached , we calculate the critical behavior of the maxima of the layer susceptibilities , and demonstrate that it is in reasonable agreement with the simulation data .	Directly at the ( 110 ) surface , the theory predicts that all order parameters vanish continuously at the surface with a nonuniversal , but common critical exponent .
2	The data are extremely well reproduced by our approach at all momenta and for sufficiently high energies .	We have investigated several models of Pomeron and Odderon contributions to high energy elastic $ pp $ and $ \bar p p $ scattering .	The questions we address concern their role in this field , the behavior of the scattering amplitude ( or of the total cross-section ) at high energy , and how to fit all high energy elastic data .	The relative virtues of Born amplitudes and of different kinds of eikonalizations are considered .	An important point in this respect is that secondary structures are predicted in the differential cross-sections at increasing energies and these phenomena appear quite directly related to the procedure of eikonalizing the various Born amplitudes .
3	We discuss the implications of a measurement of $ B_s\to \mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } $ for restricting the parameter space of gauginos and sfermion masses , and of signals in other channels $ B_ { d , s } \to l^ { + } +l^ { - } $ .	We examine the potentially very promising signal $ B_s\to \mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } $ in supersymmetry with large $ \tan\beta $ in a { \em top-down } approach starting from the best fits of an SO ( 10 ) -like model studied recently .	Our results go beyond minimal flavour violation investigated in previous works .	We show that the absolute best fits provide a signal for $ B_s\to \mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } $ at the borderline of the present limits and hence the ongoing search at the Tevatron will start having an impact on the global analysis of this class of SUSY models .	We also discuss correlations of $ B_s\to \mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } $ with the CP-odd Higgs mass , $ \sin ( \beta -\alpha ) $ and $ b\to s \gamma $ in SO ( 10 ) -like models .
1	The necessary conditions of mixed states to complete perfect teleportation are proved .	We study faithful teleportation systematically with arbitrary entangled states as resources .	Based on these results , the necessary and sufficient conditions of faithful teleportation of an unknown state |\phi & gt ; in C^d with an entangled resource { \rho } in C^m \otimes C^d and C^d \otimes C^n are derived .	It is shown that for { \rho } in C^m\otimesC^d , { \rho } must be a maximally entangled state , while for { \rho } in C^d \otimes C^n , { \rho } must be a puremaximally entangled state .	Moreover , we show that the sender 's measurements must be all projectors of maximally entangled pure states .
2	We prove the equivalence of Gromov , Osin , and Bowditch 's definitions of relative hyperbolicity for countable groups .	We lay the foundations for the study of relatively quasiconvex subgroups of relatively hyperbolic groups .	These foundations require that we first work out a coherent theory of countable relatively hyperbolic groups ( not necessarily finitely generated ) .	We then give several equivalent definitions of relatively quasiconvex subgroups in terms of various natural geometries on a relatively hyperbolic group .	We show that each relatively quasiconvex subgroup is itself relatively hyperbolic , and that the intersection of two relatively quasiconvex subgroups is again relatively quasiconvex .
3	The benefits of multipath are the enhancement of robustness against failure , and minimizing communication cost .	Our current world is revolutionned by the networks which are interconnecting any machine to any other one .	Nowadays equipments are plugged to the network by the way of many different network adapters ( Ethernet , wifi , GSM ) , and network equipments are more and more interconnected to each other creating a highly mesh network .	Thus , redundant paths are created between any two endpoints enabling multipath or the use of multiple paths to handle a communication .	In the present work , we will talk about some solutions of multipath applied to the transport level .
3	An evaluation of the systematic effects due to uncertainties on environmental and detector parameters is also included .	The results of the analysis of the data collected with the NEMO Phase-2 tower , deployed at 3500 m depth about 80 km off-shore Capo Passero ( Italy ) , are presented .	Cherenkov photons detected with the photomultipliers tubes were used to reconstruct the tracks of atmospheric muons .	Their zenith-angle distribution was measured and the results compared with Monte Carlo simulations .	The associated depth intensity relation was evaluated and compared with previous measurements and theoretical predictions .
3	We study for the first time the average case complexity of the classical algorithm for computing almost-sure winning vertices for MDPs with B\ '' uchi objectives .	We consider Markov decision processes ( MDPs ) with $ \omega $ -regular specifications given as parity objectives .	We consider the problem of computing the set of almost-sure winning vertices from where the objective can be ensured with probability 1 .	The algorithms for the computation of the almost-sure winning set for parity objectives iteratively use the solutions for the almost-sure winning set for B\ '' uchi objectives ( a special case of parity objectives ) .	Our contributions are as follows : First , we show that for MDPs with constant out-degree the expected number of iterations is at most logarithmic and the average case running time is linear ( as compared to the worst case linear number of iterations and quadratic time complexity ) .
3	We prove in many cases that the homology of the fillings is uniquely determined .	The aim of this paper is to address the following question : given a contact manifold $ ( \Sigma , \xi ) $ , what can be said about the aspherical symplectic manifolds $ ( W , \omega ) $ bounded by $ ( \Sigma , \xi ) $ ?	We first extend a theorem of Eliashberg , Floer and McDuff to prove that under suitable assumptions the map from $ H_ { * } ( \Sigma ) $ to $ H_ { * } ( W ) $ induced by inclusion is surjective .	We then apply this method in the case of contact manifolds having a contact embedding in $ { \mathbb R } ^ { 2n } $ or in a subcritical Stein manifold .	Finally we use more recent methods of symplectic topology to prove that , if a contact hypersurface has a Stein subcritical filling , then all its weakly subcritical fillings have the same homology .
1	Within this work we investigate the relation between current sheets and vortex sheets in incompressible , stationary equilibria .	Magnetohydrodynamic configurations with strong localized current concentrations and vortices play an important role for the dissipation of energy in space and astrophysical plasma .	For this approach it is helpful that the similar mathematical structure of magnetohydrostatics and stationary incompressible hydrodynamics allows us to transform static equilibria into stationary ones .	The main control function for such a transformation is the profile of the Alfven-Mach number M_A , which is always constant along magnetic field lines , but can change from one field line to another .	In the case of a global constant M_A , vortices and electric current concentrations are parallel .
0	The climbing effect of a viscoelastic fluid when stirred by a spinning rod is well documented and known as Weissenberg effect ( Wei et al , 2006 ) .	This phenomenon is related to the elasticity of the fluid .	We have observed that this effect can appear when the fluid is stirred without a rod .	In this work , a comparison of the flow around a spinning disk for a Newtonian and a non-Newtonian liquids is presented .	The flow is visualized with ink and small bubbles as fluid path tracers .
4	This represents a new addition to the list of combinatorial objects for the Grassmannian , such as matching and matroid polytopes , that have been shown to emerge from BFT dynamics .	Bipartite field theories ( BFTs ) are a new class of 4d N=1 quantum field theories defined by bipartite graphs on bordered Riemann surfaces .	In this paper we derive , purely in terms of the gauge theory , the cluster transformations of face weights under square moves in the graph .	In this context , we obtain them by connecting regular parametrizations of the master space of the associated BFTs .	For BFTs on a disk , these transformations follow from the properties of coordinates in the Grassmannian .
1	The direct collapse of protogalactic gas clouds in primordial halos with $ \rm T_ { vir } \geq 10^ { 4 } K $ provides the most promising way to assemble massive black holes .	Black holes of a billion solar masses are observed in the infant universe a few hundred million years after the Big Bang .	In this study , we aim to determine the characteristic mass scale of seed black holes and the time evolution of the accretion rates resulting from the direct collapse model .	We explore the formation of supermassive black holes via cosmological large eddy simulations ( LES ) by employing sink particles and following their evolution for twenty thousand years after the formation of the first sink .	As the resulting protostars were shown to have cool atmospheres in the presence of strong accretion , we assume here that UV feedback is negligible during this calculation .
3	Additionally , we give an explicit distributional equation for the wakeup time as a weighted sum of geometric random variables .	The frog model is a system of random walks where active particles set sleeping particles in motion .	On the complete graph with n vertices it is equivalent to a well-understood rumor spreading model .	We given an alternate and elementary proof that the wake-up time , i.e.the expected time for every particle to be activated , is Theta ( log n ) .	This project was part of the University of Washington Research Experience for Undergraduates program .
2	The space of distribution functions is decomposed into independent subspaces that remain invariant under Liouville dynamics .	We derive an exact Markovian kinetic equation for an oscillator linearly coupled to a heat bath , describing quantum Brownian motion .	Our work is based on the subdynamics formulation developed by Prigogine and collaborators .	For integrable systems in Poincar\'e 's sense the invariant subspaces follow the dynamics of uncoupled , renormalized particles .	In contrast for non-integrable systems , the invariant subspaces follow a dynamics with broken-time symmetry , involving generalized functions .
0	The carried out polarization examinations of C10H8 spectrums of small frequencies of a Raman effect of light has revealed the presence of additional lines of small intensity .	Calculation of histograms of spectrums of the lattice oscillations is carried out by Dyne 's method .	It is shown , that the presence of vacancies in structure of C10H8 leads to occurrence of additional lines around 90 cm-1 .	Occurrence of lines at frequencies less then 30 cm-1 is attributed to the presence of orientation disorder of molecules .	Apparently , structure C10H8 has both types of defects , both orientation disorder of molecules and vacancies , which causes occurrence of additional lines in a spectrum of small frequencies .
2	Starting from the microscopic Hamiltonian with local attraction , we calculated using the Gor'kov equations , the phase diagram of the superconducting transition at arbitrary chemical potential , its magnetic properties and critical exponents close to the quantum critical point .	Pairing in the Weyl semi - metal appearing on the surface of topological insulator is considered .	It is shown that due to an `` ultra-relativistic '' dispersion relation there is a quantum critical point governing the zero temperature transition to a superconducting state .	The Ginzburg - Landau effective theory is derived for small chemical potential allowing to consider effects of spatial dependence of order parameters in magnetic field .	The GL equations are very different from the conventional ones reflecting the chiral universality class of the quantum phase transition .
4	We also correct for volume , so that this mass function is a volume limited distribution to redshift 0.025 The differential mass function of nearby black hole candidates is a curved function , with a straight simple power-law of index -3 above 10^ { 8 } M_sol , growing progressively flatter towards lower masses , turning off towards a gap below 3*10^ { 6 } M_sol , and then extending into the range where nuclear star clusters replace black holes .	The mass function of super-massive black holes in our cosmic neighborhood is required to understand the statistics of their activity and consequently the origin of the ultra high energy particles .	We determine a mass function of black hole candidates from the entire sky except for the Galactic plane .	Using the 2MASS catalogue as a starting point , and the well established correlation between black hole mass and the bulge of old population of stars , we derive a list of nearby black hole candidates within the redshift range z & lt ; 0.025 , then do a further selection based on the Hubble-type , and give this as a catalogue elsewhere .	The final list of black hole candidates above a mass of M_BH & gt ; 3*10^ { 6 } M_sol has 5,829 entries ; moreover doing a further Hubble type correction to account for the selection effects cuts down the number to 2,919 black hole candidates .
0	The use of multicomponent images has become widespread with the improvement of multisensor systems having increased spatial and spectral resolutions .	However , the observed images are often corrupted by an additive Gaussian noise .	In this paper , we are interested in multichannel image denoising based on a multiscale representation of the images .	A multivariate statistical approach is adopted to take into account both the spatial and the inter-component correlations existing between the different wavelet subbands .	More precisely , we propose a new parametric nonlinear estimator which generalizes many reported denoising methods .
3	Calculations show the gain region to lie below the exciton line and to be separated from the absorption regime by a transparency region of width , for example , about 80 meV for a 90 Angstrom ZnSe/Zn_ ( 0.75 ) Cd_ ( 0.25 ) Se quantum well .	A new mechanism for exciton lasing in ZnSe/ZnCdSe quantum wells is proposed .	Lasing , occurring below the lowest exciton line , may be associated with a BCS-like condensed ( coherent ) exciton state .	This state is most stable at low temperatures for densities in the transition region separating the exciton Bose gas and the coherent exciton state .	Experimental observation of the transparency region using differential spectroscopy would confirm this picture .
1	We first evaluated differences between the final archived ( `` NEWSIPS '' ) and the originally processed ( `` IUESIPS '' ) spectra .	In this study we cross-correlate many IUE echellograms of a variety of stars to evaluate systematic error sources in the wavelength zeropoint of all three cameras .	These show a clear time dependence in zeropoint for the SWP camera due to revisions in the IUESIPS wavelength scale .	Small IUESIPS - NEWSIPS differences are also found for the LWR camera .	We also examined wavelength zeropoint disparities between data obtained both through the small and large entrance apertures and for observations made by different target acquisition modes for faint and bright stars .
1	Our approach is to analyze programs for liveness of heap-allocated data .	We consider the problem of reducing the memory required to run lazy first-order functional programs .	The result of the analysis is used to preserve only live data -- -a subset of reachable data -- -during garbage collection .	The result is an increase in the garbage reclaimed and a reduction in the peak memory requirement of programs .	While this technique has already been shown to yield benefits for eager first-order languages , the lack of a statically determinable execution order and the presence of closures pose new challenges for lazy languages .
4	We show that the category of ( ribbon ) pure braids is the free category with a twine ( a twist ) .	A tortile ( or ribbon ) category defines invariants of ribbon ( framed ) links and tangles .	We observe that these invariants , when restricted to links , string links , and more general tangles which we call turbans , do not actually depend on the braiding of the tortile category .	Besides duality , the only pertinent data for such tangles are the double braiding and twist .	We introduce the general notions of twine , which is meant to play the role of the double braiding ( in the absence of a braiding ) , and the corresponding notion of twist .
3	Chiral behavior of the couplings , Isgur-Wise functions and heavy meson bag parameters is studied in the leading logarithmic approximation .	The effective theory based on combined chiral and heavy quark symmetry , the heavy meson chiral perturbation theory , is applied to studying the role of resonances in various processes of heavy mesons within and beyond the Standard Model .	Chiral corrections including both positive and negative parity heavy meson doublets are calculated to the effective strong couplings featuring in the effective theory leading order interaction Lagrangian , to the Isgur-Wise functions in semileptonic B to D decays and to the complete set of supersymmetric four-quark operators mediating heavy neutral meson mixing .	Bare values of the effective strong couplings are extracted from the measured decay widths of charmed resonances .	In semileptonic heavy to light decays we determine resonance contributions to the various form factors within an effective theory inspired model at zero recoil .
3	In particular this paper recovers ( by constructive means ) , improves and extends previous results of Pao [ 46 ] .	In this paper we prove new constructive coercivity estimates for the Boltzmann collision operator without cutoff , that is for long-range interactions .	In particular we give a generalized sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral gap which involves both the growth behavior of the collision kernel at large relative velocities and its singular behavior at grazing and frontal collisions .	It provides in particular existence of a spectral gap and estimates on it for interactions deriving from the hard potentials $ \phi ( r ) = r^ { - ( s & amp ; # 8722 ; 1 ) } $ , $ s \ge 5 $ or the so-called moderately soft potentials $ \phi ( r ) = r^ { & amp ; # 8722 ; ( s & amp ; # 8722 ; 1 ) } $ , $ 3 & lt ; s & lt ; 5 $ , ( without angular cutoff ) .	We also obtain constructive coercivity estimates for the Landau collision operator for the optimal coercivity norm pointed out in [ 34 ] and we formulate a conjecture about a unified necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral gap for Boltzmann and Landau linearized collision operators .
0	Gene-gene interactions are often regarded as playing significant roles in influencing variabilities of complex traits .	Although much research has been devoted to this area , till date a comprehensive statistical model that adequately addresses the highly dependent structures associated with the interactions between the genes , multiple loci of every gene , various and unknown number of sub-populations that the subjects arise from , seem to be lacking .	In this paper , we propose and develop a novel Bayesian semiparametric approach composed of finite mixtures based on Dirichlet processes and a hierarchical matrix-normal distribution that can comprehensively account for the unknown number of sub-populations and gene-gene interactions .	Then , by formulating novel , and suitable Bayesian tests of hypotheses using a suitable metric for comparing clusterings in conjunction with the interaction parameters of the matrix-normal , we attempt to single out the roles of the genes , individually , and in interaction with other genes , in case-control studies .	Quite importantly , we also attempt to identify the disease producing loci .
1	First , we demonstrate the properties of such a walk by studying the phase diagram of a percolation problem .	We use a one-dimensional random walk on $ D $ -dimensional hyper-spheres to determine the critical behavior of statistical systems in hyper-spherical geometries .	We find a line of second and first order phase transitions separated by a tricritical point .	Then , we analyze the adsorption-desorption transition for a polymer growing near the attractive boundary of a cylindrical cell membrane .	We find that the fraction of adsorbed monomers on the boundary vanishes exponentially when the adsorption energy decreases towards its critical value .
4	The punctuated equilibria model is used to explain these results .	In this paper , we study the exploration / exploitation trade-off in cellular genetic algorithms .	We define a new selection scheme , the centric selection , which is tunable and allows controlling the selective pressure with a single parameter .	The equilibrium model is used to study the influence of the centric selection on the selective pressure and a new model which takes into account problem dependent statistics and selective pressure in order to deal with the exploration / exploitation trade-off is proposed : the punctuated equilibria model .	Performances on the quadratic assignment problem and NK-Landscapes put in evidence an optimal exploration / exploitation trade-off on both of the classes of problems .
2	We show that the induced oscillations of charged particles interacting with a GW , which lead to the emission of electromagnetic radiation , will also result in wave attenuation .	We provide calculations and theoretical arguments supporting the emission of electromagnetic radiation from charged particles accelerated by gravitational waves ( GWs ) .	These waves have significant indirect evidence to support their existence , yet they interact weakly with ordinary matter .	These ideas are supported by a small body of literature , as well as additional arguments for particle acceleration based on GW memory effects .	We derive order of magnitude power calculations for various initial charge distributions accelerated by GWs .
3	In the present study we compute stellar pulsation models to demonstrate the sensitivity of the radial period ratio to the opacity data ( OPAL and OP tables ) and we also examine the effect of different relative abundances of heavy elements .	The Petersen diagram is a frequently used tool to constrain model parameters such as metallicity of radial double-mode pulsators .	In this diagram the period ratio of the radial first overtone to the fundamental mode , P_1/P_0 , is plotted against the period of the fundamental mode .	The period ratio is sensitive to the chemical composition as well as to the rotational velocity of a star .	We conclude that the comparison with observed period ratios could be used successfully to test the opacity data .
3	The solution concept used in the present paper can be simply described as analogous to the standard one but with $ L^ { \infty } $ -functions substituted by measures in one component of a solution .	The notion of a delta shock wave and a singular shock wave was introduced and employed by different authors , and it was shown that a large class of Riemann problems can be solved globally with these additional building blocks .	The aim of this paper is to study the interaction of one type of these new solutions , the delta shock waves , with the classical types of solutions .	Our model problem is $ 2 \times 2 $ system derived from a simplified model of magneto-hydrodynamics .	Here , the delta function is represented by so called two sided delta function .
3	The main problem is the passage to the limit in a nonlinear term that has no obvious compactness properties .	Systems coupling fluids and polymers are of great interest in many branches of sciences .	One of the models to describe them is the FENE ( Finite Extensible Nonlinear Elastic ) dumbbell model .	We prove global existence of weak solutions to the FENE dumbbell model of polymeric flows for a very general class of potentials .	The proof uses many weak convergence techniques .
0	Watermarking helps in ensuring originality , ownership and copyrights of a digital image .	This paper aims at embedding a Watermark in an image using Wave Atom Transform .	Preference of Wave Atoms on other transformations has been due to its sparser expansion , adaptability to the direction of local pattern , and sharp frequency localization .	In this scheme , we had tried to spread the watermark in an image so that the information at one place is very small and undetectable .	In order to extract the watermark and verify ownership of an image , one would have the advantage of prior knowledge of embedded locations .
1	We study the X-ray spectrum of 3C 111 between 0.4 keV and 200 keV , and its spectral energy distribution , using data from the Suzaku satellite combined with INTEGRAL , Swift/BAT data , and Fermi/LAT data .	We attempt to determine the nature of the high energy emission of the radio galaxy 3C 111 , by distinguishing between the effects of the thermal and non-thermal processes .	We then model the overall spectral energy distribution including radio and infrared data .	The combined Suzaku , Swift and INTEGRAL data are represented by an absorbed exponentially cut-off power-law with reflection from neutral material with a photon index Gamma = 1.68+-0.03 , a high-energy cut-off Ecut = 227+143-67 keV , a reflection component with R = 0.7+-0.3 and a Gaussian component to account for the iron emission-line at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width of EW = 85+-11 eV .	The X-ray spectrum appears dominated by thermal , Seyfert-like processes , but there are also indications of non-thermal processes .
1	We construct semi-analytical model describing the form of the interface separating the two pulsars .	We consider magnetohydrodynamical interaction between relativistic pulsar wind and static magnetosphere in binary pulsar system PSR J0737-3039 .	An assumption of vacuum dipole spin down for Pulsar B leads to eclipse duration ten times longer than observed .	We discuss possible Pulsar B torque modification and magnetic field estimates due to the interaction with Pulsar A wind .	Unless the orbital inclination is $ \leq 86 ^\circ $ , the duration of eclipses is typically shorter than the one implied by the size of the eclipsing region .
2	Hence , the latter can be , in some sense , considered to be a continuation and elaboration of both former approaches .	Quantum-mechanical interpretation-related implications of the theory of uni- tary premeasurement [ 1 ] on complete measurement ( objecti ? cation or collapse included ) are investigated in the present article with a view to give an af- ? rmative answer to the question in the title .	It is argued that both Bohr 's and von Neumann 's ideas lead to those of Everett .	The importance of the idea of relativeness in Everett 's theory is emphasized .	To free the relative-state theory from its roots both of classicalness and of subjective observation in the argument of this study , the general or unfolded version of Everett 's theory is sketched .
2	An essential aspect of our formulation is that it applies to any underlying quantum field theoretic model of the $ q\bar { q } $ system , and not just to models , like exact QCD , where the quark self-energy $ \Sigma $ couples to the electromagnetic field solely via dressed quark propagators .	We construct the gauge invariant three-photon decay amplitude of particle-antiparticle bound states modeled by the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations .	Application to the quark-antiquark ( $ q\bar { q } $ ) bound states is emphasized .	In this way , applications to effective field theories and other QCD motivated models are envisioned .	The three-photon decay amplitude is constructed by attaching currents to all possible places in the Feynman diagrams contributing to the dressed quark propagator .
0	The quasi-static code WAKE [ P. Mora and T. Antonsen , Phys .	Plasmas { \bf 4 } , 217 ( 1997 ) ] is upgraded to model the propagation of an ultra-relativistic charged particle beam through a warm background plasma in plasma wakefield acceleration .	The upgraded code is benchmarked against the full particle-in-cell code OSIRIS [ Hemker et al. , Phys.Rev.ST Accel .	Beams { \bf 3 } , 061301 ( 2000 ) ] and the quasi-static code QuickPIC [ Huang et al. , J. Comp.Phys .	{ \bf 217 } , 658 ( 2006 ) ] .
4	The remaining ground state entropy is still infinite but not extensive , being $ O ( L ) $ for system size $ O ( L^3 ) $ .	The ( three-dimensional ) pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet with Heisenberg spins of large spin length $ S $ is a highly frustrated model with an macroscopic degeneracy of classical ground states .	The zero-point energy of ( harmonic order ) spin wave fluctuations distinguishes a subset of these states .	I derive an approximate but illuminating { \it effective Hamiltonian } , acting within the subspace of Ising spin configurations representing the { \it collinear } ground states .	It consists of products of Ising spins around loops , i.e has the form of a $ Z_2 $ lattice gauge theory .
2	finds an independent set of size ( 1+o ( 1 ) ) n ln ( d ) /d , i.e.half the maximum size .	The independence number of a sparse random graph G ( n , m ) of average degree d=2m/n is well-known to be \alpha ( G ( n , m ) ) ~2n ln ( d ) /d with high probability .	Moreover , a trivial greedy algorithm w.h.p .	Yet in spite of 30 years of extensive research no efficient algorithm has emerged to produce an independent set with ( 1+c ) n ln ( d ) /d , for any fixed c & gt ; 0 .	In this paper we prove that the combinatorial structure of the independent set problem in random graphs undergoes a phase transition as the size k of the independent sets passes the point k nln ( d ) /d .
3	The present approach also suffers from shear locking when lower order functions are employed and the shear locking is suppressed by introducing a modification factor .	This paper presents an effective formulation to study the response of laminated composites based on isogeometric approach ( IGA ) and Carrera unified formulation ( CUF ) .	The IGA utilizes the non-uniform rational B-spline ( NURBS ) functions which allows to construct higher order smooth functions with less computational effort .	The static bending and the free vibration of thin and moderately thick laminates plates are studied .	The combination of the IGA with the CUF allows a very accurate prediction of the field variables .
3	We show that the LMO invariant satisfies exactly the same relations .	For rational homology 3-spheres , there exist two universal finite-type invariants : the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant and the Kontsevich-Kuperberg-Thurston invariant .	These invariants take values in the same space of `` Jacobi diagrams '' , but it is not known whether they are equal .	In 2004 , Lescop proved that the KKT invariant satisfies some `` splitting formulas '' which relate the variations of KKT under replacement of embedded rational homology handlebodies by others in a `` Lagrangian-preserving '' way .	The proof is based on the LMO functor , which is a generalization of the LMO invariant to the category of 3-dimensional cobordisms , and we generalize Lescop 's splitting formulas to this setting .
2	Measuring B-modes requires dramatic improvements in sensitivity combined with exquisite control of systematics .	We report on the design and performance of the BICEP2 instrument and on its three-year data set .	BICEP2 was designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) on angular scales of 1 to 5 degrees ( $ \ell $ =40-200 ) , near the expected peak of the B-mode polarization signature of primordial gravitational waves from cosmic inflation .	The BICEP2 telescope observed from the South Pole with a 26~cm aperture and cold , on-axis , refractive optics .	BICEP2 also adopted a new detector design in which beam-defining slot antenna arrays couple to transition-edge sensor ( TES ) bolometers , all fabricated on a common substrate .
4	Cycles appear in all cases studied , thus showing that the joker dynamics generically yields a robust cyclic behavior not restricted to infinite populations .	The emergence and promotion of cooperation are two of the main issues in evolutionary game theory , as cooperation is amenable to exploitation by defectors , which take advantage of cooperative individuals at no cost , dooming them to extinction .	It has been recently shown that the existence of purely destructive agents ( termed jokers ) acting on the common enterprises ( public goods games ) can induce stable limit cycles among cooperation , defection , and destruction when infinite populations are considered .	These cycles allow for time lapses in which cooperators represent a relevant fraction of the population , providing a mechanism for the emergence of cooperative states in nature and human societies .	Here we study analytically and through agent-based simulations the dynamics generated by jokers in finite populations for several selection rules .
2	The midvelocity emission has been separated from the emission of the projectile-like fragment .	A systematic investigation of the average multiplicities of light charged particles and intermediate mass fragments emitted in peripheral and semiperipheral collisions is presented as a function of the beam energy , violence of the collision and mass of the system .	The data have been collected with the `` Fiasco '' setup in the reactions 93Nb+93Nb at 17 , 23 , 30 , 38AMeV and 116Sn+116Sn at 30 , 38AMeV .	This last component appears to be compatible with an evaporation from an equilibrated source at normal density , as described by the statistical code Gemini at the appropriate excitation energy .	On the contrary , the midvelocity emission presents remarkable differences for what concerns both the dependence of the multiplicities on the energy deposited in the midvelocity region and the isotopic composition of the emitted light charged particles .
1	The generalization to spin- $ S $ ladders is also discussed .	This study addresses low-energy properties of 2-leg spin-1 ladders with antiferromagnetic ( AF ) intrachain coupling under a uniform or staggered external field $ H $ , and a few of their modifications .	In the strong AF rung ( interchain ) -coupling $ J_\perp $ region , degenerate perturbation theory applied to spin- $ S $ ladders predicts $ 2S $ critical curves in the parameter space $ ( J_\perp , H ) $ for the staggered field case , in contrast to $ 2S $ finite critical regions for the uniform field case .	All critical areas belong to a universality with central charge $ c=1 $ .	On the other hand , we employ Abelian and non-Abelian bosonization techniques in the weak rung-coupling region .
4	The most important one is that $ \Psi_ { 0 } $ satisfies a first-order differential equation which enables us to compute the radial part of the Casimir operator of the group $ G $ as soon as we have an explicit expression for $ \Psi_ { 0 } $ .	We present a method to obtain infinitely many examples of pairs $ ( W , D ) $ consisting of a matrix weight $ W $ in one variable and a symmetric second-order differential operator $ D $ .	The method is based on a uniform construction of matrix valued polynomials starting from compact Gelfand pairs $ ( G , K ) $ of rank one and a suitable irreducible $ K $ -representation .	The heart of the construction is the existence of a suitable base change $ \Psi_ { 0 } $ .	We analyze the base change and derive several properties .
1	This has been a key driving factor for the adoption of cloud-based data outsourcing solutions .	Storage requirements for visual data have been increasing in recent years , following the emergence of many new highly interactive , multimedia services and applications for both personal and corporate use .	However , outsourcing data storage to the Cloud also leads to new challenges that must be carefully addressed , especially regarding privacy .	In this paper we propose a secure framework for outsourced privacy-preserving storage and retrieval in large image repositories .	Our proposal is based on a novel cryptographic scheme , named IES-CBIR , specifically designed for media image data .
1	The BSL consists of the 205 most significant sources detected above 100 MeV by the Fermi Large Area Telescope .	We present the result of a search of the Milagro sky map for spatial correlations with sources from a subset of the recent Fermi Bright Source List ( BSL ) .	We select sources based on their categorization in the BSL , taking all confirmed or possible Galactic sources in the field of view of Milagro .	Of the 34 Fermi sources selected , 14 are observed by Milagro at a significance of 3 standard deviations or more .	We conduct this search with a new analysis which employs newly-optimized gamma-hadron separation and utilizes the full 8-year Milagro dataset .
3	We show that to determine the maximal connected skew shapes in the Schur-positivity order and this support containment order , it suffices to consider a special class of ribbon shapes .	The Schur-positivity order on skew shapes is defined by B \leq A if the difference s_A - s_B is Schur-positive .	It is an open problem to determine those connected skew shapes that are maximal with respect to this ordering .	A strong necessary condition for the Schur-positivity of s_A - s_B is that the support of B is contained in that of A , where the support of B is defined to be the set of partitions lambda for which s_lambda appears in the Schur expansion of s_B .	We explicitly determine the support for these ribbon shapes , thereby determining the maximal connected skew shapes in the support containment order .
1	As a first application we solve a conjecture of Langlands for Shimura varieties of Hodge type .	We prove the existence of weak integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type in arbitrary unramified mixed characteristic $ ( 0 , p ) $ .	As a second application we prove the existence of integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of preabelian ( resp .	of abelian ) type in mixed characteristic $ ( 0 , p ) $ with $ p\Ge 3 $ ( resp .	with $ p=2 $ ) and with respect to hyperspecial subgroups ; if $ p=3 $ ( resp .
3	However , no matter how equations are obtained , the dimension of the fractional derivative differs from the classical one and may induce problems of temporal homogeneity in fractional objects .	Fractional equations appear in the description of the dynamics of various physical systems .	For Lagrangian systems , the embedding theory developped by Cresson [ `` Fractional embedding of differential operators and Lagrangian systems '' , J.Math.Phys .	48 , 033504 ( 2007 ) ] provides a univocal way to obtain such equations , stemming from a least action principle .	In this paper , we show that it is necessary to introduce an extrinsic constant of time .
2	This leads us to two families of binary , quadratic and regular operads whose free objects , as well as their duals in the sense of Ginzburg and Kapranov are computed .	The aim of this paper is to further explore an idea from J.-L. Loday briefly exposed in [ 5 ] .	We impose a natural and simple symmetry on a unit action over the most general quadratic relation which can be written .	Roughly speaking , free objects found here are in relation to $ m $ -ary trees , triangular numbers and more generally $ m $ -tetrahedral numbers , homogeneous polynomials on $ m $ commutative indeterminates over a field $ K $ and polygonal numbers .	Involutive connected P-Hopf algebras are constructed and a link to genomics is discussed .
1	The objective of the optimal PMU placement ( OPP ) problem is to minimize the number of PMUs and select the bus locations to make a power system completely observable .	Phasor Measurement Units ( PMUs ) are essential measuring devices for monitoring , control and protection of power systems .	In this paper , the OPP problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming ( NLP ) problem and a sequential quadratic programming ( SQP ) method is used for its solution .	Simulations are carried out on IEEE standard test systems , using MATLAB .	The numerical results are compared to those obtained by a binary integer programming ( BIP ) model , also implemented in MATLAB .
2	We conclude that the post-common envelope separation is somewhat larger and the amount of unbound mass slightly greater when the initial separation is wide enough that the giant does not yet overflow or just overflows its Roche lobe .	We present hydrodynamic simulations of the common envelope binary interaction between a giant star and a compact companion with an adaptive mesh refinement and a smooth particle hydrodynamics codes .	These simulations mimic the parameters of one of the simulations by Passy et al. , but start with a wider orbital separation to assess the influence of a larger initial orbital separation on the common envelope simulation outcome .	By setting our simulations in the context of those carried out in the past that contain at least one giant star , we conclude the following : the reason for the larger final orbital separation in simulations starting with a wider orbital separation has more to do with the expanded giant at the time of in-spiral and less to do with a larger amount of angular momentum .	We also suggest that the large range in unbound mass for different simulations is difficult to explain and may have something to do with simulations that are not fully converged .
2	We argue that the large-Nc meson masses share a common parameter , which is related to the QCD string tension .	We investigate implications of quark-hadron duality for hybrid mesons in the large-Nc limit .	A simple formalism is developed which implements duality for QCD two-point functions of currents of quark bilinears , with any number of gluons .	This parameter is fixed from correlators of conserved vector and axial-vector currents , and using lattice QCD determinations of the string tension .	Our results predict towers of hybrid mesons which , within expected 1/Nc corrections , naturally accommodate the 1^ ( -+ ) experimental hybrid candidates .
4	The q-deformed Fock space is defined as the space of semi-infinite wedges with a finite number of vectors in the wedge product differing from a ground state sequence , and endowed with a separated q-adic topology .	In this proceedings a particular example from \cite { KMPY } ( q-alg/9603025 ) is presented : the construction of the level 2 Fock space of $ \U_q ( \affsl { 2 } ) $ .	The generating ideal of the wedge relations is given and the wedge space defined .	Normal ordering of wedges is defined in terms of the energy function .	Normally ordered wedges form a base of the wedge space .
3	We want to identify new SNRs from the $ \lambda $ 6\ cm survey map of the Galactic plane .	Supernova remnants ( SNRs ) were often discovered in radio surveys of the Galactic plane .	Because of the surface-brightness limit of previous surveys , more faint or confused SNRs await discovery .	The Sino-German $ \lambda $ 6\ cm Galactic plane survey is a sensitive survey with the potential to detect new low surface-brightness SNRs .	We searched for new shell-like objects in the $ \lambda $ 6\ cm survey maps , and studied their radio emission , polarization , and spectra using the $ \lambda $ 6\ cm maps together with the $ \lambda $ 11\ cm and $ \lambda $ 21\ cm Effelsberg observations .
3	A number of photons per shot of the order of 10^7 has been measured for the first harmonic orders .	We demonstrate experimentally the full tunability of a coherent femtosecond source in the whole ultraviolet spectral region .	The experiment relies on the technique of high-order harmonic generation driven by a near-infrared parametric laser source in krypton gas .	By tuning the drive wavelength in the range between 1100 to 1900 nm , we generated intense harmonics from near to extreme ultraviolet .	Many novel scientific prospects are expected to benefit from the use of such a table-top tunable source .
2	We find that the cross section for the inclusive $ \pi^0 $ production relative to the charged-current quasi-elastic cross section is $ $ \frac { \sigma_ { CC\pi^0 } } { \sigma_ { CCQE } } =0.426\pm0.032 ( stat . ) \pm0.035 ( syst .	In this paper we report on the measurement of the rate of inclusive $ \pi^0 $ production induced by charged-current neutrino interactions in a C $ _8 $ H $ _8 $ target at a mean energy of 1.3 GeV in the K2K near detector .	Out of a sample of 11,606 charged current neutrino interactions , we select 479 $ \pi^0 $ events with two reconstructed photons .	) $ $ The energy dependent cross section ratio is also measured .	The results are consistent with previous experiments for exclusive channels on different targets .
2	We systematically varied the model parameters as well as the propagation direction to study the dependence of growth rates on model parameters .	We calculate growth rates and corresponding gains for RX and LO mode radiation associated with the cyclotron maser instability for parameterized horseshoe electron velocity distributions .	The velocity distribution function was modeled to closely fit the electron distribution functions observed in the auroral cavity .	The growth rate depends strongly on loss cone opening angle , which must be less than $ 90^ { o } $ for significant CMI growth .	The growth rate is sharply peaked for perpendicular radiation ( $ k_ { \parallel } = 0 $ ) , with a full-width at half-maximum $ 1.7^ { o } $ , in good agreement with observed k-vector orientations and numerical simulations .
3	The interest in our ( weaker ) condition is that it is immediately verified for large classes of Gaussian processes , also in infinite dimensions .	Recently , Hairer -- Pillai proposed the notion of $ \theta $ -roughness of a path which leads to a deterministic Norris lemma .	In the Gubinelli framework ( Hoelder , level 2 ) of rough paths , they were then able to prove a Hoermander type result ( SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion , $ H & gt ; 1/3 $ ) .	We take a step back and propose a natural `` roughness '' condition relative to a given $ p $ -rough path in the sense of Lyons ; the aim being a Doob-Meyer result for rough integrals in the sense of Lyons .	We conclude with an application to non-Markovian system under Hoermander 's condition .
2	However , the elliptical and clumpy lens model proposed by Kneib et al .	X-ray emission from the distant lensing cluster CL2236-04 at $ z $ = 0.552 was discovered by ASCA and ROSAT/HRI observations .	If the spherical symmetric mass distribution model of the cluster is assumed , the lensing estimate of the cluster mass is a factor of two higher than that obtained from X-ray observations as reported for many distant clusters .	( 1993 ) is surprisingly consistent with the X-ray observations assuming that the X-ray emitting hot gas is isothermal and in a hydrostatic equilibrium state .	The existence of the cooling flow in the central region of the cluster is indicated by the short central cooling time and the excess flux detected by ROSAT/HRI compared to the ASCA flux .
0	From 1929 to his death in 1944 , A. Eddington worked on developing a highly ambitious theory of fundamental physics that covered everything in the physical world , from the tiny electron to the universe at large .	His unfinished theory included abstract mathematics and spiritual philosophy in a mix which was peculiar to Eddington but hardly intelligible to other scientists .	The constants of nature , which he claimed to be able to deduce purely theoretically , were of particular significance to his project .	Although highly original , Eddington 's attempt to provide physics with a new foundation had to some extent parallels in the ideas of other British physicists , including P. Dirac and E. A. Milne .	Eddington 's project was however a grand failure in so far that it was rejected by the large majority of physicists .
1	In the case of heavy nuclear targets the very concept of nuclear parton density becomes ill-defined as exemplified by the recent derivation [ 2 ] of nonlinear nuclear k_\perp-factorization for forward dijet production in DIS off nuclei .	The linear k_\perp-factorization is part and parcel of the pQCD description of high energy hard processes off free nucleons .	Here we report a derivation of the related breaking of k_\perp-factorization for single-jet processes .	We present a general formalism and apply it to several cases of practical interest : open charm and quark and gluon jet production in the central to beam fragmentation region of \gamma^*p , \gamma^*A , pp and pA collisions .	We show how the pattern of k_\perp-factorization breaking and the nature and number of exchanged nuclear pomerons do change within the phase space of produced quark and gluon jets .
4	Alternatively , a 2T blackbody fit is just as acceptable .	We report X-ray imaging , timing , and spectral studies of XTE J1810-197 , a 5.54s pulsar discovered by Ibrahim et al .	( 2003 ) in recent RXTE observations .	In a set of short exposures with the Chandra HRC camera we detect a strongly modulated signal ( 55+/-4 % pulsed fraction ) with the expected period located at ( J2000 ) 18:09:51.08 , -19:43:51.7 , with a uncertainty radius of 0.6 arcsec ( 90 % C.L . ) .	Spectra obtained with XMM-Newton are well fitted by a two-component model that typically describes anomalous X-ray pulsars ( AXPs ) , an absorbed blackbody plus power law with parameters kT = 0.67+/-0.01 keV , Gamma=3.7+/-0.2 , N_H= ( 1.05+/-0.05 ) E22 cm^-2 , and Fx ( 0.5-10 keV ) = 3.98E-11 ergs/cm2/s .
0	Core-collapse supernova neutrinos undergo a variety of phenomena when they travel from the high neutrino density region and large matter densities to the Earth .	We perform analytical calculations of the supernova neutrino fluxes including collective effects due to the neutrino-neutrino interactions , the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein ( MSW ) effect due to the neutrino interactions with the background matter and decoherence of the wave packets as they propagate in space .	We predict the numbers of one- and two-neutron charged and neutral-current electron-neutrino scattering on lead events .	We show that , due to the energy thresholds , the ratios of one- to two-neutron events are sensitive to the pinching parameters of neutrino fluxes at the neutrinosphere , almost independently of the presently unknown neutrino properties .	Besides , such events have an interesting sensitivity to the spectral split features that depend upon the presence/absence of energy equipartition among neutrino flavors .
4	We observe an anisotropic character in local density of states at the impurity-bound-state energy , which is consistent with the STM measurements .	We present a realistic study for electronic and magnetic properties in dilute magnetic semiconductor ( Ga , Mn ) As .	A multi-orbital Haldane-Anderson model parameterized by density-functional calculations is presented and solved with the Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo algorithm .	Results well reproduce experimental results in the dilute limit .	When the chemical potential is located between the top of the valence band and an impurity bound state , a long-range ferromagnetic correlations between the impurities , mediated by antiferromagnetic impurity-host couplings , are drastically developed .
1	Although each approach has made great progress independently , it is only during the last decade that significant efforts are being made to bring the separate pieces together .	Astronomical observations , analytical solutions and numerical simulations have provided the building blocks to formulate the current theory of young stellar object jets .	Building on previous work that combined analytical solutions and numerical simulations , we apply a sophisticated cooling function to incorporate optically thin energy losses in the dynamics .	On the one hand , this allows a self-consistent treatment of the jet evolution and on the other , it provides the necessary data to generate synthetic emission maps .	Firstly , analytical disk and stellar outflow solutions are properly combined to initialize numerical two-component jet models inside the computational box .
1	We provide effective methods to compute the involution and rotation symmetries for the planar case .	This paper addresses the problem of determining the symmetries of a plane or space curve defined by a rational parametrization .	As for space curves , our method finds the involutions in all cases , and all the rotation symmetries in the particular case of Pythagorean-hodograph curves .	Our algorithms solve these problems without converting to implicit form .	Instead , we make use of a relationship between two proper parametrizations of the same curve , which leads to algorithms that involve only univariate polynomials .
4	This is a real challenge faced by a number of new proposed projects , based either on large expansions of the present experiments or on new ideas top improve the technical performance or reduce the background contributions .	Neutrinoless double decay is a unique probe for lepton number conservation and neutrino properties .	It allows to investigate the Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos and their absolute mass scale ( hierarchy problem ) with unprecedented sensitivity .	A number of experiments are presently under preparation to cover the quasi-degenerate region of the neutrino mass spectrum .	Improved sensitivities are however required to sound the so-called inverted hierarchy region .
4	Our results show that the protostellar envelopes are dispersed and warmed up during the evolution to become a pre-main sequence star .	We have carried out a molecular survey of the Class 0 IM protostar NGC 7129 -- FIRS 2 ( hereafter FIRS 2 ) and the Herbig Be star LkH $ \alpha $ 234 with the aim of studying the chemical evolution of the envelopes of intermediate-mass ( IM ) young stellar objects ( YSOs ) .	Both objects have similar luminosities ( ~500 Lsun ) and are located in the same molecular cloud which minimizes the chemical differences due to different stellar masses or initial cloud conditions .	Moreover , since they are located at the same distance , we have the same spatial resolution in both objects .	A total of 17 molecular species ( including rarer isotopes ) have been observed in both objects and the structure of their envelopes and outflows is determined with unprecedent detail .
1	Inclusion of correlation as modeled by the LDA+U approach leads to a Mott transition in the $ a_g $ subband if U is no less than U $ _c $ =2.5 eV .	The study of the strength of correlations in Na $ _x $ CoO $ _2 $ is extended to the x=0 end of the phase diagram where Mott insulating behavior has been widely anticipated .	Thus U smaller than U $ _c $ is required to model the metallic , nonmagnetic CoO $ _2 $ compound reported by Tarascon and coworkers .	The orbital-selective Mott transition of the $ a_g $ state , which is essentially degenerate with the $ e'_ { g } $ states , occurs because of the slightly wider bandwidth of the $ a_g $ bands .	The metal-insulator transition is found to be strongly coupled to the Co-O bond length , due to associated changes in the $ t_ { 2g } $ bandwidth , but the largest effects occur only at a reduced oxygen height that lies below the equilibrium position .
1	Given an integer parameter k \geq 1 , a set of vertices L \subseteq V is a feasible solution if for every pair of distinct vertices , u , v , there are at least k distinct vertices x_1 , x_2 , ... , x_k \in L each separating u and v. Such a feasible solution is called a `` landmark set '' , and the k-metric dimension of a graph is the minimal cardinality of a landmark set for the parameter k. The case k=1 is a classic problem , where in its weighted version , each vertex v has a non-negative weight , and the goal is to find a landmark set with minimal total weight .	For an undirected graph G= ( V , E ) , a vertex x \in V separates vertices u and v ( where u , v \in V , u \neq v ) if their distances to x are not equal .	We generalize the problem for k \geq 2 , introducing two models , and we seek for solutions to both the weighted version and the unweighted version of this more general problem .	In the model of all-pairs ( AP ) , k separations are needed for every pair of distinct vertices of V , while in the non-landmarks model ( NL ) , such separations are required only for pairs of distinct vertices in V \setminus L. We study the weighted and unweighted versions for both models ( AP and NL ) , for path graphs , complete graphs , complete bipartite graphs , and complete wheel graphs , for all values of k \geq 2 .	We present algorithms for these cases , thus demonstrating the difference between the two new models , and the differences between the cases k=1 and k \geq 2 .
3	The range of orbits that remain continuously habitable , or habitable for at least 2 Gyr , are provided .	We present stellar evolution models for 0.5 - 1.2 \Msol at scaled metallicities of 0.1 - 1.5 Z\sol and O/Fe values of 0.44 - 2.28 O/Fe\sol .	The time dependent evolution of habitable zone boundaries are calculated for each stellar evolution track based on stellar mass , effective temperature , and luminosity parameterizations .	The rate of change of stellar surface quantities and the surrounding habitable zone position are strong functions of all three quantities explored .	The results show that the detailed chemical characterization of exoplanet host stars and a consideration of their evolutionary history are necessary to assess the likelihood that a planet found in the instantaneous habitable zone has had sufficient time to develop a biosphere capable of producing detectable biosignatures .
1	Their application is extended from ordinary harmonic models to a more general category of `` harmonious '' field models , with emphasis on cases in which the field is confined to a string or higher brane worldsheet , and for which the relevant internal symmetry group is non Abelian , so that the conditions for conservation of the corresponding charge currents become rather delicate , particularly when the symmetry is gauged .	The principles of a previously developed formalism for the covariant treatment of multi-scalar fields for which ( as in a nonlinear sigma model ) the relevant target space is not of affine type -- but curved -- are recapitulated .	Attention is also given to the conditions for conservation of currents of a different kind -- representing surface fluxes of generalised momentum or energy -- associated with symmetries not of the internal target space but of the underlying spacetime background structure , including the metric and any relevant gauge field .	For the corresponding current to be conserved the latter need not be manifestly invariant : preservation modulo a gauge adjustment will suffice .	The simplest case is that of `` strong '' symmetry , meaning invariance under the action of an effective Lie derivative ( an appropriately gauge adjusted modification of an ordinary Lie derivative ) .
0	In this article we introduce a dynamic Erd\H { o } s-R\'enyi graph model , in which , independently for each vertex pair , edges appear and disappear according to a Markov on-off process .	In studying the dynamic graph we present two main results .	The first being on how long it takes for the graph to reach stationarity .	We give an explicit expression for this time , as well as proving that this is the fastest time to reach stationarity among all strong stationary times .	The second result concerns the time it takes for the dynamic graph to reach a certain number of edges .
3	Because the orbital period is so short , the stars should be in synchronous rotation , and if so , the rotation period should imprint itself on the multiplet structure of the pulsations .	The survey phase of the Kepler Mission includes a number of hot subdwarf B ( sdB ) stars to search for nonradial pulsations .	We present our analysis of two sdB stars that are found to be g-mode pulsators of the V1093 Her class .	These two stars also display the distinct irradiation effect typical of sdB stars with a close M-dwarf companion with orbital periods of less than half a day .	However , we do not find clear evidence for such rotational splitting .
4	The resulting averaged Wilson loop displays a scale behavior strongly reminiscent of the area law .	Reduced models are matrix integrals believed to be related to the large N limit of gauge theories .	These integrals are known to simplify further when the number of matrices D ( corresponding to the number of space-time dimensions in the gauge theory ) becomes large .	Even though this limit appears to be of little use for computing the standard rectangular Wilson loop ( which always singles out two directions out of D ) , a meaningful large D limit can be defined for a randomized Wilson loop ( in which all D directions contribute equally ) .	In this article , a proof-of-concept demonstration of this approach is given for the simplest reduced model ( the original Eguchi-Kawai model ) and the simplest randomization of the Wilson loop ( Brownian sum over random walks ) .
2	A Higgs boson with mass between $ \sim 120\gev $ and $ \sim 140\gev $ or above $ \sim 230-250\gev $ almost certainly would not be seen .	We compute an array of Standard Model Higgs boson ( $ \hsm $ ) signals and backgrounds for a possible upgrade of the Tevatron to $ E_ { \rm cm } =4\tev $ .	Taking $ \mt\geq 140\gev $ , and assuming a total accumulated luminosity of $ L=30\fbi $ , we find that a Standard Model Higgs boson with $ \mhsm\lsim 110\gev $ could almost certainly be detected using the $ \wpm\hsm\rta l\nu b\anti b $ mode .	A Higgs boson with $ \mhsm\sim 150\gev $ or $ 200\lsim\mhsm\lsim 230-250\gev $ has a decent chance of being detected in the $ ZZ\rta 4l $ mode .	There would also be some possibility of discovering the $ \hsm $ in the $ WW\rta l\nu jj $ mode for $ 150\lsim\mhsm\lsim 200\gev $ .
1	We calculate the chemical potential and the effective mass of the \down atom using two simple approaches : a many-body variational wave function and a T-matrix approximation .	We consider the problem of a single \down atom in the presence of a Fermi sea of \up atoms , in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance .	These two methods lead to the same results and are in good agreement with existing quantum Monte-Carlo calculations performed at unitarity and , in one dimension , with the known exact solution .	Surprisingly , our results suggest that , even at unitarity , the effect of interactions is fairly weak and can be accurately described using single particle-hole excitations .	We also consider the case of unequal masses .
3	Our detailed study of anisotropy of EMHD turbulence supports our earlier result of k_par ~ k_perp^ ( 1/3 ) scaling .	We present numerical simulations of electron magnetohydrodynamic ( EMHD ) and electron reduced MHD ( ERMHD ) turbulence .	Comparing scaling relations , we find that both EMHD and ERMHD turbulence show similar spectra and anisotropy .	We develop new techniques to study anisotropy of EMHD turbulence .	We find that the high-order statistics show a scaling that is similar to the She-Leveque scaling .
4	The problem concerning a double geometric interpretation for the complex imaginary unit $ i=\sqrt { -1 } $ is also discussed .	Complex geometry represents a fundamental ingredient in the formulation of the Dirac equation by the Clifford algebra .	The choice of appropriate complex geometries is strictly related to the geometric interpretation of the complex imaginary unit $ i=\sqrt { -1 } $ .	We discuss { \em two } possibilities which appear in the multivector algebra approach : the $ \sigma_ { 123 } $ and $ \sigma_ { 21 } $ complex geometries .	Our formalism permits to perform a set of rules which allows an immediate translation between the complex standard Dirac theory and its version within geometric algebra .
3	Moreover , we find that for each deformed Sasaki-Einstein manifold the BPS string solutions exist only for particular values of the deformation parameter .	We study string solutions in the beta-deformed Sasaki-Einstein gauge/gravity dualities .	We find that the BPS point-like strings move in the submanifolds where the two U ( 1 ) circles shrink to zero size .	In the corresponding T^3 fibration description , the strings live on the edges of the polyhedron , where the T^3 fibration degenerates to T^1 .	Our results imply that in the dual field theory the corresponding BPS operators exist only for these particular values of the deformation parameter we find .
4	The inability of previous , approximate models to reproduce the photospheric line profiles here demonstrates the need for a technique that accounts for the physical line profiles of both the circumstellar and photospheric lines when modelling these blended absorption features .	Some hot DA white dwarfs have circumstellar high ion absorption features in their spectra , in addition to those originating in the photosphere .	In many cases , the line profiles of these absorbing components are unresolved .	Given the importance of the atmospheric composition of white dwarfs to studies of stellar evolution , extra-solar planetary systems and the interstellar medium , we examine the effect of including circumstellar line profiles in the abundance estimates of photospheric metals in six DA stars .	The photospheric C and Si abundances are reduced in five cases where the circumstellar contamination is strong , though the relative weakness of the circumstellar Si IV absorption introduces minimal contamination , resulting in a small change in abundance .
3	This effect correlates with the accumulated hole carrier density and provides a lower estimate of about 1.3E-10 cm3/s for the cross-section of non-radiative exciton-hole processes .	We present an investigation of the microscopic interplay between excitons and charge carriers by means of combined photoluminescence ( PL ) and charge carrier transport measurements on organic thin film transistors ( OTFT ) .	For this purpose , the prototypical organic semiconductor Diindenoperylene ( DIP ) was utilized as active material .	The OTFT accumulation layer provides a spatially defined interaction zone for charges and photo-generated excitons leading to a PL intensity reduction of up to 4.5 % .	It is rationalized that these processes are preferentially mediated by trapped holes .
4	The formation of wide band gap a-C : H mantles on amorphous silicate and amorphous carbon ( a-C ) grains leads to a decrease in their absorption cross-sections but no change in their scattering cross-sections at near-IR wavelengths , resulting in higher albedos.Conclusions .	Context .	The observed cloudshine and coreshine ( C-shine ) have been explained in terms of grain growth leading to enhanced scatter- ing from clouds in the J , H and K photometric bands and the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 { \mu } m bands.Aims .	Using our global dust modelling approach THEMIS ( The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model at the IaS ) we explore the effects of dust evolution in dense clouds , through aliphatic-rich carbonaceous mantle formation and grain-grain coagulation.Methods .	We model the effects of wide band gap a-C : H mantle formation and the low-level aggregation of diffuse interstellar medium dust in the moderately-extinguished outer regions of molecular clouds.Results .
2	To do this we use an ( ideal ) triangulation to obtain a coordinate system on the set of multicurves on $ S $ .	For a fixed marked surface $ S $ , we show that the problem of deciding whether or not a mapping class is reducible lies in $ \textbf { NP } $ .	As usual this immediately gives an exponential time algorithm to decide whether or not a mapping class is reducible .	The result then follows from the fact that the action of the mapping class group of $ S $ is piecewise-linear with respect to such a coordinate system and so we are able so show that : if a mapping class $ h $ fixes a multicurve then it fixes one whose size is at most exponential in the word length of $ h $ .	We go on to show how to repeat this construction on invariant subsurfaces .
2	The three body binding energy is calculated for Malfliet-Tjon type potentials and compared with results obtained from calculations based on partial wave decomposition .	The Faddeev equations for the three body bound state are solved directly as three dimensional integral equation without employing partial wave decomposition .	The numerical stability of the algorithm is demonstrated .	The full three body wave function is calculated as function of the vector Jacobi momenta .	It is shown that it satisfies the Schr\ '' odinger equation with high accuracy .
3	This means that an approximate power-law tail ascribed to the data will have an exponent which changes with the size of the text-section which is analyzed .	It is shown that a real novel shares many characteristic features with a null model in which the words are randomly distributed throughout the text .	Such a common feature is a certain translational invariance of the text .	Another is that the functional form of the word-frequency distribution of a novel depends on the length of the text in the same way as the null model .	A further consequence is that a novel can not be described by text-evolution models like the Simon model .
3	We find an extinction shell and establish a relation between this shell and the interstellar expanding structure produced by the stellar winds comig from the Super Star Cluster ( SSCs ) A and B in the center of the galaxy .	We investigate the distribution of the intrinsic extinction in NGC1569 using an extinction map derived from the H_alpha/H_beta emission line ratio .	We compare the extinction distribution to that of the dust emission traced by SPITZER IRAC ( 8microns ) and MIPS ( 24microns ) maps .	The intrinsic extinction shows spatial variations , from zones with negligible extinction to zones with values up to A ( V ) =0.8mag .	We suggest that the extinction shell has been produced by the accumulation of dust at the border of the shell .
4	Finally , we work out an example proving the efficiency of the present approach for studying Fourier integral operators on singular manifolds .	As announced in [ 12 ] , we develop a calculus of Fourier integral G-operators on any Lie groupoid G. For that purpose , we study convolability and invertibility of Lagrangian conic submanifolds of the symplectic groupoid T * G. We also identify those Lagrangian which correspond to equivariant families parametrized by the unit space G ( 0 ) of homogeneous canonical relations in ( T * Gx \ 0 ) x ( T * G x \ 0 ) .	This allows us to select a subclass of Lagrangian distributions on any Lie groupoid G that deserve the name of Fourier integral G-operators ( G-FIO ) .	By construction , the class of G-FIO contains the class of equivariant families of ordinary Fourier integral operators on the manifolds Gx , x $ \in $ G ( 0 ) .	We then develop for G-FIO the first stages of the calculus in the spirit of Hormander 's work .
4	The majority of the gas lifted up by the fountains falls back on the disk remaining within a radial distance $ \Delta R=0.5 $ kpc from the place where the fountain originated .	The ejection of the gas out of the disk in late-type galaxies is related to star formation and is due mainly to Type II supernovae .	In this paper we studied in detail the development of the Galactic fountains in order to understand their dynamical evolution and their influence in the redistribution of the freshly delivered metals over the disk .	To this aim , we performed a number of 3D hydrodynamical radiative cooling simulations of the gas in the Milky Way where the whole Galaxy structure , the Galactic differential rotation and the supernovae explosions generated by a single OB association are considered .	A typical fountain powered by 100 Type II supernovae may eject material up to $ \sim 2 $ kpc which than collapses back mostly in form of dense , cold clouds and filaments .
2	Principles of experimental design are proposed and justified which ensure high nominal , numeric , and parameter estimation accuracy for Gaussian process emulation of deterministic simulations .	Computer experiments have become ubiquitous in science and engineering .	Commonly , runs of these simulations demand considerable time and computing , making experimental design extremely important in gaining high quality information with limited time and resources .	The space-filling properties `` small fi ? ll distance '' and `` large separation distance '' are only weakly conflicting and ensure well-controlled nominal , numeric , and parameter estimation error , while non-stationarity requires a greater density of experimental inputs in regions of the input space with more quickly decaying correlation .	This work will provide scientists and engineers with robust , rigorously justifi ? ed , and practically useful overarching principles for selecting combinations of simulation inputs with high information content .
0	We investigate the effect of the window function on the multipole power spectrum in two different ways .	First , we consider the convolved power spectrum including the window effect , which is obtained by following the familiar ( FKP ) method developed by Feldman , Kaiser and Peacock .	We show how the convolved multipole power spectrum is related to the original power spectrum , using the multipole moments of the window function .	Second , we investigate the deconvolved power spectrum , which is obtained by using the Fourier deconvolution theorem .	In the second approach , we measure the multipole power spectrum deconvolved from the window effect .
2	For the case that the lightest Higgs boson is dominated by the singlet scalar , the Higgs mixing increases the mass of a SM-like Higgs boson while reducing its signal rate at collider experiments compared to the SM case .	We examine the implications of singlet-doublet Higgs mixing on the properties of a Standard Model ( SM ) -like Higgs boson within the Peccei-Quinn invariant extension of the NMSSM ( PQ-NMSSM ) .	The SM singlet added to the Higgs sector connects the PQ and visible sectors through a PQ-invariant non-renormalizable K\ '' ahler potential term , making the model free from the tadpole and domain-wall problems .	The Higgs mixing is important also in the region of parameter space where the NMSSM contribution to the Higgs mass is small , but its size is limited by the experimental constraints on the singlet-like Higgs boson and on the lightest neutralino constituted mainly by the singlino whose Majorana mass term is forbidden by the PQ symmetry .	Nonetheless the Higgs mixing can increase the SM-like Higgs boson mass by a few GeV or more even when the Higgs signal rate is close to the SM prediction , and thus may be crucial for achieving a 125 GeV Higgs mass , as hinted by the recent ATLAS and CMS data .
0	The $ \beta $ -decay properties of the N=Z nuclei $ ^ { 96 } $ Cd , $ ^ { 98 } $ In and $ ^ { 100 } $ Sn have been studied .	These nuclei were produced at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory ( NSCL ) by fragmenting a 120 MeV/nucleon $ ^ { 112 } $ Sn primary beam on a Be target .	The resulting radioactive beam was filtered in the A1900 and the newly commissioned Radio Frequency Fragment Separator ( RFFS ) to achieve a purity level suitable for decay studies .	The observed production cross sections of these nuclei are lower than predicted by factors of 10 to 30 .	The $ ^ { 100 } $ Sn production cross section is 0.25 ( 15 ) pb , in sharp contrast with the 120 pb lower limit established at 63 MeV/nucleon incident energy of the same primary beam .
4	These results bring about the question : Is there an oblivious PTAS for Nash equilibrium in general games ?	If a game has a Nash equilibrium with probability values that are either zero or Omega ( 1 ) then this equilibrium can be found exhaustively in polynomial time .	Somewhat surprisingly , we show that there is a PTAS for the games whose equilibria are guaranteed to have small-O ( 1/n ) -values , and therefore large-Omega ( n ) -supports .	We also point out that there is a PTAS for games with sparse payoff matrices , which are known to be PPAD-complete to solve exactly .	Both algorithms are of a special kind that we call oblivious : The algorithm just samples a fixed distribution on pairs of mixed strategies , and the game is only used to determine whether the sampled strategies comprise an eps-Nash equilibrium ; the answer is yes with inverse polynomial probability .
3	In this study , anomalous irregularities are searched for in the spectrum of the bright extragalactic TeV emitter PKS 2155-304 as measured by H.E.S.S .	Pseudoscalar particles like axion-like particles generically couple to two photons , giving rise to the possibility of oscillations with photons in an external magnetic field .	These oscillations could lead to measurable imprints in the electromagnetic spectrum of astrophysical sources if the coupling to photons is strong enough .	One possible signature is the presence of irregularities in a limited energy range of the spectrum .	to put constraints on the coupling of light spin 0 particles to photons .
0	We are interested in simulating blood flow in arteries with a one dimensional model .	Thanks to recent developments in the analysis of hyperbolic system of conservation laws ( in the Saint-Venant/ shallow water equations context ) we will perform a simple finite volume scheme .	We focus on conservation properties of this scheme which were not previously considered .	To emphasize the necessity of this scheme , we present how a too simple numerical scheme may induce spurious flows when the basic static shape of the radius changes .	On contrary , the proposed scheme is `` well-balanced '' : it preserves equilibria of Q = 0 .
4	We also obtain a lower bound for the mean-square noise of a measurement in the presence of a multiplicatively conserved quantity .	The Wigner-Araki-Yanase ( WAY ) theorem shows that additive conservation laws limit the accuracy of measurements .	Recently , various quantitative expressions have been found for quantum limits on measurements induced by additive conservation laws , and have been applied to the study of fundamental limits on quantum information processing .	Here , we investigate generalizations of the WAY theorem to multiplicative conservation laws .	The WAY theorem is extended to show that an observable not commuting with the modulus of , or equivalently the square of , a multiplicatively conserved quantity can not be precisely measured .
1	The coupling to phonons through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and/or the four-spin exchange interaction of the Coulomb origin under the egde-sharing network of magnetic and ligand ions drive chiral spin piarings , introducing two successive second-order phase transitions upon cooling .	The Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian for incommensurate frustrated classical spin systems is analyzed .	First , a vector spin-chiral order appears with an either parity , leaving an O ( 2 ) chiral spin liquid .	Then , the O ( 2 ) symmetry is broken by the spin ordering into a helical magnetic state .	Possible candidate materials are also discussed .
0	The sequence of amino acids in a protein is believed to determine its native state structure , which in turn is related to the functionality of the protein .	In addition , information pertaining to evolutionary relationships is contained in homologous sequences .	One powerful method for inferring these sequence attributes is through comparison of a query sequence with reference sequences that contain significant homology and whose structure , function , and/or evolutionary relationships are already known .	In spite of decades of concerted work , there is no simple framework for deducing structure , function , and evolutionary ( SF & amp ; E ) relationships directly from sequence information alone , especially when the pair-wise identity is less than a threshold figure ~25 % [ 1,2 ] .	However , recent research has shown that sequence identity as low as 8 % is sufficient to yield common structure/function relationships and sequence identities as large as 88 % may yet result in distinct structure and function [ 3,4 ] .
4	Results show that overall the 2-ring web network offers the most efficient traffic performance , followed by the grid and the 1-ring networks .	The network structure of an urban transportation system has a significant impact on its traffic performance .	This study uses network indicators along with several traffic performance measures including speed , trip length , travel time , and traffic volume , to compare a selection of seven transportation networks with a variety of structures and under different travel demand conditions .	The selected network structures are : modified linear , branch , grid , 3-directional grid , 1-ring web , 2-ring web , and radial .	For the analysis , a base origin-destination matrix is chosen , to which different growth factors are applied in order to simulate various travel demand conditions .
2	In this paper we show how a nonlinear , nonparametric version of these models can be recovered through the Gaussian process latent variable model .	Factor analysis aims to determine latent factors , or traits , which summarize a given data set .	Inter-battery factor analysis extends this notion to multiple views of the data .	This gives us a flexible formalism for multi-view learning where the latent variables can be used both for exploratory purposes and for learning representations that enable efficient inference for ambiguous estimation tasks .	Learning is performed in a Bayesian manner through the formulation of a variational compression scheme which gives a rigorous lower bound on the log likelihood .
4	On every task , we outperform strong task-specific baselines , and achieve several new state-of-the-art results .	This paper describes an alignment-based model for interpreting natural language instructions in context .	We approach instruction following as a search over plans , scoring sequences of actions conditioned on structured observations of text and the environment .	By explicitly modeling both the low-level compositional structure of individual actions and the high-level structure of full plans , we are able to learn both grounded representations of sentence meaning and pragmatic constraints on interpretation .	To demonstrate the model 's flexibility , we apply it to a diverse set of benchmark tasks .
1	It turns out that values of exchange integrals at which the ferromagnetic state becomes unstable with respect to a creation of one and two magnon are different .	The stability of the ferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum spin-1/2 model with nearest-neighbor ferro- and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions is studied .	This difference shows that the classical approximation is inapplicable to the study of the transition from the ferromagnetic to the singlet state in contrast with 1D case .	This problem is investigated using a variational function of new type .	It is based on the boson representation of spin operators which is different from the Holstein-Primakoff approximation .
2	We prove existence and uniqueness results for indefinite Morse 2-functions mapping to arbitrary compact , oriented surfaces .	A Morse 2-function is a generic smooth map from a smooth manifold to a surface .	In the absence of definite folds ( in which case we say that the Morse 2-function is indefinite ) , these are natural generalizations of broken ( Lefschetz ) fibrations .	`` Uniqueness '' means there is a set of moves which are sufficient to go between two homotopic indefinite Morse 2-functions while remaining indefinite throughout .	We extend the existence and uniqueness results to indefinite , Morse 2-functions with connected fibers .
4	Instead we propose that it is a water-rich system of sub-Neptunes that migrated from beyond the snow line .	We use models of thermal evolution and XUV-driven mass loss to explore the composition and history of low-mass low-density transiting planets .	We investigate the Kepler-11 system in detail and provide estimates of both the current and past planetary compositions .	We find that a H/He atmosphere on Kepler-11b is highly vulnerable to mass loss .	By comparing to formation models , we show that in situ formation of the system is unlikely .
2	Unlike the Lyman-alpha line , the [ OIII ] line provides a measure of the systemic velocity of the galaxy .	We present the detection of [ OIII ] emission lines from the galaxies responsible for two high-redshift z & gt ; 1.75 damped Lyman-alpha ( DLA ) absorption lines .	These are the first detections of rest-frame optical emission lines from high-redshift DLA galaxies .	We compare the [ OIII ] redshifts with the velocity profile of the low-ionisation metal lines in these two absorbers , with the goal of distinguishing between the model of Prochaska and Wolfe of DLA absorbers as large rapidly rotating cold thick discs , and the standard hierarchical CDM model of structure formation , in which DLAs arise in protogalactic fragments .	We find some discrepancies with the predictions of the former model .
3	Electrons trapped in a formerly bound state will tunnel off the surface of helium ; we show that under suitable circumstances this `` radioactive decay '' can show damped oscillations rather than a simple exponential decay .	We consider the application of a small in-plane magnetic field to electrons on a helium surface in a perpendicular magnetic field .	Certain states that were bound to the helium surface then dissolve into the continuum turning into long-lived resonances .	As a result microwave absorption lines acquire an asymmetric Fano lineshape that is tunable by varying the microwave polarisation or the in-plane magnetic field .	The mechanism for oscillatory exponential decay is not specific to electrons on Helium and this effect may also be relevant elsewhere in physics .
0	Little is known about the incidence of magnetic fields among the coolest white dwarfs .	Their spectra usually do not exhibit any absorption lines as the bound-bound opacities of hydrogen and helium are vanishingly small .	Probing these stars for the presence of magnetic fields is therefore extremely challenging .	However , external pollution of a cool white dwarf by , e.g. , planetary debris , leads to the appearance of metal lines in its spectral energy distribution .	These lines provide a unique tool to identify and measure magnetism in the coolest and oldest white dwarfs in the Galaxy .
3	The tunability of the band offset with the strain conditions imposed by the substrate is studied .	We report first-principles density-functional pseudopotential calculations on the atomic structures , electronic properties , and band offsets of BaO/BaTiO $ _3 $ and SrO/SrTiO $ _3 $ nanosized heterojunctions grown on top of a silicon substrate .	The density of states at the junction does not reveal any electronic induced interface states .	A dominant perovskite character is found at the interface layer .	Using previously reported theoretical data available for Si/SrO , Si/BaO and BaTiO $ _ { 3 } $ /SrRuO $ _ { 3 } $ interfaces we extrapolate a value for the band alignments along the whole gate stacks of technological interest : Si/SrO/SrTiO $ _3 $ and Si/BaO/BaTiO $ _3 $ /SrRuO $ _3 $ heterostructures .
4	In the presence of a local non-resonant optical pump , a dynamic balance between spatially dependent relaxation and particle loss develops and excites a series of modes , roughly equally spaced in energy .	We study the kinetics of polariton condensation accounting for the condensation process as well as the energy relaxation of condensed polaritons due to their scattering with phonons and excitons .	By assuming a Boltzmann kinetic description of the scattering process , we show that intra-condensate relaxation can be accounted for by an additional time-dependent term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation .	As an example , we apply the formalism to the experimental results recently obtained in polariton microwires [ E. Wertz , et al. , Nature Phys .	6 , 860 ( 2010 ) ] .
1	It is shown that when this exact meaning of the data is taken into account and the most weakly bound states are removed from the hadron resonance gas , the acceptable fit to the whole spectra of pions , kaons and protons measured at midrapidity in central Pb-Pb collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } = 2.76 $ TeV [ Phys.Rev.Lett.109,252301 ( 2012 ) ] is obtained .	Many data in the high energy physics are , in fact , sample means .	The invariant distributions are predicted with the help of the single-freeze-out model in the chemical equilibrium framework .	Low $ p_ { T } $ pions and protons are reproduced simultaneously as well as $ p/\pi $ ratio .	Additionally , correct predictions extend over lower parts of large $ p_ { T } $ data .
3	Our Reachable Anytime Planner for Imprecisely-sensed Domains ( RAPID ) leverages this structure to efficiently compute a good initial envelope of reachable states under the optimal MDP policy in time linear in the number of state variables .	Despite the intractability of generic optimal partially observable Markov decision process planning , there exist important problems that have highly structured models .	Previous researchers have used this insight to construct more efficient algorithms for factored domains , and for domains with topological structure in the flat state dynamics model .	In our work , motivated by findings from the education community relevant to automated tutoring , we consider problems that exhibit a form of topological structure in the factored dynamics model .	RAPID performs partially-observable planning over the limited envelope of states , and slowly expands the state space considered as time allows .
4	Exciton transport efficiency is higher for hydrogen passivated dots as compared with those terminated with more electronegative ligands .	First-order perturbation theory and many-body Green function analysis are used to quantify the influence of size , surface reconstruction and surface treatment on exciton transport between small silicon quantum dots .	Competing radiative processes are also considered in order to determine how exciton transport efficiency is influenced .	The analysis shows that quantum confinement causes small ( ~1 nm ) Si quantum dots to exhibit exciton transport efficiencies far exceeding that of their larger counterparts .	We also find that surface reconstruction significantly influences the absorption cross section and leads to a large reduction in both transport rate and efficiency .
1	One attractive application of supported membranes is the design of phantom cells exhibiting well defined adhesive properties and receptor densities .	Supported lipid membranes are useful and important model systems for studying cell membrane properties and membrane mediated processes .	Adhesion of membranes may be achieved by specific and non-specific interactions , and typically requires the clustering of many adhesion bonds into `` adhesion domains '' .	One potential mediator of the early stages of the aggregation process is the Casimir-type forces between adhesion sites induced by the membrane thermal fluctuations .	In this review , I will present a theoretical analysis of fluctuation induced aggregation of adhesion sites in supported membranes .
3	Although the early stage of star formation is limited to a small region of the central star-forming disk , we find that the disk quickly fragments due to metal enrichment from supernovae .	We investigate the formation of metal-poor globular clusters ( GCs ) at the center of two dark matter halos with $ M_ { \rm halo } \sim4\times10^7 M_\odot $ at $ z & gt ; 10 $ using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations .	We find that very compact ( $ \lesssim $ 1 pc ) and massive ( $ \sim6\times10^5 M_\odot $ ) clusters form rapidly when pristine gas collapses isothermally with the aid of efficient Ly $ \alpha $ emission during the transition from molecular-cooling halos to atomic-cooling halos .	Because the local free-fall time of dense star-forming gas is very short ( $ \ll 1\ , { \rm Myr } $ ) , a large fraction of the collapsed gas is turned into stars before stellar feedback processes blow out the gas and shut down star formation .	Sub-clusters formed in the fragmented clouds eventually merge with the main cluster at the center .
4	Our Dupin lines are analogous to classical lines of curvature corresponding in the same to the eigenvectors of the Weingarten ( shape ) operator of a surface , that is to the directions of tangency of order two of its osculating spheres .	This article is devoted to the study of cyclides osculating general surfaces .	We show that generically , at any point of a surface , one has a one-parameter family of cyclides tangent to a surface curve of order three and among them just one is tangent to this curve of order four .	This one will be called the osculating cyclide here .	Directions of this tangency of higher order form a line filed on the surface and its integral curves will be called Dupin lines on the surface under consideration .
2	PT-symmetric models form a natural class where the partition function is necessarily real , but not necessarily positive .	PT-symmetric Hamiltonians and transfer matrices arise naturally in statistical mechanics .	These classical and quantum models often require the use of complex or negative weights and thus fall outside of the conventional equilibrium statistical mechanics of Hermitian systems .	The correlation functions of these models display a much richer set of behaviors than Hermitian systems , displaying sinusoidally-modulated exponential decay , as in a dense fluid , or even sinusoidal modulation without decay .	Classical spin models with PT symmetry include Z ( N ) models with a complex magnetic field , the chiral Potts model and the anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor Ising ( ANNNI ) model .
3	We study both conditions at low tan-beta and obtain analytic approximations to the UFB bounds for all low tan-beta ( & lt ; 15 ) .	We make a critical reappraisal of `unbounded-from-below ' ( UFB ) constraints in the MSSM and R-parity violating models .	We explain why the `traditional ' UFB bounds are neither necessary nor sufficient and propose , instead , a sufficient condition which ensures that there are no local minima along the flat directions .	This conservative ( but meaningful ) condition divides the parameter space into regions which are allowed , regardless of cosmology , and regions in which cosmology is expected to play a major role .	Finally we show that R-parity violation just below current experimental limits avoids UFB problems by lifting the dangerous flat directions .
1	For off-resonant excitation of such systems in the dissipative regime , highly correlated many-body states exhibiting , among other characteristics , intermittency and multi-modal counting distributions are expected to be created .	Ultra-cold gases excited to strongly interacting Rydberg states are a promising system for quantum simulations of many-body systems .	So far , experiments with Rydberg atoms have been carried out in the resonant , non-dissipative regime .	Here we realize a dissipative gas of rubidium Rydberg atoms and measure its full counting statistics for both resonant and off-resonant excitation .	We find strongly bimodal counting distributions in the off-resonant regime that are compatible with intermittency due to the coexistence of dynamical phases .
2	Alternatively , this action can be also viewed in the unit disc .	We reconsider the basic properties of ray-transfer matrices for first-order optical systems from a geometrical viewpoint .	In the paraxial regime of scalar wave optics , there is a wide family of beams for which the action of a ray-transfer matrix can be fully represented as a bilinear transformation on the upper complex half-plane , which is the hyperbolic plane .	In both cases , we use a simple trace criterion that arranges all first-order systems in three classes with a clear geometrical meaning : they represent rotations , translations , or parallel displacements .	We analyze in detail the relevant example of an optical resonator .
3	Here we develop a real-space renormalization group method for excited state ( RSRG-X ) , that allow us to overcome this challenge , and establish the existence and universal properties of such temperature-tuned dynamical phase transitions .	We consider a new class of unconventional critical phenomena that is characterized by singularities only in dynamical quantities and has no thermodynamic signatures .	A possible example is the recently proposed many-body localization transition , in which transport coefficients vanish at a critical temperature .	Describing this unconventional quantum criticality has been technically challenging as understanding the finite-temperature dynamics requires the knowledge of a large number of many-body eigenstates .	We characterize a specific example : the 1D disordered transverse field Ising model with interactions .
0	The foreshock region of a CME shock front , where shock accelerated electrons form a beam population in the otherwise quiescent plasma is generally assumed to be the source region of type II radio bursts .	Nonlinear wave interaction of electrostatic waves excited by the beamed electrons are the prime candidates for the radio waves ' emission .	To address the question whether a single , or two counterpropagating beam populations are a requirement for this process , we have conducted 2.5D particle in cell simulations using the fully relativistic ACRONYM code .	Results show indications of three wave interaction leading to electromagnetic emission at the fundamental and harmonic frequency for the two-beam case .	For the single-beam case , no such signatures were detectable .
4	The radio edge may be caused by electron acceleration by the shock .	Chandra observations of the merging galaxy cluster A520 reveal a prominent bow shock with M=2.1+0.4-0.3 .	This is only the second clear example of a substantially supersonic merger shock front in clusters .	Comparison of the X-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidence of the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock , offering an interesting experimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halo generation .	The halo in A520 apparently consists of two spatially distinct parts , the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structure related to the shock , where the latter may provide pre-energized electrons for subsequent turbulent re-acceleration .
0	We report on the results of XMM-Newton observations of two Broad Absorption Line Quasars ( BAL QSOs ) , Q1246-057 and SBS 1542+541 .	Unprecedented sensitivity of XMM allows spectral analysis of these X-ray weak sources .	The X-ray spectral data of these sources can be fitted by a power-law with alpha_X=1.0-1.2 and either a partially covering absorber or an ionized absorber model .	Rest frame UV spectroscopy together with polarimetry favors the model with a partially covering absorber with column density a few times 10^22 cm^-2 and a covering fraction of about 0.80 .	After correcting for absorption , the X-ray loudness of these BAL QSOs appears to be similar to other , unabsorbed quasars .
1	We explore the stability of the reconstructed models with analyzing the perturbations from the background solutions .	We reconstruct $ F ( R ) $ gravity models with exponential and power-law forms of the scale factor in which bounce cosmology can be realized .	Furthermore , we study an $ F ( R ) $ gravity model with a sum of exponentials form of the scale factor , where the bounce in the early universe as well as the late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized in a unified manner .	As a result , we build a second order polynomial type model in terms of $ R $ and show that it could be stable .	Moreover , when the scale factor is expressed by an exponential form , we derive $ F ( R ) $ gravity models of a polynomial type in case of the non-zero spatial curvature and that of a generic type in that of the zero spatial curvature .
3	Both the charge density wave ( CDW ) and the superconducting phase have been observed down to the monolayer limit .	Two-dimensional ( 2D ) atomic materials possess very different properties from their bulk counterparts .	While changes in the single-particle electronic properties have been extensively investigated , modifications in the many-body collective phenomena in the exact 2D limit , where interaction effects are strongly enhanced , remain mysterious .	Here we report a combined optical and electrical transport study on the many-body collective-order phase diagram of 2D NbSe $ _2 $ .	While the superconducting transition temperature ( $ T_C $ ) decreases with lowering the layer thickness , the newly observed CDW transition temperature ( $ T_ { \mathrm { CDW } } $ ) increases drastically from 33 K in the bulk to 145 K in the monolayers .
0	We explore the four top signal ttbar ttbar at the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider as a probe of physics beyond the standard model .	Enhancement of the corresponding cross-section with respect to the Standard Model value can probe the electroweak symmetry breaking sector or test extra dimensional models with heavy Kaluza-Klein gluons and quarks .	We perform a detailed analysis including background and detector simulation in the specific case of a universal extra-dimensional model with two extra dimensions compactified using the geometry of the real projective plane .	For masses around 600 GeV , a discovery is possible for an effective cross section above 210 fb ( 36 fb ) for 1/fb ( 10/fb ) of integrated luminosity .	This implies a branching ratio in tops of the ( 1,1 ) heavy photon above 13 % ( 5 % ) .
4	The results are general and can be applied to any close-packed array on a single platform such as the CBI and the forthcoming AMiBA experiments .	We have simulated the interferometric observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) temperature and polarization fluctuations .	We have constructed data pipelines from the time-ordered raw visibility samples to the CMB power spectra which utilize the methods of data compression , maximum likelihood analysis , and optimal subspace filtering .	They are customized for three observational strategies , such as the single pointing , the mosaicking , and the drift-scanning .	For each strategy , derived are the optimal strategy parameters that yield band power estimates with minimum uncertainty .
4	The optimistic limit of the colored Jones polynomial was also formulated by the author and others , but it was so complicated and needed many unnatural assumptions .	The optimistic limit is the mathematical formulation of the classical limit which is a physical method to expect the actual limit by using saddle point method of certain potential function .	The original optimistic limit of the Kashaev invariant was formulated by Yokota , and a modified formulation was suggested by the author and others .	The modified version was easier to handle and more combinatorial than the original one .	On the other hand , it was known that the Kashaev invariant coincides with the evaluation of the colored Jones polynomial at the certain root of unity .
3	A single integro-differential equation for the initial state amplitude has been obtained .	A model describing the electronic transitions in an atom subject to a strong high frequency laser pulse is proposed in the velocity gauge .	The model accounts for the initial state coupling with the the remaining discrete and continuum spectra .	Continuum-continuum transitions are also taken into account following well known strong-field approximation .	Exact numerical solutions of this equation are computed and compared with the full time dependent Schr { \ '' o } dinger equation solution for Hydrogen atoms .
2	We investigate the behavior of the entanglement entropy of dual field theory in this model .	In a recent paper , arXiv:1309.4877 , a holographic p-wave model has been proposed in an Einstein-Maxwell-complex vector field theory with a negative cosmological constant .	The model exhibits rich phase structure depending on the mass and the charge of the vector field .	When the above two model parameters change , we observe the second order , first order and zeroth order phase transitions from the behavior of the entanglement entropy at some intermediate temperatures .	These imply that the entanglement entropy can indicate not only the occurrence of the phase transition , but also the order of the phase transition .
4	We review the basic idea of DD .	Dimensional deconstruction ( DD ) abstracts from higher dimensional models features of related 4 -- dimensional ones .	DD was proposed in Refs .	[ 1,2,3 ] as a scheme for constructing models of { \it naturally } light composite Higgs boson .	These are models in which -- { \it without fine -- tuning of parameters } -- the composite Higgs 's mass M and vacuum expectation value v are much lighter than its binding energy scale \Lambda .
0	On 2011 May 30 , quasi-periodic fast propagating ( QFP ) magnetosonic waves accompanied by a C2.8 flare were directly imaged by the Atomospheric Imaging Assembly instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory .	The QFP waves successively emanated from the flare kernel , they propagated along a cluster of open coronal loops with a phase speed of 834 km/s during the flare 's rising phase , and the multiple arc-shaped wave trains can be fitted with a series of concentric circles .	We generate the k-omega diagram of the Fourier power and find a straight ridge that represents the dispersion relation of the waves .	Along the ridge , we find a lot of prominent nodes which represent the available frequencies of the QFP waves .	On the other hand , the frequencies of the flare are also obtained by analyzing the flare light curves using the wavelet technique .
2	This is similar to a result found by Ehrenfest ( 1917 ) at the atomic level for Coulomb forces ( in Bohr 's model ) and for the Kepler problem .	We determine the mass-radius relation of relativistic white dwarf stars ( a self-gravitating degenerate Fermi gas at T=0 ) in a D-dimensional universe and study the influence of the dimension of space on the laws of physics when we combine quantum mechanics , special relativity and gravity .	We exhibit characteristic dimensions D=1 , D=2 , D=3 , D= { 1\over 2 } ( 3+\sqrt { 17 } ) , D=4 , D=2 ( 1+\sqrt { 2 } ) and show that quantum mechanics can not balance gravitational collapse for D\ge 4 , even in the non-relativistic regime .	This makes the dimension of our universe D=3 very particular .	We discuss some historic aspects concerning the discovery of the Chandrasekhar ( 1931b ) limiting mass in relation with previous investigations by Anderson ( 1929 ) and Stoner ( 1930 ) .
0	We analyze the dynamics of weakly coupled finite temperature $ U ( N ) $ gauge theories on $ S^3 $ by studying a class of effective unitary matrix model .	Solving Dyson-Schwinger equation at large $ N $ , we find that different phases of gauge theories are characterized by gaps in eigenvalue distribution over a unit circle .	In particular , we obtain no-gap , one-gap and two-gap solutions at large $ N $ for a class of matrix model we are considering .	The same effective matrix model can equivalently be written as a sum over representations ( or Young diagrams ) of unitary group .	We show that at large $ N $ , Young diagrams corresponding to different phases can be classified in terms of discontinuities in number of boxes in two consecutive rows .
4	The emitting gas is metal rich ( Z ~2.5-3 Z_solar ) .	In the Chandra Deep Field South 1Msec exposure we have found , at redshift 3.700 +- 0.005 , the most distant Type 2 AGN ever detected .	It is the source with the hardest X-ray spectrum with redshift z & gt ; 3 .	The optical spectrum has no detected continuum emission to a 3sigma detection limit of ~3 10^ { -19 } ergs/s/cm^2/AA and shows narrow lines of Ly_alpha , CIV , NV , HeII , OVI , [ OIII ] , and CIII ] .	Their FWHM line widths have a range of ~700-2300 km/s with an average of approximately ~1500 km/s .
4	The analysis operator is invertible , thus leading to a perfect reconstruction of the original signal through the analysis coefficients .	We propose a method for automatic local time-adaptation of the spectrogram of audio signals : it is based on the decomposition of a signal within a Gabor multi-frame through the STFT operator .	The sparsity of the analysis in every individual frame of the multi-frame is evaluated through the R\'enyi entropy measures : the best local resolution is determined minimizing the entropy values .	The overall spectrogram of the signal we obtain thus provides local optimal resolution adaptively evolving over time .	We give examples of the performance of our algorithm with an instrumental sound and a synthetic one , showing the improvement in spectrogram displaying obtained with an automatic adaptation of the resolution .
0	Let $ \mathbb { K } $ denote a field and let $ \mathfrak { X } $ denote a finite non-empty set .	Let $ \text { Mat } _\mathfrak { X } ( \mathbb { K } ) $ denote the $ \mathbb { K } $ -algebra consisting of the matrices with entries in $ \mathbb { K } $ and rows and columns indexed by $ \mathfrak { X } $ .	A matrix $ C \in \text { Mat } _\mathfrak { X } ( \mathbb { K } ) $ is called Cauchy whenever there exist mutually distinct scalars $ \ { x_i\ } _ { i \in \mathfrak { X } } , \ { \tilde { x } _i\ } _ { i \in \mathfrak { X } } $ from $ \mathbb { K } $ such that $ C_ { ij } = ( x_i - \tilde { x } _j ) ^ { -1 } $ for $ i , j \in \mathfrak { X } $ .	In this paper , we give a linear algebraic characterization of a Cauchy matrix .	To do so , we introduce the notion of a Cauchy pair .
1	However , these issues as well as the solvability are less understood for networks with multiple multicast sessions .	The encoding complexity of network coding for single multicast networks has been intensively studied from several aspects : e.g. , the time complexity , the required number of encoding links , and the required field size for a linear code solution .	Recently , Wang and Shroff showed that the solvability of networks with two unit-rate multicast sessions ( 2-URMS ) can be decided in polynomial time .	In this paper , we prove that for the 2-URMS networks : $ 1 ) $ the solvability can be determined with time $ O ( |E| ) $ ; $ 2 ) $ a solution can be constructed with time $ O ( |E| ) $ ; $ 3 ) $ an optimal solution can be obtained in polynomial time ; $ 4 ) $ the number of encoding links required to achieve a solution is upper-bounded by $ \max\ { 3,2N-2\ } $ ; and $ 5 ) $ the field size required to achieve a linear solution is upper-bounded by $ \max\ { 2 , \lfloor\sqrt { 2N-7/4 } +1/2\rfloor\ } $ , where $ |E| $ is the number of links and $ N $ is the number of sinks of the underlying network .	Both bounds are shown to be tight .
2	It is shown that via applications of TOM in visualization , document clustering , time series analysis etc .	The paper proposes a text-mining based analytical framework aiming at the cognitive organization of complex scientific discourses .	The approach is based on models recently developed in science mapping , being a generalization of the so-called Science Overlay Mapping methodology , referred to as Topic Overlay Mapping ( TOM ) .	the in-depth exploration and even the measurement of cognitive complexity and its dynamics is feasible for scientific domains .	As a use case , an empirical study is presented into the discovery of a long-standing complex , interdisciplinary discourse , the debate on the species concept in biosystematics .
0	We update our 1993 analysis of the CP violating ratio $ \epe $ in view of the changes in several input parameters , in particular the improved value of the top quark mass .	We also investigate the strange quark mass $ m_s $ dependence of $ \epe $ in view of rather low values found in the most recent lattice calculations .	A simple scanning of the input parameters within one standard deviation gives the ranges : $ -1.2 \cdot 10^ { -4 } \le \epe \le 16.0 \cdot 10^ { -4 } $ and $ 0 \le \epe \le 43.0 \cdot 10^ { -4 } $ for $ \ms ( \mc ) =150\pm20~ \mev $ and $ \ms ( \mc ) =100\pm20~ \mev $ respectively .	If the experimentally measured numbers and the theoretical input parameters are used with Gaussian errors , we find $ \epe= ( 3.6\pm 3.4 ) \cdot 10^ { -4 } $ and $ \epe= ( 10.4\pm 8.3 ) \cdot 10^ { -4 } $ respectively .	We also give results for $ { \rm Im } V_ { ts } ^*V_ { td } $ .
0	Plants are sensitive to thermal and electrical effects ; yet the coupling of both , known as thermoelectricity , and its quantitative measurement in vegetal systems never were reported .	We recorded the thermoelectric response of bean sprouts under various thermal conditions and stress .	The obtained experimental data unambiguously demonstrate that a temperature difference between the roots and the leaves of a bean sprout induces a thermoelectric voltage between these two points .	Basing our analysis of the data on the force-flux formalism of linear response theory , we found that the strength of the vegetal equivalent to the thermoelectric coupling is one order of magnitude larger than that in the best thermoelectric materials .	Experimental data also show the importance of the thermal stress variation rate in the plant 's electrophysiological response .
0	The discrete spectrum of fluctuations of the metric about an $ AdS^5 $ black hole background are found .	These modes are the strong coupling limit of so called glueball states in a dual 3-d Yang-Mills theory with quantum numbers $ J^ { PC } = 2^ { ++ } , 1^ { -+ } , 0^ { ++ } $ .	For the ground state modes , we find the mass relation : $ m ( 0^ { ++ } ) & lt ; m ( 2^ { ++ } ) & lt ; m ( 1^ { -+ } ) $ .	Contrary to expectation , the mass of our new $ 0^ { ++ } $ state ( $ m^2=5.4573 $ ) associated with the graviton is smaller than the mass of the $ 0^ { ++ } $ state ( $ m^2=11.588 $ ) from the dilaton .	In fact the dilatonic excitations are exactly degenerate with our tensor $ 2^ { ++ } $ states .
0	In this article we focus on Maximum Likelihood estimation ( MLE ) for the static parameters of hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) .	We will consider the case where one can not or does not want to compute the conditional likelihood density of the observation given the hidden state because of increased computational complexity or analytical intractability .	Instead we will assume that one may obtain samples from this conditional likelihood and hence use approximate Bayesian computation ( ABC ) approximations of the original HMM .	ABC approximations are biased , but the bias can be controlled to arbitrary precision via a parameter \epsilon & gt ; 0 ; the bias typically goes to zero as \epsilon \searrow 0 .	We first establish that the bias in the log-likelihood and gradient of the log-likelihood of the ABC approximation , for a fixed batch of data , is no worse than \mathcal { O } ( n\epsilon ) , n being the number of data ; hence , for computational reasons , one might expect reasonable parameter estimates using such an ABC approximation .
0	We present first INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observations of a Seyfert galaxy , the type 2 AGN NGC 4388 .	Several INTEGRAL observations performed in 2003 allow us to study the spectrum in the 20 - 300 keV range .	In addition two XMM-Newton observations give detailed insight into the 0.2 - 10 keV emission .	The measurements presented here and comparison with previous observations by BeppoSAX , SIGMA and CGRO/OSSE show that the overall spectrum from soft X-rays up to the gamma-rays can be described by a highly absorbed ( N_H = 2.7e23 1/cm^2 ) and variable non-thermal component in addition to constant non-absorbed thermal emission ( T = 0.8 keV ) of low abundance ( 7 % solar ) , plus a constant Fe K-alpha and K-beta line .	The hard X-ray component is well described by a simple power law with a mean photon index of 1.7 .
1	It is shown how Clifford algebra provides much more : it provides room for new physics , with the prospects of resolving certain long standing puzzles .	This a book is for those who would like to learn something about special and general relativity beyond the usual textbooks , about quantum field theory , the elegant Fock-Schwinger-Stueckelberg proper time formalism , the elegant description of geometry by means of Clifford algebra , about the fascinating possibilities the latter algebra offers in reformulating the existing physical theories , and quantizing them in a natural way .	The theory of branes and the idea of how a 3-brane might represent our world is discussed in detail .	Much attention is paid to the elegant geometric theory of branes which employs the infinite dimensional space of functions describing branes .	Clifford algebra is generalized to the infinite dimensional spaces .
3	In the case of nonconservative defects , the asymptotic state is subcritical .	We study three models of driven sandpile-type automata in the presence of quenched random defects .	When the dynamics is conservative , all these models , termed the random sites ( A ) , random bonds ( B ) , and random slopes ( C ) , self-organize into a critical state .	For Model C the concentration-dependent exponents are nonuniversal .	Possible defect-mediated nonequilibrium phase transitions are also discussed .
2	During this contraction , FUV photoevaporation and ablation by shocks and winds disperse filament gas and limit core growth .	Mass functions of starless dense cores ( CMFs ) may arise from contraction and dispersal of core-forming filaments .	In an illustrative model , a filament contracts radially by self-gravity , increasing the mass of its cores .	The stopping times of core growth are described by a waiting-time distribution .	The initial filament column density profile and the resulting CMF each match recent Herschel observations in detail .
2	From total energy calculations we show that - in contrast to the other boranates and alanates - hydrogen desorption directly to the elements is likely , and is at least competitive with desorption to the elemental hydride ( BeH2 ) .	Alanates and boranates are studied intensively because of their potential use as hydrogen storage materials .	In this paper we present a first-principles study of the electronic structure and the energetics of beryllium boranate , Be ( BH4 ) 2 .	The formation enthalpy of Be ( BH4 ) 2 is only -0.12 eV/H2 ( at T=0K ) .	This low value can be rationalized by the participation of all atoms in the covalent bonding , in contrast to the ionic bonding observed in other boranates .
2	However , the core switches irregularly with respect to both the field pulse amplitude and duration .	We report on the switching of the magnetic vortex core in a Pac-man disk using a magnetic field pulse , investigated via micromagnetic simulations .	The minimum core switching field is reduced by 72 % compared to that of a circular disk with the same diameter and thickness .	This irregularity is induced by magnetization oscillations which arise due to excitation of the spin waves when the core annihilates .	We show that the core switching can be controlled with the assist magnetic field and by changing the waveform .
2	Our main technical ingredient is a sufficient condition for almost sure criticality of the ASM on sequences of finite cacti ( i.e. , separable graphs whose blocks are cycles or single edges ) under the assumption that the random weak limit is almost surely 1-ended .	The main result of this paper is a rigorous proof of criticality and an explicit computation of critical exponents for the decay of avalanches in the Abelian sandpile model ( ASM ) on a large family of infinite graphs .	We begin by introducing the notion of criticality of the ASM for limits of finite graphs in local convergence , which naturally leads to the question about criticality of the ASM in the random weak limit .	Examples that allow explicit computations of the critical exponents come from actions of finitely generated groups on regular rooted trees , by automorphisms .	Restricting the action to the consecutive levels of the tree defines a sequence of finite graphs whose limits in the local convergence are orbital Schreier graphs for the action of the group on the boundary of the tree .
0	One of the biggest mysteries in cosmology is Dark Energy , which is required to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe within the standard model .	But maybe one can explain the observations without introducing new physics , by simply taking one step back and re-examining one of the basic concepts of cosmology , homogeneity .	In standard cosmology , it is assumed that the universe is homogeneous , but this is not true at small scales ( & lt ; 200 Mpc ) .	Since general relativity , which is the basis of modern cosmology , is a non-linear theory , one can expect some backreactions in the case of an inhomogeneous matter distribution .	Estimates of the magnitude of these backreactions ( feedback ) range from insignificant to being perfectly able to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe .
3	We model source emission rates with a Gaussian mixture model and use a Markov random field to represent the atmospheric background concentration component of the measurements .	We describe a method for detecting , locating and quantifying sources of gas emissions to the atmosphere using remotely obtained gas concentration data ; the method is applicable to gases of environmental concern .	We demonstrate its performance using methane data collected from aircraft .	Atmospheric point concentration measurements are modelled as the sum of a spatially and temporally smooth atmospheric background concentration , augmented by concentrations due to local sources .	A Gaussian plume atmospheric eddy dispersion model represents gas dispersion between sources and measurement locations .
4	This feature leads to a large-scale integration and a construction of the qubit with a smaller size which is robust to the decoherence by external noises .	We propose a new qubit consisting of a superconducting ring with two ordinary zero junctions and one ferromagnetic pi junction .	In the system , two degenerate stable states appear in the phase space without an external magnetic field because of a competition between the zero and pi states .	Quantum tunneling between the two degenerate states leads to a formation of bonding and antibonding states ( coherent states ) which are used as a bit .	For manipulating the states of the qubit , only small external magnetic field around zero is required .
2	Using Kechris and Rosendal 's work as a guide , we explore consequences of ample metric generics ( or , more generally , ample generics for Polish topometric groups ) .	We define and study the notion of \emph { ample metric generics } for a Polish topological group , which is a weakening of the notion of ample generics introduced by Kechris and Rosendal in \cite { Kechris-Rosendal : Turbulence } .	Our work is based on the concept of a \emph { Polish topometric group } , defined in this article .	Then we provide examples of Polish groups with ample metric generics , such as the isometry group $ \Iso ( \bU_1 ) $ of the bounded Urysohn space , the unitary group $ { \mathcal U } ( \ell_2 ) $ of a separable Hilbert space , and the automorphism group $ \Aut ( [ 0,1 ] , \lambda ) $ of the Lebesgue measure algebra on $ [ 0,1 ] $ .	We deduce from this and earlier work of Kittrell and Tsankov that this last group has the automatic continuity property , i.e. , any morphism from $ \Aut ( [ 0,1 ] , \lambda ) $ into a separable topological group is continuous .
4	Because few are known on the behaviour of the PLS components we also investigate their statistical properties in a regression context .	Partial Least Square ( PLS ) is a dimension reduction method used to remove multicollinearities in a regression model .	However contrary to Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) the PLS components are also choosen to be optimal for predicting the response $ Y $ .	In this paper we provide a new and explicit formula for the residuals .	We show that the residuals are completely determined by the spectrum of the design matrix and by the noise on the observations .
0	We study the influence of errors and decoherence on both the performance of Shor 's factoring algorithm and Grover 's search algorithm , and on the amount of interference in these algorithms using a recently proposed interference measure .	We consider systematic unitary errors , random unitary errors , and decoherence processes .	We show that unitary errors which destroy the interference destroy the efficiency of the algorithm , too .	However , unitary errors may also create useless additional interference .	In such a case the total amount of interference can increase , while the efficiency of the quantum computation decreases .
0	This document describes the DIR net , a distributed environment which is part of the EFTOS fault tolerance framework .	The DIR net is a system consisting of two components , called DIR Manager ( or , shortly , the manager ) and DIR Backup Agent ( shortly , the backup ) .	One manager and a set of backups is located in the system to be `guarded ' , one component per node .	At this point the DIR net weaves a web which substantially does two things : 1 ) makes itself tolerant to a number of possible faults , and 2 ) gathers information pertaining the run of the user application .	As soon as an error occurs within the DIR net , the system executes built-in recovery actions that allow itself to continue processing despite a number of hardware/software faults , possibly doing a graceful degradation of its features ; when an error occurs in the user application , the DIR net , by means of custom- and user-defined detection tools , is informed of such events and runs one or more recovery strategies , both built-in and coded by the user using an ancillary compile-time tool , the rl translator .
0	We prove a useful identity valid for all $ ADE $ minimal S-matrices , that clarifies the transformation of the relative thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz ( TBA ) from its standard form into the universal one proposed by Al.B.Zamolodchikov .	By considering the graph encoding of the system of functional equations for the exponentials of the pseudoenergies , we show that any such system having the same form as those for the $ ADE $ TBA 's , can be encoded on $ A , D , E , A/Z_2 $ only .	This includes , besides the known $ ADE $ diagonal scattering , the set of all $ SU ( 2 ) $ related { \em magnonic } TBA 's .	We explore this class sistematically and find some interesting new massive and massless RG flows .	The generalization to classes related to higher rank algebras is briefly presented and an intriguing relation with level-rank duality is signalled .
4	The PL peak intensity of InAs QDs doped to 5\times1011cm-2 is increased about thirty-five times from that of the undoped ones at 300K .	The influences of Si sheet doping levels on the properties of InAs/GaAs quantum dots ( QDs ) are investigated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and photoluminescence ( PL ) .	AFM measurements reveal that Si sheet doping does n't change the morphology of InAs QDs .	Conductive AFM exhibits a quick current decrease when the Si doping density reaches 5\times1011cm-2 .	PL measurements show that the Si doping can significantly enhance the PL intensity .
4	In the magnetic phase , the capacitance is dominated by the presence of the edge states while the ribbon width is small .	Electronic states in nanographite ribbons with zigzag edges are studied using the extended Hubbard model with nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions .	The electronic states with the opposite electric charges separated along both edges are analogous as nanocondensers .	Therefore , electric capacitance , defined using a relation of polarizability , is calculated to examine nano-functionalities .	We find that the behavior of the capacitance is widely different depending on whether the system is in the magnetic or charge polarized phases .
1	Using this description , a characterization of compact-valued retracts of a given space in terms of functional extenders is obtained .	We describe the supports of a class of real-valued maps on $ C* ( X ) $ introduced by Radul .	For example , if $ X\subset Y $ , then there exists a continuous compact-valued retraction from $ Y $ onto $ X $ if and only if there exists a normed weakly additive extender $ u\colon C* ( X ) \to C* ( Y ) $ with compact supports preserving $ \min $ ( resp. , $ \max $ ) and weakly preserving $ \max $ ( resp. , $ \min $ ) .	Similar characterizations are obtained for upper ( resp. , lower ) semi-continuous compact-valued retractions .	These results provide characterizations of ( not necessarily compact ) absolute extensors for zero-dimensional spaces , as well as absolute extensors for one-dimensional spaces , involving non-linear functional extenders .
0	Recent studies have been using graph theoretical approaches to model complex networks ( such as social , infrastructural or biological networks ) , and how their hardwired circuitry relates to their dynamic evolution in time .	Understanding how configuration reflects on the coupled behavior in a system of dynamic nodes can be of great importance , for example in the context of how the brain connectome is affecting brain function .	However , the connectivity patterns that appear in brain networks , and their individual effects on network dynamics , are far from being fully understood .	We study the connections between edge configuration and dynamics in a simple oriented network composed of two interconnected cliques ( representative of brain feedback regulatory circuitry ) .	In this paper , our main goal is to study the spectra of the graph adjacency and Laplacian matrices , with a focus on three aspects in particular : ( 1 ) the sensitivity/robustness the spectrum in response to varying the intra and inter-modular edge density , ( 2 ) the effects on the spectrum of perturbing the edge configuration , while keeping the densities fixed and ( 3 ) the effects of increasing the network size .
4	We also give examples of smooth tropical surfaces of arbitrary degree greater than 3 , containing no tropical lines .	Given a tropical line L on a tropical surface X , we define its combinatorial position on X to be a certain decorated graph , showing the relative positions of vertices of X on L , and how the vertices of L are positioned on X .	We classify all possible combinatorial positions of a tropical line on general smooth tropical surfaces of any degree .	This classification allows one to give an upper bound for the number of tropical lines on a general smooth tropical surface with a given subdivision .	As a concrete example , we offer a subdivision for which the associated tropical surfaces are smooth cubics with exactly 27 tropical lines in the general case , and always at least 27 tropical lines .
1	The class of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces carries close ties to the property of complete integrability , as manifested by the existence of infinite hierarchies of conservation laws and associated linear problems .	The class of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces , first introduced by Chern and Tenenblat [ 3 ] , is characterized by the property that to each solution of a differential equation , within the class , there corresponds a 2-dimensional Riemannian metric of curvature equal to $ -1 $ .	As such , it contains many important known examples of integrable equations , like the sine-Gordon , Liouville and KdV equations .	It also gives rise to many new families of integrable equations .	The question we address in this paper concerns the local isometric immersion of pseudo-spherical surfaces in $ { \bf E } ^ { 3 } $ from the perspective of the differential equations that give rise to the metrics .
2	We find that the decay widths are $ \Gamma ( B_s\rightarrow D^ { * } _ { s1 } \ell\bar { \nu } ) =1.25^ { +0.80 } _ { -0.60 } \times10^ { -19 } \mbox { GeV } $ , $ \Gamma ( B_s\rightarrow D^ { ' } _ { s2 } \ell\bar { \nu } ) =1.49^ { +0.97 } _ { -0.73 } \times10^ { -19 } \mbox { GeV } $ , $ \Gamma ( B_s\rightarrow D_ { s2 } \ell\bar { \nu } ) =4.48^ { +1.05 } _ { -0.94 } \times10^ { -17 } \mbox { GeV } $ , and $ \Gamma ( B_s\rightarrow D^ { * } _ { s3 } \ell\bar { \nu } ) = 1.52^ { +0.35 } _ { -0.31 } \times10^ { -16 } \mbox { GeV } $ .	In the framework of heavy quark effective theory , the leading order Isgur-Wise form factors relevant to semileptonic decays of the ground state $ \bar { b } s $ meson $ B_ { s } $ into orbitally excited $ D $ -wave $ \bar { c } s $ mesons , including the newly observed narrow $ D^ { * } _ { s1 } ( 2860 ) $ and $ D^ { * } _ { s3 } ( 2860 ) $ states by the LHCb Collaboration , are calculated with the QCD sum rule method .	With these universal form factors , the decay rates and branching ratios are estimated .	The corresponding branching ratios are $ \mathcal { B } ( B_s\rightarrow D^ { * } _ { s1 } \ell\bar { \nu } ) =2.85^ { +1.82 } _ { -1.36 } \times 10^ { -7 } $ , $ \mathcal { B } ( B_s\rightarrow D^ { ' } _ { s2 } \ell\bar { \nu } ) =3.40^ { +2.21 } _ { -1.66 } \times 10^ { -7 } $ , $ \mathcal { B } ( B_ { s } \rightarrow D_ { s2 } \ell\bar { \nu } ) =1.02^ { +0.24 } _ { -0.21 } \times 10^ { -4 } $ , and $ \mathcal { B } ( B_s\rightarrow D^ { * } _ { s3 } \ell\bar { \nu } ) = 3.46^ { +0.80 } _ { -0.70 } \times 10^ { -4 } $ .	The decay widths and branching ratios of corresponding $ B^ { * } _ { s } $ semileptonic processes are also predicted .
3	In the perturbed ensembles , the correlation functions can be written in terms of kernels .	We consider ensembles of Gaussian ( Hermite ) and Wishart ( Laguerre ) $ N\times N $ hermitian matrices .	We study the effect of finite rank perturbations of these ensembles by a source term .	The rank $ r $ of the perturbation corresponds to the number of non-null eigenvalues of the source matrix .	We show that for all $ N $ , the difference between the perturbed and the unperturbed kernels is a degenerate kernel of size $ r $ which depends on multiple Hermite or Laguerre functions .
0	Let $ S_ { g,1 , p } $ be an orientable surface of genus $ g $ with one boundary component and $ p $ punctures .	Let $ \mathcal { M } _ { g,1 , p } $ be the mapping-class group of $ S_ { g,1 , p } $ relative to the boundary .	We construct homomorphisms $ \mathcal { M } _ { g,1 , p } \to \mathcal { M } _ { g',1 , ( b-1 ) } $ , where $ g ' \geq 0 $ and $ b\geq 1 $ .	We proof that the constructed homomorphisms $ \M_ { g,1 , p } \to \M_ { g',1 , ( b-1 ) } $ are injective .	One of these embeddings for $ g = 0 $ is classic .
1	Increasingly detailed observations of young star clusters and star-forming molecular clouds and computational studies provide clues about their formation scenarios and the underlying physical processes involved .	How Very Young Massive star Clusters ( VYMCs ; also known as `` starburst '' clusters ) , which typically are of $ \gtrsim 10^4M_\odot $ and are a few Myr old , form out of Giant Molecular Clouds is still largely an open question .	This chapter is focused on reviewing the decade-long studies that attempt to computationally reproduce the well-observed nearby VYMCs , such as the Orion Nebula Cluster , R136 and NGC 3603 young cluster , thereby shedding light on birth conditions of massive star clusters , in general .	On this regard , focus is given on direct N-body modeling of real-sized massive star clusters , with a monolithic structure and undergoing residual gas expulsion , which have consistently reproduced the observed characteristics of several VYMCs and also of young star clusters , in general .	The connection of these relatively simplified model calculations with the structural richness of dense molecular clouds and the complexity of hydrodynamic calculations of star cluster formation is presented in detail .
3	Extensive electronic structure calculations are performed to obtain optimized geometries , harmonic frequencies and accurate single point energies for the selected alkane conformers from octane through octadecane .	Short unbranched alkanes are known to prefer linear conformations , while long unbranched alkanes are folded .	It is not known with certainty at what chain length the linear conformation is no longer the global minimum .	To clarify this point , we use { \it ab initio } and density functional methods to compute the relative energies of the linear and hairpin alkane conformers for increasing chain lengths .	Benchmark CCSD ( T ) /cc-pVTZ single point calculations are performed for chains through tetradecane , while approximate methods are required for the longer chains up to octadecane .
1	Taking the first effect into account , we predict the masses of the ground states with $ l=0,1,2 $ in agreement with experiment .	It is shown that two physical phenomena are important for high excitations : ( i ) the screening of the universal gluon-exchange potential and ( ii ) the flattening of the confining potential owing to creation of quark loops , and both effects are determined quantitatively .	The flattening effect ensures the observed linear behaviour of the radial Regge trajectories $ M^2 ( n ) =m_0^2 + n_r \mu^2 $ GeV $ ^2 $ , where the slope $ \mu^2 $ is very sensitive to the parameter $ \gamma $ , which determines the weakening of the string tension $ \sigma ( r ) $ at large distances .	For the $ \rho $ -trajectory the linear behaviour starts with $ n_r=1 $ and the values $ \mu^2=1.40 ( 2 ) $ ~GeV $ ^2 $ for $ \gamma=0.40 $ and $ \mu^2=1.34 ( 1 ) $ ~GeV $ ^2 $ for $ \gamma=0.45 $ are obtained .	For the excited states the leptonic widths : $ \Gamma_ { \rm ee } ( \rho ( 775 ) ) =7.0 ( 3 ) $ ~keV , $ \Gamma_ { \rm ee } ( \rho ( 1450 ) ) =1.7 ( 1 ) $ ~keV , $ \Gamma_ { \rm ee } ( \rho ( 1900 ) ) =1.0 ( 1 ) $ ~keV , $ \Gamma_ { \rm ee } ( \rho ( 2150 ) ) =0.7 ( 1 ) $ ~keV , and $ \Gamma_ { \rm ee } ( 1\ , { } ^3D_1 ) =0.26 ( 5 ) $ ~keV are calculated , if these states are considered as purely $ q\bar q $ states .
1	The first part of the paper is devoted to the long time/long range rescaling of the fractional Fisher-KPP equation .	We perform an asymptotic analysis of models of population dynamics with a fractional Laplacian and local or nonlocal reaction terms .	This rescaling is based on the exponential speed of propagation of the population .	In particular we show that the only role of the fractional Laplacian in determining this speed is at the initial layer where it determines the thickness of the tails of the solutions .	Next , we show that such rescaling is also possible for models with non-local reaction terms , as selection-mutation models .
1	We assume that this central region evolved even faster than the Galactic halo and test the effect of changing the slope of the IMF on the predicted stellar metallicity distribution for bulge stars .	The chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge is treated here in the context of an inside-out model for the Galaxy formation .	An IMF favoring the formation of massive stars is found to improve the agreement with the most recently observed metallicity distribution of bulge K giants .	Then , we make specific predictions about temporal evolution of several light and heavy species in the Galactic bulge .	We predict that alpha-elements should be enhanced relative to Fe for most of the [ Fe/H ] range , with different degrees of enhancement due to the different nucleosynthetic history of each element , and show that Lithium abundance should follow a trend with metallicity similar to that found for the solar neighbourhood .
2	Information is encoded in the time differences of spikes or the multiplicity of spikes produced at certain times .	Spiking Neural P systems , SNP systems for short , are biologically inspired computing devices based on how neurons perform computations .	SNP systems use only one type of symbol , the spike , in the computations .	SNP systems with delays ( associated with rules ) and those without delays are two of several Turing complete SNP system variants in literature .	In this work we investigate how restricted forms of SNP systems with delays can be simulated by SNP systems without delays .
4	Also of course precision studies at low energy facilities can be useful for detecting new phenomena .	The importance of incorporating flavor constraints , when providing bounds on new physics is stressed .	As is well known it is very difficult for models of new physics to have scales lighter than about 10 TeV once flavor constraints are built in .	Although , in the conventional sense , this higher scale means more tuning , it may well make the underlying theory simpler as illustrated with one example .	Direct production of new particles heavier than about 5 TeV becomes very difficult at LHC though indirect signals such as deviations in the Higgs to gamma gamma branching ratio may still be possible .
0	Cellular decision making is based on regulatory circuits that associate signal thresholds to specific physiological actions .	This transmission of information is subjected to molecular noise what can decrease its fidelity .	Here , we show instead how such intrinsic noise enhances information transfer in the presence of multiple circuit copies .	The result is due to the contribution of noise to the generation of autonomous responses by each copy , which are altogether associated with a common decision .	Moreover , factors that correlate the responses of the redundant units ( extrinsic noise or regulatory cross-talk ) contribute to reduce fidelity , while those that further uncouple them ( heterogeneity within the copies ) can lead to stronger information gain .
3	We consider this to be a dominant mechanism for PAH destruction , rather than grain destruction in photoionized regions surrounding young massive stars .	Archival observations of 18 starburst galaxies that span a wide range in metallicity reveal for the first time a correlation between the ratio of emission line fluxes of [ FeII ] at 26 microns and [ NeII ] at 12.8 microns and the 7.7 micron PAH strength , with the [ FeII ] / [ NeII ] flux ratio decreasing with increasing PAH strength .	We also find a strong correlation between the [ FeII ] / [ NeII ] flux ratio and the host galaxy metallicity , with the flux ratio decreasing with increasing metallicity .	Since [ FeII ] emission has been linked primarily to supernova shocks , we attribute the high [ FeII ] / [ NeII ] ratios in low-metallicity galaxies to enhanced supernova activity .	We also consider whether the extreme youth of the low-metallicity galaxies is responsible for the lack of PAH emission .
2	Data have been compiled from observations with Fermi , Swift , RXTE , the VLBA , and various ground-based optical and radio telescopes .	We have observed 3C~279 in a gamma-ray flaring state in November 2008 .	We construct quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) of the source for the flaring period of 2008 and during a quiescent period in May 2010 .	The objective is to comprehend the correspondence between the flux and polarization variations observed during these two time periods by carrying out a detailed spectral analyses of 3C~279 in the internal shock scenario , and gain insights into the role of intrinsic parameters and interplay of synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation processes responsible for the two states .	As a first step , we have used a multi-slice time-dependent leptonic jet model , in the framework of the internal shock scenario , with radiation feedback to simulate the SED of 3C~279 observed in an optical high state in early 2006 .
3	For each partition , a set of fuzzy rules is extracted based on a f-SVM combining model .	This paper proposed a model to predict the stock price based on combining Self-Organizing Map ( SOM ) and fuzzy-Support Vector Machines ( f-SVM ) .	Extraction of fuzzy rules from raw data based on the combining of statistical machine learning models is base of this proposed approach .	In the proposed model , SOM is used as a clustering algorithm to partition the whole input space into the several disjoint regions .	Then fuzzy rules sets are used to predict the test data using fuzzy inference algorithms .
2	First , all scattered TNOs evolve through intermittent temporary resonance capture events and gravitational scattering by Neptune .	We investigate the dynamical evolution of trans-Neptunian objects ( TNOs ) in typical scattered disk orbits ( scattered TNOs ) by performing simulations using several thousand particles lying initially on Neptune-encountering orbits .	We explore the role of resonance sticking in the scattered disk , a phenomenon characterized by multiple temporary resonance captures ( 'resonances ' refers to external mean motion resonances with Neptune , which can be described in the form r : s , where the arguments r and s are integers ) .	Each scattered TNO experiences tens to hundreds of resonance captures over a period of 4 Gyr , which represents about 38 % of the object 's lifetime ( mean value ) .	Second , resonance sticking plays an important role at semimajor axes a & lt ; 250 AU , where the great majority of such captures occurred .
1	The emergent theory of gravity has two gravitational constants : G - Newton 's constant , and a dimensionless constant - alpha .	A theory of 3-space explains the phenomenon of gravity as arising from the time-dependence and inhomogeneity of the differential flow of this 3-space .	Various experiments and astronomical observations have shown that alpha is the fine structure constant 1/137 .	Here we analyse the Greenland Ice Shelf and Nevada Test Site borehole g anomalies , and confirm with increased precision this value of alpha .	This and other successful tests of this theory of gravity , including the supermassive black holes in globular clusters and galaxies , and the `dark-matter ' effect in spiral galaxies , demonstrates the validity of this theory of gravity .
4	We measured the masses of 40 stars on the RGB and 19 in the RC of the old metal-rich cluster NGC6791 .	Mass loss of red giant branch ( RGB ) stars is still poorly determined , despite its crucial role in the chemical enrichment of galaxies .	Thanks to the recent detection of solar-like oscillations in G-K giants in open clusters with Kepler , we can now directly determine stellar masses for a statistically significant sample of stars in the old open clusters NGC6791 and NGC6819 .	The aim of this work is to constrain the integrated RGB mass loss by comparing the average mass of stars in the red clump ( RC ) with that of stars in the low-luminosity portion of the RGB ( i.e.stars with L & lt ; ~ L ( RC ) ) .	Stellar masses were determined by combining the available seismic parameters numax and Dnu with additional photometric constraints and with independent distance estimates .
3	We propose an improved Laplace approximation which increases asymptotically the accuracy of the standard Laplace formula by one order of magnitude , and which is also accurate in high-dimensions .	Intractable multidimensional integrals arise very often both in Bayesian and frequentist applications .	The Laplace formula is widely used to approximate such integrals .	However , in large dimensions , when the shape of the integrand function is far from that of the Gaussian density and/or the sample size is small , the standard Laplace approximation can be inaccurate .	Applications to Bayesian inference in nonlinear regression models and to frequentist inference in a generalized linear mixed model with crossed random effects demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method with respect to the standard Laplace formula .
0	For cell-division processes in a window , Cowan introduced four selection rules and two division rules each of which stands for one cell-division model .	One of these is the area-weighted in-cell model .	In this model , each cell is selected for division with a probability that corresponds to the ratio between its area and the area of the whole window .	This selected cell is then divided by throwing a ( uniformly distributed ) point into the cell and drawing a line segment through the point under a random angle with the segment ending at the cell 's boundary .	For the STIT model which uses both a different selection and a different division rule , Mart\'inez and Nagel showed that for a STIT process { Y ( t , W ) : t & gt ; 0 } the process { exp ( t ) Y ( exp ( t ) , W ) : t real } is not only spatially stationary but also temporally .
4	The time for the final state to be reached is studied as a function of the relevant phenomenological parameters .	We present a simple one-dimensional model to describe the evolution of a transverse dune field .	The model is characterized by the distances between the dunes and their heights , which determine the inter-dune sand flux .	The model reproduces the observation that the dunes in a given field have approximately all the same height .	We find that this result is independent of the initial configuration of the field , as well as of coalescence effects between migrating dunes .
4	Maps with an average sensitivity of 50 microK per beam have been obtained for each channel .	We present observations with the new 11 GHz radiometer of the COSMOSOMAS experiment at the Teide Observatory ( Tenerife ) .	The sky region between 0 deg & lt ; = RA & lt ; = 360 deg and 26 deg & lt ; = DEC 49 deg ( ca .	6500 square degrees ) was observed with an angular resolution of 0.9 deg .	Two orthogonal independent channels in the receiving system measured total power signals from linear polarizations with a 2 GHz bandwidth .
1	By exploring the structure of downlink ( DL ) uplink ( UL ) duality at either the base station ( BS ) or the relay station ( RS ) , we propose two schemes of joint power allocation and beamforming design at the BS and the RS .	In this paper , system design for the multi-input multi-output ( MIMO ) relay broadcast channel with individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio ( SINR ) constraints at the mobile stations ( MS ) is considered .	The problem of existence of feasible solutions under practical power constraints at the BS and the RS with given SINR targets is considered first .	Then the problem of sum power minimization is considered .	Each design problem can be solved efficiently using optimal joint power allocation and beamforming under the framework of convex optimization .
2	We focus on the Brans-Dicke form of the renormalization-group improved action functional .	Previous work in the literature had built a formalism for spatially averaged equations for the scale factor , giving rise to an averaged Raychaudhuri equation and averaged Hamiltonian constraint , which involve a backreaction source term .	The present paper extends these equations to include models with variable Newton parameter and variable cosmological term , motivated by the nonperturbative renormalization program for quantum gravity based upon the Einstein-Hilbert action .	The coupling between backreaction and spatially averaged three-dimensional scalar curvature is found to survive , and a variable-G cosmic quintet is found to emerge .	Interestingly , under suitable assumptions , an approximate solution can be found where the early universe tends to a FLRW model , while keeping track of the original inhomogeneities through three effective fluids .
4	Our models are evolved in time under self-gravitational hydrodynamics with AMR using a barotropic equation of state that models the transition from an isothermal to an adiabatic equation of state .	We examine the conditions under which binary and multiple stars may form out of turbulent molecular cloud cores using high resolution 3-D , adaptive mesh refinement ( AMR ) hydrodynamics ( Truelove et al. , 1997 , 1998 ; Klein , 1999 ) .	We argue that previous conclusions on the conditions for cloud fragmentation have limited applicability , since they did not allow for the nonlinear density and velocity perturbations that are ubiquitous in molecular cloud cores .	Over the past year , we have begun to simulate the evolution of marginally stable , turbulent cores .	These models have radii , masses , density contrasts , turbulent linewidths , and projected velocity gradients consistent with observations of low-mass molecular cloud cores .
3	When we consider only bright ( $ M_ { r } $ $ & lt ; $ $ - $ 21.5 ) galaxies with early-type morphology , the fraction of galaxies with recent star formation is still 39 % .	We study the mid-infrared ( IR ) and near-ultraviolet ( UV ) excess emissions of spectroscopically selected quiescent galaxies on the optical red sequence .	We use the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( { \it WISE } ) mid-IR and Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( { \it GALEX } ) near-UV data for a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to study the possible connection between quiescent red-sequence galaxies with and without mid-IR/near-UV excess .	Among 648 12 $ \mu $ m detected quiescent red-sequence galaxies without H $ \alpha $ emission , 26 % and 55 % show near-UV and mid-IR excess emissions , respectively .	The quiescent red-sequence galaxies with mid-IR and near-UV excess emissions are optically fainter and have slightly smaller $ D_ { n } $ 4000 than those without mid-IR and near-UV excess emissions .
2	The characteristic time between metabasin transitions is comparable to the structural relaxation time , suggesting that these transitions are relevant for the long time dynamics .	We employ the Distance Matrix method to investigate metabasin dynamics in supercooled water .	We find that the motion of the system consists in the exploration of a finite region of configuration space ( enclosing several distinct local minima ) , named metabasin , followed by a sharp crossing to a different metabasin .	The crossing between metabasins is accompanied by very rapid diffusional jumps of several groups of dynamically correlated particles .	These particles form relatively compact clusters and act as cooperative relaxing units responsible for the density relaxation .
1	The fractional part of betatron tune is important and it can be measured by analyzing the signals of beam position from the appointed BPM .	Precise measurement of betatron tune is required for good operating condition of CSNS RCS .	Usually these signals are contaminated during the acquisition process , therefore several power spectrum methods are used to improve the frequency resolution .	In this article classical and modern power spectrum methods are used .	In order to compare their performance , the results of simulation data and IQT data from J-PARC RCS are discussed .
2	It is shown that the Eilenberger equations represent a viable alternative to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory of the topological superconducting heterostructures and provide a much simpler quantitative description of some observables .	We use the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory to study the topological superconducting proximity effects between a segment of a nanowire with a p-wave order parameter and a metallic segment .	This model faithfully represents key qualitative features of an experimental setup , where only a part of a nanowire is in immediate contact with a bulk superconductor , inducing topological superconductivity .	For our setup , we obtain exact analytical solutions for the quasiclassical Green 's functions and the density of states as a function of position and energy .	The correlations induced by the boundary involve terms associated with both p-wave and odd-frequency pairing , which are intertwined and contribute to observables on an equal footing .
4	The phase separation appears for all the fillings we have considered , whenever the inter-species interaction is slightly larger than the intra-species interactions .	We study the ground state quantum phase diagram for a two species Bose mixture in a one-dimensional optical lattice using the finite size density matrix renormalization group ( FSDMRG ) method .	We discuss our results for different combinations of inter and intra species interaction strengths with commensurate and incommensurate fillings of the bosons .	The phases we have obtained are superfluid , Mott insulator and a novel phase separation , where different species reside in spatially separate regions .	The spatially separated phase is further classified into phase separated superfluid ( PS-SF ) and Mott insulator ( PS-MI ) .
3	We show that there is presently no clear evidence for stabilization in a strict sense , because in the numerical experiments only metastable ( slowly decaying ) solutions have been obtained .	We consider dynamical stabilization of Bose-Einstein condensates ( BEC ) by time-dependent modulation of the scattering length .	The problem has been studied before by several methods : Gaussian variational approximation , the method of moments , method of modulated Townes soliton , and the direct averaging of the Gross-Pitaevskii ( GP ) equation .	We summarize these methods and find that the numerically obtained stabilized solution has different configuration than that assumed by the theoretical methods ( in particular a phase of the wavefunction is not quadratic with $ r $ ) .	In other words , neither numerical nor mathematical evidence for a new kind of soliton solutions have been revealed so far .
2	The distribution of the order-parameter fluctuations , P ( M_x ) , is evaluated numerically for spin-chains of up to 20 spins .	The zero-temperature transverse Ising chain carrying an energy flux j_E is studied with the aim of determining the nonequilibrium distribution functions , P ( M_z ) and P ( M_x ) , of its transverse and longitudinal magnetizations , respectively .	An exact calculation reveals that P ( M_z ) is a Gaussian both at j_E=0 and j_E not equal 0 , and the width of the distribution decreases with increasing energy flux .	For the equilibrium case ( j_E=0 ) , we find the expected Gaussian fluctuations away from the critical point while the critical order-parameter fluctuations are shown to be non-gaussian with a scaling function Phi ( x ) =Phi ( M_x/ & lt ; M_x & gt ; ) = & lt ; M_x & gt ; P ( M_x ) strongly dependent on the boundary conditions .	When j_E not equal 0 , the system displays long-range , oscillating correlations but P ( M_x ) is a Gaussian nevertheless , and the width of the Gaussian decreases with increasing j_E .
4	Compared to 122 with a coupled antiferromagnetic order ( TN ) and orthorhombic structural transition ( To ) at ~ 132 K , 1.3 % Mo-doped 122 ( x = 0.013 ) gives TN = To = 125 ( 1 ) K according to neutron diffraction results and features in specific heat , magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity .	We investigate the thermodynamic and transport properties of molybdenum-doped BaFe2As2 ( 122 ) crystals , the first report of hole doping using a 4d element .	The chemical substitution of Mo in place of Fe is possible up to ~ 7 % .	For Ba ( Fe1-xMox ) 2As2 , the suppression rate of the magnetic transition temperature with x is the same as in 3d Cr-doped 122 and is independent of the unit cell changes .	This illustrates that temperature-composition phase diagram for hole-doped 122 can be simply parameterized by x , similar to the electron-doped 122 systems found in literature .
0	A total of 235 Active Galactic Nuclei ( AGN ) from two different soft X-ray surveys ( the ROSAT Deep Survey -DRS- and the ROSAT International X-ray Optical Survey -RIXOS- ) with redshifts between 0 and 3.5 are used to study the clustering of X-ray selected AGN and its evolution .	A 2 sigma significant detection of clustering of such objects is found on scales & lt ; 40-80/h Mpc in the RIXOS sample , while no clustering is detected on any scales in the DRS sample .	Assuming a single power law model for the spatial correlation function ( SCF ) , quantitative limits on the AGN clustering have been obtained : a comoving correlation length 1.5 & lt ; ~ r_0 & lt ; ~ 3.3/h Mpc is implied for comoving evolution , while 1.9 & lt ; ~ r_0 & lt ; ~ 4.8 for stable clustering and 2.2 & lt ; ~ r_0 & lt ; ~ 5.5 for linear evolution .	These values are consistent with the correlation lengths and evolutions obtained for galaxy samples , but imply smaller amplitude or faster evolution than recent UV and optically selected AGN samples .	We also constrain the ratio of bias parameters between X-ray selected AGN and IRAS galaxies to be & lt ; ~1.7 on scales & lt ; ~ 10/h Mpc , a significantly smaller value than is inferred from local large-scale dynamical studies .
4	Extensive tests were carried out by re-observing with the same instrument a large number of standard stars taken from a variety of sources in the literature .	Context : Their high intrinsic brightness and small dispersion in absolute magnitude make red clump ( RC ) stars a prime tracer of Galactic structure and kinematics .	Aims : We aim to derive accurate , multi-epoch radial velocities and atmospheric parameters ( Teff , log g , [ M/H ] , Vrot sin i ) of a large sample of carefully selected RC stars , fainter than those present in other spectroscopic surveys and located over a great circle at high Galactic latitudes .	Methods : We acquired data of the program stars of high signal-to-noise ratio ( S/N ) and high resolution with the Asiago Echelle spectrograph .	Radial velocities were obtained by applying cross-correlation and atmospheric parameters via chi2 fit to a synthetic spectral library .
3	The resulting Hamiltonian contains several interface terms that have not been included in previous work on nanostructures in a magnetic field .	A multi-band effective-mass Hamiltonian is derived for lattice-matched semiconductor nanostructures in a slowly varying external magnetic field .	The theory is derived from the first-principles magnetic-field coupling Hamiltonian of Pickard and Mauri , which is applicable to nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotentials in the local density approximation to density functional theory .	The pseudopotential of the nanostructure is treated as a perturbation of a bulk reference crystal , with linear and quadratic response terms included in k.p perturbation theory .	The derivation provides the first direct analytical expressions showing how the coupling of the nonlocal potential to the magnetic field influences the effective magnetic dipole moment of the electron .
2	The morphology of the diffuse emission strongly resembles that of a pulsar wind nebula ( PWN ) and extends asymmetrically to the South-West of a point-source presented as a potential pulsar .	We present a Chandra X-ray observation of the very high energy $ \gamma $ -ray source HESS $ $ J1640-465 .	We identify a point source surrounded by a diffuse emission that fills the extended object previously detected by XMM Newton at the centroid of the HESS source , within the shell of the radio supernova remnant ( SNR ) G338.3-0.0 .	The spectrum of the putative pulsar and compact nebula are well-characterized by an absorbed power-law model which , for a reasonable $ N_ { \rm H } $ value of $ 14\times 10^ { 22 } \rm cm^ { -2 } $ , exhibit an index of 1.1 and 2.5 respectively , typical of Vela-like PWNe .	We demonstrate that , given the H $ $ I absorption features observed along the line of sight , the SNR and the H $ $ II surrounding region are probably connected and lie between 8 kpc and 13 kpc .
2	We extracted a wide slit along the jet axis and 12 thin slits across its axis to investigate the longitudinal motion and transverse rotation .	{ We report our observations of a swirling flare-related EUV jet on 2011 October 15 . }	{ We utilised the EUV observations from SDO/AIA .	We also used data from STEREO/EUVI to investigate the 3D structure of the jet .	Gound-based H $ \alpha $ images provide a good opportunity to explore the relationship between the cool surge and hot jet .
1	In this paper , we describe a new algorithm , named improved fixed rank approximation algorithm ( IFRAA ) , for missing values estimations of the large gene expression data matrices .	Gene expression data matrices often contain missing expression values .	We compare the present algorithm with the two existing and widely used methods for reconstructing missing entries for DNA microarray gene expression data : the Bayesian principal component analysis ( BPCA ) and the local least squares imputation method ( LLS ) .	The three algorithms were applied to four microarray data sets and two synthetic low-rank data matrices .	Certain percentages of the elements of these data sets were randomly deleted , and the three algorithms were used to recover them .
0	Let $ G $ be a connected reductive group , with connected center , and $ X $ a smooth complete curve , both defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero .	Let $ \operatorname { Bun } _G $ denote the stack of $ G $ -bundles on $ X $ .	In analogy with the classical theory of Whittaker coefficients for automorphic functions , we construct a `` Fourier transform '' functor , called $ \mathsf { coeff } _ { G , \mathsf { ext } } $ , from the DG category of $ \mathfrak { D } $ -modules on $ \operatorname { Bun } _G $ to a certain DG category $ \mathcal { W } h ( G , \mathsf { ext } ) $ , called the \emph { extended Whittaker category } .	Combined with work in progress by other mathematicians and the author , this construction allows to formulate the compatibility of the Langlands duality functor $ \mathbb { L } _G : \operatorname { IndCoh } _ { \mathcal N } ( \operatorname { LocSys } _ { \check { G } } ) \to \mathfrak { D } ( \operatorname { Bun } _G ) $ with the Whittaker model .	For $ G=GL_n $ and $ G=PGL_n $ , we prove that $ \mathsf { coeff } _ { G , \mathsf { ext } } $ is fully faithful .
3	A new bi-level optimization approach is presented .	Many theoretical and experimental studies have used heuristic methods to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the passive coupling of adjacent structures .	However , few papers have used optimization techniques with guaranteed convergence in order to increase the efficiency of the passive coupling of adjacent structures .	In this paper , the combined problem of optimal arrangement and mechanical properties of dampers placed between two adjacent buildings is considered .	The outer-loop of the approach optimizes damper configuration and is solved using the `` inserting dampers '' method , which was recently shown to be a very effective heuristic method .
1	Here , we exploit this to estimate and compare root-mean-square velocities for a large sample of nuclear star clusters and their host ( late- or early-type ) galaxies .	In a virialized stellar system , the mean-square velocity is a direct tracer of the energy per unit mass of the system .	Traditional observables , such as the radial surface brightness and second-order velocity moment profiles , are subject to short-term variations due to individual episodes of matter infall and/or star formation .	The total mass , energy and angular momentum , on the other hand , are approximately conserved .	Thus , the total energy and angular momentum more directly probe the formation of galaxies and their nuclear star clusters , by offering access to more fundamental properties of the nuclear cluster-galaxy system than traditional observables .
4	It is the quadratic interaction which gives rise to a temperature-dependent broadening of the zero-phonon line , being here calculated for the first time in a consistent scheme .	A microscopic theory of optical transitions in quantum dots with carrier-phonon interaction is developed .	Virtual transitions into higher confined states with acoustic phonon assistance add a quadratic phonon coupling to the standard linear one , thus extending the independent Boson model .	Summing infinitely many diagrams in the cumulant , a numerically exact solution for the interband polarization is found .	Its full time dependence and the absorption lineshape of the quantum dot are calculated .
3	The instability appears with an Elsasser number above unity , and saturates with an azimuthal mode number $ m $ which increases with the Elsasser number .	We report on observations of a free-Shercliff-layer instability in a Taylor-Couette experiment using a liquid metal over a wide range of Reynolds numbers , $ Re\sim 10^3-10^6 $ .	The free Shercliff layer is formed by imposing a sufficiently strong axial magnetic field across a pair of differentially rotating axial endcap rings .	This layer is destabilized by a hydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz-type instability , characterized by velocity fluctuations in the $ r-\theta $ plane .	Measurements of the structure agree well with 2D global linear mode analyses and 3D global nonlinear simulations .
1	We also consider a metric defined on this nonstandard vector space .	In this paper , we introduce the nonstandard vector space in which the concept of additive inverse element will not be taken into account .	Under these settings , the conventional intuitive properties for the open and closed balls will not hold true .	Therefore , four kinds of open and closed sets are proposed .	Furthermore , the topologies generated by these different concepts of open and closed sets are investigated .
1	Such covariance matrices are frequently occurring in the problems of optimal filtering , extrapolation and interpolation of MRP and Markov Random Fields ( MRF ) .	The article discusses the matrices of the three forms whose inversions are : tridiagonal matrix , banded matrix or block-tridiagonal matrix and their relationships with the covariance matrices of measurements of ordinary ( simple ) Markov Random Processes ( MRP ) , multiconnected MRP and vector MRP respectively .	It is shown , that the structure of these three forms of matrices has the same form , but the matrix elements in the first case are scalar quantities ; in the second case matrix elements representing a product of vectors of dimension m ; and in the third case , the off-diagonal elements are the product of matrices and vectors of dimension m. The properties of such matrices were investigated and a simple formulas of their inversion was founded .	Also computational efficiency in the storage and inverse of such matrices have been considered .	To illustrate the acquired results an example of the covariance matrix inversions of two-dimensional MRP is given .
1	McLerran-Venugopolan ( MV ) model and iterative solution of DGLAP equation in the double leading log approximation for small x gluon distribution function were used to derive the new formula for initial chromofield energy density .	This article generalizes Schwinger 's mechanism for particles production in the arbitrary finite field volume .	This initial chromofield energy is distributed among color neutral clusters or strings of different length .	This strings are stretched by receding nucleus .	From the proposed mechanism of string fragmentation or color field decay based on exact solution of Dirac equation in the different finite volume , the new formulae for esimated baryon kinetic energy loss and rapidity spectrum of produced partons were derived .
3	By contrast , CHONS clusters ( beta=1.4 , T=19 K ) combine nicely with magnesium silicate ( beta=2 , T=18.7 K ) to give a spectrum which falls well within the observational error bars ( total emission cross-section at 250 mum : 8.6 10^ { -26 } cm^ { 2 } per H atom ) .	This work purports to model the far infrared gray-body emission in the spectra of high-Galactic-latitude clouds .	Several carbonaceous laboratory materials are tested for their fitness as carriers of this modified-black-body emission which , according to data delivered by the Planck satellite , and others before , is best fit with temperature 17.9 K and spectral index beta=1.78 .	Some of these materials were discarded for insufficient emissivity , others for inadequate beta .	Only 15 % of all Galactic carbon atoms are needed for this purpose .
3	We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types , and apply them to a variety of real-world networks , showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks .	We study assortative mixing in networks , the tendency for vertices in networks to be connected to other vertices that are like ( or unlike ) them in some way .	We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics such as language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics such as age .	As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree , i.e. , according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices : do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people ?	We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks , both analytic ones based on generating function methods , and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques .
3	The infrared exponent of the ghost propagator at 0.4GeV region is \alpha_G=0.20 but there is an exceptional Gribov copy with \alpha_G=0.27 .	We performed lattice Landau gauge QCD simulation on \beta=6.0 , 16^4 , 24^4 , 32^4 and \beta=6.4 , 32^4 , 48^4 and 56^4 by adopting the gauge fixing that minimizes the norm of the gauge field , and measured the running coupling by using the gluon propagator and the ghost propagator .	In view of ambiguity in the vertex renormalization factor \tilde Z_1 in the lattice , we adjust the normalization of the running coupling by the perturbative QCD results near the highest momentum point .	It has a maximum \alpha_s ( q ) ~ 2.1 ( 3 ) at around q=0.5 GeV and decreases as q approaches 0 , and the Kugo-Ojima parameter reached -0.83 ( 2 ) .	The features of the exceptional Gribov copy are investigated by measuring four one-dimensional Fourier transform ( 1-d FT ) of the gluon propagator transverse to each lattice axis .
0	We have detected substructure within the smooth scattering disk of the celebrated Galactic Center radio source Sagittarius A* ( SgrA* ) .	We observed this structure at 1.3 cm wavelength with the Very Long Baseline Array together with the Green Bank Telescope , on baselines of up to 3000 km , long enough to completely resolve the average scattering disk .	Such structure is predicted theoretically , as a consequence of refraction by large-scale plasma fluctuations in the interstellar medium .	Along with the much-studied $ \theta_\mathrm { d } \propto \lambda^2 $ scaling of angular broadening $ \theta_\mathrm { d } $ with observing wavelength $ \lambda $ , our observations indicate that the spectrum of interstellar turbulence is shallow , with an inner scale larger than 300 km .	The substructure is consistent with an intrinsic size of about 1 mas at 1.3 cm wavelength , as inferred from deconvolution of the average scattering .
0	We introduce an explicit solution for the non-equilibrium steady state ( NESS ) of a ring that is coupled to a thermal bath , and is driven by an external hot source with log-wide distribution of couplings .	Having time scales that stretch over several decades is similar to glassy systems .	Consequently there is a wide range of driving intensities where the NESS is like that of a random walker in a biased Brownian landscape .	We investigate the resulting statistics of the induced current $ I $ .	For a single ring we discuss how $ sign ( I ) $ fluctuates as the intensity of the driving is increased , while for an ensemble of rings we highlight the fingerprints of Sinai physics on the $ abs ( I ) $ distribution .
3	We develop a method to quantify two important aspects of the size of the word niche : the range of individuals using the word and the range of topics it is used to discuss .	Patterns of word use both reflect and influence a myriad of human activities and interactions .	Like other entities that are reproduced and evolve , words rise or decline depending upon a complex interplay between { their intrinsic properties and the environments in which they function } .	Using Internet discussion communities as model systems , we define the concept of a word niche as the relationship between the word and the characteristic features of the environments in which it is used .	Controlling for word frequency , we show that these aspects of the word niche are strong determinants of changes in word frequency .
3	A band inversion can occur at a single point $ \Gamma $ with considerably large inversion strength , in addition to the opening of a bulk band gap throughout the Brillouin zone .	We present first-principles calculations to predict several three dimensional ( 3D ) topological insulators in quaternary chalcogenide compounds which are made of I $ _2 $ -II-IV-VI $ _4 $ compositions and in ternary compositions of I $ _3 $ -V-VI $ _4 $ famatinite compounds .	Among the large members of these two families , we give examples of naturally occurring compounds which are mainly Cu-based chalcogenides .	We show that these materials are candidates of 3D topological insulators or can be tuned to obtain topological phase transition by manipulating the atomic number of the other cation and anion elements .	We also demonstrate that both of these families are related to each other by cross-substitutions of cations in the underlying tetragonal structure and that one can suitably tune their topological properties in a desired manner .
4	On the other hand , we provide examples of an accumulation in the case of an irrational ratio between 2 speeds and in the case of an irrational ratio between two distances in the initial configuration .	In the context of abstract geometrical computation , computing with colored line segments , we study the possibility of having an accumulation with small signal machines , ie , signal machines having only a very limited number of distinct speeds .	The cases of 2 and 4 speeds are trivial : we provide a proof that no machine can produce an accumulation in the case of 2 speeds and exhibit an accumulation with 4 speeds .	The main result is the twofold case of 3 speeds .	On the one hand , we prove that accumulations can not happen when all ratios between speeds and all ratios between initial distances are rational .
4	We also study carefully the modifications of the resultswhen a regularization is introduced in the potential at small scales.We check and illustrate all the results with the exact integration ofthe equations of motion .	We present a rigorous study of the classical scattering for anytwo-body inter-particle potential of the form $ v ( r ) =g/r^\gamma $ , with $ \gamma\textgreater { } 0 $ , for repulsive ( $ g\textgreater { } 0 $ ) and attractive ( $ g\textless { } 0 $ ) interactions .	We give a derivation of the complete power series of thedeflection angle in terms of the impact factor for the weak scatteringregime ( large impact factors ) as well as the asymptotic expressionsfor the hard scattering regime ( small impact factors ) .	We see a verydifferent qualitative and quantitative behavior depending whether theinteraction is repulsive or attractive .	In the latter case , thefamilies of trajectories depend also strongly on the value of $ \gamma $ .
2	However , this task is challenging due to the complexity in exploring all the possible pathways and the high computational cost in accurately modeling a large number of reactions .	A variety of natural phenomena comprises a huge number of competing reactions and short-lived intermediates .	Any study of such processes requires the discovery and accurate modeling of their underlying reaction network .	Fortunately , very often these processes are dominated by only a limited subset of the network 's reaction pathways .	In this work we propose a novel computationally inexpensive method to identify and select the key pathways of complex reaction networks , so that high-level ab-initio calculations can be more efficiently targeted at these critical reactions .
3	The key to this new approach is the identification of an unobservable auxiliary variable associated with observable data and unknown parameter , and the prediction of this auxiliary variable with a random set before conditioning on data .	Posterior probabilistic statistical inference without priors is an important but so far elusive goal .	Fisher 's fiducial inference , Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions , and Bayesian inference with default priors are attempts to achieve this goal but , to date , none has given a completely satisfactory picture .	This paper presents a new framework for probabilistic inference , based on inferential models ( IMs ) , which not only provides data-dependent probabilistic measures of uncertainty about the unknown parameter , but does so with an automatic long-run frequency calibration property .	Here we present a three-step IM construction , and prove a frequency-calibration property of the IM 's belief function under mild conditions .
2	We also provide a definitive compilation of the various PMS model sets .	We examine the performance of standard PMS stellar evolution models against the accurately measured properties of a benchmark sample of 26 PMS stars in 13 EB systems .	We provide a definitive compilation of all fundamental properties for the EBs .	In the H-R diagram , the masses inferred for the individual stars by the models are accurate to better than 10 % above 1 Msun , but below 1 Msun they are discrepant by 50-100 % .	We find evidence that the failure of the models to match the data is linked to the triples in the EB sample ; at least half of the EBs possess tertiary companions .
1	For equations with periodic coefficients , the lower bound for the periods of `` oscillatory '' solutions is obtained .	Estimates for the spectrum of the Cauchy operator and logarithms of solutions of non-autonomous differential equations in the space , expressed in an arbitrary matrix norm , are found .	Similar results are derived for a nonlinear periodic equation with zero equilibrium position ; in the autonomous case , they are valid for any periodic solution .	All the estimates are attained at a scalar equation and , thereby , are accurate for any norm .	The estimates are extended to equations with derivatives of any order .
4	The formalism can systematically investigate the effect of closed paths , especially generalized clustering coefficient $ C_ { ( p ) } $ introduced in \cite { Toyota4 } , on six degrees of separation .	The phenomenon of six degrees of separation is an old but attractive subject .	The deep understanding has been uncovered yet , especially how closed paths included in a network affect six degrees of separation are an important subject left yet .	For it , some researches have been made\cite { Newm21 } , \cite { Aoyama } .	Recently we have develop a formalism \cite { Toyota3 } , \cite { Toyota4 } to explore the subject based on the string formalism developed by Aoyama\cite { Aoyama } .
0	Impulsive radio-frequency signals from astronomical sources are dispersed by the frequency dependent index of refraction of the interstellar media and so appear as chirped signals when they reach earth .	Searches for dispersed impulses have been limited by false detections due to radio frequency interference ( RFI ) and , in some cases , artifacts of the instrumentation .	Many authors have discussed techniques to excise or mitigate RFI in searches for fast transients , but comparisons between different approaches are lacking .	This work develops RFI mitigation techniques for use in searches for dispersed pulses , employing data recorded in a `` Fly 's Eye '' mode of the Allen Telescope Array as a test case .	We gauge the performance of several RFI mitigation techniques by adding dispersed signals to data containing RFI and comparing false alarm rates at the observed signal-to-noise ratios of the added signals .
4	For our optimal fit , the pole mass and width are found to be : $ M_X=3871.2\pm0.7 $ MeV and $ \Gamma_X=6.5\pm1.2 $ MeV .	We study the property of the $ X ( 3872 ) $ meson by analyzing the $ B\to K D\bar D^* $ and $ B\to K J/\psi \pi^+\pi^- $ decay processes .	The competition between the rescattering mediated through a Breit-Wigner resonance and the rescattering generated from a local $ D\bar { D } ^* \to D\bar { D } ^* $ interaction is carefully studied through an effective lagrangian approach .	Three different fits are performed : pure Breit-Wigner case , pure $ D\bar { D } ^* $ molecule case with only local rescattering vertices ( generated by the loop chain ) , and the mixed case .	It is found that data supports the picture where X ( 3872 ) is mainly a ( $ \bar cc $ ) Breit-Wigner resonance with a small contribution to the self-energy generated by $ \bar DD^* $ final state interaction .
4	We focus on $ s $ -wave-interacting fermions in quasi-one and two-dimensional geometries .	Ramsey spectroscopy has become a powerful technique for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of internal ( pseudospin ) degrees of freedom of interacting systems .	In many theoretical treatments , the key to understanding the dynamics has been to assume the external ( motional ) degrees of freedom are decoupled from the pseudospin degrees of freedom .	Determining the validity of this approximation -- known as the spin model approximation -- is complicated , and has not been addressed in detail .	Here we shed light in this direction by calculating Ramsey dynamics exactly for two interacting spin-1/2 particles in a harmonic trap .
1	The study is based on a Hamiltonian approach .	Bifurcations of solitary waves propagating along the interface between two ideal fluids are considered .	It concentrates on values of the density ratio close to a critical one , where the supercritical bifurcation changes to the subcritical one .	As the solitary wave velocity approaches the minimum phase velocity of linear interfacial waves ( the bifurcation point ) , the solitary wave solutions transform into envelope solitons .	In order to describe their behavior and bifurcations , a generalized nonlinear Schr\ '' { o } dinger equation describing the behavior of solitons and their bifurcations is derived .
2	Some rules help to choose the most likely hypothesis .	Belief function theory provides a flexible way to combine information provided by different sources .	This combination is usually followed by a decision making which can be handled by a range of decision rules .	Others allow that a decision is made on a set of hypotheses .	In [ 6 ] , we proposed a decision rule based on a distance measure .
1	Here we provide an investigation which type of superstatistics is most suitable to properly describe share price dynamics on various time scales .	Share price returns on different time scales can be well modelled by a superstatistical dynamics .	It is shown that while chi-square superstatistics works well on a time scale of days , on a much smaller time scale of minutes the price changes are better described by lognormal superstatistics .	The system dynamics thus exhibits a transition from lognormal to chi-square superstatistics as a function of time scale .	We discuss a more general model interpolating between both statistics which fits the observed data very well .
3	( b ) $ n\geq 3 $ and $ \kappa ( X ) \geq 0 $ .	In our previous papers , we investigated a lower bound for the second sectional geometric genus $ g_ { 2 } ( X , L ) $ of $ n $ -dimensional polarized manifolds $ ( X , L ) $ and by using these , we studied the dimension of global sections of $ K_ { X } +tL $ with $ t\geq 2 $ .	In this paper , we consider the case where $ ( X , L ) $ is a quasi-polarized manifold .	First we will prove $ g_ { 2 } ( X , L ) \geq h^ { 1 } ( \mathcal { O } _ { X } ) $ for the following cases : ( a ) $ n=3 $ , $ \kappa ( X ) =-\infty $ and $ \kappa ( K_ { X } +L ) \geq 0 $ .	Moreover , by using this inequality , we will study $ h^ { 0 } ( K_ { X } +tL ) $ for the case where $ ( X , L ) $ is a quasi-polarized 3-fold .
1	We find that the magnetic edge states of the Dirac fermions , formed along the boundary between the two domains , have features strongly dependent on whether $ B_0 $ is parallel or antiparallel to $ B_1 $ .	We theoretically study electronic properties of a graphene sheet on xy plane in a spatially nonuniform magnetic field , $ B = B_0 \hat { z } $ in one domain and $ B = B_1 \hat { z } $ in the other domain , in the quantum Hall regime and in the low-energy limit .	In the parallel case , when the Zeeman spin splitting can be ignored , the magnetic edge states originating from the $ n=0 $ Landau levels of the two domains have dispersionless energy levels , contrary to those from the $ n \ne 0 $ levels .	Here , $ n $ is the graphene Landau-level index .	They become dispersive as the Zeeman splitting becomes finite or as an electrostatic step potential is additionally applied .
1	As result we connected the dynamics of astronomical objects at great scale with the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ( $ \Lambda $ FRW ) model .	We deducted the Hubble law and the age of the Universe , through the introduction of the Inverse Yukawa Field ( IYF ) , as a non-local additive complement of the Newtonian gravitation ( Modified Newtonian Dynamics ) .	From the corresponding formalism , the Hubble law can be expressed as v = ( 4 $ \pi $ [ G ] /c ) r , which was derivated by evaluating the IYF force at distances much greater than 50Mpc , giving a maximum value for the expansion rate of the universe of $ H_0=86,31 $ , consistent with the observational data of 392 astronomical objects from NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database ( NED ) .	This additional field ( IYF ) provides a simple interpretation of dark energy as the action a large scale of baryonic matter .	Additionally , we calculated the age of the universe as 11Gyr , in agreement with recent measurements of the age of the white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .
1	In the canonical ensemble , the post-collapse evolution is marked by the formation of a Dirac peak with increasing mass .	We address the post-collapse dynamics of a self-gravitating gas of Brownian particles in D dimensions , in both canonical and microcanonical ensembles .	The density profile outside the peak evolves self-similarly with decreasing central density and increasing core radius .	In the microcanonical ensemble , the post-collapse regime is marked by the formation of a `` binary '' -like structure surrounded by an almost uniform halo with high temperature .	These results are consistent with thermodynamical predictions .
4	The concept of rejection with contextual information is implemented by modeling the classification problem as an energy minimization problem over a graph representing local and multiscale similarities of the image .	We introduce a new supervised algorithm for image classification with rejection using multiscale contextual information .	Rejection is desired in image-classification applications that require a robust classifier but not the classification of the entire image .	The proposed algorithm combines local and multiscale contextual information with rejection , improving the classification performance .	As a probabilistic model for classification , we adopt a multinomial logistic regression .
4	The equations of motion of configuration interaction coefficients and molecular orbitals for general MCSCF ansatz have recently been derived .	In parallel with the evolution of femtosecond and attosecond laser as well as free-electron laser technology , a variety of theoretical methods have been developed to describe the behavior of atoms , molecules , clusters , and solids under the action of those laser pulses .	Here we review major ab initio wave-function-based numerical approaches to simulate multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules driven by intense long-wavelength and/or ultrashort short-wavelength laser pulses .	Direct solution of the time-dependent Schr\ '' odinger equation ( TDSE ) , though its applicability is limited to He , $ { \rm H } _2 $ , and Li , can provide an exact description and has been greatly contributing to the understanding of dynamical electron-electron correlation .	Multiconfiguration self-consistent-field ( MCSCF ) approach offers a flexible framework from which a variety of methods can be derived to treat both atoms and molecules , with possibility to systematically control the accuracy .
1	The model provides sufficiently e-folds to solve the flatness/horizon problem and the density fluctuations agree with experimental values .	I study a fresh inflationary model with an increasing F-cosmological parameter .	The temperature increases during fresh inflation and reach its maximum value when inflation ends .	I find that entropy perturbations always remain below $ 10^ { -4 } $ during fresh inflation and become negligible when fresh inflation ends .	Hence , the adiabatic fluctuations dominate the primordial spectrum at the end of fresh inflation .
1	The two principal improvements are ( 1 ) developing a model for the density and velocity structure of a disk wind that fills the bipolar outflow cavities ; and ( 2 ) solving for the radially varying accretion rate in the disk due to a supply of mass and angular momentum from the infall envelope and their loss to the disk wind .	( Abridged ) We present radiation transfer simulations of a massive ( 8 Msun ) protostar forming from a massive ( Mc=60 Msun ) protostellar core , extending the model developed by Zhang & amp ; Tan ( 2011 ) .	One consequence of the launching of the disk wind is a reduction in the amount of accretion power that is radiated by the disk .	For the transition from dusty to dust-free conditions where gas opacities dominate , we now implement a gradual change as a more realistic approximation of dust destruction .	We study how the above effects , especially the outflow , influence the SEDs and the images of the protostar .
4	However , in case of BL Lacs our model parameters are not entirely in agreement with the results from studies at radio wavelengths indicating systematical uncertainties whereas our estimate for the FSRQ contribution seems to be consistent .	We present a model for estimating the blazar contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background ( EGRB ) in the EGRET energy range .	It is based on inverse-Compton scattering as the dominant gamma-ray production process in the jets of flat spectrum radio quasars ( FSRQs ) and BL Lac objects , and on the unification scheme of radio-loud AGN .	Depending on the evolutionary behaviour of radio-loud AGN , our estimate for the point source contribution to the extragalactic background emission ranges from about ~20 % -40 % for a redshift drop off at Z_ { max } =3 to around ~35 % -85 % for a cutoff at Z_ { max } =5 .	Roughly 70 % -90 % of the AGN contribution to the EGRB would be due to BL~Lacs/FR I objects .
0	In a graphene Landau level ( LL ) , strong Coulomb interactions and the fourfold spin/valley degeneracy lead to an approximate SU ( 4 ) isospin symmetry .	At partial filling , exchange interactions can spontaneously break this symmetry , manifesting as additional integer quantum Hall plateaus outside the normal sequence .	Here we report the observation of a large number of these quantum Hall isospin ferromagnetic ( QHIFM ) states , which we classify according to their real spin structure using temperature-dependent tilted field magnetotransport .	The large measured activation gaps confirm the Coulomb origin of the broken symmetry states , but the order is strongly dependent on LL index .	In the high energy LLs , the Zeeman effect is the dominant aligning field , leading to real spin ferromagnets with Skyrmionic excitations at half filling , whereas in the `relativistic ' zero energy LL , lattice scale anisotropies drive the system to a spin unpolarized state , likely a charge- or spin-density wave .
4	This requires some caution ( use of `` positive formulas '' , iteration replacing inversion , stable submodules replacing finite-rank families for instance ) .	We describe the problem of Sweedler 's duals for bialgebras as essentially characterizing the domain of the transpose of the multiplication .	This domain is the set of what could be called `` representative linear forms '' which are the elements of the algebraic dual which are also representative on the multiplicative semigroup of the algebra .	When the algebra is free , this notion is indeed equivalent to that of rational functions of automata theory .	For the sake of applications , the range of coefficients has been considerably broadened , i.e.extended to semirings , so that the results could be specialized to the boolean and multiplicity cases .
0	By numerical and analytical methods , we study in detail the effects of the Lifshitz dynamical exponent $ z $ on the vector condensate induced by an applied magnetic field in the probe limit .	Concretely , in the presence of the magnetic field , we obtain the Landau level independent of $ z $ , and also find the critical value by coupling a Maxwell complex vector field and SU ( 2 ) field into a ( 3+1 ) -dimensional Lifshitz black hole , respectively .	The research results show that for both two models with the lowest Landau level , the increasing $ z $ improves the response of the critical temperature to the applied magnetic field even without the charge density , and the analytical results uphold the numerical results .	In addition , we find even in the Lifshitz black hole , the Maxwell complex vector model is still a generalization of the SU ( 2 ) Yang-Mills model .	Furthermore , we construct the square vortex lattice and discuss the implications of these results .
1	We find that the spectral density obtained using reduced density matrix functional theory is in good agreement with experiments both undoped as well as doped NiO .	The insulator to metal phase transition in NiO is studied within the framework of reduced density matrix functional theory and density functional theory .	We find that the physical description of the hole-doping induced phase transition \emph { qualitatively differs } depending on whether NiO is calculated within density functional theory or reduced density matrix functional .	In the former case the underlying mechanism of the phase transition is identified to be a rigid shift of chemical potential , while in the latter case a redistribution of the spectral weight drives the transition .	These latter results are found to be in good agreement with both experiments and previous many-body calculations .
3	These strengths are comparable to those seen in simulations of ideal MHD disk turbulence .	We investigate the strength of axisymmetric local pressure maxima ( zonal flows ) in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks , where ambipolar diffusion reduces turbulent stresses driven by the magnetorotational instability .	Using local numerical simulations we show that in the absence of net vertical magnetic fields , the strength of turbulence in the ambipolar dominated region of the disk is low and any zonal flows that are present are weak .	For net fields strong enough to yield observed protostellar accretion rates , however , zonal flows with a density amplitude of 10-20 % are formed .	We investigate whether these zonal flows are able to reverse the inward radial drift of solids , leading to prolonged and enhanced concentration as a prelude to planetesimal formation .
2	We employ these observations to both investigate the frequency and nature of the circumstellar disk population in the cluster .	We present near and mid-infrared photometry obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope of 300 known members of the IC348 cluster .	We merge this photometry with existing ground-based optical and near-infrared photometry in order to construct optical-infrared spectral energy distributions ( SEDs ) for all the cluster members and present a complete atlas of these SEDs .	The observations are sufficiently sensitive to enable the first detailed measurement of the disk frequency for very low mass stars at the peak of the stellar IMF .	Using measurements of infrared excess between 3.6 and 8 microns we find the total frequency of disk-bearing stars in the cluster to be 50 +/- 6 % .
3	In this paper we have carried out an investigation of a spatially well resolved coronal loop using the EIS onboard Hinode to measure the above mentioned physical quantities .	Coronal loops are fundamental building blocks of the solar active regions and the corona .	Therefore , a clear understanding of the physics of coronal loops will help us understand the physics of active region heating in particular and coronal heating in general .	This requires a precise measurement of physical quantities such as electron densities and filling factors , temperatures , and flows in coronal loops .	Based on this study we find that a nano-flare model could explain most of the observed characteristics of this loop .
3	We show that deformations which are marginal but not exactly marginal lead to a non-conformal solution with a logarithmically running coupling constant .	N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU ( n ) ( n & gt ; =3 ) is believed to have two exactly marginal deformations which break the supersymmetry to N=1 .	We discuss the construction of the string theory dual to these deformations , in the supergravity approximation , in a perturbation series around the AdS_5 * S^5 solution .	We construct explicitly the deformed solution at second order in the deformation .	Surprisingly , at third order in the deformation we find the same beta functions for the couplings in field theory and in supergravity , suggesting that the leading order beta functions ( or anomalous dimensions ) do not depend on the gauge coupling ( the coefficient is not renormalized ) .
1	A discrete-time channel model that takes into account the effect of filtering on the phase noise is developed .	A waveform channel is considered where the transmitted signal is corrupted by Wiener phase noise and additive white Gaussian noise .	The model is based on a multi-sample receiver , i.e. , an integrate-and-dump filter whose output is sampled at a rate higher than the signaling rate .	It is shown that , at high signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , the multi-sample receiver achieves a rate that grows logarithmically with the SNR if the number of samples per symbol ( oversampling factor ) grows with the cubic root of the SNR .	Moreover , the pre-log factor is at least 1/2 and can be achieved by amplitude modulation .
1	We present the first non-perturbative calculation of the entropic $ c $ -function ( $ C ( l ) $ ) of SU ( 3 ) gauge theory in lattice Monte Carlo simulation using the replica method .	We investigate the quantum entanglement entropy for the four-dimensional Euclidean SU ( 3 ) gauge theory .	For $ 0 \leqslant l \leqslant 0.7 $ ~fm , where $ l $ is the length of the subspace , the entropic $ c $ -function is almost constant , indicating conformally invariant dynamics .	The value of the constant agrees with that perturbatively obtained from free gluons , with 20 % discrepancy .	When $ l $ is close to the Hadronic scale , the entropic $ c $ -function decreases smoothly , and it is consistent with zero within error bars at $ l \gtrsim 0.9 $ fm .
3	It is shown that alternative , equally plausible , choices leads to the definition of a Parity operator that is conserved by the Weak Interactions .	The symmetry of Nature under a Space Inversion is described by a Parity operator .	Contrary to popular belief , the Parity operator is not unique .	The choice of the Parity operator requires several arbitrary decisions to be made .	The operator commonly known as CP is a more appropriate choice for a Parity operator .
0	We use the moduli space approximation to study the time evolution of magnetically charged configurations in a theory with an SU ( N+2 ) gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to U ( 1 ) x SU ( N ) x U ( 1 ) .	We focus on configurations containing two massive and N-1 massless monopoles .	The latter do not appear as distinct objects , but instead coalesce into a cloud of non-Abelian field .	We find that at large times the cloud and the massless particles are decoupled , with separately conserved energies .	The interaction between them occurs through a scattering process in which the cloud , acting very much like a thin shell , contracts and eventually bounces off the cores of the massive monopoles .
0	We present energy filtered electron emission spectromicroscopy with spatial and wave-vector resolution on few layer epitaxial graphene on SiC $ ( 000-1 ) grown by furnace annealing .	Low energy electron microscopy shows that more than 80 % of the sample is covered by 2-3 graphene layers .	C1s spectromicroscopy provides an independent measurement of the graphene thickness distribution map .	The work function , measured by photoelectron emission microscopy ( PEEM ) , varies across the surface from 4.34 to 4.50eV according to both the graphene thickness and the graphene-SiC interface chemical state .	At least two SiC surface chemical states ( i.e. , two different SiC surface structures ) are present at the graphene/SiC interface .
2	When the temperature and density at the center of the star pass a critical threshold , thermonuclear fusion begins .	A star forms when a cloud of dust and gas collapses .	It is generally believed that this collapse first produces a flattened rotating disk , through which matter is fed onto the embryonic star at the center of the disk .	The remaining disk , which can still contain up to 0.3 times the mass of the star , is then sculpted and eventually dissipated by the radiation and wind from the newborn star .	Unfortunately this picture of the structure and evolution of the disk remains speculative because of the lack of morphological data of sufficient resolution and uncertainties regarding the underlying physical processes .
2	The dominant mode of semiconvection in stars is layered semiconvection , where the layer height is an adjustable parameter analogous to the mixing length in convection .	Semiconvection - mixing that occurs in regions that are stable when considering compositional gradients , but unstable when ignoring them - is shown to have the greatest potential impact on main sequence stars with masses in the range 1.2 - 1.7 solar masses .	We present the first stellar evolution calculations using a prescription for semiconvection derived from extrapolation of direct numerical simulations of double-diffusive mixing down to stellar parameters .	The rate of mixing across the semiconvective region is sensitively dependent on the layer height .	We find that there is a critical layer height that separates weak semiconvective mixing ( where evolution is well-approximated by using the Ledoux criterion ) from strong semiconvective mixing ( where evolution is well-approximated by using the Schwarzschild criterion ) .
3	All the constants of the Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of bond energies that can be computed using first-principles calculations .	We derive an Ising Hamiltonian for kinetic simulations involving interstitial and vacancy defects in binary alloys .	Our model , which we term `ABVI ' , incorporates solute transport by both interstitial defects and vacancies into a mathematically-consistent framework , and thus represents a generalization to the widely-used ABV model for alloy evolution simulations .	The Hamiltonian captures the three possible interstitial configurations in a binary alloy : A-A , A-B , and B-B , which makes it particularly useful for irradiation damage simulations .	We implement our ABVI model in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and perform a verification exercise by comparing our results to published irradiation damage simulations in simple binary systems with Frenkel pair defect production and several microstructural scenarios , with matching agreement found .
2	Non-trivial examples of matter for which the result applies are a wave map and a massive charged scalar field interacting with an electromagnetic field .	This paper explores `` black hole '' solutions of various Einstein-wave matter systems admitting an isometry of their domain of outer communications taking every point to its future .	In the first two parts , it is shown that such solutions , assuming in addition that they are spherically symmetric and the matter has a certain structure , must be Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstrom .	The results thus generalize work of Bekenstein [ 1 ] and Heusler [ 12 ] from the static to the periodic case .	In the third part , which is independent of the first two , it is shown that Dirac fields preserved by an isometry of a spherically symmetric domain of outer communications of the type described above must vanish .
2	We show that the geometric phases are then identified with horizontal lifts of surfaces in an abelian gerbe with connection , rather than with horizontal lifts of curves in an abelian principal bundle .	We study the geometric phase phenomenon in the context of the adiabatic Floquet theory ( the so-called the $ ( t , t ' ) $ Floquet theory ) .	A double integration appears in the geometric phase formula because of the presence of two time variables within the theory .	This higher degree in the geometric phase gauge theory is related to the appearance of changes in the Floquet blocks at the transitions between two local charts of the parameter manifold .	We present the physical example of a kicked two-level system where these changes are involved via a Cheon 's anholonomy .
4	Our results demonstrate that high-resolution CO imaging-spectroscopy is useful to search for nuclear bars , even in highly inclined systems where isophoto fitting techniques are not applicable .	Aperture synthesis observations of CO ( J=1-0 ) emission and near-infrared broad-band photometry of the non-barred Seyfert galaxy NGC 5033 ( D = 18.7 Mpc ) were performed .	Our 3 '' .9 x 3 '' .6 resolution CO observations reveal a perturbed distribution and the kinematics of molecular gas in the center of NGC 5033 ; we find the characteristic gaseous features that are widely observed in barred spiral galaxies , such as two bright CO peaks near the center ( separated by ~ 3 '' or 270 pc from the nucleus ) , two offset ridges of CO emission emanating from the CO peaks , and a CO ring ( with a radius of ~ 14 '' or 1.3 kpc ) .	Double-peaked velocity profiles are also evident near the two CO peaks , implying that these CO peaks are orbit crowding zones in a barred/oval potential .	Although NIR data only give an upper limit of the possible bar lengths , due to a large inclination of the NGC 5033 disk ( i = 68 deg ) , our CO data clearly suggests the presence of a small ( the semi-major axis of about 12 '' - 15 '' or 1.1 - 1.4 kpc ) nuclear bar ( or oval structure ) in the center of the `` non-barred '' galaxy NGC 5033 .
0	We present a detailed study of the reduction to 4D of 5D supergravity compactified on the S^1/Z_2 orbifold .	For this purpose we develop and employ a recently proposed N=1 conformal superfield description of the 5D supergravity couplings to abelian vector and hypermultiplets .	In particular , we obtain a unique relation of the `` radion '' to chiral superfields as in global 5D SUSY and we can embed the universal hypermultiplet into this formalism .	In our approach , it is transparent how the superconformal structure of the effective 4D actions is inherited from the one of the original 5D supergravity .	We consider both ungauged and gauged 5D supergravities .
4	The relevant strain-induced changes in electronic properties arise from band structure modifications at the Fermi level as a consequence of a spin-polarized charge transfer between pi-orbitals of the N and Al edge atoms in a spin-resolved self-doping process .	We present a first-principles theoretical study of electric field-and strain-controlled intrinsic half-metallic properties of zigzagged aluminium nitride ( AlN ) nanoribbons .	We show that the half-metallic property of AlN ribbons can undergo a transition into fully-metallic or semiconducting behavior with application of an electric field or uniaxial strain .	An external transverse electric field induces a full charge screening that renders the material semiconducting .	In contrast , as uniaxial strain varies from compressive to tensile , a spin-resolved selective self-doping increases the half-metallic character of the ribbons .
0	Quantum field theory allows more general symmetries than groups and Lie algebras .	For instance quantum groups , that is Hopf algebras , have been familiar to theoretical physicists for a while now .	Nowdays many examples of symmetries of categorical flavor -- categorical groups , groupoids , Lie algebroids and their higher analogues -- appear in physically motivated constructions and faciliate constructions of geometrically sound models and quantization of field theories .	Here we consider two flavours of categorified symmetries : one coming from noncommutative algebraic geometry where varieties themselves are replaced by suitable categories of sheaves ; another in which the gauge groups are categorified to higher groupoids .	Together with their gauge groups , also the fiber bundles themselves become categorified , and their gluing ( or descent data ) is given by nonabelian cocycles , generalizing group cohomology , where infinity-groupoids appear in the role both of the domain and the coefficient object .
2	However , a careful analysis has shown that it entails no genuine contradictions for physics , and the paradigm of observer complementarity has been coined .	Black Holes are unique objects which allow for meaningful theoretical studies of strong gravity and even quantum gravity effects .	An infalling and a distant observer would have very different views on the structure of the world .	Recently this picture was put into doubt .	In particular , it was argued that in old Black Holes a firewall must form in order to protect the basic principles of quantum mechanics .
1	This paper discusses the need for an empirical lnterpretatlon of any theory of confidence factors applied to Knowledge Based Systems and describes an empirical lnterpretatlon of DS theory suggesting that the theory has been extensively misinterpreted .	The issue of confidence factors in Knowledge Based Systems has become increasingly important and Dempster-Shafer ( DS ) theory has become increasingly popular as a basis for these factors .	For the essentially syntactic DS theory , a model is developed based on sample spaces , the traditional semantic model of probability theory .	This model is used to show that , if belief functions are based on reasonably accurate sampling or observation of a sample space , then the beliefs and upper probabilities as computed according to DS theory can not be interpreted as frequency ratios .	Since many proposed applications of DS theory use belief functions in situations with statistically derived evidence ( Wesley [ 1 ] ) and seem to appeal to statistical intuition to provide an lnterpretatlon of the results as has Garvey [ 2 ] , it may be argued that DS theory has often been misapplied .

4	This will be done through some general considerations regarding determinantal processes given by a projection kernel .	We show that the distribution of ( a suitable rescaling of ) a single eigenvalue gap $ \lambda_ { i+1 } ( M_n ) -\lambda_i ( M_n ) $ of a random Wigner matrix ensemble in the bulk is asymptotically given by the Gaudin-Mehta distribution , if the Wigner ensemble obeys a finite moment condition and matches moments with the GUE ensemble to fourth order .	This is new even in the GUE case , as prior results establishing the Gaudin-Mehta law required either an averaging in the eigenvalue index parameter $ i $ , or fixing the energy level $ u $ instead of the eigenvalue index .	The extension from the GUE case to the Wigner case is a routine application of the Four Moment Theorem .	The main difficulty is to establish the approximate independence of the eigenvalue counting function $ N_ { ( -\infty , x ) } ( \tilde M_n ) $ ( where $ \tilde M_n $ is a suitably rescaled version of $ M_n $ ) with the event that there is no spectrum in an interval $ [ x , x+s ] $ , in the case of a GUE matrix .
4	We give various illustrations .	We consider equations of the form Bf=g , where B is a Galois connection between lattices of functions .	This includes the case where B is the Legendre-Fenchel transform , or more generally a Moreau conjugacy .	We characterise the existence and uniqueness of a solution f in terms of generalised subdifferentials .	This extends a theorem of Vorobyev and Zimmermann , relating solutions of max-plus linear equations and set coverings .
3	Quantum effects due to their different masses are observed both in the energetic and the structural properties .	We present diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of D $ _2 $ adsorbed inside a narrow carbon nanotube .	The 1D D $ _2 $ equation of state is reported , and the one-dimensional character of the adsorbed D $ _2 $ is analyzed .	The isotopic dependence of the constitutive properties of the quantum fluid are studied by comparing D $ _2 $ and H $ _2 $ .	The influence of the interatomic potential in one-dimensional systems is also studied by comparing the properties of D $ _2 $ and $ ^4 $ He which have nearly the same mass but a sizeably different potential .
4	Quantum machine learning can take time logarithmic in both the number of vectors and their dimension , an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms .	Machine-learning tasks frequently involve problems of manipulating and classifying large numbers of vectors in high-dimensional spaces .	Classical algorithms for solving such problems typically take time polynomial in the number of vectors and the dimension of the space .	Quantum computers are good at manipulating high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces .	This paper provides supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms for cluster assignment and cluster finding .
4	We find that it is relatively easier to accommodate the normal hierarchical mass pattern compared to the inverted hierarchical or quasi-degenerate case , when one-loop corrections are included .	In an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( popularly known as the $ \mu\nu $ SSM ) , three right handed neutrino superfields are introduced to solve the $ \mu $ -problem and to accommodate the non-vanishing neutrino masses and mixing .	Neutrino masses at the tree level are generated through $ R- $ parity violation and seesaw mechanism .	We have analyzed the full effect of one-loop contributions to the neutrino mass matrix .	We show that the current three flavour global neutrino data can be accommodated in the $ \mu\nu $ SSM , for both the tree level and one-loop corrected analyses .
1	The estimates give upper bounds for the probabilities $ \mathbb { P } ( N\geq M +r ) $ and $ \mathbb { P } ( N\leq M - r ) $ where $ M $ is either a median or the expectation of a subgraph count $ N $ .	Concentration inequalities for subgraph counts in random geometric graphs built over Poisson point processes are proved .	The bounds for the lower tail have a fast Gaussian decay and the bounds for the upper tail satisfy an optimality condition .	A special feature of the presented inequalities is that the underlying Poisson process does not need to have finite intensity measure .	The tail estimates for subgraph counts follow from concentration inequalities for more general local Poisson U-statistics .
0	We studied electron spectral indices of nonthermal emissions seen in hard X-rays ( HXRs ) and in microwaves .	We analyzed 12 flares observed by the Hard X-ray Telescope aboard { \it Yohkoh } , Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters ( NoRP ) , and the Nobeyama Radioheliograph ( NoRH ) , and compared the spectral indices derived from total fluxes of hard X-rays and microwaves .	Except for four events , which have very soft HXR spectra suffering from the thermal component , these flares show a gap $ \Delta\delta $ between the electron spectral indices derived from hard X-rays $ \delta_ { X } $ and those from microwaves $ \delta_ { \mu } $ ( $ \Delta\delta = \delta_ { X } - \delta_ { \mu } $ ) of about 1.6 .	Furthermore , from the start to the peak times of the HXR bursts , the time profiles of the HXR spectral index $ \delta_ { X } $ evolve synchronously with those of the microwave spectral index $ \delta_ { \mu } $ , keeping the constant gap .	We also examined the spatially resolved distribution of the microwave spectral index by using NoRH data .
0	Using the Parkes radio telescope , we have searched for pulsed radio emission from the recently discovered X-ray pulsars AX J1811.5-1926 and PSR J0537-6910 in the supernova remnants G11.2-0.3 and N157B , respectively .	We detected no significant pulsed radio emission from these pulsars and have set an upper limit of 0.07 mJy on the 1374 MHz flux from AX J1811.5-1926 and upper limits of 0.18 mJy and 0.06 mJy for the flux from PSR J0537-6910 at 660 MHz and 1374 MHz , respectively .	Assuming a power law radio spectral index of 2 , these flux limits correspond to luminosity limits at 400 MHz of 20 mJy kpc^2 for AX J1811.5-1926 and 1100 mJy kpc^2 for PSR J0537-6910 .	Our luminosity limit for AX J1811.5-1926 is lower than the observed luminosities of other young radio pulsars .	The upper limit on the luminosity for PSR J0537-6910 in N157B is not significantly constraining due to the large distance to the pulsar .
0	We prove that for all $ 0\leq t\leq k $ and $ d\geq 2k $ , every graph $ G $ with treewidth at most $ k $ has a `large ' induced subgraph $ H $ , where $ H $ has treewidth at most $ t $ and every vertex in $ H $ has degree at most $ d $ in $ G $ .	The order of $ H $ depends on $ t $ , $ k $ , $ d $ , and the order of $ G $ .	With $ t=k $ , we obtain large sets of bounded degree vertices .	With $ t=0 $ , we obtain large independent sets of bounded degree .	In both these cases , our bounds on the order of $ H $ are tight .
1	For any fixed $ H $ let $ \delta ( H , n ) $ be the minimum $ \delta $ such that any $ k $ -graph $ G $ on $ n $ vertices with minimum codegree $ \delta ( G ) \geq \delta $ contains a perfect $ H $ -packing .	Let $ G $ and $ H $ be $ k $ -graphs ( $ k $ -uniform hypergraphs ) ; then a perfect $ H $ -packing in $ G $ is a collection of vertex-disjoint copies of $ H $ in $ G $ which together cover every vertex of $ G $ .	The problem of determining $ \delta ( H , n ) $ has been widely studied for graphs ( i.e. $ 2 $ -graphs ) , but little is known for $ k \geq 3 $ .	Here we determine the asymptotic value of $ \delta ( H , n ) $ for all complete $ k $ -partite $ k $ -graphs $ H $ , as well as a wide class of other $ k $ -partite $ k $ -graphs .	In particular , these results provide an asymptotic solution to a question of R\ '' odl and Ruci\'nski on the value of $ \delta ( H , n ) $ when $ H $ is a loose cycle .
1	Just as electrons undergo Thomson scattering with photons , dark matter particles may experience an analogous form of momentum exchange with dark energy .	Low energy interactions between particles are often characterised by elastic scattering .	We investigate the influence such an interaction has on the formation of linear and nonlinear cosmic structure , by running for the first time a suite of N-body simulations with different dark energy equations of state and scattering cross sections .	In models where the linear matter power spectrum is suppressed by the scattering , we find that on nonlinear scales the power spectrum is strongly enhanced .	This is due to the friction term increasing the efficiency of gravitational collapse , which also leads to a scale-independent amplification of the concentration and mass functions of halos .
1	In this paper we present a systematic study of the relation between the structure of the QNM 's of the KG equation and the form of $ V ( x ) $ .	The dynamics of relativistic stars and black holes are often studied in terms of the quasinormal modes ( QNM 's ) of the Klein-Gordon ( KG ) equation with different effective potentials $ V ( x ) $ .	In particular , we determine the requirements on $ V ( x ) $ in order for the QNM 's to form complete sets , and discuss in what sense they form complete sets .	Among other implications , this study opens up the possibility of using QNM expansions to analyse the behavior of waves in relativistic systems , even for systems whose QNM 's do { \it not } form a complete set .	For such systems , we show that a complete set of QNM 's can often be obtained by introducing an infinitesimal change in the effective potential .
3	For double occupation per site , both the Mott insulating and superfluid phases are ferromagnetic and the transition is still continuous .	We study , using quantum Monte-Carlo simulations , the bosonic Kondo-Hubbard model in a two dimensional square lattice .	We explore the phase diagram and analyse the mobility of particles and magnetic properties .	At unit filling , the transition from a paramagnetic Mott insulator to a ferromagnetic superfluid appears continuous , contrary to what was predicted with mean field .	Multiband tight binding Hamiltonians can be realized in optical lattice experiments , which offer not only the possibility of tuning the different energy scales over wide ranges , but also the option of loading the system with either fermionic or bosonic atoms .
3	We use a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the relaxation of spins due to the motional $ v\times E $ field for UCN and for $ ^ { 3 } $ He atoms at temperatures below $ 600 , \mathrm { mK } $ .	We discuss the precession of spin-polarized Ultra Cold Neutrons ( UCN ) and $ ^ { 3 } $ He atoms in uniform and static magnetic and electric fields and calculate the spin relaxation effects from motional $ v\times E $ magnetic fields .	Particle motion in an electric field creates a motional $ v\times E $ magnetic field , which when combined with collisions , produces variations of the total magnetic field and results in spin relaxation of neutron and $ ^ { 3 } $ He samples .	The spin relaxation times $ T_ { 1 } $ ( longitudinal ) and $ T_ { 2 } $ ( transverse ) of spin-polarized UCN and $ ^ { 3 } $ He atoms are important considerations in a new search for the neutron Electric Dipole Moment at the SNS \emph { nEDM } experiment .	We find the relaxation times for the neutron due to the $ v\times E $ effect to be long compared to the neutron lifetime , while the $ ^ { 3 } $ He relaxation times may be important for the \emph { nEDM } experiment .
1	Currently , the most popular auction for sponsored search is the `` Generalized Second Price '' ( GSP ) auction in which advertisers are assigned to slots in the decreasing order of their `` score , '' which is defined as the product of their bid and click-through rate .	Sponsored search involves running an auction among advertisers who bid in order to have their ad shown next to search results for specific keywords .	In the past few years , there has been significant research on the game-theoretic issues that arise in an advertiser 's interaction with the mechanism as well as possible redesigns of the mechanism , but this ranking order has remained standard .	From a search engine 's perspective , the fundamental question is : what is the best assignment of advertisers to slots ?	Here `` best '' could mean `` maximizing user satisfaction , '' `` most efficient , '' `` revenue-maximizing , '' `` simplest to interact with , '' or a combination of these .
3	In particular , if a function $ f $ is coordinate-wise smooth with parameters $ L_1 , L_2 , \dots , L_n $ , we obtain an algorithm that converges in $ O ( \sum_i \sqrt { L_i } / \sqrt { \varepsilon } ) $ iterations for convex $ f $ and in $ \tilde { O } ( \sum_i \sqrt { L_i } / \sqrt { \sigma } ) $ iterations for $ \sigma $ -strongly convex $ f $ .	Accelerated coordinate descent methods are widely used in optimization and machine learning .	By taking cheap-to-compute coordinate gradients in each iteration , they are usually faster than accelerated full gradient descent , and thus suitable for large-scale optimization problems .	In this paper , we improve the running time of accelerated coordinate descent , using a clean and novel non-uniform sampling method .	The best known result was $ \tilde { O } ( \sqrt { n \sum_i L_i } / \sqrt { \varepsilon } ) $ for convex $ f $ and $ \tilde { O } ( \sqrt { n \sum_i L_i } / \sqrt { \sigma } ) $ for $ \sigma $ -strongly convex $ f $ , due to Lee and Sidford .
4	We believe non-thermal processes are operating , perhaps along with enhanced thermal emission .	We observed the energetic binary Cygnus X-3 in both quiescent and flaring states between 4 and 16 microns using the ISO satellite .	We find that the quiescent source shows the thermal free-free spectrum typical of a hot , fast stellar wind , such as from a massive helium star .	The quiescent mass-loss rate due to a spherically symmetric , non-accelerating wind is found to be in the range 0.4-2.9 x 10E-4 solar masses per year , consistent with other infrared and radio observations , but considerably larger than the 10E-5 solar masses per year deduced from both the orbital change and the X-ray column density .	There is rapid , large amplitude flaring at 4.5 and 11.5 microns at the same time as enhanced radio and X-ray activity , with the infrared spectrum apparently becoming flatter in the flaring state .
4	Theoretical properties for fixed as well as increasing dimensions are established , even when the number of variables increases faster than the sample size .	Variable selection for structured covariates lying on an underlying known graph is a problem motivated by practical applications , and has been a topic of increasing interest .	However , most of the existing methods may not be scalable to high dimensional settings involving tens of thousands of variables lying on known pathways such as the case in genomics studies .	We propose an adaptive Bayesian shrinkage approach which incorporates prior network information by smoothing the shrinkage parameters for connected variables in the graph , so that the corresponding coefficients have a similar degree of shrinkage .	We fit our model via a computationally efficient expectation maximization algorithm which scalable to high dimensional settings ( p~100,000 ) .
3	A more than 3 orders of magnitude reduction of cavity mode spacing and cavity line-width from GHz to MHz was observed .	Cavity assisted quantum memory storage has been proposed [ PRA 82 , 022310 ( 2010 ) , PRA 82 , 022311 ( 2010 ) ] for creating efficient ( close to unity ) quantum memories using weakly absorbing materials .	Using this approach we experimentally demonstrate a significant ( about 20-fold ) enhancement in quantum memory efficiency compared to the no cavity case .	A strong dispersion originating from absorption engineering inside the cavity was observed , which directly affect the cavity line-width .	We are not aware of any previous observation of several orders of magnitudes cavity mode spacing and cavity line-width reduction due to slow light effects .
3	From this we obtain that $ \operatorname { Im } \log\zeta ( 1/2+it ) $ satisfies a large deviation principle on the critical line .	We prove mod-Gaussian convergence for a Dirichlet polynomial which approximates $ \operatorname { Im } \log\zeta ( 1/2+it ) $ .	This Dirichlet polynomial is sufficiently long to deduce Selberg 's central limit theorem with an explicit error term .	Moreover , assuming the Riemann hypothesis , we apply the theory of the Riemann zeta-function to extend this mod-Gaussian convergence to the complex plane .	Results about the moments of the Riemann zeta-function follow .
0	For $ p\in ( 1 , \infty ) $ let $ \mathscr { P } _p ( \mathbb { R } ^3 ) $ denote the metric space of all $ p $ -integrable Borel probability measures on $ \mathbb { R } ^3 $ , equipped with the Wasserstein $ p $ metric $ \mathsf { W } _p $ .	We prove that for every $ \varepsilon & gt ; 0 $ , every $ \theta\in ( 0,1/p ] $ and every finite metric space $ ( X , d_X ) $ , the metric space $ ( X , d_ { X } ^ { \theta } ) $ embeds into $ \mathscr { P } _p ( \mathbb { R } ^3 ) $ with distortion at most $ 1+\varepsilon $ .	We show that this is sharp when $ p\in ( 1,2 ] $ in the sense that the exponent $ 1/p $ can not be replaced by any larger number .	In fact , for arbitrarily large $ n\in \mathbb { N } $ there exists an $ n $ -point metric space $ ( X_n , d_n ) $ such that for every $ \alpha\in ( 1/p,1 ] $ any embedding of the metric space $ ( X_n , d_n^\alpha ) $ into $ \mathscr { P } _p ( \mathbb { R } ^3 ) $ incurs distortion that is at least a constant multiple of $ ( \log n ) ^ { \alpha-1/p } $ .	These statements establish that there exists an Alexandrov space of nonnegative curvature , namely $ \mathscr { P } _ { \ !
3	For two states , we obtain exact solutions in dimension one , and asymptotic ones confirmed by Brownian simulations in dimension 3 .	The mean time for a diffusing ligand to activate a target protein located on the surface of a microdomain can regulate cellular signaling .	When the ligand switches between various states induced by chemical interactions or conformational changes , while target activation occurs in only one state , this activation time is affected .	We investigate this dynamics using new equations for the sojourn times spent in each state .	We find that the activation time is quite sensitive to changes of the switching rates , which can be used to modulate signaling .
1	In spite of the extreme conditions expected to prevail in this innermost , central environment , the radiative clouds can survive and maintain cool temperatures relative to the ambient emitting region by means of magnetic confinement .	The primary radiation generated in the central continuum-forming region of Active Galactic Nuclei can be reprocessed by very dense , small-scale clouds that are optically-thin to Thomson scattering .	Motivated by these ideas , we present a detailed quantitative study of such clouds , explicitly describing the physical properties they can attain under thermal and radiative equilibrium conditions .	We also discuss the thermal stability of the gas in comparison to that of other reprocessing material thought to reside at larger distances from the central source .	We construct a model to predict the emergent spectra from a source region containing dense clouds which absorb and reemit the primary radiation generated therein .
0	In this paper we present improved results on the problem of counting triangles in edge streamed graphs .	For graphs with $ m $ edges and at least $ T $ triangles , we show that an extra look over the stream yields a two-pass treaming algorithm that uses $ O ( \frac { m } { \eps^ { 2.5 } \sqrt { T } } \polylog ( m ) ) $ space and outputs a $ ( 1+\eps ) $ approximation of the number of triangles in the graph .	This improves upon the two-pass streaming tester of Braverman , Ostrovsky and Vilenchik , ICALP 2013 , which distinguishes between triangle-free graphs and graphs with at least $ T $ triangle using $ O ( \frac { m } { T^ { 1/3 } } ) $ space .	Also , in terms of dependence on $ T $ , we show that more passes would not lead to a better space bound .	In other words , we prove there is no constant pass streaming algorithm that distinguishes between triangle-free graphs from graphs with at least $ T $ triangles using $ O ( \frac { m } { T^ { 1/2+\rho } } ) $ space for any constant $ \rho \ge 0 $ .
4	This can be explained in terms of polar fluctuation arising from LSAT chemical composition .	Since the discovery of two-dimensional electron gas ( 2DEG ) at the oxide interface of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 , improving carrier mobility has become an important issue for device applications .	In this paper , by using an alternate polar perovskite insulator ( La0.3Sr0.7 ) ( Al0.65Ta0.35 ) O3 ( LSAT ) for reducing lattice mismatch from 3.0 % to 1.0 % , the low-temperature carrier mobility has been increased 30 fold to 35,000 cm2V-1s-1 .	Moreover , two critical thicknesses for the LSAT/SrTiO3 ( 001 ) interface are found : one at 5 unit cell for appearance of the 2DEG , the other at 12 unit cell for a peak in the carrier mobility .	By contrast , the conducting ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) LSAT/STO interfaces only show a single critical thickness of 8 unit cells .
3	We then prove that the ground states of the models exhibit saturated ferromagnetism , i.e. , have maximum total spins .	It is believed that strong ferromagnetic orders in some solids are generated by subtle interplay between quantum many-body effects and spin-independent Coulomb interactions between electrons .	Here we describe our rigorous and constructive approach to ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model , which is a standard idealized model for strongly interacting electrons in a solid .	We introduce a class of Hubbard models in any dimensions which are nonsingular in the sense that both the Coulomb interaction and the density of states ( at the Fermi level ) are finite .	Combined with our earlier results , the present work provides nonsingular models of itinerant electrons with only spin-independent interactions where low energy behaviors are proved to be that of a `` healthy '' ferromagnetic insulator .
0	With the continuous development of science and technology , the intelligent development of community system becomes a trend .	Meanwhile , smart mobile devices and cloud computing technology are increasingly used in intelligent information systems ; however , smart mobile devices such as smartphone and smart pad , also known as thin clients , limited by either their capacities ( CPU , memory or battery ) or their network resources , do not always meet users ' satisfaction in using mobile services .	Mobile cloud computing , in which resource-rich virtual machines of smart mobile device are provided to a customer as a service , can be terrific solution for expanding the limitation of real smart mobile device , but the resources utilization rate is low and the information can not be shared easily .	To address the problems above , this paper proposes an information system for intelligent community , which is composed of thin clients , wide band network and cloud computing servers .	On one hand , the thin clients with the characteristics of energy efficiency , high robustness and high computing capacity can efficiently avoid the problems encountered in the PC architecture and mobile devices .
0	In this paper , we consider a massive multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) downlink system underlaid with a network of multi-antenna D2D user equipments ( UEs ) .	Each D2D transmitter ( Tx ) uses all its antennas to beamform information towards its desired D2D receiver , which uses only a single antenna for reception .	While beamforming at the D2D Tx reduces D2D interference to the neighbouring cellular UEs ( CUEs ) , the cellular-to-D2D interference is also negligible due to highly directional beamforming at the massive MIMO base station .	For the above proposed system , we analyze the average per-user spectral efficiency ( SE ) of CUEs ( $ R^ { c , d } $ ) as a function of the D2D area spectral efficiency ( ASE ) .	Our analysis reveals that for a fixed D2D ASE ( $ R_0^ { ( d ) } $ ) and fixed number of D2D antennas ( $ N $ ) , with increasing density of D2D Txs ( $ \lambda $ ) , $ R^ { c , d } $ increases ( for sufficiently large $ \lambda $ ) and approaches a fundamental limit $ R_ { \infty } ^ { c , d } $ as $ \lambda \to \infty $ .
2	We numerically obtain both the pair correlation function and the virial coefficients for a fluid of hyper-spheres in dimensions $ d=4,6 $ and 8 , and find good agreement with available exact results and Monte-Carlo simulations .	We solve the Percus-Yevick equation in even dimensions by reducing it to a set of simple integro-differential equations .	This work generalizes an approach we developed previously for hard discs .	This paper confirms the alternating character of the virial series for $ d \ge 6 $ , and provides the first evidence for an alternating character for $ d=4 $ .	Moreover , we show that this sign alternation is due to the existence of a branch point on the negative real axis .
4	We show that these power-law spectra lead to diverging geometric backreaction , which is the likely precursor to black hole formation .	We analyze the gravitational dynamics of a classical scalar field coupled to gravity in asymptotically AdS spacetime , which leads to black hole formation on the shortest nonlinear time scale for some initial conditions .	We show that the observed collapse can not be described by the well-known process of a random-phase cascade in the theory of weak turbulence .	This implies that the dynamics on this time scale is highly sensitive to the phases of modes .	We explore the alternative possibility of a coherent phase cascade and analytically find stationary solutions with completely coherent phases and power-law energy spectra .
0	We calculate the ion-ion correlation effect on the neutrino-nucleus scattering in supernova cores , which is an important opacity source for the neutrinos and plays a vital role in the supernova explosion .	In order to calculate the ion-ion correlation effect we use the results of the improved hypernetted-chain method calculations of the classical one-component plasma .	As in the preceding studies on this effect , we find a dramatic decrease of the effective neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section for relatively low energy neutrinos with E & lt ; 20MeV .	As a matter of fact , our calculation shows a much more dramatic reduction of the effective neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section for the low energy neutrinos with E & lt ; 10MeV than the results of Horowitz .	Therefore , the ion-ion correlation effect will be more important than has hitherto been recognized .
2	A classification is performed of the relevant operators including custodially-breaking effects from the gauging of hypercharge .	We compute the 1-loop correction to the electroweak observables from spin-1 resonances in SO ( 5 ) /SO ( 4 ) composite Higgs models .	The strong dynamics is modeled with an effective description comprising the Nambu-Goldstone bosons and the lowest-lying spin-1 resonances .	The 1-loop contribution of the resonances is extracted in a diagrammatic approach by matching to the low-energy theory of Nambu-Goldstone bosons .	We find that the correction is numerically important in a significant fraction of the parameter space and tends to weaken the bounds providing a negative shift to the S parameter .
2	Strong e-e , i-i and e-i correlation effects and partial degeneracies are found in these systems where the electron temperature $ T_e $ is comparable to the electron Fermi energy .	Finite-temperature DFT has become of topical interest , partly due to the increasing ability to create novel states of warm-correlated matter ( WCM ) .	Subclasses of WCM are Warm-dense matter ( WDM ) , ultra-fast matter ( UFM ) , and high-energy density matter ( HEDM ) , containing electyrons ( e ) and ions ( i ) .	The ion subsystem may be solid , liquid or plasma , with many states of ionization with ionic charge $ Z_j $ .	Quasi-equilibria with the ion temperature $ T_i\ne T_e $ are common .
4	Our results resolve the controversy surrounding macroscopic models of the electrocaloric effect and may inspire ab initio calculations of electrocaloric parameters and thus a targeted search for new materials .	An applied electric field can reversibly change the temperature of an electrocaloric material under adiabatic conditions , and the effect is strongest near phase transitions .	This phenomenon has been largely ignored because only small effects ( 0.003 K V^-1 ) have been seen in bulk samples such as Pb0.99Nb0.02 ( Zr0.75Sn0.20Ti0.05 ) 0.98O3 and there is no consensus on macroscopic models .	Here we demonstrate a giant electrocaloric effect ( 0.48 K V^-1 ) in 300 nm sol-gel PbZr0.95Ti0.05O3 films near the ferroelectric Curie temperature of 222oC .	We also discuss a solid state device concept for electrical refrigeration that has the capacity to outperform Peltier or magnetocaloric coolers .
2	If so , all close binaries should be members of triple ( or higher-order ) systems .	It is unclear how very close binary stars form , given that during the pre-main-sequence phase the component stars would have been inside each other .	One hypothesis is that they formed further apart , but were brought in closer after formation by gravitational interaction with a third member of the system .	As a test of this prediction , we present a search for the signature of third components in archival spectra of close binaries .	In our sample of 75 objects , 23 show evidence for the presence of a third component , down to a detection limit of tertiary flux contributions of about 0.8 % at 5200 \AA\ ( considering only contact and semi-detached binaries , we find 20 out of 66 ) .
4	We use linear , parabolic and exponential profiles as rising part and find complex-energy poles , $ { \cal E } _n=E_n-i\Gamma_n/2 $ $ ( \Gamma_n & gt ; 0 ) $ , in the reflection amplitude ( s-matrix ) .	We study scattering from potentials that rise monotonically on one side ; this is generally avoided .	We report that resonant states are absent in such potentials when they are smooth and single-piece having less than three real turning points ( like in the cases of Morse oscillator , exponential and linear potentials ) .	But when these potentials are made two-piece , resonances can occur .	We further show that rising potentials next to a well/step/barrier are rich models of multiple resonances ( Gamow 's decaying states ) in one- dimension .
1	Using Schwinger boson formulation for spins , we start in a U ( 1 ) spin liquid phase proximate to Neel phase and explore possible confining paramagnetic phases as we transition away from the spin liquid by the process of monopole condensation .	We study spin S=1 and S=3/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a cubic lattice focusing on spin solid states .	Electromagnetic duality is used to rewrite the theory in terms of monopoles .	For spin 1 we find several candidate phases of which the most natural one is a phase with spins organized into parallel Haldane chains .	For spin 3/2 we find that the most natural phase has spins organized into parallel ladders .
1	However , the fate of this momentum if the fields are turned off is unclear .	A stationary magnetic dipole immersed in an electric field carries `` hidden '' mechanical momentum .	We consider a charge-and-dipole hidden momentum configuration , and turn off the fields by collapsing a null shell onto the system , forming a black hole .	In numerical calculations we find that the black hole receives a kick corresponding to 0.1 % of the initial stored momentum .	When extrapolated to apply to purely gravitational phenomena , this efficiency suggests a role for the hidden momentum kick mechanism in generating the binary black hole `` superkicks '' observed in numerical simulations of Einstein 's equation .
0	Resistivity and Hall effect measurements of EuFe $ _2 $ As $ _2 $ up to 3.2\ , GPa indicate no divergence of quasiparticle effective mass at the pressure $ P_\mathrm { c } $ where the magnetic and structural transition disappears .	This is corroborated by analysis of the temperature ( $ T $ ) dependence of the upper critical field .	$ T $ -linear resistivity is observed at pressures slightly above $ P_\mathrm { c } $ .	The scattering rates for both electrons and holes are shown to be approximately $ T $ -linear .	When a field is applied , a $ T^2 $ dependence is recovered , indicating that the origin of the $ T $ -linear dependence is spin fluctuations .
1	Further asteroseismic constraints can be obtained from studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster , which all have similar age , distance and chemical composition .	Recent progress in the seismic interpretation of field beta Cep stars has resulted in improvements of the physics in the stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars .	We present an observational asteroseismology study based on the discovery of numerous multi-periodic and mono-periodic B-stars in the open cluster NGC 884 .	We describe a thorough investigation of the pulsational properties of all B-type stars in the cluster .	Overall , our detailed frequency analysis resulted in 115 detected frequencies in 65 stars .
0	We use the ACTpol published cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) polarization data to constrain cosmological birefringence , a tracer of parity violation beyond the standard model of particle physics .	To this purpose , we employ all the polarized ACTpol spectra , including the cross-correlations between temperature anisotropy and B mode polarization ( TB ) and between E mode and B mode ( EB ) , which are most sensitive to the effect .	We build specific , so-called D-estimators for birefringence and assess their performances and error budgets by using realistic Monte Carlo simulations based on the experimental characteristics provided by the ACTpol collaboration .	We determine the optimal multipole range for our analysis to be $ 250 & lt ; \ell & lt ; 3025 $ over which we find a null result for the birefringence angle $ \alpha = 0.29^\circ \pm 0.28^\circ $ ( stat . )	$ \pm 0.5^\circ $ ( syst .
4	We observe that the problem is NP-Hard , and is hard to even approximate within a constant factor .	We are given a set of sensors at given locations , a set of potential locations for placing base stations ( BSs , or sinks ) , and another set of potential locations for placing wireless relay nodes .	There is a cost for placing a BS and a cost for placing a relay .	The problem we consider is to select a set of BS locations , a set of relay locations , and an association of sensor nodes with the selected BS locations , so that number of hops in the path from each sensor to its BS is bounded by hmax , and among all such feasible networks , the cost of the selected network is the minimum .	The hop count bound suffices to ensure a certain probability of the data being delivered to the BS within a given maximum delay under a light traffic model .
0	M17 JVLA 35 is a radio source detected in projection against the M17 HII region .	In recent observations , its spectrum between 4.96 and 8.46 GHz was found to be positive and very steep , with $ \alpha \geq 2.9 \pm 0.6 $ ( $ S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha $ ) .	Here we present Very Large Array observations made in the 18.5 to 36.5 GHz region that indicate a spectral turnover at $ \sim $ 13 GHz and a negative spectral index ( $ \alpha \simeq -2.0 $ ) at higher frequencies .	The spectrum is consistent with that of an extragalactic High Frequency Peaker ( HFP ) .	However , M17 JVLA 35 has an angular size of $ \sim0\rlap .
1	More recent rules are compared with Efron 's [ Biometrika 58 ( 1971 ) 403-417 ] biased-coin rule and extended to allow balance over covariates .	Biased-coin designs are used in clinical trials to allocate treatments with some randomness while maintaining approximately equal allocation .	The main properties are loss of information , due to imbalance , and selection bias .	Theoretical results , mostly large sample , are assembled and assessed by small-sample simulations .	The properties of the rules fall into three clear categories .
1	We combine a mean field theory developed from a lattice model with a level surface analysis of the periodic structures of soft-sphere aggregates to study stable morphologies for all clustering potentials .	Soft spheres interacting via a hard core and range of attractive and repulsive `` soft-shoulder '' potentials self-assemble into clusters forming a variety of mesophases .	We develop a systematic approach to the thermodynamics of mesophase assembly in the low-temperature , strong-segregation and predict a generic sequence of phases including lamella , hexagonal-columnar and body-center cubic phases , as well as the associated inverse structures .	We discuss the finite-temperature corrections to strong segregation theory in terms of Sommerfeld-like expansion and how these corrections affect the thermodynamic stability of bicontinuous mesophase structures , such as gyroid .	Finally , we explore the opposite limit of weakly-segregated particles , and predict the generic stability of a bicontinuous cluster morphology within the mean-field phase diagram .
3	When the Misiurewicz-Ziemian rotation set has non-empty interior the dynamics is fully essential , and the set $ C $ is ( externally ) sensitive on initial conditions and realizes all the rotational dynamics .	We study the interplay between the dynamics of area-preserving surface homeomorphisms homotopic to the identity and the topology of the surface .	We define fully essential dynamics and generalize the results previously obtained on strictly toral dynamics to surfaces of higher genus .	Non-fully essential dynamics are , in a way , reducible to surfaces of lower genus , while in the fully essential case the dynamics is decomposed into a disjoint union of periodic bounded disks and a complementary invariant externally transitive continuum $ C $ .	As a fundamental tool we introduce the notion of homotopically bounded sets and we prove a general boundedness result for invariant open sets when the fixed point set is inessential .
4	In particular , we prove weak characterizations , a chain rule for Lipschitz functions , a sufficient condition for pathwise continuity and an Ito formula for non-adapted processes .	In this paper we study the Malliavin derivatives and Skorohod integrals for processes taking values in an infinite dimensional space .	Such results are motivated by their applications to SPDEs and in particular financial mathematics .	Vector-valued Malliavin theory in Banach space E is naturally restricted to spaces E which have the so-called UMD property , which arises in harmonic analysis and stochastic integration theory .	We provide several new results and tools for the Malliavin derivatives and Skorohod integrals in an infinite dimensional setting .
4	The quantities calculated are the total energy , the kinetic energy , the thermal energy , the radial extent , and the mass .	We present the results of numerical studies of supernova remnant evolution and their effects on galactic and globular cluster evolution .	We show that parameters such as the density and the metallicity of the environment significantly influence the evolution of the remnant , and thus change its effects on the global environment ( e.g. , globular clusters , galaxies ) as a source of thermal and kinetic energy .	We conducted our studies using a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code , in which we implemented a metallicity dependent cooling function .	Global time-dependent quantities such as the total kinetic and thermal energies and the radial extent are calculated for a grid of parameter sets .
2	In order to define the character of the motion in the 2D system , we use the classical method of the Poincare x-px phase plane , the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent ( LCE ) and the dynamical parameter - the S ( c ) spectrum .	A 3D dynamical model is used to study the motion in the central parts of an elliptical galaxy , hosting a massive and dense nucleus .	Our aim is to investigate the regular or chaotic character of the motion , with emphasis in the different chaotic components , as well as the sticky regions of the dynamical system .	Then the results obtained from the 2D system are used to investigate the properties of the 3D system .	For this , we introduce and use a new dynamical parameter , the S ( k ) spectrum , which proves to be a very reliable and fast method to detect the islandic motion and the evolution of the sticky orbits in the 3D system .
1	At a first stage , individual telescopes produce a trigger signal from the pixel information in the telescope camera .	Arrays of Cherenkov telescopes typically use multi-level trigger schemes to keep the rate of random triggers from the night sky background low .	The final event trigger is then formed by combining trigger signals from several telescopes .	In this poster , we present a possible scheme for the Cherenkov Telescope Array telescope trigger , which is based on the analog pulse information of the pixels in a telescope camera .	Advanced versions of all components of the system have been produced and working prototypes have been tested , showing a performance that meets the original specifications .
2	Why time elapsed is different for a moving entity relative to a stationary entity.3 .	This paper sets out to explain : 1 .	Why the speed of light c is a constant and is the maximum speed at which any moving entity can travel.2 .	Why there has been confusion between the wave and particle nature of an entity.4 .	The relation between the speed of light c , Planck 's constant k and time 5 .
4	In a subsequent paper we shall use this theorem to establish the Mobius and Nilsequences conjecture from our earlier paper `` Linear equations in primes '' .	A theorem of Leibman asserts that a polynomial orbit $ ( g ( 1 ) , g ( 2 ) , g ( 3 ) , \ldots ) $ on a nilmanifold $ G/\Gamma $ is always equidistributed in a union of closed sub-nilmanifolds of $ G/\Gamma $ .	In this paper we give a quantitative version of Leibman 's result , describing the uniform distribution properties of a finite polynomial orbit $ ( g ( 1 ) , \ldots , g ( N ) ) $ in a nilmanifold .	More specifically we show that there is a factorization $ g = \epsilon g'\gamma $ , where $ \epsilon ( n ) $ is `` smooth '' , $ \gamma ( n ) $ is periodic and `` rational '' , and $ ( g ' ( a ) , g ' ( a+d ) , \ldots , g ' ( a + d ( l-1 ) ) ) $ is uniformly distributed ( up to a specified error $ \delta $ ) inside some subnilmanifold $ G'/\Gamma ' $ of $ G/\Gamma $ , for all sufficiently dense arithmetic progressions $ a , a+d , \ldots , a+d ( l-1 ) $ inside $ \ { 1 , .. , N\ } $ .	Our bounds are uniform in $ N $ and are polynomial in the error tolerance delta .
1	But the xDSL line that can be used for the backhauling of femtocell traffic can not always provide sufficient bandwidth due to the inequality between the xDSL capacity and demanded bandwidth of home applications like , IPTV , PC , WiFi , and others .	Satisfaction level of femtocell users ' depends on the availability of requested bandwidth .	A Service Level Agreement ( SLA ) between xDSL and femtocell operator ( mobile operator ) to reserve some bandwidth for the upcoming femtocell calls can increase the satisfaction level for femtocell users .	In this paper we propose a SLA negotiation procedure for femtocell networks .	The Bandwidth Broker controls the allocated bandwidth for femtocell users .
0	At present , dwarf spheroidal galaxies satellites of the Milky Way may represent the best astrophysical objects for dark matter ( DM ) searches with gamma-ray telescopes .	They present the highest mass-to-light ratios known in the Universe .	Furthermore , many of them are near enough from the Earth to be able to yield high predicted DM annihilation fluxes that might be observed by current gamma-ray instruments like MAGIC .	The picture has become even better with the recent discovery of new dwarfs .	These new objects are expected to yield even higher DM annihilation fluxes , since most of them are nearer than the previously known dwarfs and are even more DM dominated systems .
3	It means that Schr\ '' odinger equation predicts infinite speed of the wave function perturbations propagation .	Principle of locality means that any local change ( perturbation ) of the stationary state wave function field propagates with finite speed , and therefore reaches distant regions of the field with time delay .	If a one-particle or multi-particle non-relativistic quantum system is initially in a stationary state , and its wave function field is locally perturbed , then perturbed and non-perturbed sub-regions appear in the region .	According to Schr\ '' odinger equation , borders of the perturbed sub-region propagate with infinite speed , and the perturbation instantaneously affects all infinite region .	This feature of classical Schr\ '' odinger equation is traditionally interpreted as non-locality of quantum mechanics .
4	We also find different chemical-potential dependences of $ I_ { \rm c } $ in the monolayer and bilayer cases .	Josephson effect in a planar graphene junction is studied by assuming that the coupling of a graphene sheet and two superconductors deposited on its top is described by a tunneling Hamiltonian .	This model properly takes account of the proximity effect characteristic to a planar junction , and allows us to treat monolayer and bilayer cases in a parallel manner .	Applying a quasiclassical Green 's function approach to it we analyze the Josephson critical current $ I_ { \rm c } $ in a short-junction limit .	As a characteristic feature of the planar junction we find that $ I_ { \rm c } $ is a concave function of temperature at the strong coupling limit while it crosses over to a convex function with decreasing the coupling strength .
4	We show that magnetic fluctuations are probed on length scales ranging over at least one order of magnitude .	We apply a novel technique of Faraday Rotation measure ( RM ) map analysis to three galaxy clusters , Abell 400 , Abell 2634 and Hydra A , in order to estimate cluster magnetic field strengths , length scales and power spectra .	This analysis is based on the assumption that the magnetic fields are statistically isotropically distributed across the Faraday screen .	We investigate the difficulties involved in the application of the analysis to observational data .	We derive magnetic power spectra for the three clusters and discuss influences on their shapes .
1	We analyze the simplest case , attachment of the three node V-graphlet , where , with probability alpha , we attach a peripheral node of the graphlet , and with probability ( 1-alpha ) , we attach the central node .	Motivated by widely observed examples in nature , society and software , where groups of already related nodes arrive together and attach to an existing network , we consider network growth via sequential attachment of linked node groups , or graphlets .	Our analytical results and simulations show that tuning alpha produces a wide range in degree distribution and degree assortativity , achieving assortativity values that capture a diverse set of many real-world systems .	We introduce a fifteen-dimensional attribute vector derived from seven well-known network properties , which enables comprehensive comparison between any two networks .	Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) of this attribute vector space shows a significantly larger coverage potential of real-world network properties by a simple extension of the above model when compared against a classic model of network growth .
4	Then , we derive the equations of motion of our theory , and finally discuss further aspects : the dimensional reduction to four dimensions and comparison to gauged supergravities , the obtention of ten-dimensional purely NSNS solutions , the extensions to other sectors and new objects , the supergravity limit , and eventually the symmetries , in particular the \beta gauge transformation .	We present a ten-dimensional theory , named \beta-supergravity , that contains non-geometric fluxes and could uplift some four-dimensional gauged supergravities .	Building on earlier work , we study here its NSNS sector , where Q- and R-fluxes are precisely identified .	Interestingly , the Q-flux is captured in an analogue of the Levi-Civita spin connection , giving rise to a second curvature scalar .	We reproduce the ten-dimensional Lagrangian using the Generalized Geometry formalism ; this provides us with enlightening interpretations of the new structures .
0	Intrusion Detection is an invaluable part of computer networks defense .	An important consideration is the fact that raising false alarms carries a significantly lower cost than not detecting at- tacks .	For this reason , we examine how cost-sensitive classification methods can be used in Intrusion Detection systems .	The performance of the approach is evaluated under different experimental conditions , cost matrices and different classification models , in terms of expected cost , as well as detection and false alarm rates .	We find that even under unfavourable conditions , cost-sensitive classification can improve performance significantly , if only slightly .
1	In this paper we consider positive recurrent general state space Markov chains with stationary transition probabilities .	The theory of $ L^2 $ -spectral gaps for reversible Markov chains has been studied by many authors .	Replacing the assumption of reversibility by a less strong one , we still obtain a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the spectral gap property of the associated Markov operator in terms of isoperimetric constant .	Moreover , we define a new sequence of isoperimetric constants which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral gap in a very general setting .	Finally , these results are used to obtain simple sufficient conditions for the existence of a spectral gap in terms of the first and second order transition probabilities .
0	The rank-three tensor models , which have a rank-three tensor as their only dynamical variable , may be interpreted as models of dynamical fuzzy spaces .	In this interpretation , the generalized Hermiticity condition on the rank-three tensor leads to a cyclic property of the algebra of functions on fuzzy spaces .	The fuzzy spaces with the cyclic property are shown to have various physically interesting characteristics .	( i ) Although the function algebras of the kind are nonassociative in general , various properties analogous to quantum mechanics hold on the fuzzy spaces .	( ii ) The symmetry of the rank-three tensor models can be shown to be represented systematically by n-ary transformations on the fuzzy spaces .
3	Theoretical analysis of this flow , both in the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes ( RANS ) framework and by simple dynamic models , show an encouraging consistency with the numerical results .	Three-dimensional ( 3D ) , time dependent numerical simulations , of flow of matter in stars , now have sufficient resolution to be fully turbulent .	The late stages of the evolution of massive stars , leading up to core collapse to a neutron star ( or black hole ) , and often to supernova explosion and nucleosynthesis , are strongly convective because of vigorous neutrino cooling and nuclear heating .	Unlike models based on current stellar evolutionary practice , these simulations show a chaotic dynamics characteristic of highly turbulent flow .	It may now be possible to develop physically realistic and robust procedures for convection and mixing which ( unlike 3D numerical simulation ) may be applied throughout the long life times of stars .
4	Thus , for these networks , the small-world nature is destroyed .	We study the optimal distance in networks , $ \ell_ { \scriptsize opt } $ , defined as the length of the path minimizing the total weight , in the presence of disorder .	Disorder is introduced by assigning random weights to the links or nodes .	For strong disorder , where the maximal weight along the path dominates the sum , we find that $ \ell_ { \scriptsize opt } \sim N^ { 1/3 } $ in both Erd\H { o } s-R\'enyi ( ER ) and Watts-Strogatz ( WS ) networks .	For scale free ( SF ) networks , with degree distribution $ P ( k ) \sim k^ { -\lambda } $ , we find that $ \ell_ { \scriptsize opt } $ scales as $ N^ { ( \lambda - 3 ) / ( \lambda - 1 ) } $ for $ 3 & lt ; \lambda & lt ; 4 $ and as $ N^ { 1/3 } $ for $ \lambda\geq 4 $ .
0	We present new algorithms for simulating Bose-Einstein correlations among final-state bosons in an event generator .	The algorithms are all based on introducing Bose-Einstein correlations as a shift of final-state momenta among identical bosons , and differ only in the way energy and momentum conservation is ensured .	The benefits and shortcomings of this approach , that may be viewed as a local reweighting strategy , is compared to the ones of recently proposed algorithms involving global event reweighting .	We use the new algorithms to improve on our previous study of the effects of Bose-Einstein correlations on the W mass measurement at LEP 2 .	The intrinsic uncertainty could be as high as 100 MeV but is probably reduced to the order of 30 MeV with realistic experimental reconstruction procedures .
4	We observe that the electronic structure is sensitive to structural distortions , and that an enhanced Hubbard U tends to stabilize the nontrivial gap .	Using tight-binding models and first-principles calculations , we demonstrate the possibility to achieve a quantum anomalous Hall ( QAH ) phase on a two-dimensional square lattice , which can be realized in monolayers of double perovskites .	We show that effective intersite spin-orbit coupling between eg orbitals can be induced perturbatively , giving rise to a QAH state .	Moreover , the effective spin-orbit coupling can be enhanced by octahedral rotations .	Based on first-principles calculations , we propose that this type of QAH state could be realized in La2MnIrO6 monolayers , with the size of the gap as large as 26 meV in the ideal case .
3	In this paper , we release the above assumptions and take the CSI uncertainty and the spatial and temporal selectivities into account .	To detect spatially-modulated signals , a receiver needs the channel state information ( CSI ) about each transmit-receive antenna pair .	Although the CSI ( or channel response information ) is never perfect and varies in time , most studies on spatial modulation ( SM ) systems assume perfectly known CSI and time-invariant channel .	The spatial correlations among multiple spatial subchannels , which have to be considered when CSI is imperfect , are also often neglected .	We derive the channel estimation error-aware maximum likelihood ( CEEA-ML ) detectors as well as several low-complexity suboptimal alternatives for PSK and QAM signals .
3	Their shifts under transformations to uniformly accelerated frames are evaluated through algebraic computations in conformal algebra .	We define quantum observables associated with Einstein localisation in space-time .	These observables are built on Poincare ' and dilatation generators .	Their commutators are given by spin observables defined from the same symmetry generators .	Spin number is found to vary under such transformations with a variation involving further observables introduced as irreducible quadrupole momenta .
1	To model this phenomenon , a competition mechanism is suggested which incorporates two factors : vigorousness and dormancy .	In citation networks , the activity of papers usually decreases with age and dormant papers may be discovered and become fashionable again .	Based on this idea , a citation network model is proposed , in which a node has two discrete stage : vigorous and dormant .	Vigorous nodes can be deactivated and dormant nodes may be activated and become vigorous .	The evolution of the network couples addition of new nodes and state transitions of old ones .
0	We demonstrate how to compute real-time Green 's functions for a class of finite temperature field theories from their AdS gravity duals .	In particular , we reproduce the two-by-two Schwinger-Keldysh matrix propagator from a gravity calculation .	Our methods should work also for computing higher point Lorentzian signature correlators .	We elucidate the boundary condition subtleties which hampered previous efforts to build a Lorentzian-signature AdS/CFT correspondence .	For two-point correlators , our construction is automatically equivalent to the previously formulated prescription for the retarded propagator .
1	We find that the subhalo mass function departs significantly from a power law at the high mass end .	We use the Millennium Simulation , a large , high resolution N-body simulation of the evolution of structure in a LambdaCDM cosmology , to study the properties and fate of substructures within a large sample of dark matter haloes .	We also find that the radial and angular distributions of substructures depend on subhalo mass .	In particular , high mass subhaloes tend to be less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer to the direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their less massive counterparts .	We find that mergers between subhaloes occur .
0	Aggregates of misfolded proteins are a hallmark of many age-related diseases .	Recently , they have been linked to aging of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) where protein aggregates accumulate at the old pole region of the aging bacterium .	Because of the potential of E. coli as a model organism , elucidating aging and protein aggregation in this bacterium may pave the way to significant advances in our global understanding of aging .	A first obstacle along this path is to decipher the mechanisms by which protein aggregates are targeted to specific intercellular locations .	Here , using an integrated approach based on individual-based modeling , time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis , we show that the movement of aging-related protein aggregates in E. coli is purely diffusive ( Brownian ) .
1	One aspect of the overall challenge is manifold matching - identifying embeddings of multiple disparate data spaces into the same low-dimensional space where joint inference can be pursued .	Fusion and inference from multiple and massive disparate data sources - the requirement for our most challenging data analysis problems and the goal of our most ambitious statistical pattern recognition methodologies - -has many and varied aspects which are currently the target of intense research and development .	We investigate this manifold matching task from the perspective of jointly optimizing the fidelity of the embeddings and their commensurability with one another , with a specific statistical inference exploitation task in mind .	Our results demonstrate when and why our joint optimization methodology is superior to either version of separate optimization .	The methodology is illustrated with simulations and an application in document matching .
1	Correlations between the emergence of new VLBI components from the core , flares in linearly polarized radio flux , and gamma-ray activity in bright EGRET-detected blazars supported a picture in which the gamma-ray and the radio band emission arises in the same shocked region of the jet , with the high energy emission produced via inverse Compton scattering by the synchrotron-emitting electrons in the jet .	In the 1990s a comparison of sparse EGRET measurements with single-dish flux density monitoring from the Metsahovi and UMRAO programs established a temporal connection between the onset of flaring at radio band and the occurrence of gamma-ray activity .	Quantitative tests of this scenario , however , were hampered by insufficient temporal sampling of the data and the simple nature of the models adopted .	The extensive data from Fermi coupled with the wealth of well-sampled radio band data from old as well as new programs such as the F-GAMMA project now permit statistical studies for large numbers of sources , including weak HBLs , and detailed analyses of individual highly-active class members .	I summarize progress in understanding the origin of the gamma-ray emission using these new measurements .
2	This allows us to study how both the density profile and velocity anisotropy affect the degree of mass loss -- we present basic results from such a study .	We examine the problem tidally-induced mass loss from collisionless systems such as dark matter haloes .	We develop a model for tidal mass loss , based upon the phase space distribution of particles , which accounts for how both tidal and Coriolis torques perturb the angular momentum of each particle in the system .	Our model predicts that mass loss is a continuous process even in a static tidal field , a consequence of the fact that mass loss weakens the potential of the system making it easier for further mass loss to occur .	We compare the predictions of our model with N-body simulations of idealized systems in order to check its validity .
4	Furthermore , we compared the spectrum of SDSSJ212531.92-010745.9 with NLTE models , the results of which also constrain the light curve solution .	The archival spectrum of SDSSJ212531.92-010745.9 shows not only the typical signature of a PG1159 star , but also indicates the presence of a companion .	Our aim was the proof of the binary nature ofthis object and the determination of its orbital period.We performed time-series photometry of SDSSJ212531.92-010745.9 .	We observed the object during 10 nights , spread over one month , with the Tuebingen 80cm and the Goettingen 50cm telescopes .	We fitted the observed light curve with a sine and simulated the light curve of this system with the nightfall program .
2	In particular the model retains the subcritical dynamics of fully resolved pipe flow , capturing realistic localised `puff'-like structures which can decay abruptly after long times , as well as global `slug ' turbulence .	Fully 3-dimensional computations of flow through a long pipe demand a huge number of degrees of freedom , making it very expensive to explore parameter space and difficult to isolate the structure of the underlying dynamics .	We therefore introduce a `2+epsilon ' dimensional model of pipe flow which is a minimal 3-dimensionalisation of the axisymmetric case : only sinusoidal variation in azimuth plus azimuthal shifts are retained , yet the same dynamics familiar from experiments are found .	Relaminarisation statistics of puffs reproduce the memoryless feature of pipe flow and indicate the existence of a Reynolds number about which lifetimes diverge rapidly , provided that the pipe is sufficiently long .	Exponential divergence of the lifetime is prevalent in shorter periodic domains .
3	This can be considered as an analogue of the Sato-Tate distribution which covers the case when the curve $ \E $ is defined over $ \Q $ and considered modulo consecutive primes $ p $ , although in our scenario the distribution function is different .	Let $ \cC $ be a smooth absolutely irreducible curve of genus $ g \ge 1 $ defined over $ \F_q $ , the finite field of $ q $ elements .	Let $ # \cC ( \F_ { q^n } ) $ be the number of $ \F_ { q^n } $ -rational points on $ \cC $ .	Under a certain multiplicative independence condition on the roots of the zeta-function of $ \cC $ , we derive an asymptotic formula for the number of $ n =1 , ... , N $ such that $ ( # \cC ( \F_ { q^n } ) - q^n -1 ) /2gq^ { n/2 } $ belongs to a given interval $ \cI \subseteq [ -1,1 ] $ .	The above multiplicative independence condition has , recently , been considered by E. Kowalski in statistical settings .
4	We also show that in short intervals of certain lengths the divisor function has a Gaussian limiting distribution .	We investigate the behavior of the divisor function in both short intervals and in arithmetic progressions .	The latter problem was recently studied by \'E .	Fouvry , S. Ganguly , E. Kowalski , and Ph.Michel .	We prove a complementary result to their main theorem .
4	This value is found to be less or equal for all $ m\ne 0 $ , $ { \rm Im } ( m ) \ge 0 $ and $ | m| & lt ; +\infty $ than for $ | m| =+\infty $ , i.e.when the $ \Delta { \cal E } $ term is absent .	Solutions to the equation $ \partial_t { \cal E } ( x , t ) -\frac { i } { 2m } \Delta { \cal E } ( x , t ) =\lambda| S ( x , t ) |^2 { \cal E } ( x , t ) $ are investigated , where $ S ( x , t ) $ is a complex Gaussian field with zero mean and specified covariance , and $ m\ne 0 $ is a complex mass with $ { \rm Im } ( m ) \ge 0 $ .	For real $ m $ this equation describes the backscattering of a smoothed laser beam by an optically active medium .	Assuming that $ S ( x , t ) $ is the sum of a finite number of independent complex Gaussian random variables , we obtain an expression for the value of $ \lambda $ at which the $ q $ -th moment of $ | { \cal E } ( x , t ) | $ w.r.t .	the Gaussian field $ S $ diverges .
4	Most of the component pure states do not have rapid inflation , but when an inflaton is present and the states are weighted by the volume at the end of inflation , a much smaller number of states may dominate and give a large amount of inflation and hence may agree with observations .	A quantum state of the entire cosmos ( universe or multiverse ) is proposed which is the equal mixture of the Giddings-Marolf states that are asymptotically single de Sitter spacetimes in both past and future and are regular on the throat or neck of minimal three-volume .	That is , states are excluded that have a big bang or big crunch or which split into multiple asymptotic de Sitter spacetimes .	( For simplicity , transitions between different values of the cosmological constant are assumed not to occur , though different positive values are allowed . )	The entropy of this mixed state appears to be of the order of the three-fourths power of the Bekenstein-Hawking A/4 entropy of de Sitter spacetime .
1	The higher-twist contribution is essentially independent of $ x_F $ and therefore becomes dominant at large $ x_F $ , where the leading-twist contribution falls off as $ ( 1-x_F ) ^3 $ .	We present a higher-twist production mechanism for $ \eta_c $ and $ \chi_J $ charmonium at large momentum fraction $ x_F $ in pion-nucleon collisions .	We show that the higher-twist mechanism produces longitudinally polarized $ \chi_1 $ and $ \chi_2 $ .	For the $ \chi_2 $ , this is clearly different from the leading-twist prediction of transverse polarization .	For the $ \chi_1 $ , the polarization of the leading- and higher-twist contributions is qualitatively similar .
2	In this context , Alice must simultaneously satisfy the desired requirements on the distortion level at Bob , and the equivocation rate at the eavesdropper ( referred to as Eve ) .	The problem of secure lossy source-channel wiretapping with arbitrarily correlated side informations at both receivers is investigated .	This scenario consists of an encoder ( referred to as Alice ) that wishes to compress a source and send it through a noisy channel to a legitimate receiver ( referred to as Bob ) .	This setting can be seen as a generalization of the conventional problems of secure source coding with side information at the decoders , and the wiretap channel .	Inner and outer bounds on the rate-distortion-equivocation region for the case of arbitrary channels and side informations are derived .
0	Numerical simulations have shown that the X-shaped structure in the Milky Way bulge can naturally arise from the bar instability and buckling instability .	To understand the influence of the buckling amplitude on the morphology of the X-shape , we analyze three self-consistent numerical simulations of barred galaxies with different buckling amplitudes ( strong , intermediate and weak ) .	We derive the three-dimensional density with an adaptive kernel smoothing technique .	The face-on iso-density surfaces are all elliptical , while in the edge-on view , the morphology of buckled bars transitions with increasing radius , from a central boxy core to a peanut bulge and then to an extended thin bar .	Based on these iso-density surfaces at different density levels , we find no clear evidence for a well-defined structure shaped like a letter X .
4	Therefore the Phi junctions open interesting perspectives for the superconducting spintronics .	We study the proximity effect between conventional superconductor and magnetic normal metal with a spin-orbit interaction of the Rashba type .	Using the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and the quasiclassical Eilenberger approach it is demonstrated that the Josephson junction with such a metal as a weak link has a special non-sinusoidal current-phase relation .	The ground state of this junction is caracterized by the finite phase difference Phi , which is proportional to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and the exchange field in the normal metal .	The proposed mechanism of the Phi junction formation gives a direct coupling between the superconducting current and the magnetic moment in the weak link .
4	We compared them to those of mature and young BD , and young late-type companions to nearby stars with known ages , in order to identify and study gravity-sensitive features .	We obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra of seven young M9.5-L3 dwarfs classified in the optical .	We aim to confirm the low surface gravity of the objects in the NIR .	We also test whether atmospheric models correctly represent the formation and the settling of dust clouds in the atmosphere of young late-M and L dwarfs .	We used ISAAC at VLT to obtain the spectra of the targets .
2	From the analysis of the Cu-O bond lengths we find that the system forms a Wigner lattice .	Na5Cu3O6 , a new member of one dimensional charge ordered chain cuprates , was synthesized via the azide/nitrate route by reacting NaN3 , NaNO3 and CuO .	According to single crystal X-ray analysis , one dimensional CuO2 chains built up from planar , edge-sharing CuO4 squares are a dominant feature of the crystal structure .	The commensurate charge order allows to explicitly assign the valence states of either +2 or +3 to each copper atom resulting in a repetition according to Cu ( 2+ ) -Cu ( 3+ ) -Cu ( 2+ ) -Cu ( 2+ ) -Cu ( 3+ ) -Cu ( 2+ ) .	Following the theoretical analysis of the previously synthesized compounds Na3Cu2O4 and Na8Cu5O10 , the magnetic susceptibility was expected to show a large dimer gap .
4	It is shown that the system average information with time does not increase .	The evolution of a quasi-isolated finite quantum system from a nonequilibrium initial state is considered .	The condition of quasi-isolation allows for the description of the system dynamics on the general basis , without specifying the system details and for arbitrary initial conditions .	The influence of surrounding results in ( at least partial ) equilibration and decoherence .	The resulting equilibrium state bears information on initial conditions and is characterized by a representative ensemble .
2	In our view , sufficient understanding has been acquired to warrant a formal mathematical consolidation .	In 1864 , Waage and Guldberg formulated the `` law of mass action . ''	Since that time , chemists , chemical engineers , physicists and mathematicians have amassed a great deal of knowledge on the topic .	A major goal of this consolidation is to solidify the mathematical foundations of mass action chemistry -- to provide precise definitions , elucidate what can now be proved , and indicate what is only conjectured .	In addition , we believe that the law of mass action is of intrinsic mathematical interest and should be made available in a form that might transcend its application to chemistry alone .
4	The very closeness of the superconducting phase to the spin-density-wave instability suggests that the magnetic fluctuations play a key role in the superconducting paring mechanism .	A series of layered CeO $ _ { 1-x } $ F $ _x $ FeAs compounds with x=0 to 0.20 are synthesized by solid state reaction method .	Similar to the LaOFeAs , the pure CeOFeAs shows a strong resistivity anomaly near 145 K , which was ascribed to the spin-density-wave instability .	F-doping suppresses this instability and leads to the superconducting ground state .	Most surprisingly , the superconducting transition temperature could reach as high as 41 K. The very high superconducting transition temperature strongly challenges the classic BCS theory based on the electron-phonon interaction .
4	We compare various known representations and describe some nontrivial applications .	Matrix models and related Spin-Calogero-Sutherland models are of major relevance in a variety of subjects , ranging from condensed matter physics to QCD and low dimensional string theory .	They are characterized by integrability and exact solvability .	Their continuum , field theoretic representations are likewise of definite interest .	In this paper we describe various continuum , field theoretic representations of these models based on bosonization and collective field theory techniques .
1	It is found that the ground-state correlation effects are significant especially in the octupole excitation .	The effects of the correlations in the ground state of $ ^ { 16 } $ O on the octupole and dipole excitations are studied using the extended random phase approximation ( ERPA ) derived from the time-dependent density-matrix theory .	It is shown that the first $ 3^- $ state calculated in the random phase approximation ( RPA ) is shifted upward when the self-energy contributions are included in particle - hole pairs .	The coupling to the two particle - two hole states plays a role in shifting the first $ 3^- $ state down to the right position .	It is also found that the dipole strength is fragmented due to the partial occupation of the single-particle states and that the peak position of the giant dipole resonance calculated in ERPA is little changed from that in RPA due to the above-mentioned competing effects : the increase in particle - hole energy and the coupling to two particle - two hole configurations .
3	However , we find that this mechanism also introduces an energy splitting due to a local field effect , and the whole oscillator strength is contained in the higher-energy component , while the lowest-energy state remains dark and needs an extrinsic spin-flip mechanism for the decay .	We perform a theoretical study of radiative decay of dark intravalley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers .	This decay necessarily involves an electronic spin flip .	The intrinsic decay mechanism due to interband spin-flip dipole moment perpendicular to the monolayer plane , gives a rate about 100 -- 1000 times smaller than that of bright excitons .	Rashba effect due to a perpendicular electric field or a dielectric substrate , gives a negligible radiative decay rate ( about $ 10^7 $ times slower than that of bright excitons ) .
4	) , whereas for hard optimization problems like 3-SAT or Bicoloring it provides new upper bounds for their critical thresholds ( \gamma_c^ { var } =4.396 and \gamma_c^ { var } =2.149 resp . ) .	We study the low temperature properties of p-spin glass models with finite connectivity and of some optimization problems .	Using a one-step functional replica symmetry breaking Ansatz we can solve exactly the saddle-point equations for graphs with uniform connectivity .	The resulting ground state energy is in perfect agreement with numerical simulations .	For fluctuating connectivity graphs , the same Ansatz can be used in a variational way : For p-spin models ( known as p-XOR-SAT in computer science ) it provides the exact configurational entropy together with the dynamical and static critical connectivities ( for p=3 , \gamma_d=0.818 and \gamma_s=0.918 resp .
4	The peak height increases dramatically with increasing molecular weight and decreases with increased concentrations of added salt .	A self-consistent mode-coupling theory is presented for the viscosity of solutions of charged rod-like polymers .	The static structure factor used in the theory is obtained from polymer integral equation theory ; the Debye-H\ '' { u } ckel approximation is inadequate even at low concentrations .	The theory predicts a non-monotonic dependence of the reduced excess viscosity , $ \eta_R $ , on concentration from the behaviour of the static structure factor in polyelectrolyte solutions .	The theory predicts that the peak in $ \eta_R $ occurs at concentrations slightly lower than the overlap threshold concentration , $ c^\ast $ .
1	The force evaluation of the $ N $ -body problem was implemented in Cg using the GPU directly to speed-up the calculations .	We present the results of gravitational direct $ N $ -body simulations using the commercial graphics processing units ( GPU ) NVIDIA Quadro FX1400 and GeForce 8800GTX , and compare the results with GRAPE-6Af special purpose hardware .	The integration of the equations of motions were , running on the host computer , implemented in C using the 4th order predictor-corrector Hermite integrator with block time steps .	We find that for a large number of particles ( $ N \apgt 10^4 $ ) modern graphics processing units offer an attractive low cost alternative to GRAPE special purpose hardware .	A modern GPU continues to give a relatively flat scaling with the number of particles , comparable to that of the GRAPE .
3	The elastic anomaly seems not to be associated with the antiferromagnetic transition , which is distinct from the MIT in Nd0.65Eu0.35NiO3 .	Measurements are presented of the complex dynamic Young 's modulus of NdNiO3 and Nd0.65Eu0.35NiO3 through the Metal-Insulator Transition ( MIT ) .	On cooling , the modulus presents a narrow dip at the MIT followed by an abrupt stiffening of ~6 % .	The anomaly is reproducible between cooling and heating in Nd0:65Eu0:35NiO3 but only appears as a slow stiffening during cooling in undoped NdNiO3 , conformingly with the fact that the MIT in RNiO3 changes from strongly first order to second order when the mean R size is decreased .	It is concluded that the steplike stiffening is due to the disappearance or freezing of dynamic Jahn- Teller ( JT ) distortions through the MIT , where the JT active Ni3+ is disproportionated into alternating Ni3+d and Ni3-d .
2	The failure time , that is the time when a first crack forms , is highly random .	Mechanical components that are exposed to cyclic mechanical loading fail at loads that are well below the ultimate tensile strength .	This process is known as fatigue .	In this work we review some recent developments in the modelling of probabilistic failure times , understood as the time to the formation of a fatigue crack .	We also discuss the how probabilistic models can be used in shape design with the design intent of optimizing the component 's reliability .
1	We propose an efficient algorithm that transforms any characteristic set into the canonical one .	We study the concept of canonical characteristic set of a characterizable differential ideal .	We prove the basic properties of canonical characteristic sets .	In particular , we show that in the ordinary case for any ranking the order of each element of the canonical characteristic set of a characterizable differential ideal is bounded by the order of the ideal .	Finally , we propose a factorization-free algorithm for computing the canonical characteristic set of a characterizable differential ideal represented as a radical ideal by a set of generators .
3	This astrometric technique uses phase referencing , and the current techniques and limitations are discussed , using the results from four experiments .	Reference systems and frames are crucial for high precision absolute astrometric work , and their foundations must be well-defined .	The current frame , the International Celestial Reference Frame , will be discussed : its history , the use of the group delay as the measured quantity , the positional accuracy of 0.3 milliarcsec , and possible future improvements .	On the other hand , for the determination of the motion of celestial objects , accuracies approaching 0.01 milliarcsec can be obtained by measuring the differential position between the target object and nearby stationary sources .	Brief comments are included on the interpretation of the Jupiter gravity deflection experiment of September 2002 .
0	We make a first calculation of eigenfrequencies of radial pulsations of neutron stars with quark cores in a general relativistic formalism given by Chandrasekhar .	The equations of state ( EOS ) used to estimate such eigenfrequencies have been derived by taking proper care of the hadron-quark phase transition .	The hadronic EOS 's have been obtained in the framework of the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock and relativistic mean field theories , whereas the quark EOS has been derived within the MIT bag model .	We find that the periods of oscillations of neutron stars with a quark core show a kink , which is associated with the presence of a mixed phase region .	Also , oscillation periods show significant differences between ordinary neutron stars and neutron stars with dynamical quark phases .
0	We present the results of 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations of idealized protoplanetary discs that examine the formation and evolution of vortices by the vertical shear instability ( VSI ) .	In agreement with recent work , we find that discs with radially decreasing temperature profiles and short thermal relaxation time-scales , are subject to the axisymmetric VSI .	In three dimensions , the resulting velocity perturbations give rise to quasi-axisymmetric potential vorticity perturbations that break-up into discrete vortices , in a manner that is reminiscent of the Rossby wave instability .	Discs with very short thermal evolution time-scales ( i.e . { \tau } & lt ; 0.1 local orbit periods ) develop strong vorticity perturbations that roll up into vortices that have small aspect ratios ( { \chi } & lt ; 2 ) and short lifetimes ( ~ a few orbits ) .	Longer thermal time-scales give rise to vortices with larger aspect ratios ( 6 & lt ; { \chi } & lt ; 10 ) , and lifetimes that depend on the entropy gradient .
4	The relationship G ~ 1/sqrt ( D ) is observed to approximately hold for two program-like systems .	Several genetic programming systems are created , each solving a different problem .	In these systems , the median number of generations G needed to evolve a working program is measured .	The behavior of G is observed as the difficulty of the problem is increased .	In these systems , the density D of working programs in the universe of all possible programs is measured .
4	These systems behave , furthermore , as conducting needles in photoabsorption processes .	Linear chains of carbon atoms have been proposed as the electron emitting structures of open tip carbon nanotubes subject to an electric field .	To better understand the implications of the results of Smalley and collaborators , the electromagnetic response of linear carbon chains to both static and dynamics fields have been studied , making use of ab-initio methods .	It is found that the associated emission currents , plotted as a function of the bias potential , follow Fowler-Nordheim intensity-voltage curves typical of the field emission of metallic tips .	Under standard bias conditions , linear carbon chains of one nanometer of length are expected to deliver currents of the order of one microampere .
2	We consider very general settings for both contextual bandits ( arbitrary policy sets , e.g.Dudik et al .	We study contextual bandits with ancillary constraints on resources , which are common in real-world applications such as choosing ads or dynamic pricing of items .	We design the first algorithm for solving these problems that handles constrained resources other than time , and improves over a trivial reduction to the non-contextual case .	( UAI'11 ) ) and bandits with resource constraints ( bandits with knapsacks , Badanidiyuru et al .	( FOCS'13 ) ) , and prove a regret guarantee with near-optimal statistical properties .
4	Let $ A $ be a unital AH-algebra ( not necessarily simple ) and let $ \af\in Aut ( A ) $ be an automorphism .	Let $ C $ be a unital AH-algebra and let $ A $ be a unital separable simple \CA with tracial rank zero .	Suppose that $ \phi_1 , \phi_2 : C\to A $ are two unital monomorphisms .	We show that there is a continuous path of unitaries $ \ { u_t : t\in [ 0 , \infty ) \ } $ of $ A $ such that $ $ \lim_ { t\to\infty } u_t^*\phi_1 ( a ) u_t=\phi_2 ( a ) \tforal a\in C $ $ if and only if $ [ \phi_1 ] = [ \phi_2 ] $ in $ KK ( C , A ) , $ $ \tau\circ \phi_1=\tau\circ \phi_2 $ for all $ \tau\in T ( A ) $ and the rotation map $ { \tilde\eta } _ { \phi_1 , \phi_2 } $ associated with $ \phi_1 $ and $ \phi_2 $ is zero .	In particular , an automorphism $ \af $ on a unital separable simple \CA $ A $ in $ { \cal N } $ with tracial rank zero is asymptotically inner if and only if $ $ [ \af ] = [ { \rm id } _A ] \text { in } KK ( A , A ) $ $ and the rotation map $ { \tilde\eta } _ { \phi_1 , \phi_2 } $ is zero .
0	We revisit the problem of quantizing field theories on noncommutative Moyal spacetime with \emph { light-like } noncommutativity .	To tackle the issues arising from noncommuting and hence nonlocal time , we argue that for this case light-front quantization procedure should be employed .	In this appropriate quantization scheme we perform the non-planar loop analysis for the light-like noncommutative field theories .	One of the important and peculiar features of light-front quantization is that the UV cutoff of the light-cone Hamiltonian manifests itself as an IR cutoff for the light-cone momentum , $ p^+ $ .	Due to this feature , the naive results of covariant quantization for the light-like case allude to the absence of the UV/IR mixing in the light-front quantization .
4	These calculations overestimate the DR rates by factors of ~2 or underestimate it by factors of ~2 to orders of magnitude , but none are in good agreement with our results .	In photoionized gases with cosmic abundances , dielectronic recombination ( DR ) proceeds primarily via nlj -- & gt ; nl'j ' core excitations ( Dn=0 DR ) .	We have measured the resonance strengths and energies for Fe XVIII to Fe XVII and Fe XIX to Fe XVIII Dn=0 DR .	Using our measurements , we have calculated the Fe XVIII and Fe XIX Dn=0 DR DR rate coefficients .	Significant discrepancies exist between our inferred rates and those of published calculations .
3	For the D=3 model , there indeed exist conserved B ~ dRdR in the linearized limit .	We attempt to generalize the familiar covariantly conserved Bel-Robinson tensor B_ { mnab } ~ R R of GR and its recent topologically massive third derivative order counterpart B ~ RDR , to quadratic curvature actions .	Two very different models of current interest are examined : fourth order D=3 `` new massive '' , and second order D & gt ; 4 Lanczos-Lovelock , gravity .	On dimensional grounds , the candidates here become B ~ DRDR+RRR .	However , despite a plethora of available cubic terms , B can not be extended to the full theory .
2	Informally speaking , the event that a new state is visited at a large time $ t $ may be considered a `` surprise '' .	In a Markov chain started at a state $ x $ , the hitting time $ \tau ( y ) $ is the first time that the chain reaches another state $ y $ .	We study the probability $ \mathbf { P } _x ( \tau ( y ) = t ) $ that the first visit to $ y $ occurs precisely at a given time $ t $ .	We prove the following three bounds : 1 ) In any Markov chain with $ n $ states , $ \mathbf { P } _x ( \tau ( y ) = t ) \le \frac { n } { t } $ .	2 ) In a reversible chain with $ n $ states , $ \mathbf { P } _x ( \tau ( y ) = t ) \le \frac { \sqrt { 2n } } { t } $ for $ t \ge 4n + 4 $ .
2	The non-relativistic D-brane , NS5-brane , F-string and KK monopole metrics have asymptotically space and time translations , space rotations , Galilean symmetries and a particle number symmetry .	We construct gravitational non-relativistic brane solutions of type IIA/IIB string theories and M-theory and their near-horizon geometries .	The non-relativistic M2 and M5-brane metrics have Schroedinger symmetries with dynamical exponent z=3/2 and z=3 , respectively , whereas the known D3-brane solution has z=2 .	We construct two different gravitational backgrounds of a non-relativistic D1-D5 system , both having asymptotically Schroedinger symmetry with exponent z=2 .	We study the properties of the solutions and their phase diagram .
2	A defining challenge at this stage is the controlled integration of these individual functional atoms into extended , scalable atomic circuits .	The advent of devices based on single dopants , such as the single atom transistor , the single spin magnetometer and the single atom memory , motivates the quest for strategies that permit to control matter with atomic precision .	Manipulation of individual atoms by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy provides ways to store data in atoms , encoded either into their charge state , magnetization state or lattice position .	Here we present a robust digital atomic scale memory of up to 1 kilobyte ( 8,000 bits ) using an array of individual surface vacancies in a chlorine terminated Cu ( 100 ) surface .	The memory can be read and rewritten automatically by means of atomic scale markers , and offers an areal density of 502 Terabits per square inch , outperforming state-of-the-art hard disk drives by three orders of magnitude .
2	In fact , it remains possible that this index is a perfect discriminant of duality .	Romelsberger 's index has been argued to be an RG-invariant and , therefore , Seiberg-duality-invariant object that counts protected operators in the IR SCFT of an N=1 theory .	These claims have so far passed all tests .	The investigation presented here bolsters such optimism .	It is shown that the conditions of total ellipticity , which are needed for the mathematical manifestation of duality , are equivalent to the conditions ensuring non-anomalous gauge and flavor symmetries and the matching of ( most ) 't Hooft anomalies .
3	This scaling relation suggests that the black hole masses of NLS1s ( narrow-line Seyfert 1s ) are relatively low .	This dissertation presents synthetic spectra and response functions of the red giant stellar line emission model of active galactic nuclei .	Our results agree with the fundamental line emission characteristics of active galactic nuclei within the model uncertainties if the following additional assumptions are made : 1 ) the mean stellar mass loss rates decrease with distance from the black hole , and 2 ) the mean ionization parameters are lower than those postulated in Kazanas ( 1989 ) .	For models with enhanced mass loss , the zero-intensity-full-widths of the line profiles are proportional to the black hole mass to the power of 1/3 .	Models with enhanced mass loss also predict minimum line/continuum delays that are proportional to the zero-intensity-full-widths of the profiles .
3	The detection of a strong 6.4 keV line in NGC 3690 clearly demonstrates the existence of an AGN in this galaxy , while the presence of a strong 6.7 keV Fe-Kalpha line in the spectrum of IC 694 suggests that also this nucleus might harbor an AGN .	Recent BeppoSAX observations of Arp 299 , a powerful far-IR merging starburst system composed of IC 694 and NGC 3690 , clearly unveiled for the first time in this system the presence of a strongly absorbed active galactic nucleus ( AGN ) .	However the system was not spatially resolved by BeppoSAX .	Here we present the analysis of archival Chandra and ( for the first time ) XMM-Newton observations , which allow us to disentangle the X-ray emission of the two galaxies .	This would be the second discovery of two AGNs in a merging system after NGC 6240 .
0	We review the quantitative science that can be and has been done with redshift and peculiar velocity surveys of galaxies in the nearby universe .	After a brief background setting the cosmological context for this work , the first part of this review focuses on redshift surveys .	The practical issues of how redshift surveys are carried out , and how one turns a distribution of galaxies into a smoothed density field , are discussed .	Then follows a description of major redshift surveys that have been done , and the local cosmography out to 8,000 km/s that they have mapped .	We then discuss in some detail the various quantitative cosmological tests that can be carried out with redshift data .
4	The boundaries of the mixed phase and the related critical points for symmetric and asymmetric matter are obtained .	It is believed that there exists a rich phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) at finite temperature and baryon density , namely , the deconfinement process from hadron gas to quark-gluon plasma , the transition from chiral symmetry breaking phase to the symmetry restoration phase , and the color superconductivity at low temperature and high baryon density .	In the present work we study the hadron-quark phase transition by investigating the binodal surface and extending it to finite temperature in order to mimic the QCD phase diagram .	In order to obtain these conditions we use different models for the two possible phases , namely the quark and hadron phases .	The phase separation boundary ( binodal ) is determined by the Gibbs criteria for phase equilibrium .
1	The secondary beams were selected and separated by the fragment separator BigRIPS and incident at ~240 meV/u on a natural carbon ( secondary ) target , which was surrounded by the DALI2 array to detect coincident de-excitation gammarays .	The structure of the neutron rich sodium isotopes 31,32,33Na was investigated by means of in-beam gammaray spectroscopy following one-neutron knockout and inelastic scattering of radioactive beams provided by the RIKEN Radioactive Ion Beam Factory .	Scattered particles were identified by the spectrometer ZeroDegree .	In 31Na , a new decay gammaray was observed in coincidence with the known ( 5/2+ ) - & gt ; 3/2 ( + ) transition , while for 32,33Na excited states are reported for the first time .	From a comparison to state-of-the-art shell model calculations it is concluded that the newly observed excited state in 31Na belongs to a rotational band formed by a 2p2h intruder configuration within the `` Island of Inversion '' .
0	We report on 1.7 and 5.0 GHz observations of the z=3.087 radio galaxy B3 J2330+3927 , using the Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) , and archival 1.4 and 8.4 GHz Very Large Array ( VLA ) data .	Our VLBA data identify a compact , flat spectrum ( \alpha_ { 1.7 GHz } ^ { 5 GHz } = -0.2 +/- 0.1 ; S_\nu ~ \nu^\alpha ) radio component as the core .	The VLA images show that the fraction of core emission is very large ( f_c \approx 0.5 at 8.4 GHz ) , and reveal a previously undetected , very faint counterjet , implying a radio lobe flux density ratio R & gt ; = 11 and a radio lobe distance ratio Q \approx 1.9 .	Those values are much more common in quasars than in radio galaxies , but the optical/near-IR spectra show a clear type II AGN for B3 J2330+3927 , confirming that it is indeed a radio galaxy .	Unlike all other radio galaxies , the bright Ly-\alpha emitting gas is located towards the furthest radio arm .
4	It is found that the introduction of a non-zero net baryon number does not change the lifetime of the droplets significantly .	We present an extended version of the dynamical model for a multi-quark droplet evolution described in our proceeding paper .	The model includes collective expansion of the droplet , effects of the vacuum pressure and surface tension , and now a non-zero baryon number .	The hadron emission from the droplet is described following Weisskopf 's statistical model .	We consider evolutions of droplets with different initial temperatures and net baryon number .
2	In this paper we present calculations , which predict that this phase transition can also be induced by an ultrashort laser pulse in As under pressure .	In Arsenic a pressure-induced solid-solid phase transition from the A7 into the simple cubic structure has been experimentally demonstrated [ Beister et al. , Phys.Rev .	B 41 , 5535 ( 1990 ) ] .	In addition , calculations for the pressure-induced phase transition are presented .	Using density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation , we found that the pressure-induced phase transition takes place at 26.3 GPa and is accompanied by a volume change `` Delta V '' = 0.5 bohr^3/atom .
1	A recent formulation of the transport problem in this kind of composites treats each conducting particle as electrically connected to all others via tunneling conductances to form a global tunneling network .	In conductor-insulator composites in which the conducting particles are dispersed in an insulating continuous matrix the electrical connectedness is established by interparticle quantum tunneling .	Here , we extend this approach to nonhomogeneous composites with a segregated distribution of the conducting phase .	We consider a model of segregation in which large random insulating spherical inclusions forbid small conducting particles to occupy homogeneously the volume of the composite , and allow tunneling between all pairs of the conducting objects .	By solving numerically the corresponding tunneling resistor network , we show that the composite conductivity is enhanced by segregation and that it may remain relatively large also for very small values of the conducting filler concentration .
0	This paper describes a lossy method for compressing raw images produced by CCDs or similar devices .	The method is very simple : lossy quantization followed by lossless compression using general-purpose compression tools such as gzip and bzip2 .	A key feature of the method is that compressed images can be converted to FITS files simply by decompressing with gunzip or bunzip2 , and this is a significant advantage for distributing compressed files .	The degree of quantization is chosen to eliminate low-order bits that over-sample the noise , contain no information , and are difficult or impossible to compress .	The method is lossy but gives guarantees on the maximum absolute difference , the expected mean difference , and the expected RMS difference between the compressed and original images ; these guarantees make it suitable for use on raw images .
1	centered sub-Gaussian distribution , how to recover the signal $ \theta^* $ if $ D\theta^* $ is sparse { \rca under a linear transformation } $ D\in\mathbb { R } ^ { m\times p } $ ?	We consider the following signal recovery problem : given a measurement matrix $ \Phi\in \mathbb { R } ^ { n\times p } $ and a noisy observation vector $ c\in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } $ constructed from $ c = \Phi\theta^* + \epsilon $ where $ \epsilon\in \mathbb { R } ^ { n } $ is the noise vector whose entries follow i.i.d .	One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the following problem : $ $ \min_ { \theta } { 1\over 2 } \|\Phi\theta - c\|^2 + \lambda\|D\theta\|_1. $ $ This paper provides an upper bound of the estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by assuming that the design matrix $ \Phi $ is a Gaussian random matrix .	Specifically , we show 1 ) in the noiseless case , if the condition number of $ D $ is bounded and the measurement number $ n\geq \Omega ( s\log ( p ) ) $ where $ s $ is the sparsity number , then the true solution can be recovered with high probability ; and 2 ) in the noisy case , if the condition number of $ D $ is bounded and the measurement increases faster than $ s\log ( p ) $ , that is , $ s\log ( p ) =o ( n ) $ , the estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when $ p $ and $ s $ go to infinity .	Our results are consistent with those for the special case $ D=\bold { I } _ { p\times p } $ ( equivalently LASSO ) and improve the existing analysis .
1	The radio jets are roughly perpendicular to the dust which is used to constrain the Doppler boosting factors of the radio jet and cores .	We have observed a complete sample of 21 nearby ( D & lt ; 70h^ { -1 } Mpc ) Fanaroff & amp ; Riley Type I galaxies with HST/WFPC2 and detected dust disks and lanes in 19 of them .	The VLBA core flux correlates with the central Halpha+ [ NII ] flux which might indicate that the VLBA core is dominated by an isotropic component .	Twelve galaxies show nuclear optical sources .	We discuss various possible origins for this emission .
2	The analysis includes the cases where the total energy of the space-time is positive or negative .	Using numerical methods we present the first full nonlinear study of phantom scalar field accreted into a black hole .	We study different initial configurations and find that the accretion of the field into the black hole can reduce its area down to 50 percent within time scales of the order of few masses of the initial horizon .	The confirmation of this effect in full nonlinear general relativity implies that the accretion of exotic matter could be considered an evaporation process .	We speculate that if this sort of exotic matter has some cosmological significance , this black hole area reduction process might have played a crucial role in black hole formation and population .
2	We propose an elementary model based on the effective recording time window ( ERTW ) to compute the switching probability of bits during HARM of bit-patterned media .	Heat-assisted magnetic recording ( HAMR ) is expected to be a key technology to significantly increase the areal storage density of magnetic recording devices .	At high temperatures thermally induced noise becomes a major problem , which must be overcome in order to reliably write magnetic bits with narrow transitions .	With few assumptions this analytical model allows to gain deeper insights into the basic noise mechanisms like AC and DC noise .	Finally , we discuss strategies to reduce noise and to increase the areal storage density of both bit-patterned as well as granular media .
0	We study the role of Chern -- Simons couplings for the appearance of enhanced symmetries of Cremmer -- Julia type in various theories .	It is shown explicitly that for generic values of the Chern -- Simons coupling there is only a parabolic Lie subgroup of symmetries after reduction to three space-time dimensions but that this parabolic Lie group gets enhanced to the full and larger Cremmer -- Julia Lie group of hidden symmetries if the coupling takes a specific value .	This is heralded by an enhanced isotropy group of the metric on the scalar manifold .	Examples of this phenomenon are discussed as well as the relation to supersymmetry .	Our results are also connected with rigidity theorems of Borel-like algebras .
1	The number of references has increased by 60 % between 1975 and 1995 , reflecting the increase ( by the same amount ) of the literature which must be cited , and of the number of pages per paper .	We have counted the number of references in 1179 papers published in Astronomy and Astrophysics over twenty years .	There are 1.5 times more references in predominantly observational fields than in others .	References are used 1.65 times in the text , and there is no trend with time or field .	They appear mostly in the introduction ( 30 % ) and in the main body of the paper ( 60 % ) , but papers in predominantly observational fields tend to use less references in the introduction and more in the main body than papers in the other fields .
0	We work entirely in the smooth category .	An embedding $ f : ( S^2\times S^1 ) \sqcup S^3\rightarrow { \mathbb R } ^6 $ is { \it Brunnian } , if the restriction of $ f $ to each component is isotopic to the standard embedding .	For each triple of integers $ k , m , n $ such that $ m\equiv n \pmod { 2 } $ , we explicitly construct a Brunnian embedding $ f_ { k , m , n } : ( S^2\times S^1 ) \sqcup S^3 \rightarrow { \mathbb R } ^6 $ such that the following theorem holds .	Theorem : Any Brunnian embedding $ f : ( S^2\times S^1 ) \sqcup S^3\rightarrow { \mathbb R } ^6 $ is isotopic to $ f_ { k , m , n } $ for some integers $ k , m , n $ such that $ m\equiv n \pmod { 2 } $ .	Two embeddings $ f_ { k , m , n } $ and $ f_ { k ' , m ' , n ' } $ are isotopic if and only if $ k=k ' $ , $ m\equiv m ' \pmod { 2k } $ and $ n\equiv n ' \pmod { 2k } $ .
4	In addition , we consider correlation functions of 2d $ \mathcal { N } = ( 2,2 ) ^* $ theory and their relation to equivariant quantum cohomology and equivariant integration of cotangent bundle of Grassmann manifolds .	We calculate partition function and correlation functions in A-twisted 2d $ \mathcal { N } = ( 2,2 ) $ theories and topologically twisted 3d $ \mathcal { N } =2 $ theories containing adjoint chiral multiplet with particular choices of $ R $ -charges and the magnetic fluxes for flavor symmetries .	According to Gauge-Bethe correspondence , they correspond to Heisenberg XXX and XXZ spin chain models .	We identify the partition function as the inverse of the norm of the Bethe eigenstates .	Correlation functions are identified as the coefficients of the expectation value of Baxter $ Q $ -operators .
4	PSR J1023-5746 has the smallest characteristic age ( tau_c=4.6 kyr ) and is the most energetic ( Edot=1.1E37 erg/s ) of all gamma-ray pulsars discovered so far in blind searches .	We report the discovery of eight gamma-ray pulsars in blind frequency searches using the LAT , onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope .	Five of the eight pulsars are young ( tau_c & lt ; 100 kyr ) , energetic ( Edot & gt ; 10^36 erg/s ) , and located within the Galactic plane ( |b| & lt ; 3 deg ) .	The remaining three are older , less energetic , and located off the plane .	Five pulsars are associated with sources included in the LAT bright gamma-ray source list , but only one , PSR J1413-6205 , is clearly associated with an EGRET source .
1	All possible dilepton final states with zero , one or two charged leptons that can arise from off-shell W and Z bosons or photons are considered .	We present next-to-leading order ( NLO ) predictions including QCD and electroweak ( EW ) corrections for the production and decay of off-shell electroweak vector bosons in association with up to two jets at the 13 TeV LHC .	All predictions are obtained using the automated implementation of NLO QCD+EW corrections in the OpenLoops matrix-element generator combined with the Munich and Sherpa Monte Carlo frameworks .	Electroweak corrections play an especially important role in the context of BSM searches , due to the presence of large EW Sudakov logarithms at the TeV scale .	In this kinematic regime , important observables such as the jet transverse momentum or the total transverse energy are strongly sensitive to multijet emissions .
4	Next , we specialize to focus on circular orbits in the equatorial plane of Kerr spacetime at $ O ( \mu ) $ .	We extend the gravitational self-force approach to encompass `self-interaction ' tidal effects for a compact body of mass $ \mu $ on a quasi-circular orbit around a black hole of mass $ M \gg \mu $ .	Specifically , we define and calculate at $ O ( \mu ) $ ( conservative ) shifts in the eigenvalues of the electric- and magnetic-type tidal tensors , and a ( dissipative ) shift in a scalar product between their eigenbases .	This approach yields four gauge-invariant functions , from which one may construct other tidal quantities such as the curvature scalars and the speciality index .	First , we analyze the general case of a geodesic in a regular perturbed vacuum spacetime admitting a helical Killing vector and a reflection symmetry .
4	However , the fluctuations of the local interfacial position are strongly suppressed by confinement and mutual interactions between lamellae .	The structure of lamellar phases of symmetric $ AB $ diblock copolymers in a thin film is investigated .	We quantitatively compare the composition profiles and profiles of individual segments in self-consistent field calculations with Monte Carlo simulations in the bond fluctuation model for chain length N=32 and $ \chi N=30 $ .	Three film thicknesses are investigated , corresponding to parallel oriented lamellae with 2 and 4 interfaces and a perpendicular oriented morphology .	Taking account of capillary waves , we find good quantitative agreement between the Monte Carlo simulations and the self-consistent field calculations .
4	They can also be tuned over orders of magnitude so that robust delay lines and interference devices are within reach .	Topological effects continue to fascinate physicists since more than three decades .	One of their main applications are high-precision measurements of the resistivity .	We propose to make also use of the spatially separated edge states .	It is possible to realize strongly direction-dependent group velocities .
2	The nuclei $ ^ { 168 } $ Yb , $ ^ { 172 } $ Hf , $ ^ { 176 } $ W , $ ^ { 184 } $ Os , $ ^ { 188 } $ Pt , $ ^ { 196 } $ Hg are found to be most stable isotope in the respective series in the neutron-deficient region .	We study binding energy , root- mean square radius , quadrapole deformation parameter , two-neutron separation energy and single particle energy levels for various isotopes of Ytterbium ( Yb ) , Hafnium ( Hf ) , Tungsten ( W ) , Osmium ( Os ) , Platinum ( Pt ) and Mercury ( Hg ) in $ Z = 70 - 80 $ drip-line region starting from $ N =80 $ to $ N=170 $ within the formalism of relativistic mean field ( RMF ) theory .	We compared our results with Finite Range Droplet Model ( FRDM ) and experimental data and found that the calculated results are in good agreement .	We also observe that there is a shape transition at about $ A=190 $ in $ Z=70-80 $ region .	The shape changes from oblate to highly prolate shape in their intrinsic ground state .
4	The result is a compact circuit that protects qubits from spontaneous loss to the environment , while also retaining the ability to perform fast , high-fidelity readout .	Physical implementations of qubits can be extremely sensitive to environmental coupling , which can result in decoherence .	While efforts are made for protection , coupling to the environment is necessary to measure and manipulate the state of the qubit .	As such , the goal of having long qubit energy relaxation times is in competition with that of achieving high-fidelity qubit control and measurement .	Here we propose a method that integrates filtering techniques for preserving superconducting qubit lifetimes together with the dispersive coupling of the qubit to a microwave resonator for control and measurement .
2	A simple theoretical model for designing broad-band absorbers is presented .	A simple design paradigm for making broad-band ultra-thin plasmonic absorbers is introduced .	The absorber 's unit cell is composed of sub-units of various sizes , resulting in nearly 100 % absorbance at multiple adjacent frequencies and high absorbance over a broad frequency range .	It uses a single-resonance model to describe the optical response of each sub-unit and employs the series circuit model to predict the overall response .	Validity of the circuit model relies on short propagation lengths of the surface plasmons .
0	A gain graph is a graph whose edges are orientably labelled from a group .	A weighted gain graph is a gain graph with vertex weights from an abelian semigroup , where the gain group is lattice ordered and acts on the weight semigroup .	For weighted gain graphs we establish basic properties and we present general dichromatic and forest-expansion polynomials that are Tutte invariants ( they satisfy Tutte 's deletion-contraction and multiplicative identities ) .	Our dichromatic polynomial includes the classical graph one by Tutte , Zaslavsky 's two for gain graphs , Noble and Welsh 's for graphs with positive integer weights , and that of rooted integral gain graphs by Forge and Zaslavsky .	It is not a universal Tutte invariant of weighted gain graphs ; that remains to be found .
2	Recently , high-temperature superconductivity over 40 K was found in electron-doped FeSe superconductors including K $ _x $ Fe $ _ { 2-y } $ Se $ _2 $ , Li $ _ { 0.8 } $ Fe $ _ { 0.2 } $ OHFeSe , and 1 monolayer FeSe thin film .	Superconductivity originates from pairing of electrons .	Pairing channel on Fermi surface and pairing glue are thus two pivotal issues for understanding a superconductor .	However , their pairing mechanism remains controversial .	Here , we studied the systematic evolution of electronic structure in potassium-coated FeSe single crystal .
4	However Chicago must be treated separately .	We examine Illinois educational data from standardized exams and analyze primary factors affecting the achievement of public school students .	We focus on the simplest possible models : representation of data through visualizations and regressions on single variables .	Exam scores are shown to depend on school type , location , and poverty concentration .	For most schools in Illinois , student test scores decline linearly with poverty concentration .
4	It is shown here how the value of this hitherto mysterious timescale governing the memetic phase is explicable in terms of what happenned in the preceding genetic phase .	The last few million years on planet Earth have witnessed two remarkable phases of hominid development , starting with a phase of biological evolution characterised by rather rapid increase of the size of the brain .	This has been followed by a phase of even more rapid technological evolution and concomitant expansion of the size of the population , that began when our own particular `sapiens ' species emerged , just a few hundred thousand years ago .	The present investigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution mechanism governing the first phase , and the memetic evolution mechanism governing the second phase .	From the outset of the latter until very recently -- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly governed by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T* , in which T* is a coefficient introduced ( in 1960 ) by von Foerster , who evaluated it empirically as about two hundred thousand million years .
3	In particular , we examine the behavior of the model in the vicinity of an unusual coexistence point that we call the `` conical '' point .	We examine the last unexplored regime of the asymmetric six-vertex model : the low-temperature phase of the so-called ferroelectric model .	The original publication of the exact solution , by Sutherland , Yang , and Yang , and various derivations and reviews published afterwards , do not contain many details about this regime .	We study the exact solution for this model , by numerical and analytical methods .	This point corresponds to additional singularities in the free energy that were not discussed in the original solution .
0	We represent a classical Maxwell-Bloch equation and related to it positive part of the AKNS hierarchy in geometrical terms .	The Maxwell-Bloch evolution is given by an infinitesimal action of a nilpotent subalgebra $ n_+ $ of affine Lie algebra $ \hat { sl } _2 $ on a Maxwell-Bloch phase space treated as a homogeneous space of $ n_+ $ .	A space of local integrals of motion is described using cohomology methods .	We show that hamiltonian flows associated to the Maxwell-Bloch local integrals of motion ( i.e.positive AKNS flows ) are identified with an infinitesimal action of an abelian subalgebra of the nilpotent subalgebra $ n_+ $ on a Maxwell- Bloch phase space .	Possibilities of quantization and latticization of Maxwell-Bloch equation are discussed .
3	We provide a multi-region scheme , and apply our method to motion segmentation .	We formulate a general energy and method for segmentation that is designed to have preference for segmenting the coarse structure over the fine structure of the data , without smoothing across boundaries of regions .	The energy is formulated by considering data terms at a continuum of scales from the scale space computed from the Heat Equation within regions , and integrating these terms over all time .	We show that the energy may be approximately optimized without solving for the entire scale space , but rather solving time-independent linear equations at the native scale of the image , making the method computationally feasible .	Experiments on a benchmark dataset shows that our method is less sensitive to clutter or other undesirable fine-scale structure , and leads to better performance in motion segmentation .
1	In this study we derived through an uniform and homogeneous method stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances for iron , silicium and nickel in 63 Post T-Tauri Stars from 11 nearby young associations .	The recently discovered coeval , moving groups of young stellar objects in the solar neighborhood represent invaluable laboratories to study recent star formation and to search for high metallicity stars which can be included in future exo-planet surveys .	We further compare the results with two different pre-main sequence ( PMS ) and main sequence ( MS ) star populations .	The stellar atmospheric parameters and the abundances presented here were derived using the equivalent width of individual lines in the stellar spectra through the excitation/ionization equilibrium of iron .	Moreover , we compared the observed Balmer lines with synthetic pro ? les calculated for model atmospheres with a different line formation code .
2	One suggested realization involves the convergence of the cavity field distribution to a single Fock state by conditional measurements performed on two-level atoms with fluctuating velocities after they cross the cavity .	We propose a scheme which can effectively restore fixed points in the quantum dynamics of repeated Jaynes-Cummings interactions followed by atomic state measurements , when the interaction times fluctuate randomly .	It is based on selection of superposed atomic states whose phase correlations tend to suppress the phase fluctuations of each separate state .	Another realization involves a trapped ion whose internal-motional state coupling fluctuates randomly .	Its motional state is made to converge to a Fock state by conditional measurements of the internal state of the ion .
3	The absorption band edges of Cu , Ag , and Au-doped TiO2 shift to the long wavelength region compared with the pure TiO2 .	We perform first-principles calculations to investigate the band structure , density of states , optical absorption , and the imaginary part of dielectric function of Cu , Ag , and Au-doped anatase TiO2 in 72 atoms systems .	The electronic structure results show that the Cu incorporation can lead to the enhancement of d states near the uppermost of valence band , while the Ag and Au doping cause some new electronic states in band gap of TiO2 .	Meanwhile , it is found that the visible optical absorptions of Cu , Ag , and Au-doped TiO2 , are observed by analyzing the results of optical properties , .which locate in the region of 400-1000 nm .	Furthermore , according to the calculated results , we propose the optical transition mechanisms of Cu , Ag , and Au-doped TiO2 , respectively .
4	In dynamics the presence of these `` priveleged '' velocitied results in phenomenon of quantization of fluxon velocities : in our numerical experiments a travelling kink-like excitation radiates energy and slows down to one of these particular velocities , taking a shape of predicted 2-pi-kink .	We study a model of Josephson layered structure which is characterized by two peculiarities : ( i ) superconducting layers are thin ; ( ii ) due to suppression of superconducting states in superconducting layers the current-phase relation is non-sinusoidal and is described by two sine harmonics .	The governing equation is a nonlocal generalization of double sine-Gordon ( NDSG ) equation .	We argue that the dynamics of fluxons in the NDSG model is unusual .	Specifically , we show that there exists a set of particular velocities for non-radiating fluxon propagation .
0	`` \textit { The noise is the signal } '' [ R. Landauer , Nature \textbf { 392 } , 658 ( 1998 ) ] emphasizes the rich information content encoded in fluctuations .	This paper assesses the dynamical role of fluctuations of a quantum system driven far from equilibrium , with laser-aligned molecules as a physical realization .	Time evolutions of the expectation value and the uncertainty of a standard observable are computed quantum mechanically and classically .	We demonstrate the intricate dynamics of the uncertainty that are strikingly independent of those of the expectation value , and their exceptional sensitivity to quantum properties of the system .	In general , detecting the time evolution of the fluctuations of a given observable provides information on the dynamics of correlations in a quantum system .
4	The purpose of this report is to show that , due to existence of the strong gradients of the impurity potential , kinks can be created mainly in the close vicinity of the impurities .	The purpose of this report is presentation of the main modifications of the standard Kibble-Zurek formalism caused by the existence of the unperfections in the system .	We know that the distribution of kinks created during a second order phase transition in pure systems is determined solely by the correlation length at freeze-out time .	The correlation length at that instant of time intuitively describes the size of the defect and therefore the number density of defects is limited by the possibility of holding kinks in a unit volume .	On the other hand if the system is populated by the impurities then kinks emerge mainly in knots of the force distribution which correspond to extremes of the impurity potential i.e.positions of imperfections .
3	The problem is approached using the language of Renormalization Group transformations in the space of probability densities .	In the classical theorems of extreme value theory the limits of suitably rescaled maxima of sequences of independent , identically distributed random variables are studied .	So far , only affine rescalings have been considered .	We show , however , that more general rescalings are natural and lead to new limit distributions , apart from the Gumbel , Weibull , and Fr\'echet families .	The limit distributions are fixed points of the transformation and the study of the differential around them allows a local analysis of the domains of attraction and the computation of finite-size corrections .
1	Recent work in deep networks highlighted that it is easy to generate images that humans would never classify as a particular object class , yet networks classify such images high confidence as that given class - deep network are easily fooled with images humans do not consider meaningful .	Deep networks have produced significant gains for various visual recognition problems , leading to high impact academic and commercial applications .	The closed set nature of deep networks forces them to choose from one of the known classes leading to such artifacts .	Recognition in the real world is open set , i.e.the recognition system should reject unknown/unseen classes at test time .	We present a methodology to adapt deep networks for open set recognition , by introducing a new model layer , OpenMax , which estimates the probability of an input being from an unknown class .
0	The effect of the Gauss -- Bonnet term on the SU ( 2 ) non -- Abelian regular stringy sphaleron solutions is studied within the non -- perturbative treatment .	It is found that the existence of regular solutions depends crucially on the value of the numerical factor $ \beta $ in front of the Gauss -- Bonnet term in the four -- dimensional effective action .	Numerical solutions are constructed in the N=1 , 2 , 3 cases for different $ \beta $ below certain critical values $ \beta_N $ which decrease with growing N ( N being the number of nodes of the Yang -- Mills function ) .	It is proved that for any static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat regular solution the ADM mass is exactly equal to the dilaton charge .	No solutions were found for $ \beta $ above critical values , in particular , for $ \beta=1 $ .
0	The stars of the middle main sequence have relatively quiescent outer layers , and unusual chemical abundance patterns may develop in their atmospheres .	The presence of chemical peculiarities reveal the action of such subsurface phenomena as gravitational settling and radiatively driven levitation of trace elements , and their competition with mixing processes such as turbulent diffusion .	We want to establish whether abundance peculiarities change as stars evolve on the main sequence , and provide observational constraints to diffusion theory .	We have performed spectral analysis of 15 magnetic Bp stars that are members of open clusters ( and thus have well-known ages ) , with masses between about 3 and 4 M_sun .	For each star , we measured the abundances of He , O , Mg , Si , Ti , Cr , Fe , Pr and Nd .
1	Central of these is a self-consistent model for the physical mechanism that provides the energy to start and drive the disruption of the star .	The rapidly growing base of observational data for supernova explosions of massive stars demands theoretical explanations .	We give arguments why the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism should still be regarded as the standard paradigm to explain most explosions of massive stars and show how large-scale and even global asymmetries can result as a natural consequence of convective overturn in the neutrino-heating region behind the supernova shock .	Since the explosion is a threshold phenomenon and depends sensitively on the efficiency of the energy transfer by neutrinos , even relatively minor differences in numerical simulations can matter on the secular timescale of the delayed mechanism .	To enhance this point , we present some results of recent one- and two-dimensional computations , which we have performed with a Boltzmann solver for the neutrino transport and a state-of-the-art description of neutrino-matter interactions .
2	Firstly , we address the bosonization of a bi-fundamental free Dirac fermion defined on a noncommutative ( NC ) Euclidean plane $ \IR_ { \theta } ^ { 2 } $ .	We perform the path-integral bosonization of the recently proposed noncommutative massive Thirring model ( NCMT $ _ { 1 } $ ) [ JHEP0503 ( 2005 ) 037 ] .	This model presents two types of current-current interaction terms related to the bi-fundamental representation of the group U ( 1 ) .	In this case we show that the fermion system is dual to two copies of the NC Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model .	Next , we apply the bosonization prescription to the NCMT $ _ { 1 } $ model living on $ \IR_ { \theta } ^ { 2 } $ and show that this model is equivalent to two-copies of the WZNW model and a two-field potential defined for scalar fields corresponding to the global $ U ( 1 ) \times U ( 1 ) $ symmetry plus additional bosonized terms for the four fermion interactions .
4	Thus the effect has some similarity with volcanic activity as suggested by Kundt .	It is suggested that the Tunguska event in June 1908 cm-large was due to a cm-large ball of a condensate of bound states of 6 top and 6 anti-top quarks containing highly compressed ordinary matter .	Such balls are supposed to make up the dark matter as we earlier proposed .	The expected rate of impact of this kind of dark matter ball with the earth seems to crudely match a time scale of 200 years between the impacts .	The main explosion of the Tunguska event is explained in our picture as material coming out from deep within the earth , where it has been heated and compressed by the ball penetrating to a depth of several thousand km .
4	We show that the sufficient conditions for the validity of the total quasi steady state assumption ( tQSSA ) , obtained in a single protein case by Borghans , de Boer and Segel can be extended to sufficient conditions for the validity of the tQSSA in a large class of enzymatic networks .	The Michaelis-Menten equation has played a central role in our understanding of biochemical processes .	It has long been understood how this equation approximates the dynamics of irreversible enzymatic reactions .	However , a similar approximation in the case of networks , where the product of one reaction can act as an enzyme in another , has not been fully developed .	Here we rigorously derive such an approximation in a class of coupled enzymatic networks where the individual interactions are of Michaelis-Menten type .
1	The dip is a feature in the diffuse spectrum of ultra-high energy ( UHE ) protons in the energy range $ 1\times 10^ { 18 } - 4\times 10^ { 19 } $ eV , which is caused by electron-positron pair production on the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) radiation .	We discuss the signatures of the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays in different scenarios , giving most attention to the dip scenario .	The dip scenario provides a simple physical description of the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays .	Here we summarize the signatures of the pair production dip model for the transition , most notably the spectrum , the anisotropy and the chemical composition .	The main focus of our work is however on the description of the features that arise in the elongation rate and in the distribution of the depths of shower maximum $ X_ { \rm max } $ in the dip scenario .
0	Here , a Finsler manifold ( M , F ) is considered with corresponding curvature tensor , regarded as 2-forms on the bundle of non-zero tangent vectors .	Certain subspaces of the tangent spaces of M determined by the curvature are introduced and called k-nullity foliations of the curvature operator .	It is shown that if the dimension of foliation is constant then the distribution is involutive and each maximal integral manifold is totally geodesic .	Characterization of the k-nullity foliation is given , as well as some results concerning constancy of the flag curvature , and completeness of their integral manifolds , providing completeness of ( M , F ) .	The introduced k-nullity space is a natural extension of nullity space in Riemannian geometry , introduced by S. S. Chern and N. H. Kuiper and enlarged to Finsler setting by H. Akbar-Zadeh and contains it as a special case .
2	We show that the noise effects along with non-normality can lead to the stochastic amplification of the magnetic field even in the subcritical case .	We present and analyze a simplified stochastic $ \alpha \Omega - $ dynamo model which is designed to assess the influence of additive and multiplicative noises , non-normality of dynamo equation , and nonlinearity of the $ \alpha - $ % effect and turbulent diffusivity , on the generation of a large-scale magnetic field in the subcritical case .	Our model incorporates random fluctuations in the $ \alpha - $ parameter and additive noise arising from the small-scale fluctuations of magnetic and turbulent velocity fields .	The criteria for the stochastic instability during the early kinematic stage are established and the critical value for the intensity of multiplicative noise due to $ \alpha - $ fluctuations is found .	We obtain numerical solutions of non-linear stochastic differential equations and find the series of phase transitions induced by random fluctuations in the $ \alpha - $ parameter .
1	Our method gives an alternative approach to a Concentration -- Compactness principle in $ W^ { m , \frac nm } _0 ( \Omega ) $ recently established by do \'O and Macedo .	We prove an improvement for the sharp Adams inequality in $ W^ { m , \frac nm } _0 ( \Omega ) $ where $ \Omega $ is a bounded domain in $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ inspired by Lions Concentration -- Compactness principle for the sharp Moser -- Trudinger inequality .	Moreover , when $ m $ is odd , we obtain an improvement for their result by finding the best exponent in this principle .	Our approach also is successfully applied to whole space $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ to establish an improvement for the sharp Adams inequalities in $ W^ { m , \frac nm } ( \mathbb { R } ^n ) $ due to Ruf , Sani , Lam , Lu , Fontana and Morpurgo .	This type of improvement is still unknown , in general , except the special case $ m=1 $ due to do \'O , de Souza , de Medeiros and Severo .
4	The results are corrected for detector effects , presented as particle-level distributions and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators .	Charged-particle distributions are measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV , using a data sample of nearly 9 million events , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 170 $ \mu $ b $ ^ { -1 } $ , recorded by the ATLAS detector during a special Large Hadron Collider fill .	The charged-particle multiplicity , its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the dependence of the mean transverse momentum on the charged-particle multiplicity are presented .	The measurements are performed with charged particles with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV and absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5 , in events with at least one charged particle satisfying these kinematic requirements .	Additional measurements in a reduced phase space with absolute pseudorapidity less than 0.8 are also presented , in order to compare with other experiments .
3	As the WMAP mission winds down and the Planck mission prepares to release data , I take a last look at what WMAP has to tell us about the origin of this unique Galactic feature .	The microwave `` haze '' was first discovered with the initial release of the full sky data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe .	It is diffuse emission towards the center of our Galaxy with spectral behavior that makes it difficult to categorize as any of the previously known emission mechanisms at those wavelengths .	With now seven years of WMAP data publicly available , we have learned much about the nature of the haze , and with the release of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the discovery of the gamma-ray haze/bubbles , we have had a spectacular confirmation of its existence at other wavelengths .	Much like the gamma-rays , the microwave haze/bubbles is elongated in latitude with respect to longitude by a factor of roughly two , and at high latitudes , the microwave emission cuts off sharply above ~35 degrees ( compared to ~50 degrees in the gammas ) .
1	The system is described on suitable macroscopic spatial and temporal scales by the inviscid Burgers ' equation ; the latter has shock solutions with a discontinuous jump from left density $ \rho_- $ to right density $ \rho_+ $ , $ \rho_- & lt ; \rho_+ $ , which travel with velocity $ ( 2p-1 ) ( 1-\rho_+-\rho_- ) $ .	The asymmetric simple exclusion process ( ASEP ) on a one-dimensional lattice is a system of particles which jump at rates $ p $ and $ 1-p $ ( here $ p & gt ; 1/2 $ ) to adjacent empty sites on their right and left respectively .	In the microscopic system we may track the shock position by introducing a second class particle , which is attracted to and travels with the shock .	In this paper we obtain the time invariant measure for this shock solution in the ASEP , as seen from such a particle .	The mean density at lattice site $ n $ , measured from this particle , approaches $ \rho_ { \pm } $ at an exponential rate as $ n\to\pm\infty $ , with a characteristic length which becomes independent of $ p $ when $ p/ ( 1-p ) & gt ; \sqrt { \rho_+ ( 1-\rho_- ) /\rho_- ( 1-\rho_+ ) } $ .
3	( 2 ) 70 % of the stellar mass is in disks , 10 % in bars , and 20 % in bulges .	We use the bulge Sersic index n and bulge-to-total ratio ( B/T ) to explore the fundamental question of how bulges form .	We perform 2D bulge-disk-bar decomposition on H-band images of 143 bright , high stellar mass ( & gt ; 1.0e10 solar masses ) low-to-moderately inclined ( i & lt ; 70 degrees ) spirals .	Our results are : ( 1 ) Our H-band bar fraction ( ~58 % ) is consistent with that from ellipse fits .	( 3 ) A large fraction ( ~69 % ) of bright spirals have B/T & lt ; 0.2 , and ~76 % have low n & lt ; 2 bulges .
2	For $ Pr \simeq 1 $ and intermediate non-Boussinesq effects we find reentrance of stable hexagons as the Rayleigh number is increased .	We study the stability and dynamics of non-Boussinesq convection in pure gases ( CO $ _2 $ and SF $ _6 $ ) with Prandtl numbers near $ Pr\simeq 1 $ and in a H $ _2 $ -Xe mixture with $ Pr=0.17 $ .	Focusing on the strongly nonlinear regime we employ Galerkin stability analyses and direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations .	For stronger non-Boussinesq effects the hexagons do not exhibit any amplitude instability to rolls .	Seemingly , this result contradicts the experimentally observed transition from hexagons to rolls .
4	Finally , we discuss similarities between the multiple refraction of light at the lenslet arrays and multiple refraction and reflection of cold atoms at a barrier in the presence of the light fields .	METATOYs can change the direction of light in ways that appear to , but do not actually , contravene the laws of wave optics .	This direction change applies only to part of the transmitted light beam ; the remainder gets re-directed differently .	For a specific example , namely confocal pairs of rectangular lenslet arrays with no dead area between lenslets , we calculate here the fractions of power of a uniform-intensity light beam incident from a specific ( but arbitrary ) direction that get re-directed in different ways , and we derive an equation describing this redirection .	This will facilitate assessment of the suitability of METATOYs for applications such as solar concentration .
2	Effectively , the free-electron AC polarizability of Ry electron is modulated by intensity landscape and can accept both positive and negative values .	Motivated by compelling advances in manipulating cold Rydberg ( Ry ) atoms in optical traps , we consider the effect of large extent of Ry electron wave function on trapping potentials .	We find that when the Ry orbit lies outside inflection points in laser intensity landscape , the atom can stably reside in laser intensity maxima .	We apply these insights to determining magic wavelengths for Ry-ground-state transitions for alkali atoms trapped in infrared optical lattices .	We find magic wavelengths to be around 10 $ \mu \mathrm { m } $ , with exact values that depend on Ry state quantum numbers .
2	Combining physical experiments and numerical simulations , we elucidate this collective behavior .	Coherent vortical motion has been reported in a wide variety of populations including living organisms ( bacteria , fishes , human crowds ) and synthetic active matter ( shaken grains , mixtures of biopolymers ) , yet a unified description of the formation and structure of this pattern remains lacking .	Here we report the self-organization of motile colloids into a macroscopic steadily rotating vortex .	We demonstrate that the emergent-vortex structure lives on the verge of a phase separation , and single out the very constituents responsible for this state of polar active matter .	Building on this observation , we establish a continuum theory and lay out a strong foundation for the description of vortical collective motion in a broad class of motile populations constrained by geometrical boundaries .
2	By using observational values for the energy and volume of the source , it is shown that the radiation pressure of an expanding GRB `fireball ' leads to the formation of a Schwinger critical field at the ambient medium immediately outside the `fireball ' .	A theory is proposed to explain with simplicity the basic observed properties of a Gamma Ray Burst ( GRB ) .	It employs a well-known result of Schwinger , that static electric fields in excess of a critical value are unstable to pair creation , and catastrophically produces a thermal plasma at temperatures & lt ; = 0.5 MeV .	This naturally provides a runaway solution which is inevitable , and which must involve a burst of gamma radiation in the core of the observed energy range and in an optically thin environment .	The observed burst duration of 1 -- 10 seconds is also a straightforward consequence of the theory .
0	We use the Bolshoi Simulation to find the most probable location of the Local Group ( LG ) in the cosmic web .	Our LG simulacra are pairs of halos with isolation and kinematic properties consistent with observations .	The cosmic web is defined using a tidal tensor approach .	We find that the LG 's preferred location is regions with a dark matter overdensity close to the cosmic average .	This makes filaments and sheets the preferred environment .
4	We argue that they are the first unambiguous manifestation of interactions in dc transport in the integer quantum Hall effect .	We find that mesoscopic conductance fluctuations in the quantum Hall regime in silicon MOSFETs display simple and striking patterns .	The fluctuations fall into distinct groups which move along lines parallel to loci of integer filling factor in the gate voltage-magnetic field plane .	Also , a relationship appears between the fluctuations on quantum Hall transitions and those found at low densities in zero magnetic field .	These phenomena are most naturally attributed to charging effects .
4	The significantly increased abundance of the early halos would naturally explain the observed source-subtracted near-IR cosmic infrared background ( CIB ) fluctuations , which can not be accounted for by known galaxy populations .	LIGO 's discovery of a gravitational wave from two merging black holes ( BHs ) of similar masses rekindled suggestions that primordial BHs ( PBHs ) make up the dark matter ( DM ) .	If so , PBHs would add a Poissonian isocurvature density fluctuation component to the inflation-produced adiabatic density fluctuations .	For LIGO 's BH parameters , this extra component would dominate the small-scale power responsible for collapse of early DM halos at z & gt ; 10 , where first luminous sources formed .	We quantify the resultant increase in high-z abundances of collapsed halos that are suitable for producing the first generation of stars and luminous sources .
4	In this paper we consider a discrete-time version of this model , focusing on the problem of identifying the dynamics and the noise characteristics of such a so-called L\'evy system .	L\'evy processes are widely used in financial mathematics to model return data .	Price processes are then defined as a corresponding geometric L\'evy process , implying the fact that returns are independent .	In this paper we propose an alternative class of models allowing to describe dependence between return data .	Technically such an alternative model class is obtained by considering finite dimensional linear stochastic SISO systems driven by a L\'evy process .
2	Moreover , it is demonstrated that both inflation and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe can be realized in a modified YM- $ F ( R ) $ gravity which is consistent with solar system tests .	We study inflationary cosmology and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe in non-minimal Yang-Mills ( YM ) theory , in which the YM field couples to a function of the scalar curvature .	It is shown that power-law inflation can be realized due to the non-minimal YM field-gravitational coupling which maybe caused by quantum corrections .	Furthermore , it is shown that this result can be realized also in a non-minimal vector- $ F ( R ) $ gravity .	In addition , we consider the duality of the non-minimal electromagnetic theory and that of the non-minimal YM theory , and also discuss the cosmological reconstruction of the YM theory .
4	It has a simple definition , with no reference to homology theory , that resembles graph expansion .	In this paper we establish some foundations regarding sheaves of vector spaces on graphs and their invariants , such as homology groups and their limits .	We then use these ideas to prove the Hanna Neumann Conjecture of the 1950 's ; in fact , we prove a strengthened form of the conjecture .	We introduce a notion of a sheaf of vector spaces on a graph , and develop the foundations of homology theories for such sheaves .	One sheaf invariant , its `` maximum excess , '' has a number of remarkable properties .
1	We find that for many very extended algebras almost all the A type representations that occur in the decomposition of the fundamental representations also occur in the adjoint representation of G+++ .	We consider the decomposition of the adjoint and fundamental representations of very extended Kac-Moody algebras G+++ with respect to their regular A type subalgebra which , in the corresponding non-linear realisation , is associated with gravity .	In particular , for E8+++ , this applies to all its fundamental representations .	However , there are some important examples , such as An+++ , where this is not true and indeed the adjoint representation contains no generator that can be identified with a space-time translation .	We comment on the significance of these results for how space-time can occur in the non-linear realisation based on G+++ .
2	These observations spectroscopically confirm previous suggestions of a break based on photometry .	We present new near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the outer edges of the young stellar cluster around the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center .	The observations show a break in the surface-density profile of young stars at approximately 13 arcsec ( 0.52 pc ) .	Using Gemini North 's Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer ( NIFS ) we are able to detect and separate early- and late-type stars with a 75 % completeness at Ks = 15.5 .	We sample a region with radii between 7 '' to 23 '' ( 0.28 pc to 0.92 pc ) from Sgr A* , and present new spectral classifications of 144 stars brighter than Ks = 15.5 , where 140 stars are late-type ( & gt ; 1 Gyr ) and only four stars are early-type ( young , 4-6 Myr ) .
2	Now we discuss the theoretical justification in further detail and counter a possible objection .	In former work , we showed that a quantum algorithm is the sum over the histories of a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50 % of the information about the solution of the problem - each history is a possible way of getting the advanced information and a possible result of computing the missing information .	We gave a theoretical justification of this 50 % advanced information rule and checked that it holds for a large variety of quantum algorithms .	We show that the rule is the generalization of a simple , well known , explanation of quantum nonlocality - where logical correlation between measurement outcomes is physically backed by a causal/deterministic/local process with causality allowed to go backward in time with backdated state vector reduction .	The possible objection is that quantum algorithms often produce the solution of the problem in an apparently deterministic way ( when their unitary part produces an eigenstate of the observable to be measured and measurement produces the corresponding eigenvalue - the solution - with probability 1 ) , while the present explanation of the speed up relies on the nondeterministic character of quantum measurement .
0	Quasilinear theory has long been used to treat the problem of a weak electron beam interacting with plasma and generating Langmuir waves .	Its extension to weak-turbulence theory treats resonant interactions of these Langmuir waves with other plasma wave modes , in particular ion-sound waves .	These are strongly damped in plasma of equal ion and electron temperatures , as sometimes seen in , for example , the solar corona and wind .	Weak turbulence theory is derived in the weak damping limit , with a term describing ion-sound wave damping then added .	In this paper we use the EPOCH particle-in-cell code to numerically test weak turbulence theory for a range of electron-ion temperature ratios .
3	The latter are shown to yield various concentration-type estimates for deviations of smooth ( not necessarily Lipschitz ) functions and measures of enlargements of sets corresponding to non-Euclidean norms .	We study a class of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with a general form of the energy functional .	The class generalizes various examples of modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities considered previously in the literature .	Refining a method of Aida and Stroock for the classical logarithmic Sobolev inequality , we prove that if a measure on $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ satisfies a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality then it satisfies a family of $ L^p $ -Sobolev-type inequalities with non-Euclidean norms of gradients ( and dimension-independent constants ) .	We also prove a two-level concentration result for functions of bounded Hessian and measures satisfying the classical logarithmic Sobolev inequality .
2	We give an explicit description of the Mordell-Weil group of the elliptic curve $ \displaystyle E_ { ( M , N ) } : y^2-Mxy-Ny=x^3 $ over $ \Q $ .	Let $ a , b , c $ be distinct positive integers .	Set $ M=a+b+c $ and $ N=abc $ .	In particular we determine the torsion subgroup of $ E_ { ( M , N ) } ( \Q ) $ and show that its rank is positive .	Furthermore there are infinitely many positive integers $ M $ that can be written in $ n $ different ways , $ n\in\ { 2,3\ } $ , as the sum of three distinct positive integers with the same product $ N $ and $ E_ { ( M , N ) } ( \Q ) $ has rank at least $ n $ .
2	announced an analytical solution of the two-dimensional Anderson localisation problem via the calculation of a generalised Lyapunov exponent using signal theory .	In a recent publication , J.Phys . : Condens.Matt .	14 13777 ( 2002 ) , Kuzovkov et.al .	Surprisingly , for certain energies and small disorder strength they observed delocalised states .	We study the transmission properties of the same model using well-known transfer matrix methods .
3	The non-linearity of thermal expansion leads to the special relation between the shear strain and volume change as a result of the elastic energy minimization .	An effect of the volume change upon proper ferroelastic ( martensitic ) phase transitions in cubic crystals is considered .	Corresponding terms in the Ginzburg-Landau expansion of the Gibbs free energy are analyzed for the first- as well as second-order phase transitions from cubic to tetragonal lattice under the action of uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure .	The pressure effect on the critical temperature as well as on the phase transition anomalies of isothermal compressibility and linear thermal expansion coefficient are studied and recent experimental data on thermal expansion anomalies in V $ _3 $ Si , In-Tl and Ni-Al are discussed .	This phenomenon can provide the transformation from FCC lattice to BCC one , observed in the iron alloys .
0	This paper provides an improved flamelet/progress variable ( FPV ) model for the simulation of turbulent combustion , employing the statistically most likely distribution ( SMLD ) approach for the joint probability density function ( PDF ) of the mixture fraction , Z , and of the progress parameter , { \Lambda } .	Steady-state FPV models are built presuming the func- tional shape of the joint PDF of Z and { \Lambda } in order to evaluate Favre-averages of thermody- namic quantities .	The mixture fraction is widely assumed to behave as a passive scalar with a mono-modal behaviour modelled by a \b { eta } -distribution .	Moreover , under the hypothesis that Z and { \Lambda } are statistically independent , the joint PDF coincides with the product of the two marginal PDFs .	In this work we discuss these two constitutive hypotheses .
4	We study a more realistic scenario where each gate is applied imperfectly .	Universal quantum simulation may provide insights into those many-body systems that can not be described classically , and that can not be efficiently simulated with current technology .	The Trotter formula , which decomposes a desired unitary time evolution of the simulator into a stroboscopic sequence of repeated elementary evolutions , is a key algorithmic component which makes quantum simulation of dynamics tractable .	The Trotter number $ n $ sets the timescale on which a computer running this algorithm is switched from one elementary evolution to another .	In the ideal case , the precision of the simulation can be arbitrarily controlled by increasing $ n $ .
0	It would be interesting to investigate the accuracy of the results obtained in the variational method , because it is important for studying hadron spectra .	One can define some criteria to judge the accuracy , or the quality of the trial function .	We employ a simple potential form to check how accurate the variational results obtained by a single-parameter trial function can be .	All the concerned problems , in particular , the relevant aspects on the application of hypervirial theorem in variational method for various potential forms , are discussed in every detail .	The qualitative conclusion of the work can be generalized to much more complicated cases .
2	A key ingredient in our approach is bypassing the need for `` black-box '' rounding of fractional solutions , which yields improved competitive ratios .	We study online scheduling problems on a single processor that can be viewed as extensions of the well-studied problem of minimizing total weighted flow time .	In particular , we provide a framework of analysis that is derived by duality properties , does not rely on potential functions and is applicable to a variety of scheduling problems .	We begin with an interpretation of Highest-Density-First ( HDF ) as a primal-dual algorithm , and a corresponding proof that HDF is optimal for total fractional weighted flow time ( and thus scalable for the integral objective ) .	Building upon the salient ideas of the proof , we show how to apply and extend this analysis to the more general problem of minimizing $ \sum_j w_j g ( F_j ) $ , where $ w_j $ is the job weight , $ F_j $ is the flow time and $ g $ is a non-decreasing cost function .
3	First , we apply the Maxwell iteration to the infinite moment system and determine the magnitude of each moment with respect to the Knudsen number .	This paper is a continuation of our earlier work \cite { NRxx } in which a numerical moment method with arbitrary order of moments was presented .	However , the computation may break down during the calculation of the structure of a shock wave with Mach number $ M_0 \geqslant 3 $ .	In this paper , we concentrate on the regularization of the moment systems .	After that , we obtain the approximation of high order moments and close the moment systems by dropping some high-order terms .
4	We prove in this article a lower bound on u_* , which is equivalent to log ( d ) as d goes to infinity .	We investigate the percolative properties of the vacant set left by random interlacements on Z^d , when d is large .	A non-negative parameter u controls the density of random interlacements on Z^d .	It is known from arXiv:0704.2560 , and arXiv:0808.3344 , that there is a non-degenerate critical value u_* , such that the vacant set at level u percolates when u & lt ; u_* , and does not percolate when u & gt ; u_* .	Little is known about u_* , however for large d , random interlacements on Z^d , ought to exhibit similarities to random interlacements on a ( 2d ) -regular tree , for which the corresponding critical parameter can be explicitly computed , see arXiv:0907.0316 .
0	We measured the polarization memory of excitonic and biexcitonic optical transitions from single quantum dots at either positive , negative or neutral charge states .	Positive , negative and no circular or linear polarization memory was observed for various spectral lines , under the same quasi-resonant excitation below the wetting layer band-gap .	We developed a model which explains both qualitatively and quantitatively the experimentally measured polarization spectrum for all these optical transitions .	We consider quite generally the loss of spin orientation of the photogenerated electron-hole pair during their relaxation towards the many-carrier ground states .	Our analysis unambiguously demonstrates that while electrons maintain their initial spin polarization to a large degree , holes completely dephase .
4	We found that bright outbursts ( peak luminosity & gt ; 10^ { 37 } erg s^-1 ) equal in number dimmer outbursts ( & lt ; 10^ { 36.6 } erg s^-1 ) .	Aql X-1 is the prototypical low mass X-ray binary transient .	The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All Sky Monitor provided a ~16 yr coverage revealing 20 outbursts .	This is by far the most extensive legacy of outbursts from the same source .	We investigated the outbursts characteristics in terms of energetics , peak luminosities , durations , decays and recurrence times .
4	This mechanism also leads to finite thermoelectric effects even in the presence of electron-hole symmetry .	Attaching a superconductor in good contact with a normal metal makes rise to a proximity effect where the superconducting correlations leak into the normal metal .	An additional contact close to the first one makes it possible to carry a supercurrent through the metal .	Forcing this supercurrent flow along with an additional quasiparticle current from one or many normal-metal reservoirs makes rise to many interesting effects .	The supercurrent can be used to tune the local energy distribution function of the electrons .
0	We study gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking in SU ( 5 ) supersymmetric grand unified theory with gauge fields as messengers .	The generated soft supersymmetry breaking parameters lead to close to maximal mixing scenario for the Higgs mass and highly reduce the fine tuning of electroweak symmetry breaking .	All gaugino , squark and slepton masses are determined by one parameter -- the supersymmetry breaking scale .	The characteristic features are : negative and non-universal squark and slepton masses squared at the unification scale , non-universal gaugino masses , and sizable soft-trilinear couplings .	In this scenario , all soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the unification scale can be smaller than 400 GeV and all the superpartners can be lighter than 400 GeV and still satisfy all the limits from direct searches for superpartners and also the limit on the Higgs mass .
0	We prove coding theorems for two scenarios of cooperating encoders for the multiple access channel with two classical inputs and one quantum output .	In the first scenario ( ccq-MAC with common messages ) , the two senders each have their private messages , but would also like to transmit common messages .	In the second scenario ( ccq-MAC with conferencing encoders ) , each sender has its own set of messages , but they are allowed to use a limited amount of noiseless classical communication amongst each other prior to encoding their messages .	This conferencing protocol may depend on each individual message they intend to send .	The two scenarios are related to each other not only in spirit - the existence of near-optimal codes for the ccq-MAC with common messages is used for proving the existence of near-optimal codes for the ccq-MAC with conferencing encoders .
3	NEXT has both good energy resolution ( & lt ; 1 % FWHM ) at the Q value of $ ^ { 136 } $ Xe and an extra handle for background identification provided by track reconstruction .	NEXT ( Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC ) is a neutrinoless double-beta ( \beta \beta 0\nu ) decay experiment that will operate at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory ( LSC ) .	It is an electroluminescent high-pressure gaseous xenon Time Projection Chamber ( TPC ) with separate read-out planes for calorimetry and tracking .	Energy resolution and background suppression are the two key features of any neutrinoless double beta decay experiment .	With the background model of NEXT , based on the detector simulation and the evaluation of the detector radiopurity , we can determine the sensitivity to a measurement of the \beta\beta 2\nu\ mode in NEW and to a \beta\beta 0\nu\ search in NEXT100 .
0	Let $ V $ be a simple VOA of CFT-type satisfying $ V'\cong V $ and $ \sigma $ a finite automorphism of $ V $ .	We prove that if all $ V $ -modules are completely reducible and a fixed point subVOA $ V^\sigma $ is $ C_2 $ -cofinite , then all $ V^\sigma $ -modules are completely reducible and every simple $ V^ { \sigma } $ -module appears in some twisted or ordinary $ V $ -modules as a $ V^ { \sigma } $ -submodule .	We also prove that $ V_L^ { \sigma } $ is $ C_2 $ -cofinite for any lattice VOA $ V_L $ and $ \sigma\in \Aut ( V_L ) $ lifted from any triality automorphism of $ L $ .	Using these results , we present two $ Z_3 $ -orbifold constructions as examples .	One is the moonshine VOA $ V^ { \natural } $ and the other is a new CFT No.32 in Schellekens ' list .
3	The difference in the choice of a certain model lies on the existence or not of a lagrangian ideal .	In this paper we deal with symplectic Lie algebras .	All symplectic structures are determined for dimension four and the corresponding Lie algebras are classified up to equivalence .	Symplectic four dimensional Lie algebras are described either as solutions of the cotangent extension problem or as symplectic double extension of $ \Bbb RR^2 $ by $ \Bbb RR $ .	Moreover all extensions of a two dimensional Lie algebra are determined , and so all solutions ( up to equivalence ) of the cotangent extension problem are given in dimension two .
1	Our goal is to find a single classifier , with small approximation error , across all datasets while minimizing the communication between nodes .	We consider the problem of learning classifiers for labeled data that has been distributed across several nodes .	This setting models real-world communication bottlenecks in the processing of massive distributed datasets .	We present several very general sampling-based solutions as well as some two-way protocols which have a provable exponential speed-up over any one-way protocol .	We focus on core problems for noiseless data distributed across two or more nodes .
2	This demands perfect timing synchronization and is therefore fault-intolerant , even in the absence of noise .	The potential energy profile of a binary switch is a symmetric double well .	Switching between the wells without energy dissipation requires time-modulating the potential barrier separating them and tilting the profile towards the desired well at the precise juncture when the barrier disappears .	A fault-tolerant strategy that requires no time modulation of the barrier ( and hence no timing synchronization ) switches by tilting the profile by an amount at least equal to the barrier height and dissipates at least that amount of energy .	Here , we present a third strategy that requires a time modulated barrier but no timing synchronization .
2	However , recent high magnetic field experiments suggest orbital coupling of the magnetic field to the electronic structure , indicating a finite interchain bandwidth .	The band structure of alfa- ( Per ) 2M ( mnt ) 2 , leads to a description of these materials as nearly perfectly one dimensional conductors .	The conduction is mainly along the stacking direction of the partially oxidized perylene molecules , ( Per ) 1/2+ , with virtually no interchain bandwidth .	The details of the band structure and the possible variances , at low energies , from a perfect one dimensional system are examined .	In particular , multiple quasi-one dimensional Fermi surface sheets , which would become important at low temperatures , may lead to an explanation for the experimental finding of a magnetic field induced high field charge density wave ground state .
0	While several observational investigations have revealed the presence of magnetic fields in the circumstellar envelopes , jets and outflows of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars ( PAGBs ) and planetary nebulae ( PNe ) , none has clearly demonstrated their presence at the stellar surface .	The lack of information on the strength of the surface magnetic fields prevents us from performing any thorough assessment of their dynamic capability ( i.e.material mixing , envelope shaping , etc ) .	We present new high resolution spectropolarimetric ( Stokes V ) observations of a sample of PAGB stars , realised with the instruments ESPaDOnS and Narval , where we searched for the presence of photospheric magnetic fields .	Out of the seven targets investigated the RV Tauri stars U Mon and R Sct display a clear Zeeman signature and return a definite detection after performing a least squares deconvolution ( LSD ) analysis .	The remaining five PAGBs show no significant detection .
3	These decays provide a very clean experimental signature and the background is expected to be small in particular at e+e- B factories .	We present a novel method to search for a new CP-violating phase in b - & gt ; ss~ss~s transition using B - & gt ; phi phi Xs decays , where Xs represents a final state with a specific strange flavor such as K+/- , K*+/- , or K+/-pi-/+ .	Direct CP violation can be enhanced due to an interference between an amplitude beyond the standard model ( SM ) and the SM decay amplitude through the eta_c resonance .	We find that the CP asymmetry can be as large as 0.4 within the present experimental bounds on the b - & gt ; ss~s transition .	A simulation study for the B+/- - & gt ; phi phi K+/- decay shows that the statistical significance of CP violation can exceed 5 standard deviations with 10^9 B mesons .
2	conjectured the existence of massless modes in the spectrum of excitations ( `` anomalous massless modes '' ) building upon certain similarities between a spontaneous symmetry breaking and the interplay of axial and vector symmetries in an anomalous theory .	Some years ago Anton Yu .	Alekseev et al .	We reinterpret the analogy and argue that the presence of these modes is ensured in any ( even ) number of dimensions only by the excitation of certain anomaly-induced terms called Schwinger terms .	In 1+1 dimensions the anomalous massless mode corresponds to the charge density wave present in a Luttinger liquid .
1	Precision experiments using ultracold neutrons ( UCN ) require very high intensities of UCN .	There are worldwide efforts to search for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics .	Efficient transport of UCN from the production volume to the experiment is therefore of great importance .	We have developed a method using prestored UCN in order to quantify UCN transmission in tubular guides .	This method simulates the final installation at the Paul Scherrer Institute 's UCN source where neutrons are stored in an intermediate storage vessel serving three experimental ports .
2	More specifically , it is demonstrated that an appropriately loaded gap layer enables substantial excitation of toroidal moment and its strong interaction with the AM dipole moment , resulting in Fano- or electromagnetically induced transparency ( EIT ) -like profile in the scattering spectrum .	Plasmonic nanoantenna is of promising applications in optical sensing , single-molecular detection , and enhancement of optical nonlinear effect , surface optical spectroscopy , photochemistry , photoemission , photovoltaics , etc .	Here we show that in a carefully-designed dimer gap-antenna made by two metallic nanorods , the longitudinal plasmon antenna mode ( AM ) of bonding dipoles can compete with the transverse plasmonic cavity modes ( CMs ) , yielding dramatically enhanced or suppressed scattering efficiency , depending on the CMs symmetry characteristics ( e.g. , the radial order n and the azimuthal quantum number m ) .	However , for CMs with nonzero azimuthal number , the spectrum features a cumulative signature of the respective AM and CM resonances .	We supply both detailed near-field and far-field analysis for these phenomena , showing that the modal overlap and phase relationship between the fundamental moments of different order play a crucial role .
0	The problem of computing Craig Interpolants has recently received a lot of interest .	In this paper , we address the problem of efficient generation of interpolants for some important fragments of first order logic , which are amenable for effective decision procedures , called Satisfiability Modulo Theory solvers .	We make the following contributions .	First , we provide interpolation procedures for several basic theories of interest : the theories of linear arithmetic over the rationals , difference logic over rationals and integers , and UTVPI over rationals and integers .	Second , we define a novel approach to interpolate combinations of theories , that applies to the Delayed Theory Combination approach .
2	We first geometrically engineer supersymmetry-breaking vacua by wrapping D5 branes on rigid 2-cycles in noncompact Calabi-Yau geometries , such that the central charges of the branes are misaligned .	We propose a new way of using geometric transitions to study metastable vacua in string theory and certain confining gauge theories .	The gauge theories in question are N=2 supersymmetric theories deformed to N=1 by superpotential terms .	In a limit of slightly misaligned charges , this has a gauge theory description , where supersymmetry is broken by Fayet-Iliopoulos D-terms .	Geometric transitions relate these configurations to dual Calabi-Yaus with fluxes , where H_RR , H_NS and dJ are all nonvanishing .
1	Approximate Dynamic Programming ( ADP ) has the potential , in principle , to ensure stability without such tight restrictions .	Classical adaptive control proves total-system stability for control of linear plants , but only for plants meeting very restrictive assumptions .	It also offers nonlinear and neural extensions for optimal control , with empirically supported links to what is seen in the brain .	However , the relevant ADP methods in use today -- TD , HDP , DHP , GDHP -- and the Galerkin-based versions of these all have serious limitations when used here as parallel distributed real-time learning systems ; either they do not possess quadratic unconditional stability ( to be defined ) or they lead to incorrect results in the stochastic case .	( ADAC or Q-learning designs do not help . )
1	Using data from the ASCA archive for objects that have been observed more than once during the mission , we study the time-averaged spectra from individual observations , thereby probing variability on timescales that range from days to years .	We find that variability of the iron K-alpha line is common in Seyfert 1 galaxies .	Since the statistics of the data do not warrant searches for line variability in terms of a complex physical model , we use a a simple Gaussian to model the gross shape of the line , and then use the centroid energy , intensity and equivalent width as robust indicators of changes in the line profile .	We find that ~70 % of Seyfert 1s ( ten out of fifteen ) show variability in at least one of these parameters : the centroid energy , intensity , and equivalent width vary in six , four , and eight sources respectively .	Due to the low S/N , limited sampling and time averaging , we consider these results to represent lower limits to the rate of incidence of variability .
1	The index algorithm approximates boundary layer turbulent kinetic energy by parameterizing vertical wind shear , responsible for mechanical production of TKE , and kinematic heat flux , parameterized by the vertical temperature lapse rate and responsible for buoyant production of TKE .	A boundary layer turbulence index ( TIBL ) product has been developed to assess the potential for turbulence in the lower troposphere , generated using RUC-2 numerical model data .	Validation for the TIBL product has been conducted for selected nonconvective wind events during the 2008 winter season over the Idaho National Laboratory mesonet domain .	This paper presents studies of four significant wind events between December 2007 and February 2008 over southeastern Idaho .	Based on the favorable results highlighted from validation statistics and in the case studies , the RUC TIBL product has demonstrated operational utility in assessing turbulence hazards to low-flying aircraft and ground transportation , and in the assessment of wildfire threat .
4	alpha and beta relaxation depend in the same way on the thermodynamic state ; close to the mode-coupling cross-over , this dependence can be parametrised by an effective coupling Gamma ~ n*T** { -1/4 } .	The incoherent dynamic structure factor of ortho-terphenyl has been measured by neutron time-of-flight and backscattering technique in the pressure range from 0.1 MPa to 240 MPa for temperatures between 301 K and 335 K. Tagged-particle correlations in the compressed liquid decay in two steps .	The alpha-relaxation lineshape is independent of pressure , and the relaxation time proportional to viscosity .	A kink in the amplitude f_Q ( P ) reveals the onset of beta relaxation .	The beta-relaxation regime can be described by the mode-coupling scaling function ; amplitudes and time scales allow a consistent determination of the critical pressure P_c ( T ) .
4	In the numerical experiment , dependence s on loading step was obtained with fiber bundle size up to N=10^10 .	We consider a fiber bundle model with a equal load sharing and uniformly distributed breakdown thresholds .	A unified probability-theoretic approach was used to describe bundle under continuous and discrete load increase .	It was shown that the ratio of distribution D ( d ) of avalanches of sizes d to the number of bundle load steps exactly corresponds to burst probability of size d. Evolution of s - power law distribution exponent of D ( d ) was studied as a function of loading step and bundle size .	It was shown that s does not depend on bundle size .
2	After a detailed analysis of the $ \alpha $ -FPU equation of motion , we find that the first non trivial resonances correspond to six-wave interactions .	We study the original $ \alpha $ -Fermi-Pasta-Ulam ( FPU ) system with $ N=16,32 $ and $ 64 $ masses connected by a nonlinear quadratic spring .	Our approach is based on resonant wave-wave interaction theory , i.e.we assume that , in the weakly nonlinear regime ( the one in which Fermi was originally interested ) , the large time dynamics is ruled by exact resonances .	Those are precisely the interactions responsible for the thermalization of the energy in the spectrum .	We predict that for small amplitude random waves the time scale of such interactions is extremely large and it is of the order of $ 1/\epsilon^8 $ , where $ \epsilon $ is the small parameter in the system .
1	The exact kinetic equations for neutrinos , written in terms of neutrino density matrix in { \it momentum space } were analyzed .	We studied nonequilibrium oscillations between left-handed electron neutrinos and nonthermalized sterile neutrinos in medium for resonant and nonresonant cases .	The evolution of neutrino density matrix was numerically calculated .	This allowed to study precisely the evolution of the neutrino number densities , energy spectrum distortion and the asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos for each momentum mode .	The influence of nonequilibrium oscillations on the primordial production of He-4 was calculated .
2	The presented procedure does not rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem , and can therefore be applied to account for both internal and external fluctuations in either variational or non-variational phase-field formulations .	We present a derivation of the sharp-interface limit of a generic fluctuating phase-field model for solidification .	As a main result , we obtain a sharp-interface projection which presents noise terms in both the diffusion equation and in the moving boundary conditions .	In particular , it can be used to introduce thermodynamical fluctuations in non-variational formulations of the phase-field model , which permit to reach better computational efficiency and provide more flexibility for describing some features of specific physical situations .	This opens the possibility of performing quantitative phase-field simulations in crystal growth while accounting for the proper fluctuations of the system .
1	While there is good observational support for forming at least some giant planets by disk instability , the mechanism has become theoretically contentious , with different three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics codes often yielding different results .	The disk instability mechanism for giant planet formation is based on the formation of clumps in a marginally-gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disk , which must lose thermal energy through a combination of convection and radiative cooling if they are to survive and contract to become giant protoplanets .	Rigorous code testing is required to make further progress .	Here we present two new analytical solutions for radiative transfer in spherical coordinates , suitable for testing the code employed in all of the Boss disk instability calculations .	The testing shows that the Boss code radiative transfer routines do an excellent job of relaxing to and maintaining the analytical results for the radial temperature and radiative flux profiles for a spherical cloud with high or moderate optical depths , including the transition from optically thick to optically thin regions .
2	The latter can be considered as a gas of photons with an almost perfect blackbody spectrum .	In some cases it may be useful to know parton distributions in a photon gas .	This may be relevant , e.g. , for the analysis of interactions of high energy cosmic ray particles with the cosmic microwave background radiation .	An approach to finding such parton distributions is described .	The survival probability of ultra-high energy neutrinos traveling through this radiation is calculated .
0	Infinite loop space theory , both additive and multiplicative , arose largely from two basic motivations .	One was to solve calculational questions in geometric topology .	The other was to better understand algebraic K-theory .	The Adams conjecture is intrinsic to the first motivation , and Quillen 's proof of that led directly to his original , calculationally accessible , definition of algebraic K-theory .	In turn , the infinite loop understanding of algebraic K-theory feeds back into the calculational questions in geometric topology .
1	We first determine potential energy curves for several states using different basis sets and discuss their predicted accuracy by comparing our values of the well depths and position with other available results .	In this paper , using a standard quantum chemistry approach based on pseudopotentials for atomic core representation , Gaussian basis sets , and effective core polarization potentials , we investigate the electronic properties of the MgH $ ^+ $ ion .	We then calculate permanent and transition dipole moments for several transitions .	Finally for the first time , we calculate the static dipole polarizability of MgH $ ^+ $ as function of the interatomic distance .	This study represents the first step towards the modeling of collisions between trapped cold Mg $ ^+ $ ions and H $ _2 $ molecules .
2	The eavesdropper ( Eve ) is supposed to have unlimited technological power while the honest parties ( Alice and Bob ) use present day technology , in particular an attenuated laser as an approximation of a single-photon source .	A new class of quantum cryptography ( QC ) protocols that are robust against the most general photon number splitting attacks in a weak coherent pulse implementation has been recently proposed .	In this article we give a quite exhaustive analysis of several eavesdropping attacks on these schemes .	They exploit the nonorthogonality of quantum states for decreasing the information accessible to Eve in the multi-photon pulses accidentally produced by the imperfect source .	An implementation of some of these protocols using present day technology allow for a secure key distribution up to distances of $ \sim $ 150 km .
3	A minimally infrequent itemset has no subset which is also infrequent .	Itemset mining has been an active area of research due to its successful application in various data mining scenarios including finding association rules .	Though most of the past work has been on finding frequent itemsets , infrequent itemset mining has demonstrated its utility in web mining , bioinformatics and other fields .	In this paper , we propose a new algorithm based on the pattern-growth paradigm to find minimally infrequent itemsets .	We also introduce the novel concept of residual trees .
2	The propagator of the gauge fields and the form of the fields $ A^I_\mu $ are explicitly computed in the Feynman gauge .	In this paper general abelian gauge field theories interacting with matter fields are quantized on a closed and orientable Riemann surface $ \Sigma $ .	The approach used is that of small perturbations around topologically nontrivial classical solutions $ A^I_\mu $ of the Maxwell equations .	Despite of the fact that the quantization procedure presented here is mainly perturbative , in the case of the Schwinger model , or two dimensional quantum electrodynamics , it is also possible to derive nonperturbative results .	As an example , we show that , at very short distances , the electromagnetic forces on a Riemann surface vanish up to zero modes .
2	We work both with non-fading phase spaces $ c_0 ( \ZZ^- , \X ) $ and $ \ll^\infty ( \ZZ^- , \X ) $ and with exponentially fading phase spaces of the $ \ll^p $ and $ c_0 $ types .	Uniform exponential ( UE ) stability of linear difference equations with infinite delay is studied using the notions of a stability radius and a phase space .	The state space $ \X $ is supposed to be an abstract Banach space .	For equations of the convolution type , several criteria of UE stability are obtained in terms of the Z-transform $ \wh K ( \zeta ) $ of the convolution kernel $ K ( \cdot ) $ , in terms of the input-state operator and of the resolvent ( fundamental ) matrix .	These criteria do not impose additional positivity or compactness assumptions on coefficients $ K ( j ) $ .
0	Determinations of the solar oxygen content relying on the neutral forbidden transition at 630 nm depend upon the nickel abundance , due to a Ni I blend .	Here we rederive the solar nickel abundance , using the same ab initio 3D hydrodynamic model of the solar photosphere employed in the recent revision of the abundances of C , N , O and other elements .	Using 17 weak , unblended lines of Ni I together with the most accurate atomic and observational data available we find log epsilon_Ni = 6.17 +/- 0.02 ( statistical ) +/- 0.05 ( systematic ) , a downwards shift of 0.06 to 0.08 dex relative to previous 1D-based abundances .	We investigate the implications of the new nickel abundance for studies of the solar oxygen abundance based on the [ O I ] 630 nm line in the quiet Sun .	Furthermore , we demonstrate that the oxygen abundance implied by the recent sunspot spectropolarimetric study of Centeno & amp ; Socas-Navarro needs to be revised downwards from log epsilon_O = 8.86 +/- 0.07 to 8.71 +/- 0.10 .
2	The theory is based on the unitary operator $ e^ { iS } $ ( { \it S } is the correlation operator ) formalism which , in this paper , is treated non perturbatively within many-particle correlations .	In this contribution we present calculations performed for interacting electron systems within a non-perturbative formulation of the cluster theory .	Extrapolation of the model to describe the time dependence of the interacting systems is feasible and planed .	The application of the derived equations to few-body systems is realized in terms of Generalized Linearization Approximations ( GLA ) and via the Cluster Factorization Theory ( CFT ) .	To check the reliability of the model we present two different applications .
3	When the control light is coupled to the atoms , the input signal light is nearly totally reflected and this means that there is no direct coupling of the control light and the signal light through the cavity-confined atoms .	We propose a scheme of the interaction-free all-optical switching in a multi-atom cavity QED system consisting of three-level atoms confined in a cavity and coupled by a free-space control laser .	A signal laser field is coupled into the cavity and its transmission through and reflection from the cavity form two output channels .	We show that the free-space control laser induces destructive quantum interference in the excitation of the intra-cavity normal mode , which can be used to switch on or off of the output signal light of the reflection and the transmission channels .	We present analytical and numerical calculations that show this type of the interaction-free all-optical switching in the coupled cavity-atom system can be realized with high switching efficiencies and at low light intensities .
0	The Symmetric Primal-Dual Simplex Pivoting Decision Strategy ( spdspds ) is a novel iterative algorithm to solve linear programming ( LP ) problems .	Each iteration is based on a systematic selection and application of one among the newly identified set of four ( or possibly six ) distinct types of simplex pivots defined over a symmetric primal-dual pair of LP .	The two ( or possibly four ) types of classical ( standard ) simplex pivots are the Primal Standard Pivot with positive ( or zero ) indicator , and the Dual Standard Pivot with negative ( or zero ) indicator .	The two newly identified pivot types are : the Primal Tricky Pivot with positive indicator and the Dual Tricky Pivot with negative indicator .	If more than one candidate pivot element/cell is of the same type , then a selection among them can be made based on a measure of goodness that is defined as the decrease in the infeasibility index of such cells .
4	In this paper we give a formal definition about how such missing information can be recovered and then give an ASP implementation of it .	The broader goal of our research is to formulate answers to why and how questions with respect to knowledge bases , such as AURA .	One issue we face when reasoning with many available knowledge bases is that at times needed information is missing .	Examples of this include partially missing information about next sub-event , first sub-event , last sub-event , result of an event , input to an event , destination of an event , and raw material involved in an event .	In many cases one can recover part of the missing knowledge through reasoning .
3	The host star is metal rich , with an estimated [ Fe/H ] = +0.4 .	Doppler observations from Keck Observatory reveal the presence of a planet with Msini of 2.1 Mjup orbiting the M3V star HIP79431 .	This is the sixth giant planet to be detected in Doppler surveys of M dwarfs and it is one of the most massive planets discovered around an M dwarf star .	The planet has an orbital period of 111.7 days and an orbital eccentricity of 0.29 .	This is the first planet to emerge from our new survey of 1600 M-to-K dwarf stars .
4	Further , not accounting for time can lead us to misinterpret important phenomena .	Online communities provide a fertile ground for analyzing people 's behavior and improving our understanding of social processes .	Because both people and communities change over time , we argue that analyses of these communities that take time into account will lead to deeper and more accurate results .	Using Reddit as an example , we study the evolution of users based on comment and submission data from 2007 to 2014 .	Even using one of the simplest temporal differences between users -- -yearly cohorts -- -we find wide differences in people 's behavior , including comment activity , effort , and survival .
3	The workshop has also debated some of the state-of-the-art theoretical considerations and the modeling of MPI in Monte Carlo event generators .	Multiple Partonic Interactions are often crucial for interpreting results obtained at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) .	The quest for a sound understanding of the dynamics behind MPI - particularly at this time when the LHC is due to start its `` Run II '' operations - has focused the aim of this workshop .	MPI @ LHC2014 concentrated mainly on the phenomenology of LHC measurements whilst keeping in perspective those results obtained at previous hadron colliders .	The topics debated in the workshop included : Phenomenology of MPI processes and multiparton distributions ; Considerations for the description of MPI in Quantum Chromodynamics ( QCD ) ; Measuring multiple partonic interactions ; Experimental results on inelastic hadronic collisions : underlying event , minimum bias , forward energy flow ; Monte Carlo generator development and tuning ; Connections with low-x phenomena , diffraction , heavy-ion physics and cosmic rays .
4	Here , the successive inserted wors are strongly dependent .	In this paper , we consider a possible representation of a DNA sequence in a quaternary tree , in which on can visualize repetitions of subwords .	The CGR-tree turns a sequence of letters into a digital search tree ( DST ) , obtained from the suffixes of the reversed sequence .	Several results are known concerning the height and the insertion depth for DST built from i.i.d .	successive sequences .
3	I propose transparent axioms from which the upper and lower probability operators follow .	It is known that non-commuting observables in quantum mechanics do not have joint probability .	This statement refers to the precise ( additive ) probability model .	I show that the joint distribution of any non-commuting pair of variables can be quantified via upper and lower probabilities , i.e.the joint probability is described by an interval instead of a number ( imprecise probability ) .	They depend only on the non-commuting observables and revert to the usual expression for the commuting case .
4	Our results suggest that there is either phase separation or coexistence between magnetic and superconducting states .	A two dimensional electronic system with novel electronic properties forms at the interface between the insulators LaAlO $ _3 $ and SrTiO $ _3 $ .	Samples fabricated until now have been found to be either magnetic or superconducting , depending on growth conditions .	We combine transport measurements with high-resolution magnetic torque magnetometry and report here evidence of magnetic ordering of the two-dimensional electron liquid at the interface .	The magnetic ordering exists from well below the superconducting transition to up to 200 K , and is characterized by an in-plane magnetic moment .
2	This problem often occurs when sub-optimal starting values are used to initialize the algorithm .	The Expectation-Maximization ( EM ) algorithm is a commonly used method for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in a mixture model via coordinate ascent .	A serious pitfall with the algorithm is that in the case of multimodal likelihood functions , it can get trapped at a local maximum .	Bayesian initialization averaging ( BIA ) is proposed as a method to generate high quality starting values for the EM algorithm .	Competing sets of starting values are combined as a weighted average , which is then used as the starting position for one full EM run .
4	Quantitative results are presented for central Pb+Pb collisions at $ E_ { beam } =158 GeV/A $ .	Production of $ \phi $ mesons is considered in the course of heavy-ion collisions at SPS energies .	We investigate the possible difference in momentum distributions of $ \phi $ mesons measured via their leptonic ( $ \mu^+\mu^- $ ) and hadronic ( $ K^+K^- $ ) decays .	Rescattering of secondary kaons in the dense hadron gas together with the influence of in-medium kaon potential can lead to a relative decrease of a $ \phi $ yield observed in the hadronic channel .	We analyze how the in-medium modifications of meson properties affect apparent - reconstructed momentum distributions of $ \phi $ mesons .
3	This enhancement in photostability and recovery rate is found to be explicable by the modified correlated chromophore domain model , with the NPs resulting in the domain free energy advantage increasing from 0.29 eV to 0.41 eV .	We report the observation of intensity feedback random lasing at 645 nm in Disperse Orange 11 dye-doped PMMA ( DO11/PMMA ) with dispersed ZrO $ _2 $ nanoparticles ( NPs ) .	The lasing threshold is found to increase with concentration , with the lasing threshold for 0.1 wt\ % being $ 75.8 \pm 9.4 $ MW/cm $ ^2 $ and the lasing threshold for 0.5 wt\ % being $ 121.1 \pm 2.1 $ MW/cm $ ^2 $ , with the linewidth for both concentrations found to be $ \approx 10 $ nm .	We also consider the material 's photostability and find that it displays fully reversible photodegradation with the photostability and recovery rate being greater than previously observed for DO11/PMMA without NPs .	Additionally , the molecular decay and recovery rates are found to be in agreement with previous measurements of DO11/PMMA [ Polymer Chemistry \textbf { 4 } , 4948 ( 2013 ) ] .
4	It is also shown that in models with spectator fields , even though the decays towards vacua involving nonzero spectator VEVs do n't have a strong parametric dependence on the scale ratios , the ISS vacuum can still be made long-lived in the presence of R-symmetry breaking interactions .	The decay rates of metastable SQCD vacua in ISS-type models , both towards supersymmetric vacua as well as towards other nonsupersymmetric configurations arising in theories with elementary spectators , are estimated numerically in the semiclassical approximation by computing the corresponding multifield bounce configurations .	The scaling of the bounce action with respect to the most relevant dimensionless couplings and ratios of scales is analyzed .	In the case of the decays towards the susy vacua generated by nonperturbative effects , the results confirm previous analytical estimations of this scaling , obtained by assuming a triangular potential barrier .	The decay rates towards susy vacua generated by R-symmetry breaking interactions turn out to be more than sufficiently suppressed for the phenomenologically relevant parameter range , and their behavior in this regime differs from analytic estimations valid for parametrically small scale ratios .
0	We investigate the formation of spherical cosmological structures following both dark matter and gas components .	We focus on the dynamical aspect of the collapse assuming an adiabatic , $ \gamma = 5/3 $ , fully ionized primordial plasma .	We use for that purpose a fully Lagrangian hydrodynamical code designed to describe highly compressible flows in spherical geometry .	We investigate also a `` fluid approach '' to describe the mean physical quantities of the dark matter flow .	We test its validity for a wide range of initial density contrast .
2	We show that in the Caputo case , it suffices to compute F-PSDM of order $ \mu\in ( 0,1 ) $ to compute that of any order $ k+\mu $ with integer $ k\ge 0 , $ while in the modified RL case , it is only necessary to evaluate a fractional integral matrix of order $ \mu\in ( 0,1 ) . $ Secondly , we introduce suitable fractional JGL Birkhoff interpolation problems leading to new interpolation polynomial basis functions with remarkable properties : ( i ) the matrix generated from the new basis yields the exact inverse of F-PSDM at `` interior '' JGL points ; ( ii ) the matrix of the highest fractional derivative in a collocation scheme under the new basis is diagonal ; and ( iii ) the resulted linear system is well-conditioned in the Caputo case , while in the modified RL case , the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are highly concentrated .	The purpose of this paper is twofold .	Firstly , we provide explicit and compact formulas for computing both Caputo and ( modified ) Riemann-Liouville ( RL ) fractional pseudospectral differentiation matrices ( F-PSDMs ) of any order at general Jacobi-Gauss-Lobatto ( JGL ) points .	In both cases , the linear systems of the collocation schemes using the new basis can solved by an iterative solver within a few iterations .	Notably , the inverse can be computed in a very stable manner , so this offers optimal preconditioners for usual fractional collocation methods for fractional differential equations ( FDEs ) .
0	For $ f $ an entire transcendental map with a univalent Baker domain $ U $ of hyperbolic type I , we study pinching deformations in $ U $ , the support of this deformation being certain laminations in the grand orbit of $ U $ .	We show that pinching along a lamination that contains the geodesic $ \lambda_ { \infty } $ ( See Section 3.1 ) does not converges .	However , pinching at a lamination that does not contains such $ \lambda_ { \infty } $ , converges and converges to a unique map $ F $ if : the Julia set of $ f $ , $ J ( f ) $ is connected , the postcritical set of $ f $ is a positive ( plane ) distance away from $ J ( f ) $ , and it is thin at $ \infty $ .	We show that $ F $ has a simply connected wandering domain that stays away from the postcritical set .	We interpret these results in terms of the Teichm\ '' uller space of $ f $ , $ Teich ( f ) $ , included in $ M_ { f } $ the marked space of topologically equivalent maps to $ f $ .
0	The social connections people form online affect the quality of information they receive and their online experience .	Although a host of socioeconomic and cognitive factors were implicated in the formation of offline social ties , few of them have been empirically validated , particularly in an online setting .	In this study , we analyze a large corpus of geo-referenced messages , or tweets , posted by social media users from a major US metropolitan area .	We linked these tweets to US Census data through their locations .	This allowed us to measure emotions expressed in the tweets posted from an area , the structure of social connections , and also use that area 's socioeconomic characteristics in analysis .
1	The study is divided into two parts : ( i ) a survey of open data situation and ( ii ) an overview of available open data sets .	This paper examines the state of Open Data in Latvia at the middle of 2014 .	The first part examines the general open data climate in Latvia according to the guidelines of the OKFN Open Data Index making the results comparable to those of other participants of this index .	The second part examines datasets made available on the Latvia Open Data community catalogue , the only open data catalogue available in Latvia at the moment .	We conclude that Latvia public sector open data mostly fulfil the basic criteria ( e.g. , data is available ) of the Open Data Index but fail on more advanced criteria : the majority of data considered in the study are not published in machine-readable form , are not available for bulk download and none of the data sources have open license statements .
3	The dependence with different parameters as the initial social diversity , size effects , Mass Media strength and noise is outlined .	The use of { \it dyadic interaction } between agents , in combination with { \it homophily } ( the principle that `` likes attract '' ) in the Axelrod model for the study of cultural dissemination has two important problems : the prediction of monoculture in large societies and an extremely narrow window of noise levels in which diversity with local convergence is obtained .	Recently , the inclusion of { \it social influence } has proven to overcome them ( A. Flache and M. W. Macey , arXiv:0808.2710 ) .	Here we extend the Axelrod model with social influence interaction for the study of Mass Media effects through the inclusion of a super-agent which acts over the whole system and has nonnull overlap with each agent of the society .	Our results might be relevant in several socio-economic contexts and for the study of the emergence of collective behavior in complex social systems .
2	Aims : We investigate and discuss the soft X-ray properties of this AGN sample and examine the correlations between X-ray and VLBI properties , test beaming scenarios , and search for the discriminating properties between the sub-samples detected and not detected by ROSAT .	Context : We present the soft X-ray properties obtained in the ROSAT All-Sky survey and from pointed PSPC observations for the AGN in the complete flux-density limited Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat spectrum sample ( hereafter CJF ) .	CJF is a VLBI survey ( VLBA observations at 5 GHz ) of 293 AGN with detailed information on jet component motion .	Methods : Comparing the observed and the predicted X-ray fluxes by assuming an Inverse Compton ( IC ) origin for the observed X-rays , we compute the beaming or Doppler factor and contrast the Doppler factors with other beaming indicators derived from the VLBI observations , such as the value of the expansion velocity , and the observed and intrinsic brightness temperature .	In addition , we investigate the large-scale radio structure of the AGN and the difference between the pc- and kpc-scale structure ( misalignment ) with regard to the X-ray observations.Results : We find a nearly linear relation between X-ray and radio luminosities , and a similar but less stringent behaviour for the relation between optical and X-ray luminosities .
3	In this paper , we first show the existence of a dyadic grid in the group $ S $ , which has { nice } properties similar to the classical Euclidean dyadic cubes .	Let $ S $ be the Lie group $ \mathrm { R } ^n\ltimes \mathrm { R } ^+ $ endowed with the left-invariant Riemannian symmetric space structure and the right Haar measure $ \rho $ , which is a Lie group of exponential growth .	Hebisch and Steger in [ Math.Z .	245 ( 2003 ) , 37 -- 61 ] proved that any integrable function on $ ( S , \rho ) $ admits a Calder\'on -- Zygmund decomposition which involves a particular family of sets , called Calder\'on -- Zygmund sets .	Using the properties of the dyadic grid we shall prove a Fefferman -- Stein type inequality , involving the dyadic maximal Hardy -- Littlewood function and the dyadic sharp dyadic function .
4	Experimental studies aiming at evaluating characteristic times of spin coherence and dephasing in GaN are described .	A report of progress in spintronics-related works involving group III nitrides is given emphasizing contradictory opinions concerning basics characteristics of these materials .	The actual position of magnetic impurities in the GaN lattice as well as a possible role of magnetic precipitates is discussed .	The question whether the hole introduce by the Mn impurities is localized tightly on the Mn d-levels or rather on the hybridized p-d bonding states is addressed .	The nature of spin-spin interactions and magnetic phases , as provided by theoretical and experimental findings , is outlined , and possible origins of the high temperature ferromagnetism observed in ( Ga , Mn ) N are presented .
0	The possibility of studying superstring inspired \mbox { $ { \rm E } _6 $ } phenomenology at high energy hadron colliders is investigated .	A very simple low energy rank-5 Supersymmetric ( N=1 ) model is considered , which consists of three scalar-Higgses , $ H^0_ { i=1,2,3 } \ , $ , two charged-Higgses , $ H^\pm\ , $ , one pseudo-scalar-Higgses , $ P^0\ , $ , and an extra vector boson , the $ Z^\prime $ .	The production of charged heavy leptons pairs , $ L^+L^-\ , $ , by gluon-gluon fusion and Drell-Yan mechanisms is discussed .	For gluon-gluon fusion an enhancement in the parton level cross-section is expected due to the heavy ( s ) fermion loops which couple to the gluons .	This mechanism is expected to dominate over Drell-Yan for $ L^+L^- $ invariant masses above the $ Z^\prime $ mass .
0	We present a unifying theory of fields with certain classes of analytic functions , called fields with analytic structure .	Both real closed fields and Henselian valued fields are considered .	For real closed fields with analytic structure , o-minimality is shown .	For Henselian valued fields , both the model theory and the analytic theory are developed .	We give a list of examples that comprises , to our knowledge , all principal , previously studied , analytic structures on Henselian valued fields , as well as new ones .
1	Here , we describe a counter-intuitive lateral optical force acting on particles placed above a substrate , under uniform plane wave illumination without any field gradients .	Optical forces allow manipulation of small particles and control of nanophotonic structures with light beams .	We show that under circularly-polarized illumination , nanoparticles experience a lateral force as a result of dipolar , spin-sensitive scattering , with a magnitude comparable to other optical forces .	To this end , we rigorously calculate the force experienced by a circularly polarized dipole radiating above a surface .	Unlike for linearly-polarized dipoles , force components parallel to the surface can exist , caused by the recoil of unidirectional guided modes excited at the surface and/or by dipole-dipole interactions with the induced image dipole .
2	Taking $ B=\Bbb C $ and $ M_i = ( L ( \Bbb Z^2 \rtimes \Bbb F_ { 2 } ) ) ^ { t_i } $ , with $ \ { t_i\ } _ { i\geq 1 } =S $ a given countable subgroup of $ \Bbb R_+^* $ , we obtain continuously many non stably isomorphic factors $ M $ with fundamental group $ \mycal F ( M ) $ equal to $ S $ .	We consider amalgamated free product II $ _1 $ factors $ M = M_1 *_B M_2 *_B ... $ and use `` deformation/rigidity '' and `` intertwining '' techniques to prove that any relatively rigid von Neumann subalgebra $ Q\subset M $ can be intertwined into one of the $ M_i $ 's .	We apply this to the case $ M_i $ are w-rigid II $ _1 $ factors , with $ B $ equal to either $ \Bbb C $ , to a Cartan subalgebra $ A $ in $ M_i $ , or to a regular hyperfinite II $ _1 $ subfactor $ R $ in $ M_i $ , to obtain the following type of unique decomposition results , \`a la Bass-Serre : If $ M = ( N_1 *_C N_2 *_C ... ) ^t $ , for some $ t & gt ; 0 $ and some other similar inclusions of algebras $ C\subset N_j $ then , after a permutation of indices , $ ( B\subset M_i ) $ is inner conjugate to $ ( C\subset N_i ) ^t $ , $ \forall i $ .	For $ B=A $ , we obtain a new class of factors $ M $ with unique Cartan subalgebra decomposition , with a large subclass satisfying $ \mycal F ( M ) =\ { 1\ } $ and Out $ ( M ) $ abelian and calculable .	Taking $ B=R $ , we get examples of factors with $ \mycal F ( M ) =\ { 1\ } $ , Out $ ( M ) =K $ , for any given separable compact abelian group $ K $ .
4	Thus , in a QDL phase , thermal equilibration is incomplete , and the canonical assumptions of statistical mechanics are not fully operative .	We propose and explore a new finite temperature phase of translationally invariant multi-component liquids which we call a `` Quantum Disentangled Liquid '' ( QDL ) phase .	We contemplate the possibility that in fluids consisting of two ( or more ) species of indistinguishable quantum particles with a large mass ratio , the light particles might `` localize '' on the heavy particles .	We give a precise , formal definition of this Quantum Disentangled Liquid phase in terms of the finite energy density many-particle wavefunctions .	While the heavy particles are fully thermalized , for a typical fixed configuration of the heavy particles , the entanglement entropy of the light particles satisfies an area law ; this implies that the light particles have not thermalized .
3	The polarisation in the envelope reaches 50 -- 60 % and is nearly constant in the H and K_S bands in the observations .	We investigate the circumstellar dust properties of the oxygen-rich bipolar proto-planetary nebula IRAS 18276-1431 by means of two-dimensional radiative transfer simulations of the circumstellar dust shell .	The model geometry is assumed to have a torus and an envelope .	The parameters of the dust and the dust shell are constrained by comparing the SED and NIR intensity and polarisation data with the models .	This weak wavelength dependence of the polarisation can be reproduced with a grain size distribution function for the torus : 0.05 micron & lt ; = a with n ( a ) =a^ { - ( p=5.5 ) } exp ( -a/ { a_c=0.3 micron } ) .
3	We also studied the possibilities of head-tail recognition of nuclear tracks in the surface laboratory .	NEWAGE is a direction-sensitive dark matter search experiment with a gaseous time-projection chamber .	We improved the direction-sensitive dark matter limits by our underground measurement .	After the first underground run , we replaced the detector components with radio-pure materials .	For the future large volume detector , we are developing a pixel ASIC named QPIX .
4	We also address the question of the proper treatment of the large gluino mass limit , i.e.the consistent decoupling of heavy gluino effects , and present the effective Lagrangian for decoupled gluinos .	In the MSSM scalar h , H production is mediated by heavy quark and squark loops .	The higher order QCD corrections have been obtained some time ago and turned out to be large .	The full SUSY QCD corrections have been obained recently including the full mass dependence of the loop particles .	We describe our calculation and present first numerical results .
1	For an operad $ \oo $ in $ \ab $ , let $ A $ be a simplicial $ \oo $ -algebra such that $ A_m $ is the $ \oo $ -subalgebra generated by $ ( \sum_ { i = 0 } ^ { m } s_i ( A_ { m-1 } ) ) $ , for every $ n $ , and let $ \N A $ be the Moore complex of $ A $ .	The main objectives of this paper are to give general proofs of the following two facts : A .	Then \ [ d ( \N_m A ) = \sum_ { I } \gamma ( \oo_ { p } \otimes \bigcap_ { i \in I_1 } \ker d_i \otimes ... \otimes \bigcap_ { i \in I_ { p } } \ker d_i ) \ ] where the sum runs over those partitions of $ [ m-1 ] $ , $ I = ( I_1 , ... , I_p ) $ , $ p \geq 1 $ , and $ \gamma $ is the action of $ \oo $ on $ A $ .B .	Let $ G $ be a simplicial group with Moore complex $ \N G $ in which the normal subgroup of $ G_n $ generated by the degenerate elements in dimension $ n $ is the proper $ G_n $ .	Then $ d ( \N_nG ) = \prod_ { I , J } [ \bigcap_ { i \in I } \ker d_i , \bigcap_ { j \in J } \ker d_j ] $ , for $ I , J \subseteq [ n-1 ] $ with $ I \cup J = [ n-1 ] $ .
3	The momentum distributions exhibit a dependence on the fragment neutron-to-proton ratio in isobaric chains , which was not expected from systematics so far .	We have measured production yields and longitudinal momentum distributions of projectile-like fragments in the reaction 129Xe + 27Al at an energy of Elab=790 AMeV .	Production cross sections higher than expected from systematics were observed for nuclei in the neutron-deficient tails of the isotopic distributions .	A comparison with previously measured data from the fragmentation of 136Xe ions shows that the production yields strongly depend on the neutron excess of the projectile with respect to the line of beta-stability .	This can be interpreted by a higher excitation of the projectile during the formation of neutron-deficient fragments .
4	Therefore , we predict that massive galaxies must lie on fundamental planes from their formation .	Relaxed , massive galactic objects have been identified at redshifts z = 4 ; 5 ; and 6 in hydrodynamical simulations run in a large cosmological volume .	This allowed us to analyze the assembly patterns of the high mass end of the galaxy distribution at these high zs , by focusing on their structural and dynamical properties .	Our simulations indicate that massive objects at high redshift already follow certain scaling relations .	These relations define virial planes at the halo scale , whereas at the galactic scale they define intrinsic dynamical planes that are , however , tilted relative to the virial plane .
4	Moreover , if G=Z^d , and the coalescing mechanism is Kingman 's coalescent , then starting with N particles at the origin , the total number of particles remaining is of order ( log* N ) ^d at any fixed positive time ( where log* is the inverse tower function ) .	We study several fundamental properties of a class of stochastic processes called spatial Lambda-coalescents .	In these models , a number of particles perform independent random walks on some underlying graph G. In addition , particles on the same vertex merge randomly according to a given coalescing mechanism .	A remarkable property of mean-field coalescent processes is that they may come down from infinity , meaning that , starting with an infinite number of particles , only a finite number remains after any positive amount of time , almost surely .	We show here however that , in the spatial setting , on any infinite and bounded-degree graph , the total number of particles will always remain infinite at all times , almost surely .
1	In our setup , a B0 star irradiates an overdensity which is at a distance of 10 pc and modelled as a supercritical 100 M_sol Bonnor-Ebert sphere .	We present 3D radiation-gasdynamical simulations of an ionization front running into a dense clump .	The radiation from the star heats up the gas and creates a shock front that expands into the interstellar medium .	The shock compresses the clump material while the ionizing radiation heats it up .	The outcome of this `` cloud-crushing '' process is a fully turbulent gas in the wake of the clump .
2	We then observed 3C 279 on 2012 May 7 in a 5 hour 230 GHz VLBI track with baseline lengths of 2800 M $ \lambda $ to 7200 M $ \lambda $ and a finest fringe spacing of 28.6 micro-arcseconds .	We report about a 230 GHz very long baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) fringe finder observation of blazar 3C 279 with the APEX telescope in Chile , the phased submillimeter array ( SMA ) , and the SMT of the Arizona Radio Observatory ( ARO ) .	We installed VLBI equipment and measured the APEX station position to 1 cm accuracy ( 1 sigma ) .	Fringes were detected on all baselines with SNRs of 12 to 55 in 420 s. The correlated flux density on the longest baseline was ~0.3 Jy/beam , out of a total flux density of 19.8 Jy .	Visibility data suggest an emission region & lt ; 38 uas in size , and at least two components , possibly polarized .
2	The objectives of the test were the characterization of the target , the hodoscope and the X-ray detectors .	The high precision measurement of the hyperfine splitting of the muonic-hydrogen atom ground state with pulsed and intense muon beam requires careful technological choices both in the construction of a gas target and of the detectors .	In June 2014 , the pressurized gas target of the FAMU experiment was exposed to the low energy pulsed muon beam at the RIKEN RAL muon facility .	The apparatus consisted of a beam hodoscope and X-rays detectors made with high purity Germanium and Lanthanum Bromide crystals .	In this paper the experimental setup is described and the results of the detector characterization are presented .
3	The 1.083-micron He I line has a P-Cygni profile which showed variations in both absorption and emission components as WR 140 went through periastron passage .	We present new spectra of WR 140 ( HD 193793 ) in the JHK bands with some covering the 1.083-micron He I emission line at higher resolution , observed between 2000 October and 2003 May to cover its 2001 periastron passage .	The WC7 + O4-5 spectroscopic binary WR 140 is the prototype of colliding-wind , episodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet systems which also show strong variations in radio and X-ray emission .	The JHK spectra showed changes in continuum and in the equivalent widths of the WC emission lines , consistent with formation of dust starting between 2001 January 3 and March 26 ( orbital phases 0.989 and 0.017 ) and its subsequent fading and cooling .	The variation of the absorption component yielded tight constraints on the geometry of the wind-collision region , giving theta = 50 +/- 8 degrees for the opening semi-angle of the interaction `cone ' , indicating a wind-momentum ratio of the O to the WR star=0.1 , about three times larger than previously believed .
0	Localized surface plasmon polaritons in conducting structures give rise to enhancements of electromagnetic local fields and extinction efficiencies .	Resonant conducting structures are conventionally fabricated with a fixed geometry that determines their plasmonic response .	Here , we challenge this conventional approach by demonstrating the photo-generation of plasmonic materials ( THz plasmonic antennas ) on a flat semiconductor layer by the structured optical illumination through a spatial light modulator .	Free charge carriers are photo-excited only on selected areas , which enables the definition of different plasmonic antennas on the same sample by simply changing the illumination pattern , thus without the need of physically structuring the sample .	These results open a wide range of possibilities for an all-optical spatial and temporal control of resonances on plasmonic surfaces and the concomitant control of THz extinction and local field enhancements .
4	The potential impact of these constraints is discussed .	We provide Standard Model expectations for the rare radiative decays B- & gt ; K^* gamma , B- & gt ; rho gamma and B- & gt ; omega gamma , and the electroweak penguin decays B- & gt ; K^* l^+ l^- and B- & gt ; rho l^+ l^- at the next-to-leading order ( NLO ) , extending our previous results to b- & gt ; d transitions .	We consider branching fractions , isospin asymmetries and direct CP asymmetries .	For the electroweak penguin decays , the lepton-invariant mass spectrum and forward-backward asymmetry is also included .	Radiative and electroweak penguin transitions in b- & gt ; d are mainly interesting in the search for new flavour-changing neutral current interactions , but in addition the B- & gt ; rho gamma decays provide constraints on the CKM parameters ( \bar\rho , \bar\eta ) .
4	By studying the integrability of the resulting conditions , one can provide an explicit foliation of the entire solution manifold of the considered equations .	The main physical result of this paper are exact analytical solutions of the heavenly equation , of importance in the general theory of relativity .	These solutions are not invariant under any subgroup of the symmetry group of the equation .	The main mathematical result is a new method of obtaining noninvariant solutions of partial differential equations with infinite dimensional symmetry groups .	The method involves the compatibility of the given equations with a differential constraint , which is automorphic under a specific symmetry subgroup , the latter acting transitively on the submanifold of the common solutions .
1	The un-doped SmFeAsO is charge neutral SDW ( Spin Density Wave ) compound with magnetic ordering below 150 K. The Superconducting FeAs layers are doped with Co and Ni at Fe site , whereas REO layers are doped with F at O site .	The mechanism of superconductivity in pnictides is discussed through direct doping in superconducting FeAs and also in charge reservoir REO layers .	The electron doping in SmFeAsO through Co results in superconductivity with transition temperature ( Tc ) maximum up to 15 K , whereas F doping results in Tc upto 47 K in SmFeAsO .	All these REFe/Co/NiAsO/F compounds are iso-structural to ZrCuSiAs structure .	The samples are crystallized in a tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm .
2	Moreover , we systematically use another symbolic technique , namely the cylindrical algebraic decomposition , in order to derive the conditions on the von Neumann stability of a difference s cheme for a linear PDE with constant coefficients .	In this paper we discuss three symbolic approaches for the generation of a finite difference scheme of a partial differential equation ( PDE ) .	We prove , that for a linear PDE with constant coefficients these three approaches are equivalent and discuss the applicability of them to nonlinear PDE 's as well as to the case of variable coefficients .	For stable schemes we demonst rate algorithmic and symbolic approach to handle both continuous and discrete di spersion .	We present an implementation of tools for generation of schemes , which rely on Gr\ '' obner basis , in the system SINGULAR and present numerous e xamples , computed with our implementation .
2	After removing the contribution from X-ray binaries and hot gas to the stacked X-ray emission , we still find an X-ray excess in the five redshift bins that can be explained by nuclear accreting BHs .	We study a sample of $ \sim $ 50,000 dwarf starburst and late-type galaxies drawn from the COSMOS survey with the aim of investigating the presence of nuclear accreting black holes ( BHs ) as those seed BHs from which supermassive BHs could grow in the early Universe .	We divide the sample into five complete redshift bins up to $ z=1.5 $ and perform an X-ray stacking analysis using the \textit { Chandra } COSMOS-Legacy survey data .	This X-ray excess is more significant for $ z & lt ; 0.5 $ .	At higher redshifts , these active galactic nuclei could suffer mild obscuration , as indicated by the analysis of their hardness ratios .
0	In this paper we consider genus one equations of degree n , namely a ( generalised ) binary quartic when n = 2 , a ternary cubic when n = 3 , and a pair of quaternary quadrics when n = 4 .	A new definition for the minimality of genus one equations of degree n is introduced .	The advantage of this definition is that it does not depend on invariant theory of genus one curves .	We prove that this definition coincides with the classical definition of minimality when n & lt ; = 4 .	As an application , we give a new proof for the existence of global minimal genus one equations over number fields of class number 1 .
3	The photometric magnitudes exhibit variations in the JHK bands which are probably due to the variability of the companion star .	Near infrared spectroscopy and photometry of the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 143 ( HD 195177 ) were obtained in the $ JHK $ photometric bands .	High resolution spectra observed in the J and H bands exhibit narrow 1.083-micron He I line and the H I Pa Beta and the Brackett series lines in emission superposed on the broad emission line spectrum of the Wolf-Rayet star , giving strong indications of the presence of a companion .	From the narrow emission lines observed , the companion is identified to be an early-type Be star .	The flux density distribution is too steep for a Wolf-Rayet atmosphere .
0	We study spectral theory for bounded Borel subsets of $ \br $ and in particular finite unions of intervals .	For Hilbert space , we take $ L^2 $ of the union of the intervals .	This yields a boundary value problem arising from the minimal operator $ \Ds = \frac1 { 2\pi i } \frac { d } { dx } $ with domain consisting of $ C^\infty $ functions vanishing at the endpoints .	We offer a detailed interplay between geometric configurations of unions of intervals and a spectral theory for the corresponding selfadjoint extensions of $ \Ds $ and for the associated unitary groups of local translations .	While motivated by scattering theory and quantum graphs , our present focus is on the Fuglede-spectral pair problem .
0	The future of direct terrestrial WIMP detection lies on two fronts : new , much larger low background detectors sensitive to energy deposition , and detectors with directional sensitivity .	The former can large range of WIMP parameter space using well tested technology while the latter may be necessary if one is to disentangle particle physics parameters from astrophysical halo parameters .	Because directional detectors will be quite difficult to construct it is worthwhile exploring in advance generally which experimental features will yield the greatest benefits at the lowest costs .	We examine the sensitivity of directional detectors with varying angular tracking resolution with and without the ability to distinguish forward versus backward recoils , and compare these to the sensitivity of a detector where the track is projected onto a two-dimensional plane .	The latter detector regardless of where it is placed on the Earth , can be oriented to produce a significantly better discrimination signal than a 3D detector without this capability , and with sensitivity within a factor of 2 of a full 3D tracking detector .
1	The survey reached a 3 sigma limiting magnitude of 23.6 ( NB209 ) which corresponds to a 3 sigma limiting line flux of 2.5 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 over a 56 arcmnin^2 contiguous area ( excluding a shallower area ) .	We present a pilot narrow-band survey of H-alpha emitters at z=2.2 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North ( GOODS-N ) field with MOIRCS instrument on the Subaru telescope .	From this survey , we have identified 11 H-alpha emitters and one AGN at z=2.2 on the basis of narrow-band excesses and photometric redshifts .	We obtained spectra for seven new objects among them , including one AGN , and an emission line above 3 sigma is detected from all of them .	We have estimated star formation rates ( SFR ) and stellar masses ( M_star ) for individual galaxies .
4	Other dynamic structure factors which are governed by many-fermion excitations are calculated numerically .	We consider the spin-1/2 anisotropic XY chain in a transverse ( z ) field with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction directed along z-axis in spin space to examine the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the zz , xx and yy dynamic structure factors .	Using the Jordan-Wigner fermionization approach we analytically calculate the dynamic transverse spin structure factor .	It is governed by a two-fermion excitation continuum .	We analyze the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the two-fermion excitation continuum .
3	This transition is associated with vanishing ability of hosting high angle domain walls between adjacent stripes .	N\'eel walls in soft magnetic NiFe/NiFeGa hybrid stripe structures surrounded by a NiFe film are investigated by high resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopic imaging .	An anti-parallel orientation of magnetization in 1000 nm wide neighboring unirradiated-irradiated stripes is observed by forming high angle domain walls during magnetization reversal .	Upon downscaling the stripe structure size from 1000 nm to 200 nm a transition from a discrete domain pattern to an effective magnetic medium is observed for external magnetic field reversal .	The investigation also demonstrated the potentiality of Lorentz microscopy to image periodic stripe structures well under micron length-scale .
2	This long-time behavior is characterized by the shortest ballistic microscopic timescale of the system and therefore falls outside of the validity range for conventional approximations of statistical physics .	Magnetic resonance studies of nuclear spins in solids are exceptionally well suited to probe the limits of statistical physics .	We report experimental results indicating that isolated macroscopic systems of interacting nuclear spins possess the following fundamental property : spin decays that start from different initial configurations quickly evolve towards the same long-time behavior .	We find that the nuclear free induction decay and different solid echoes in hyperpolarized solid xenon all exhibit sinusoidally modulated exponential long-time behavior characterized by identical time constants .	This universality was previously predicted on the basis of analogy with resonances in classical chaotic systems .
0	The primordial lithium abundance inferred from observations of metal-poor stars is ~3 times smaller than the theoretical value in standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( BBN ) model .	We assume a simple model including a sterile neutrino nu_H with mass of O ( 10 ) MeV which decays long after BBN .	We then investigate cosmological effects of a sterile neutrino decay .	We formulate the injection spectrum of nonthermal photons induced by electrons and positrons generated at the nu_H decay , as a function of the nu_H mass and the photon temperature .	We then consistently solve ( 1 ) the cosmic thermal history , ( 2 ) nonthermal nucleosynthesis induced by the nonthermal photons , ( 3 ) the baryon-to-photon ratio eta , and ( 4 ) the effective neutrino number N_eff .
2	The characteristic equation of the eigenvalue problem for calculation of guided modes is obtained in an analytical form in terms of SPPS .	Spectral parameter power series ( SPPS ) method is a recently introduced technique for solving linear differential equations and related spectral problems .	In the present work we develop an approach based on the SPPS for analysis of graded-index optical fibers .	Truncation of the series and consideration in this way of the approximate characteristic equation gives us a simple and efficient numerical method for solving the problem .	Comparison with the results obtained by other available techniques reveals clear advantages of the SPPS approach , in particular , with regards to accuracy .
3	Unlike the case for other disk galaxies with detected X-ray halos , the halo emission around NGC 5746 is not accompanied by extraplanar H-alpha or radio emission , and there is no evidence for significant nuclear or starburst activity in the disk .	Models of disk galaxy formation commonly predict the existence of an extended reservoir of hot gas surrounding massive spirals at low redshift .	As a test of these models , we have obtained X-ray and optical data of the two massive edge-on spirals NGC 5746 and NGC 5170 , in order to investigate the amount and origin of hot gas in their disks and halos .	Chandra observations of NGC 5746 reveal evidence for diffuse X-ray emission with a total luminosity of ~7 x 10^39 erg/s surrounding this galaxy out to at least ~20 kpc from the disk , whereas an identical study of the less massive NGC 5170 fails to detect any extraplanar X-ray emission .	In contrast to these other cases , the emission around NGC 5746 therefore appears to arise from the cooling of externally accreted material rather than from disk outflows .
3	In this paper , we define a related class of combinatorial designs which simultaneously generalize packing designs and packing arrays .	Generalized $ t $ -designs , which form a common generalization of objects such as $ t $ -designs , resolvable designs and orthogonal arrays , were defined by Cameron [ P.J .	Cameron , A generalisation of $ t $ -designs , \emph { Discrete Math .	} \ { \bf 309 } ( 2009 ) , 4835 -- 4842 ] .	We describe the sometimes surprising connections which these generalized designs have with various known classes of combinatorial designs , including Howell designs , partial Latin squares and several classes of triple systems , and also concepts such as resolvability and block colouring of ordinary designs and packings , and orthogonal resolutions and colourings .
4	Alternatively , the Higgs may decay into the nearby singlet , along with a very light , very soft mediator particle , in which case there can be O ( 1 ) enhancement to the apparent diphoton rate even for ~ TeV-scale charged vector-like matter .	The newly discovered resonance at 125 GeV has properties consistent with the Standard Model ( SM ) Higgs particle , although some production and/or decay channels currently exhibit O ( 1 ) deviations .	We consider scenarios with a new scalar singlet field with couplings to electrically charged vector-like matter , focusing particularly on the case when the singlet mass lies within a narrow ~ few GeV window around the Higgs mass .	Such a `singlet neighbor ' presents novel mechanisms for modifying the observed properties of the Higgs boson .	For instance , even a small amount of the Higgs-singlet mixing can lead to a significant enhancement of the apparent diphoton rate .
4	We present the theory and first on-sky demonstration of a technique to measure the complex halo using the rapidly-changing residual atmospheric speckles at the 6.5m MMT telescope using the Clio mid-IR camera .	Optical imperfections , misalignments , aberrations , and even dust can significantly limit sensitivity in high-contrast imaging systems such as coronagraphs .	An upstream deformable mirror ( DM ) in the pupil can be used to correct or compensate for these flaws , either to enhance Strehl ratio or suppress residual coronagraphic halo .	Measurement of the phase and amplitude of the starlight halo at the science camera is essential for determining the DM shape that compensates for any non-common-path ( NCP ) wavefront errors .	Using DM displacement ripples to create a series of probe and anti-halo speckles in the focal plane has been proposed for space-based coronagraphs and successfully demonstrated in the lab .
3	We also report the first detection of C II 1037 emission in a supernova remnant .	We present the results of a FUSE observation of an X-ray selected knot in the Vela supernova remnant .	Spectra were obtained through the 30 '' x30 '' low resolution aperture and the 4 '' x20 '' medium resolution aperture .	O VI 1032,1038 and C III 977 are detected strongly in both spectra , and S VI 933,944 is detected weakly only in the larger aperture spectrum .	The spectra show the presence of two kinematic components along the line of sight - one with both low and high excitation emission centered at a velocity of -50 km/s and another with only low excitation emission centered at a velocity of +100 km/s .
0	Relations between categorical variables can be analyzed conveniently by multiple correspondence analysis ( MCA ) .	% It is well suited to discover relations that may exist between categories of different variables .	The graphical representation of MCA results in so-called biplots makes it easy to interpret the most important associations .	However , a major drawback of MCA is that it does not have an underlying probability model for an individual selecting a category on a variable .	In this paper , we propose such probability model called multinomial multiple correspondence analysis ( MMCA ) that combines the underlying low-rank representation of MCA with maximum likelihood .
2	For expansion from a harmonic trap , and in the limits of very weak and very strong interactions , we recover the self-similar scaling solutions known from the hydrodynamic approach .	We analyze free expansion of a trapped one-dimensional Bose gas after a sudden release from the confining trap potential .	By using the stationary phase and local density approximations , we show that the long-time asymptotic density profile and the momentum distribution of the gas are determined by the initial distribution of Bethe rapidities ( quasimomenta ) and hence can be obtained from the solutions to the Lieb-Liniger equations in the thermodynamic limit .	For all other power-law traps and arbitrary interaction strengths , the expansion is not self-similar and shows strong dependence of the density profile evolution on the trap anharmonicity .	We also characterize dynamical fermionization of the expanding cloud in terms of correlation functions describing phase and density fluctuations .
2	In particular , ZEBRA uses the template-fitting approach to produce Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian redshift estimates based on : ( 1 . )	We present ZEBRA , the Zurich Extragalactic Bayesian Redshift Analyzer .	The current version of ZEBRA combines and extends several of the classical approaches to produce accurate photometric redshifts down to faint magnitudes .	An automatic iterative technique to correct the original set of galaxy templates to best represent the SEDs of real galaxies at different redshifts ; ( 2 . )	A training set of spectroscopic redshifts for a small fraction of the photometric sample ; and ( 3 . )
1	The yield of fission products is calculated using the statistical model based on the driving potentials for the fissionable system .	The mechanism leading to the formation of the observed products of the collinear cluster tripartition is carried out within the framework of the model based on the dinuclear system concept .	The minima of potential energy of the decaying system correspond to the charge numbers of the products which are produced with large probabilities in the sequential fission ( partial case of the collinear cluster tripartition ) of the compound nucleus .	The realization of this mechanism supposes the asymmetric fission channel as the first stage of sequential mechanism .	It is shown that only the use of the driving potential calculated by the binding energies with the shell correction allows us to explain the yield of the true ternary fission products .
1	Most of these absorbers are found to be metal-poor , while 2 are found to have ~ 30-50 solar metallicities .	We present elemental abundance measurements for 9 damped Ly-alpha systems ( DLAs ) and 1 sub-DLA at 0.1 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.5 from recent observations with the Multiple Mirror Telescope .	Combining our data with other data from the literature , we find that the systems with higher [ Zn/H ] also have stronger depletion as measured by [ Cr/Zn ] and [ Fe/Zn ] .	The relationship between the metallicity and H I column density is also investigated .	Together with our previous MMT survey ( Khare et al .
1	We obtain universal expressions for the spin and charge current fluctuations , cast in terms of current-current autocorrelation functions .	We study the spin-Hall conductance fluctuations in ballistic mesoscopic systems .	We show that the latter are conveniently parametrized as deformed Lorentzian shape lines , functions of an external applied magnetic field and the Fermi energy .	We find that the charge current fluctuations show quite unique statistical features at the symplectic-unitary crossover regime .	Our findings are based on an evaluation of the generalized transmission coefficients correlation functions within the stub model and are amenable to experimental test .
1	We consider Gaussian real matrices $ X_1 , X_2 $ , for which the generalised eigenvalues have the rotational invariance of the half-sphere , or after a fractional linear transformation , the rotational invariance of the unit disk .	The generalised eigenvalues for a pair of $ N\times N $ matrices $ ( X_1 , X_2 ) $ are defined as the solutions of the equation $ \det ( X_1-\lambda X_2 ) =0 $ , or equivalently , for $ X_2 $ invertible , as the eigenvalues of $ X_2^ { -1 } X_1 $ .	In these latter variables we calculate the joint eigenvalue probability density function , the probability $ p_ { N , k } $ of finding $ k $ real eigenvalues , the densities of real and complex eigenvalues ( the latter being related to an average over characteristic polynomials ) , and give an explicit Pfaffian formula for the higher correlation functions $ \rho_ { ( k_1 , k_2 ) } $ .	A limit theorem for $ p_ { N , k } $ is proved , and the scaled form of $ \rho_ { ( k_1 , k_2 ) } $ is shown to be identical to the analogous limit for the correlations of the eigenvalues of real Gaussian matrices .	We show that these correlations satisfy sum rules characteristic of the underlying two-component Coulomb gas .
1	The cation as well as the anion surface vacancy show a pronounced inward relaxation of the three nearest neighbor atoms towards the vacancy while the surface point-group symmetry is maintained .	We have performed total-energy density-functional calculations using first-principles pseudopotentials to determine the atomic and electronic structure of neutral surface and subsurface vacancies at the GaP ( 110 ) surface .	For both types of vacancies we find a singly occupied level at mid gap .	Subsurface vacancies below the second layer display essentially the same properties as bulk defects .	Our results for vacancies in the second layer show features not observed for either surface or bulk vacancies : Large relaxations occur and both defects are unstable against the formation of antisite vacancy complexes .
1	Strong coupling or competition between various orders in these systems presents the key to manipulate their functional properties by means of external perturbations such as electric and magnetic fields or pressure .	The interplay among charge , spin and lattice degrees of freedom in solids gives rise to intriguing macroscopic quantum phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance , multiferroicity and high-temperature superconductivity .	Ultrashort and intense optical pulses have emerged as an interesting tool to investigate elementary dynamics and control material properties by melting an existing order .	Here , we employ few-cycle multi-terahertz pulses to resonantly probe the evolution of the spin-density-wave ( SDW ) gap of the pnictide compound BaFe2As2 following excitation with a femtosecond optical pulse .	When starting in the low-temperature ground state , optical excitation results in a melting of the SDW order , followed by ultrafast recovery .
3	The electromagnetic units in SI are actually based on concepts of prerelativistic classical electrodynamics such as ether , electric permitivity and magnetic permeability of vacuum .	The problem of fundamental units is discussed in the context of achievements of both theoretical physics and modern metrology .	On one hand , due to fascinating accuracy of atomic clocks , the traditional macroscopic standards of metrology ( second , metre , kilogram ) are giving way to standards based on fundamental units of nature : velocity of light $ c $ and quantum of action $ h $ .	On the other hand , the poor precision of gravitational constant $ G $ , which is widely believed to define the `` cube of theories '' and the units of the future `` theory of everything '' , does not allow to use $ G $ as a fundamental dimensional constant in metrology .	Concluding remarks are devoted to terminological confusion which accompanies the progress in basic physics and metrology .
0	Nondegenerate geometry ( T-geometry ) with nonsymmetric world function is considered .	In application to the space-time geometry the asymmetry of world function means that the past and the future are not equivalent geometrically .	T-geometry is described in terms of finite point subspaces and world function between pairs of points of these subsets , i.e.in the language which is immanent to geometry and free of external means of description ( coordinates , curves ) .	Such a description appears to be simple and effective even in the case of complicated T-geometry .	Antisymmetric component of the world function generates appearance of additional metric fields .
2	The resulting minimum mass of the planet ( m2 sin i ) is only 0.052 Mjup = 0.97 Mnep = 16.6 Mearth making Gl 581b one of the lightest extra-solar planet known to date .	We report the discovery of a Neptune-mass planet around Gl 581 ( M3V , M = 0.31 Msol ) , based on precise Doppler measurements with the HARPS spectrograph at La Silla Observatory .	The radial velocities reveal a circular orbit of period P = 5.366 days and semi-amplitude K1 = 13.2 m/s .	The Gl 581 planetary system is only the third centered on an M dwarf , joining the Gl 876 three-planet system and the lone planet around Gl 436 .	Its discovery reinforces the emerging tendency of such planets to be of low mass , and found at short orbital periods .
0	Conditional mutual information is important in the selection and interpretation of graphical models .	Its empirical version is well known as a generalised likelihood ratio test and that it may be represented as a difference in entropy .	We consider the forward difference expansion of the entropy function defined on all subsets of the variables under study .	The elements of this expansion are invariant to permutation of their suffices and relate higher order mutual informations to lower order ones .	The third order difference is expressible as an , apparently assymmetric , difference between a marginal and a conditional mutual information .
4	We also outline extensions of our methods leading to novel methods for Non-negative PLS and Generalized PLS , an adaption of PLS for structured data .	High-dimensional data common in genomics , proteomics , and chemometrics often contains complicated correlation structures .	Recently , partial least squares ( PLS ) and Sparse PLS methods have gained attention in these areas as dimension reduction techniques in the context of supervised data analysis .	We introduce a framework for Regularized PLS by solving a relaxation of the SIMPLS optimization problem with penalties on the PLS loadings vectors .	Our approach enjoys many advantages including flexibility , general penalties , easy interpretation of results , and fast computation in high-dimensional settings .
2	For instance , a plate is preferred to be inserted vertically into the slot of a dish-rack as compared to be placed horizontally in it .	The ability to place objects in the environment is an important skill for a personal robot .	An object should not only be placed stably , but should also be placed in its preferred location/orientation .	Unstructured environments such as homes have a large variety of object types as well as of placing areas .	Therefore our algorithms should be able to handle placing new object types and new placing areas .
3	By re-summing the most divergent diagrams , we obtain a closed form of the self-energy near the mass shell .	We consider a system of 2D fermions with short-range interaction .	A straightforward perturbation theory is shown to be ill-defined even for an infinitesimally weak interaction , as the perturbative series for the self-energy diverges near the mass shell .	We show that the divergences result from the interaction of fermions with the zero-sound collective mode .	The spectral function exhibits a threshold feature at the onset of the emission of the zero-sound waves .
0	We present observations of high-amplitude rapid ( 2 s ) variability toward two bright , compact extragalactic radio sources out of several hundred of the brightest radio sources in one of the 30x30 deg MWA Epoch of Reionization fields using the Murchison Widefield Array ( MWA ) at 155 MHz .	After rejecting intrinsic , instrumental , and ionospheric origins we consider the most likely explanation for this variability to be interplanetary scintillation ( IPS ) , likely the result of a large coronal mass ejection propagating from the Sun .	This is confirmed by roughly contemporaneous observations with the Ooty Radio Telescope .	We see evidence for structure on spatial scales ranging from & lt ; 1000 km to & gt ; 1e6 km .	The serendipitous night-time nature of these detections illustrates the new regime that the MWA has opened for IPS studies with sensitive night-time , wide-field , low-frequency observations .
2	Considering an exhaustive set of hadronic reactions and vector meson decays we have estimated the photon spectrum emitted from hot hadronic matter taking into account medium effects through thermal loop corrections on the hadronic decay widths and masses .	Temperature dependence of hadronic decay widths and masses are studied within the framework of an effective Lagrangian approach .	At finite temperature the hadronic masses do not seem to follow a universal scaling law .	An enhancement in photon emission rate is obtained when we use the in-medium masses of vector mesons in our calculations .	It is observed that the effect of $ \rho $ decay width on the photon spectra is negligible .
2	We presents a NOT operation on the Majorana qubit with moving the complementary soliton through heterostructure adiabatically .	Coupling Majorana qubits with other qubits is an absolute essential in storing , manipulating and transferring informations for topological quantum computing .	We theoretically propose a manner to coupling Majorana qubits with solitons , another kind of topological impurities , which was first studied in the spinless Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ( SSH ) model .	Based on these two topological impurities , the operation is robust against local disorder .	Furthermore , we find that the soliton may carry decimal electric charge instead of fractional charge $ 1/2 $ , because of the breaking of gauge invariance induced by superconducting proximity .
2	2013 ) , it is shown that , up to a stopping time $ \tau $ , a stochastic flow of local diffeomorphisms $ \varphi_t $ in $ M $ can be decomposed in diffeomorphisms that preserves this foliations .	Let $ M $ be a manifold equipped ( locally ) with a pair of complementary foliations .	In Catuogno , da Silva and Ruffino ( Stoch.Dyn .	In this article we present techniques which allows us to extend the time of this decomposition .	For this extension , we use two techniques : In the first one , assuming that the vector fields of the system commute with each other , we apply Marcus equation to jump nondecomposable diffeomorphisms .
4	We demonstrate that a large mass difference in the two intercalated layers , or weakened interactions across the interface between layers result in materials with very low thermal conductivity , below the values of the corresponding amorphous counterparts .	The value measured in the amorphous structure with the same chemical composition is often considered as a lower bound for the thermal conductivity of any material : the heat carriers are strongly scattered by disorder , and their lifetimes reach the minimum time scale of thermal vibrations .	An appropriate design at the nano-scale , however , may allow one to reduce the thermal conductivity even below the amorphous limit .	In the present contribution , using molecular-dynamics simulation and the Green-Kubo formulation , we study systematically the thermal conductivity of layered phononic materials ( superlattices ) , by tuning different parameters that can characterize such structures .	We discover that the key to reach a lower-than-amorphous thermal conductivity is to block almost completely the propagation of the heat carriers , the superlattice phonons .
3	For this purpose , we perform systematic simulations of two-flavor QCD with an improved Wilson quark action to investigate the equation of state .	The QCD thermodynamics on the lattice provides fundamental theoretical grounds to analyze the various experimental data in relativistic heavy ion collisions .	So far , most of the numerical simulations on the lattice have been performed by using the staggered-type fermion actions .	Therefore it is important to carry out studies using different fermion formulations to test the uncertainties of the lattice QCD results .	We report the current status of our project and show the preliminary results of the Taylor expansion coefficients of the thermodynamic grand partition function in terms of chemical potential .
4	In addition to the methods , in the object-oriented sense , for performing traditional encryption and decryption , the system implements methods for visible and invisible watermarking .	With the explosive growth of internet technology , easy transfer of digital multimedia is feasible .	However , this kind of convenience with which authorized users can access information , turns out to be a mixed blessing due to information piracy .	The emerging field of Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) systems addresses issues related to the intellectual property rights of digital content .	In this paper , an object-oriented ( OO ) DRM system , called `` Imaging System with Watermarking and Attack Resilience '' ( ISWAR ) , is presented that generates and authenticates color images with embedded mechanisms for protection against infringement of ownership rights as well as security attacks .
0	We present a feasibility study of observing $ HH\rightarrow b\bar b\gamma\gamma $ at the future hadron colliders with $ \sqrt { s } = $ 14 , 33 , and 100 TeV .	The measured cross section then can be used to constrain the Higgs self-coupling directly in the standard model .	Any deviation could be a sign of new physics .	The signal and background events are estimated using Delphes 3.0.10 fast Monte Carlo simulation based on the ATLAS detector capabilities .	With 3 ab $ ^ { -1 } $ data , it would be possible to measure the Higgs self-coupling with a 50 % , 20 % , and 8 % statistical accuracy by observing $ HH\rightarrow b\bar b\gamma\gamma $ at $ \sqrt { s } = $ 14 , 33 , and 100 TeV colliders , respectively .
4	We also show that the success probabilities can reach 100 % for restricted classes of states .	We propose two controlled remote state preparation protocols via partially entangled channels .	One prepares a single-qubit state and the other prepares a two-qubit state .	Different from other controlled remote state preparation schemes which also utilize partially entangled channels , neither auxiliary qubits nor two-qubit unitary transformations are required in our schemes and the success probabilities are independent of the coefficients of the quantum channel .	The success probabilities are 50 % and 25 % for arbitrary single-qubit states and two-qubit states , respectively .
1	The noise is of internal origin and due to the discrete character and finite number of constituents of the swarm .	We obtain a Fokker-Planck equation describing experimental data on the collective motion of locusts .	The stationary probability distribution shows a rich phenomenology including non-monotonic behavior of several order/disorder transition indicators in noise intensity .	This complex behavior arises naturally as a result of the randomness in the system .	Its counterintuitive character challenges standard interpretations of noise induced transitions and calls for an extension of this theory in order to capture the behavior of certain classes of biologically motivated models .
4	This paper considers the case $ X=S^1 $ , $ R=K_p^\wedge $ , the p-adic $ K $ -theory spectrum , and $ \zeta = 1-p \in \pi_1BGL_1K_p^\wedge $ .	Let $ R $ be an $ E_\infty $ -ring spectrum .	Given a map $ \zeta $ from a space $ X $ to $ BGL_1R $ , one can construct a Thom spectrum , $ X^\zeta $ , which generalises the classical notion of Thom spectrum for spherical fibrations in the case $ R=S^0 $ , the sphere spectrum .	If $ X $ is a loop space ( $ \simeq \Omega Y $ ) and $ \zeta $ is homotopy equivalent to $ \Omega f $ for a map $ f $ from $ Y $ to $ B^2GL_1R $ , then the Thom spectrum has an $ A_\infty $ -ring structure .	The Topological Hochschild Homology of these $ A_\infty $ -ring spectra is equivalent to the Thom spectrum of a map out of the free loop space of $ Y $ .
2	We report simulations of the channel performance and its comparison with the vacuum case ; we also briefly discuss technical and safety issues associated with cavities filled with high-pressure hydrogen gas .	A Neutrino Factory requires an intense and well-cooled ( in transverse phase space ) muon beam .	We discuss a hybrid approach for a linear 4D cooling channel consisting of high-pressure gas-filled RF cavities- potentially allowing high gradients without breakdown- and discrete LiH absorbers to provide the necessary energy loss that results in the required muon beam cooling .	Even with additional windows that might be needed for safety reasons , the channel performance is comparable to that of the original , all-vacuum Feasibility Study 2a channel on which our design is based .	If tests demonstrate that the gas-filled RF cavities can operate effectively with an intense beam of ionizing particles passing through them , our approach would be an attractive way of avoiding possible breakdown problems with a vacuum RF channel .
4	In particular , a new class of time-periodic solutions with quasi-closed particle trajectories is constructed and studied .	Lie symmetry analysis is applied to study the nonlinear rotating shallow water equations .	The 9-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries admitted by the model is found .	It is shown that the rotating shallow water equations are related with the classical shallow water model with the change of variables .	The derived symmetries are used to generate new exact solutions of the rotating shallow equations .
1	In terms of language usage , one of the most influential results is Zipf 's law of word frequencies .	Quantitative linguistics has provided us with a number of empirical laws that characterise the evolution of languages and competition amongst them .	Zipf 's law appears to be universal , and may not even be unique to human language .	However , there is ongoing controversy over whether Zipf 's law is a good indicator of complexity .	Here we present an alternative approach that puts Zipf 's law in the context of critical phenomena ( the cornerstone of complexity in physics ) and establishes the presence of a large scale `` attraction '' between successive repetitions of words .
4	In all these contexts , we find that mutual information can be used as an appropriate figure of merit for determining the synchronization phases , independently of the specific details of the system .	Spontaneous synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon , important in many theoretical studies and applications .	Recently this effect has been analyzed and observed in a number of physical systems close to the quantum mechanical regime .	In this work we propose the mutual information as a useful order parameter which can capture the emergence of synchronization in very different contexts , ranging from semi-classical to intrinsically quantum mechanical systems .	Specifically we first study the synchronization of two coupled Van der Pol oscillators in both classical and quantum regimes and later we consider the synchronization of two qubits inside two coupled optical cavities .
1	This yields a Hilbert-space like structure to convex functionals in Banach spaces .	Semi-inner-products in the sense of Lumer are extended to convex functionals .	In particular , a general expression for semi-inner-products with respect to one homogeneous functionals is given .	Thus one can use the new operator for the analysis of total variation and higher order functionals like total-generalized-variation ( TGV ) .	Having a semi-inner-product , an angle between functions can be defined in a straightforward manner .
4	The X-ray bolometric correction , kappa_ ( 2-10 keV ) , of our sample is lower than in the case of AGN , with a mean value of 16 .	( Abridged ) We attempt to infer the accretion mechanism and radiative processes giving rise to the SEDs of a well-defined optically-selected sample of LINERs showing a definite detection of broad Halpha emission ( LINER 1s ) .	We construct SEDs for six LINER~1s with simultaneous UV and X-ray fluxes , and we looked for multiwavelength , radio to X-ray and UV to X-ray , correlations .	At a given X-ray luminosity , the average SED of the six LINER 1s in our sample : ( 1 ) resembles the SED of radio-loud quasars in the radio band , & lt ; log R_X & gt ; ~-2.7 , ( 2 ) exhibits a weak UV bump , & lt ; alpha_ox & gt ; ~-1.17+-0.02 with a dispersion sigma=0.01 , and ( 3 ) displays a X-ray spectrum similar to radio-quiet quasars .	The bolometric luminosities inferred from the SEDs are extremely faint , at least two orders of magnitude lower than AGN .
2	In order to protect DFSs against these errors it is sufficient to employ a recently proposed concatenated DFS-quantum error correcting code scheme [ D.A .	The exchange interaction between identical qubits in a quantum information processor gives rise to unitary two-qubit errors .	It is shown here that decoherence free subspaces ( DFSs ) for collective decoherence undergo Pauli errors under exchange , which however do not take the decoherence free states outside of the DFS .

1	Here we present an analysis of the persistent radiative evolution and a statistical study of the burst properties during the 2009 outburst using the { \em Swift } X-ray Telescope ( XRT ) .	The magnetar 1E~1547 $ - $ 5408 recently exhibited two periods of outburst , beginning on 2008 October 3 and 2009 January 22 .	We find that the 1 -- 10 keV flux increased by a factor of $ \sim500 $ and hardened significantly , peaking $ \sim6 $ hours after the onset of the outburst .	The observed pulsed fraction exhibited an anti-correlation with phase-averaged flux .	Properties of the several hundred X-ray bursts during the 2009 outburst were determined and compared to those from other magnetar outburst events .
4	We also obtain that the resulting wealth distribution of all traders corresponds to the well-known Pareto power law , while the one of random traders is exponential .	Building on similarities between earthquakes and extreme financial events , we use a self-organized criticality-generating model to study herding and avalanche dynamics in financial markets .	We consider a community of interacting investors , distributed on a small-world network , who bet on the bullish ( increasing ) or bearish ( decreasing ) behavior of the market which has been specified according to the S & amp ; P500 historical time series .	Remarkably , we find that the size of herding-related avalanches in the community can be strongly reduced by the presence of a relatively small percentage of traders , randomly distributed inside the network , who adopt a random investment strategy .	Our findings suggest a promising strategy to limit the size of financial bubbles and crashes .
0	RX J1856.5-3754 has been proposed as a strange star candidate due to its very small apparent radius measured from its X-ray thermal spectrum .	However , its optical emission requires a much larger radius and thus most of the stellar surface must be cold and undetectable in X-rays .	In the case the star is a neutron star such a surface temperature distribution can be explained by the presence of a strong toroidal field in the crust ( Perez-Azorin et al .	2006 , Geppert et al.2006 ) .	We consider a similar scenario for a strange star with a thin baryonic crust to determine if such a magnetic field induced effect is still possible .
2	These results are applied to the spectral action of the noncommutative space defined by the standard model .	The arbitrary mass scale in the spectral action for the Dirac operator in the spectral action is made dynamical by introducing a dilaton field .	We evaluate all the low-energy terms in the spectral action and determine the dilaton couplings .	We show that the effective action for all matter couplings is scale invariant , except for the dilaton kinetic term and Einstein-Hilbert term .	The resulting action is almost identical to the one proposed for making the standard model scale invariant as well as the model for extended inflation and has the same low-energy limit as the Randall-Sundrum model .
0	Various classes of stable finite difference schemes can be constructed to obtain a numerical solution .	It is important to select among all stable schemes such a scheme that is optimal in terms of certain additional criteria .	In this study , we use a simple boundary value problem for a one-dimensional parabolic equation to discuss the selection of an approximation with respect to time .	We consider the pure diffusion equation , the pure convective transport equation and combined convection-diffusion phenomena .	Requirements for the unconditionally stable finite difference schemes are formulated that are related to retaining the main features of the differential problem .
2	139 , 104904 ( 2013 ) ] for mixtures of single patch colloids ( p colloids ) and colloids with spherically symmetric attractions ( s colloids ) to the case that the p colloids can have multiple patches .	In this paper we extend our previous theory [ B. D. Marshall and W.G .	Chapman , J. Chem.Phys .	The theory is then applied to the case of a binary mixture of bi-functional p colloids which have an A and B type patch and s colloids which are not attracted to other s colloids and are attracted to only patch A on the p colloids .	This mixture reversibly self assembles into both colloidal star molecules , where the s colloid is the articulation segment and the p colloids form the arms , and free chains composed of only p colloids .
2	In addition , by introducing an adiabatic deformation between one Chern number 2 band and two Chern number 1 bands , we show that the topological order in the Gutzwiller-projected state does not always agree with the expectation of topological field theory .	Using a method called momentum polarization , we study the quasiparticle topological spin and edge-state chiral central charge of non-Abelian topological ordered states described by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions .	Our results verify that the fractional Chern insulator state obtained by Gutzwiller projection of two partons in bands of Chern number 2 is described by $ SU ( 2 ) _2 $ Chern-Simons theory coupled to fermions , rather than the pure $ SU ( 2 ) _2 $ Chern-Simons theory .	Even if the parton mean-field state is adiabatically deformed , the Gutzwiller projection can introduce a topological phase transition between Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered states .	Our approach applies to more general topologically ordered states described by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions .
4	This suggests that other factors play an important role .	Galactic sized gravitational lenses are simulated by combining a cosmological N-body simulation and models for the baryonic component of the galaxy .	The lens caustics , critical curves , image locations and magnification ratios are calculated by ray-shooting on an adaptive grid .	When the source is near a cusp in a smooth lens ' caustic the sum of the magnifications of the three closest images should be close to zero .	It is found that in the observed cases this sum is generally too large to be consistent with the simulations implying that there is not enough substructure in the simulations .
1	This stochastic partial differential equation ( SPDE ) is used as a test case to understand , how numerical continuation methods can be carried over to the SPDE setting .	We study the Allen-Cahn equation with a cubic-quintic nonlinear term and a stochastic $ Q $ -trace-class stochastic forcing in two spatial dimensions .	First , we compute the deterministic bifurcation diagram for the PDE , i.e.without stochastic forcing .	In this case , two locally asymptotically stable steady state solution branches exist upon variation of the linear damping term .	Then we consider the Lyapunov operator equation for the locally linearized system around steady states for the SPDE .
0	Innovative auction methods can be exploited to increase profits , with Shubik 's famous `` dollar auction '' perhaps being the most widely known example .	Recently , some mainstream e-commerce web sites have apparently achieved the same end on a much broader scale , by using `` pay-per-bid '' auctions to sell items , from video games to bars of gold .	In these auctions , bidders incur a cost for placing each bid in addition to ( or sometimes in lieu of ) the winner 's final purchase cost .	Thus even when a winner 's purchase cost is a small fraction of the item 's intrinsic value , the auctioneer can still profit handsomely from the bid fees .	Our work provides novel analyses for these auctions , based on both modeling and datasets derived from auctions at Swoopo.com , the leading pay-per-bid auction site .
3	The presence of a bar has no influence on the AGN strength , with barred and unbarred active galaxies showing equivalent X-ray luminosity distributions .	We present empirical constraints on the influence of stellar bars on the fueling of active galactic nuclei ( AGNs ) out to z=0.84 using a sample of X-ray-selected AGNs hosted in luminous non-interacting face-on and moderately inclined disk galaxies from the Chandra COSMOS survey .	Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging to identify bars , we find that the fraction of barred active galaxies displays a similar behavior as that of inactive spirals , declining with redshift from 71 % at z~0.3 , to 35 % at z~0.8 .	With active galaxies being typically massive , we compare them against a mass-matched sample of inactive spirals and show that , while at face value the AGN bar fraction is slightly higher at all redshifts , we can not rule out that the bar fractions of active and inactive galaxies are the same .	From our results , we conclude that the occurrence and the efficiency of the fueling process is independent of the large scale structure of a galaxy .
1	A catalogue was produced containing 397 X-ray sources with their properties measured by the HRI .	All 543 pointed observations of the ROSAT High Resolution Imager ( HRI ) with exposure times higher than 50 sec in a field of 10 deg x 10 deg covering the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) were analyzed .	The list was cross-correlated with the ROSAT Position Sensitive Propotional Counter ( PSPC ) source catalogue presented by Haberl & amp ; Pietsch ( 1999 ) , the SIMBAD data base , and the TYCHO catalogue .	138 HRI sources are contained in the PSPC catalogue .	The spatial resolution of the HRI was higher than that of the PSPC and the source position could be determined with errors mostly smaller than 15 arcsec which are dominated by systematic attitude errors .
3	We find that such galaxies are often barely resolved in the ACS images , having half-light radii of 0.1-0.3 arcsec ( & lt ; 2 kpc ) .	In a recent paper Lehnert & amp ; Bremer have photometrically selected a sample of galaxies at z & gt ; 4.8 from a single VLT/FORS2 pointing and spectroscopically confirmed half of them to be at 4.8 & lt ; z & lt ; 5.8 .	To study the properties of such galaxies further , we have photometrically selected a similar sample ( V ( AB ) & gt ; 28 , i ( AB ) & lt ; 26.3 , i ( AB ) -z ( AB ) & gt ; 0 ) from the HST ACS images of the Chandra Deep Field South .	This selection results in a sample of 44 sources from ~150 sq.arcmin .	They show no difference in spatial clustering from sources selected by i ( AB ) & lt ; 26.3 , i ( AB ) -z ( AB ) & gt ; 0 , which are generally galaxies of lower redshift .
4	The implications of our results are discussed .	Starting from the Wigner-Moyal equation coupled to Poisson 's equation , a simplified set of equations describing nonlinear Landau damping of Langmuir waves is derived .	This system is studied numerically , with a particular focus on the transition from the classical to the quantum regime .	In the quantum regime several new features are found .	This includes a quantum modified bounce frequency , and the discovery that bounce-like amplitude oscillations can take place even in the absence of trapped particles .
4	The role of handling self consistently the subthreshold $ \eta N $ interaction is carefully studied .	We report on precise hyperspherical-basis calculations of $ \eta NN $ and $ \eta NNN $ quasibound states , using energy dependent $ \eta N $ interaction potentials derived from coupled-channel models of the $ S_ { 11 } $ $ N^ { \ast } ( 1535 ) $ nucleon resonance .	The $ \eta N $ attraction generated in these models is too weak to generate a two-body bound state .	No $ \eta NN $ bound-state solution was found in our calculations in models where Re $ a_ { \eta N } \lesssim 1 $ fm , with $ a_ { \eta N } $ the $ \eta N $ scattering length , covering thereby the majority of $ N^ { \ast } ( 1535 ) $ resonance models .	A near-threshold $ \eta NNN $ bound-state solution , with $ \eta $ separation energy of less than 1 MeV and width of about 15 MeV , was obtained in the 2005 Green-Wycech model where Re $ a_ { \eta N } \approx 1 $ fm .
1	We investigate here the connection between the general solvable IRF models and the fusion ones .	Recently , a class of interaction round the face ( IRF ) solvable lattice models were introduced , based on any rational conformal field theory ( RCFT ) .	To this end , we introduce an associative algebra associated to any graph , as the algebra of products of the eigenvalues of the incidence matrix .	If a model is based on an RCFT , its associated graph algebra is the fusion ring of the RCFT .	A number of examples are studied .
1	The Taskforce 's goal is to be able to quickly calculate the impact of any mission design changes on LISA 's science capabilities , based on reasonable estimates of the distribution of astrophysical sources in the universe .	The LISA Parameter Estimation ( LISAPE ) Taskforce was formed in September 2007 to provide the LISA Project with vetted codes , source distribution models , and results related to parameter estimation .	This paper describes our Taskforce 's work on massive black-hole binaries ( MBHBs ) .	Given present uncertainties in the formation history of MBHBs , we adopt four different population models , based on ( i ) whether the initial black-hole seeds are small or large , and ( ii ) whether accretion is efficient or inefficient at spinning up the holes .	We compare four largely independent codes for calculating LISA 's parameter-estimation capabilities .
4	Scaled to a 10 cm aggregate about 2x10^4 small silicate aggregates might result .	Recently Saito & amp ; Sirono ( 2011 ) proposed that large ice aggregates which drift in- wards in protoplanetary disks break up during sublimation , ejecting embedded silicate particles .	This would lead to a concentration of small solid particles close to the snow- line .	In view of this model we carried out laboratory experiments where we observed freely levitating ice aggregates sublimating .	We ? nd that frequent break up is indeed very common .
3	To target cluster members reliably during spectroscopic surveys and both spatial and radial distributions in the cluster outskirts without including field stars , a good proper motion and membership probability catalogue of NGC 6809 is required.The archival data of two epochs with a time-base line of 7.1 years have been collected with Wide Field Imager ( WFI ) mounted on the 2.2m MPG/ESO telescope .	NGC 6809 is a luminous metal-poor halo globular cluster that is relatively easy to study due to its proximity and low concentration .	Because of its high Galactic latitude ( b = -23deg ) , interstellar reddening and contamination is not very high .	We aim to determine the relative proper motion and membership probability of the stars in the wide area of globular cluster NGC 6809 .	The CCD images of both epochs have been reduced using the astrometric techniques as described in Anderson et al . ( 2006 ) .
1	It captures several aspects of single and multicentered BPS black hole geometries in four-dimensional $ \mathcal { N } = 2 $ supergravity such as the presence of bound states and an exponential growth of microstates .	Quiver quantum mechanics describes the low energy dynamics of a system of wrapped D-branes .	The Coulomb branch of an Abelian three node quiver is obtained by integrating out the massive strings connecting the D-particles .	It allows for a scaling regime corresponding to a deep AdS $ _2 $ throat on the gravity side .	In this scaling regime , the Coulomb branch is shown to be an $ SL ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) $ invariant multi-particle superconformal quantum mechanics .
1	While some areas of astronomy ( most notably pulsar studies ) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades , recently new areas have crossed into this regime .	As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve , the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves , but by the manner , standard , and uniformity with which time itself is referenced .	In particular , in the exoplanet community , we have found that the ( typically unspecified ) time standards adopted by various groups can differ by as much as a minute .	Left uncorrected , this ambiguity may be mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements .	We argue that , since the commonly-used Julian Date , as well as its heliocentric and barycentric counterparts , can be specified in several time standards , it is imperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1 minute are required .
3	They are needed for the rigorous evaluation of the classical continuum limit of the axial anomaly and index of the overlap Dirac operator at general values of m , and provide information on the topological phase structure of overlap fermions .	Lower bounds on the magnitude of the spectrum of the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator H ( m ) have previously been derived for 0 & lt ; m & lt ; 2 when the lattice gauge field satisfies a certain smoothness condition .	In this paper lower bounds are derived for 2p-2 & lt ; m & lt ; 2p for general p=1,2 , ... , d where d is the spacetime dimension .	The bounds can alternatively be viewed as localisation bounds on the real spectrum of the usual Wilson-Dirac operator .	They are also useful for understanding the instanton size-dependence of the real spectrum of the Wilson-Dirac operator in an instanton background .
2	It is further surprising that the rate increases up to about twenty five percent , as the hopper empties and the granular pressure head decreases .	The discharge of spherical grains from a hole in the bottom of a right circular cylinder is measured with the entire system underwater .	We find that the discharge rate depends on filling height , in contrast to the well-known case of dry non-cohesive grains .	For deep filling , where the discharge rate is constant , we measure the behavior as a function of both grain and hole diameters .	The discharge rate scale is set by the product of hole area and the terminal falling speed of isolated grains .
2	By imposing $ n_ { _N } \le m \forall N\in \zN $ , Jarnik defined the corresponding sets $ E_m $ and gave a first estimate of $ d_H ( E_m ) $ , $ d_H $ the Hausdorff dimension .	This paper has been withdrawn Any real number $ x $ in the unit interval can be expressed as a continued fraction $ x= [ n_1 , ... , n_ { _N } , ... ] $ .	Subsets of zero measure are obtained by imposing simple conditions on the $ n_ { _N } $ .	Subsequent authors improved these estimates .	In this paper we deal with $ d_H ( E_m ) $ and $ d_H ( F_m ) $ , $ F_m $ being the set of real numbers for which $ { \sum_ { i=1 } ^N n_i\over N } \le m $ .
1	The reduced density matrix of the system in the steady state is obtained by tracing out the degree of freedom of the thermal bath from the equilibrium density matrix of the total system .	We study the structure of the time evolution of the density matrix in contact with a thermal bath in a standard projection operator sheme .	This reduced density matrix is modified by the interaction , and is different from that of the equilibrium of the system alone .	We explicitly calculate the contribution of each term in quantum master equation to the realization of the steady state density matrix , and make clear roles of each term .	By making use of the role of each term , the properties of the commonly used quantum master equation are examined .
3	A gauge monopole spacetime is essentially that of a magnetically charged black hole .	It has been recently shown that topological defects can arise in symmetry breaking models where the scalar field potential $ V ( \phi ) $ has no minima and is a monotonically decreasing function of $ |\phi| $ .	Here we study the gravitational fields produced by such vacuumless defects in the cases of both global and gauge symmetry breaking .	We find that a global monopole has a strongly repulsive gravitational field , and its spacetime has an event horizon similar to that in de Sitter space .	The gravitational field of a global string is repulsive and that of a gauge string is attractive at small distances and repulsive at large distances .
3	We discuss various models for the formation of this line .	We report the detection of faint emission in the high-excitation [ OIV ] 25.90um line in a number of starburst galaxies , from observations obtained with the Short Wavelength Spectrometer ( SWS ) on board ISO .	Further observations of M82 spatially resolve the [ OIV ] emitting region .	Detection of this line in starbursts is surprising since it is not produced in measurable quantities in HII regions around hot main-sequence stars , the dominant energy source of starburst galaxies .	[ OIV ] that is spatially resolved by ISO can not originate in a weak AGN and must be due to very hot stars or ionizing shocks related to the starburst activity .
2	We give a derivation of this result in terms of the type II five-brane compactified on K3 , by assuming that its fluctuations are described by a closed string theory on its world-volume .	We present a microscopic index formula for the degeneracy of dyons in four-dimensional N=4 string theory .	This counting formula is manifestly symmetric under the duality group , and its asymptotic growth reproduces the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy .	We find that the degeneracies are given in terms of the denominator of a generalized super Kac-Moody algebra .	We also discuss the correspondence of this result with the counting of D-brane states .
2	However , some additional set-theoretic assumption is needed , as we prove in the main result of this paper that it is consistent with the usual axioms of set-theory that there is no universal Banach space of density $ \cc $ .	We consider the question whether there exists a Banach space $ X $ of density continuum such that every Banach space of density not bigger than continuum isomorphically embeds into $ X $ ( called a universal Banach space of density $ \cc $ ) .	It is well known that $ \ell_\infty/c_0 $ is such a space if we assume the continuum hypothesis .	Thus , the problem of the existence of a universal Banach space of density $ \cc $ is undecidable using the usual axioms of set-theory .	We also prove that it is consistent that there are universal Banach spaces of density $ \cc $ , but $ \ell_\infty/c_0 $ is not among them .
1	These sources have a flat radio continuum spectrum between 33 and 94~GHz .	We investigated the archival ground-based VLBI images of the extragalactic radio sources included in both the { \it Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) } and the { \it Planck } catalogues , and selected 49 bright and compact sources as potential targets for space Very Long Baseline Interferometry ( VLBI ) observations at mm wavelengths .	They are identified as core-dominated active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) , located at declinations above $ -40\degr $ , and have never been observed with ground-based VLBI at 86~GHz .	The radio properties of the 49 new sources are presented .	We compare this new sample with similar samples of compact AGN available from earlier studies .
4	Since our general likelihood function is expensive to compute , we derive two approximations with significantly smaller computational cost .	We present a detailed statistical treatment of the energy calibration of hybrid air-shower detectors , which combine a surface detector array and a fluorescence detector , to obtain an unbiased estimate of the calibration curve .	The special features of calibration data from air showers prevent unbiased results , if a standard least-squares fit is applied to the problem .	We develop a general maximum-likelihood approach , based on the detailed statistical model , to solve the problem .	Our approach was developed for the Pierre Auger Observatory , but the applied principles are general and can be transferred to other air-shower experiments , even to the cross-calibration of other observables .
0	Based on 19 high-resolution N-body/gas-dynamical galaxy formation simulations in the LCDM cosmology it is shown , that for a galaxy like the Milky Way , in addition to the baryonic mass of the galaxy itself , about 70 % extra baryonic mass should reside around the galaxy ( inside of the virial radius ) , chiefly in the form of hot gas .	Averaging over the entire field galaxy population , this `` external '' component amounts to 64-85 % of the baryonic mass of the population itself .	These results are supported by the recent detection of very extended , soft X-ray emission from the halo of the quiescent , massive disk galaxy NGC 5746 .	Some of the hot gas may , by thermal instability , have condensed into mainly pressure supported , warm clouds , similar to the Galactic High Velocity Clouds ( HVCs ) .	Based on an ultra-high resolution cosmological test simulation of a Milky Way like galaxy ( with a gas particle mass and gravity softening length of only 7600 h^-1 Msun and 83 h^-1 pc , respectively ) , it is argued , that the hot gas phase dominates over the warm gas phase , in the halo .
2	From the RR Lyraes , we measure a distance modulus of ( m-M ) _0 = 24.51 +/- 0.12 , or 0.80 +/- 0.04 Mpc .	We present the results of a search for short-period variable stars in Leo A .	We have found 92 candidate variables , including eight candidate RR Lyrae stars .	This discovery of RR Lyraes confirms , for the first time , the presence of an ancient ( & gt ; ~11 Gyr ) population in Leo A accounting for at least 0.1 % of the galaxy 's V luminosity .	We have also discovered a halo of old ( & gt ; ~2 Gyr ) stars surrounding Leo A , with a scale length roughly 50 % larger than that of the dominant young population .
0	The claim that an overdense ( positive curvature ) region in the early universe can not extend beyond some maximum scale and remain part of our universe , first made 40 years ago , has recently been questioned by Kopp et al .	Their analysis is elucidating and demonstrates that one can not constrain the form of primordial density perturbations using this argument .	However , the notion of a separate-universe scale still applies and it places an important upper limit on the mass of primordial black holes forming at any epoch .	We calculate this scale for equations of state of the form $ p = k \rho c^2 $ with $ -1 & lt ; k & lt ; \infty $ , refining earlier calculations on account of the Kopp et al.criticisms .	For $ -1/3 & lt ; k & lt ; \infty $ , the scale is always of order the cosmological particle horizon size , with a numerical factor depending on $ k $ .
2	First I discuss the extraction of CKM matrix elements from measurements of form factors for semi-leptonic decays of heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons such as $ D \to Ke\nu $ .	I give a brief introduction to the scope of lattice QCD calculations in our effort to extract the fundamental parameters of the standard model .	This goal is illustrated by two examples .	Second , I present the status of results for the kaon $ B $ parameter relevant to CP violation .	I conclude the talk with a short outline of our experiences with optimizing QCD codes on the CM5 .
4	We also assume multi-packet reception ( MPR ) capability and sensing errors under a Rayleigh fading channel .	In this paper , we consider a cognitive radio ( CR ) system where the secondary user ( SU ) harvests energy from both the nature resources and the primary user ( PU ) radio frequency ( RF ) signal .	We propose an energy-based probabilistic access scheme in which SU probabilistically accesses and senses the primary channel .	The decision is based on the available energy and the PU 's activity .	We investigate the problem of maximizing the SU 's success rate provided that the PU average quality of service ( QoS ) constraint is satisfied .
3	The simulation reaches inflow equilibrium with an accretion rate ~220L_edd/c^2 and forms a radiation driven outflow along the rotation axis .	We study super-Eddington accretion flows onto black holes using a global three dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamical simulation .	We solve the time dependent radiative transfer equation for the specific intensities to accurately calculate the angular distribution of the emitted radiation .	Turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability provides self-consistent angular momentum transfer .	The mechanical energy flux carried by the outflow is ~20 % of the radiative energy flux .
1	We address the problem of a single electron in vertically coupled GaAs quantum rings .	Electron relaxation , induced by acoustic phonons , is studied for coupled quantum rings in the presence of external fields , both electric and magnetic .	Electron-phonon interaction is accounted for both deformation potential and piezoelectric field coupling mechanisms .	Depending on the external fields , the ring radii and the separation between the rings , we show that the two different couplings have different weights and importance .	Significant oscillations are found in the scattering rates from electron excited states to the ground state , as a function of either the geometry of the system or the external fields .
4	E { \bf 66 } , 046701 ( 2002 ) ] .	We introduce a novel multi-discontinuity algorithm for efficient global update of world-line configurations in Monte Carlo simulations of interacting quantum systems .	This new algorithm is a generalization of the two-discontinuity algorithms introduced in Refs .	[ N. Prokof'ev , B. Svistunov , and I. Tupitsyn , Phys.Lett .	A { \bf 238 } , 253 ( 1998 ) ] and [ O. Sylju { \aa } sen and A. Sandvik , Phys.Rev .
0	We propose to use deep convolutional neural networks to address the problem of cross-view image geolocalization , in which the geolocation of a ground-level query image is estimated by matching to georeferenced aerial images .	We use state-of-the-art feature representations for ground-level images and introduce a cross-view training approach for learning a joint semantic feature representation for aerial images .	We also propose a network architecture that fuses features extracted from aerial images at multiple spatial scales .	To support training these networks , we introduce a massive database that contains pairs of aerial and ground-level images from across the United States .	Our methods significantly out-perform the state of the art on two benchmark datasets .
2	This entanglement is of critical importance in these systems , since without it superconductivity would be extremely weak , if not completely negligible .	A Green functions approach is used to study superconductivity in nanofilms and nanowires .	We show that the superconducting condensate results from the multimodal entanglement , or internal Josephson coupling , of the subcondensates associated with the manifold of Fermi surface subparts resulting from size-quantisation .	Further , the multimodal character of the condensate generally results in multigap superconductivity , with great quantitative consequence for the value of the critical parameters .	Our approach suggests that these are universal characteristics of confined superconductors .
3	Given this assumption , we advocate using a variant of first-order linear regularization to invert multi-frequency microlensing lightcurves to obtain the disk surface brightness as a function of radius and frequency .	We show how analysis of a quasar high-magnification microlensing event may be used to construct a map of the frequency-dependent surface brightness of the quasar accretion disk .	The same procedure also allows determination of the disk inclination angle , the black hole mass ( modulo the caustic velocity ) , and possibly the black hole spin .	This method depends on the validity of one assumption : that the optical and ultraviolet continuum of the quasar is produced on the surface of an azimuthally symmetric , flat equatorial disk , whose gas follows prograde circular orbits in a Kerr spacetime ( and plunges inside the marginally stable orbit ) .	The other parameters can be found by minimizing chi-square in a fashion consistent with the regularized solution for the surface brightness .
3	The simulations investigate three different planetary masses and two disk temperatures to bracket the tidal ( thermal ) and viscous gap opening conditions .	The processes of planet formation and migration depend intimately on the interaction between planetesimals and the gaseous disks in which they form .	The formation of gaps in the disk can severely limit the mass of the planet and its migration toward the protostar .	We investigate the process of gap formation through magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which internal stress arises self-consistently from turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability .	The results are in general qualitative agreement with previous simulations of gap formation , but show significant differences .
3	Radiances over the quiet Sun are also considered , with comparisons with previous measurements .	A preliminary assessment of the in-flight radiometric calibration of the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer ( EIS ) is presented .	This is done with the line ratio technique applied to a wide range of observations of the quiet Sun , active regions and flares from 2006 until 2012 .	The best diagnostic lines and the relevant atomic data are discussed in detail .	Some departures in the shapes of the ground calibration responsivities are found at the start of the mission .
0	Given a network represented by a weighted directed graph G , we consider the problem of finding a bounded cost set of nodes S such that the influence spreading from S in G , within a given time bound , is as large as possible .	The dynamic that governs the spread of influence is the following : initially only elements in S are influenced ; subsequently at each round , the set of influenced elements is augmented by all nodes in the network that have a sufficiently large number of already influenced neighbors .	We prove that the problem is NP-hard , even in simple networks like complete graphs and trees .	We also derive a series of positive results .	We present exact pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for general trees , that become polynomial time in case the trees are unweighted .
1	Since there is currently no agreed-upon standard way to specify such models it is not always easy to use published models .	Agent-based modeling and simulation is a useful method to study biological phenomena in a wide range of fields , from molecular biology to ecology .	Also , since model descriptions are not usually given in mathematical terms , it is difficult to bring mathematical analysis tools to bear , so that models are typically studied through simulation .	In order to address this issue , Grimm et al .	proposed a protocol for model specification , the so-called ODD protocol , which provides a standard way to describe models .
1	Most recently it was shown that the Immirzi parameter together with the non-minimal coupling constant of Dirac spinors provides the measure for parity violating spin-spin interaction terms in the effective field theory .	There has been considerable recent interest in the Immirzi parameter as a measure of parity violating effects in the classical theory of gravitation with fermion coupling .	For complex values of the Immirzi parameter , the resulting effective field theory yields complex values for the torsion , and a non-unitary effective field theory that blows up for the special cases $ \gamma=\pm i $ where the gravitational kinetic term is the Ashtekar action .	We show that by restricting ourselves to real values for the torsion , there is a natural set of choice for the non-minimal coupling constant that yields real and unitary effective field theory that does not blow up for the special cases $ \gamma=\pm i $ .	We then show that these particular values for the non-minimal coupling coefficients most naturally follow from a non-minimal pseudo-kinetic term in the fermion Lagrangian .
0	SETI researchers believe that the basic principles of our science and the science of extraterrestrial beings should be fundamentally the same , and we should be able to communicate with them by referring to those things we share , such as the principles of mathematics , physics , and chemistry ( a similar cognitive map of nature ) .	This view assumes that there is only one way to conceptualize the laws of nature .	Consequently , mathematics and the language of nature should be universal .	In this essay , we discuss the epistemological bases of the last assumptions .	We describe all the hypotheses behind the universality of the laws of nature and the restrictions that any technology should have to establish contact with other galactic technological civilization .
1	This method is based on the Ramsauer approach , a model known in atomic an nuclear physics .	We present a new method to study light scattering on non-absorbing spherical particles .	Its main advantage is its intuitive understanding of the underlying physics phenomena .	We show that although the approximations are numerous , the Ramsauer analytical solutions describe fairly well the scattering phase function and the total cross section .	Then this model is applied to the Henyey-Greenstein parameterisation of scattering phase function to give a relation between its asymmetry parameter and the mean particle size .
1	The mass term in axial anomaly equation affects both the fluctuation ( generation ) and dissipation of axial charge .	We studied effect of finite quark mass on the dynamics of axial charge using the D3/D7 model in holography .	We studied the dependence of the effect on quark mass and external magnetic field .	For axial charge generation , we calculated the mass diffusion rate , which characterizes the helicity flipping rate .	The rate is a non-monotonous function of mass and can be significantly enhanced by the magnetic field .
1	The phase of the induced i d_ { xy } component is determined by impurity spin and averages to zero at high temperatures .	It is shown that the patches of complex d_ { xy } component are generated around magnetic impurity in the presence of the coupling between orbital moment of the condensate and impurity spin S. Locally induced d_ { xy } gap leads to the fully gapped quasiparticle spectrum near impurity .	It is suggested that at low temperature the well defined patches of d_ { xy } are formed and they can undergo a phase transition into phase locked state via Josephson effect .	Violation of time-reversal symmetry and parity occurs spontaneously via the second order transition .	In the ordered phase both impurity magnetization and d_ { xy } component of the order parameter develop and are proportional to each other .
4	Finally the class group of the ring attached to a stack polyomino and its canonical class is computed , and a classification of the Gorenstein stack polyominoes is given .	In this paper we study ideals generated by quite general sets of 2-minors of an $ m \times n $ -matrix of indeterminates .	The sets of 2-minors are defined by collections of cells and include 2-sided ladders .	For convex collections of cells it is shown that the attached ideal of 2-minors is a Cohen -- Macaulay prime ideal .	Primality is also shown for collections of cells whose connected components are row or column convex .
4	We assume the coefficients are bounded and elliptic .	This paper deals with two separate but related results .	First we consider weak solutions to a parabolic operator with H\ '' ormander vector fields .	Adapting the iteration scheme of J\ '' urgen Moser for elliptic and parabolic equations in $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ we show a parabolic Harnack inequality .	Then , after proving the Harnack inequality for weak solutions to equations of the form $ u_t = \sum X_i ( a_ { ij } X_j u ) $ we use this to show H\ '' older continuity .
1	Below 200 K a shoulder in the reflectance appears and signals the onset of scattering at 400 cm^-1 .	The a-axis optical properties of a detwinned single crystal of YBa_2Cu_3O_6.50 in the ortho II phase ( Ortho II Y123 , T_c= 59 K ) were determined from reflectance data over a wide frequency range ( 70 - 42 000 cm^-1 ) for nine temperature values between 28 and 295 K. Above 200 K the spectra are dominated by a broad background of scattering that extends to 1 eV .	In this temperature range we also observe a peak in the optical conductivity at 177 cm^-1 .	Below 59 K , the superconducting transition temperature , the spectra change dramatically with the appearance of the superconducting condensate .	Its spectral weight is consistent , to within experimental error , with the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham ( FGT ) sum rule .
0	We performed a search for the HeH+ J=1-0 line ( \nu_ { rest } = 2010.183873 GHz ) and simultaneously for the CH ^2\Pi_ { 3/2 } ( F_2 ) J=3/2 - ^2\Pi_ { 1/2 } ( F_2 ) J=1/2 lines ( \nu_ { rest } \approx 2006.8 and 2010.8 GHz ) toward one of the highest-redshift quasars known , SDSS J114816.64+525150.3 ( z= 6.4189 ) .	No clearly visible line was detected after obtaining an rms noise level of ~ 0.4 mK ( ~ 3 mJy ) in 16 MHz ( 18 km s^ { -1 } ) channels .	At a level of 2.9sigma , however , there is a tentative emission feature shifted by about 100 km s^ { -1 } from the expected frequency of the HeH+ line .	This shift is well within the width of the line profiles for CO and C+ .	The putative feature is about four times narrower than the previously detected CO and C+ lines .
4	The high-energy LDOS of the surface states is also found to show the multi-periodic Friedel oscillations , caused by competing characteristic scattering processes .	We study theoretically by a quantum-mechanical approach the general scattering problem of a straight step defect on the surface of topological insulator $ \mathrm { Bi } _ { 2 } \mathrm { Te } _ { 3 } $ with strong warping effect .	At high energy where the warping effect is large , an incident electron on a step defect running along $ \Gamma-\mathrm { M } $ direction may exhibit perfect transmission whereas on a defect running along $ \Gamma-\mathrm { K } $ direction has a finite probability to be reflected and may even exhibit resonant total reflection .	Transmission properties in the latter case are also very sensitive to whether there is particle-hole symmetry .	The predicted Friedel oscillations and the power-law decaying behavior of the local density of states ( LDOS ) near the defect are in good agreement with recent scanning tunneling microscope experiments on $ \mathrm { Bi } _ { 2 } \mathrm { Te } _ { 3 } $ .
2	Stochastic evaporative and condensative fluxes determine the width of the fixed-point size distribution .	The coarsening instability typically disrupts steady-state cluster-size distributions .	We show that degradation coupled to the cluster size , such as arising from biological proteolysis , leads to a novel fixed-point cluster size .	At the fixed-point , we show how the peak size and width depend on number , interactions , and proteolytic rate .	This proteolytic size-control mechanism is consistent with the phenomenology of pseudo-pilus length control in the general secretion pathway of bacteria .
2	For example , a country 's population is often distributed in such a heavy-tailed manner , with a minority of people ( e.g. , 20 percent ) in the countryside and the vast majority ( e.g. , 80 percent ) in urban areas .	This paper introduces a new classification scheme - head/tail breaks - in order to find groupings or hierarchy for data with a heavy-tailed distribution .	The heavy-tailed distributions are heavily right skewed , with a minority of large values in the head and a majority of small values in the tail , commonly characterized by a power law , a lognormal or an exponential function .	This heavy-tailed distribution is also called scaling , hierarchy or scaling hierarchy .	This new classification scheme partitions all of the data values around the mean into two parts and continues the process iteratively for the values ( above the mean ) in the head until the head part values are no longer heavy-tailed distributed .
0	The filled skutterudite compound SmRu_4P_ { 12 } undergoes a complex evolution from a paramagnetic metal ( phase I ) to a probable multipolar ordering insulator ( phase II ) at T_ { MI } = 16.5 K , then to a magnetically ordered phase ( phase III ) at T_ { N } = 14 K. Elastic properties under hydrostatic pressures were investigated to study the nature of the ordering phases .	We found that distinct elastic softening above T_ { MI } is induced by pressure , giving evidence of quadrupole degeneracy of the ground state in the crystalline electric field .	It also suggests that quadrupole moment may be one of the order parameters below T_ { MI } under pressure .	Strangely , the largest degree of softening is found in the transverse elastic constant C_ { T } at around 0.5-0.6 GPa , presumably having relevancy to the competing and very different Gruneisen parameters \Omega of T_ { MI } and T_ { N } .	Interplay between the two phase transitions is also verified by the rapid increase of T_ { MI } under pressure with a considerably large \Omega of 9 .
3	We construct a low_2 degree bounding the Erd\H { o } s-Moser theorem ( EM ) , thereby showing that previous argument does not hold for EM .	A Turing degree d bounds a principle P of reverse mathematics if every computable instance of P has a d-computable solution .	P admits a universal instance if there exists a computable instance such that every solution bounds P. We prove that the stable version of the ascending descending sequence principle ( SADS ) as well as the stable version of the thin set theorem for pairs ( STS ( 2 ) ) do not admit a bound of low_2 degree .	Therefore no principle between Ramsey 's theorem for pairs RT22 and SADS or STS ( 2 ) admit a universal instance .	Finally , we prove that the only Delta^0_2 degree bounding a stable version of the rainbow Ramsey theorem for pairs ( SRRT22 ) is 0 ' .
3	All signatures contain missing transverse energy in the final state and all , except for one , have at least one photon in the final state .	In this note we present the results of several searches for physics beyond the standard model .	All final states use 2 inverse fb\of data produced at Tevatron in p-pbar collisions at 1.96 TeV and collected by the CDF Run II detector .	None of the analysis is heavily optimized for any specific model .	Unfortunately , no interesting excesses of events over the SM prediction are observed in any final states , except may be for the last one .
4	The present work promises stringent observational constraints on chemical mixing in the course of massive star evolution .	Accurate atomic data have become available in the recent past due to the demands of astrophysics and fusion research .	We report on the impact of such data on non-LTE line-formation calculations for CNO in early-type stars .	Considerable improvement is achieved by the derivation of consistent results from practically all available spectroscopic indicators , regardless of ionization stage or spin system , and the uncertainties in the analyses are drastically reduced .	Moreover , systematic trends are revealed , e.g.an increase of the NI abundances from previous studies of BA-type supergiants by a factor of two is indicated .
3	We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study the environment of quasars and compare it directly with the environment of galaxies .	Where do quasars reside ?	Are quasars located in environments similar to those of typical L* galaxies , and , if not , how do they differ ?	An answer to this question will help shed light on the triggering process of quasar activity .	We find that quasars ( M_i & lt ; -22 , z & lt ; 0.4 ) are located in higher local overdensity regions than are typical L* galaxies .
3	An extension to smooth Jordan domains is given .	Let $ u\in W^ { 2 , p } _0 $ , $ 1\le p\le \infty $ be a solution of the Poisson equation $ \Delta u = h $ , $ h\in L^p $ , in the unit disk .	It is proved that $ \|\nabla u\|_ { L^p } \le a_p\|h\|_ { L^p } $ with sharp constant $ a_p $ for $ p=1 $ and $ p=\infty $ and that $ \|\partial u\|_ { L^p } \le b_p\|h\|_ { L^p } $ with sharp constant $ b_p $ for $ p=1 $ , $ p=2 $ and $ p=\infty $ .	In addition is proved that for $ p & gt ; 2 $ $ ||\partial u||_ { L^\infty } \le c_p\Vert h\Vert_ { L^p } $ , and $ ||\nabla u||_ { L^\infty } \le C_p\Vert h\Vert_ { L^p } , $ with sharp constants $ c_p $ and $ C_p $ .	These problems are equivalent to determining the precise value of $ L^p $ norm of { \it Cauchy transform of Dirichlet 's problem } .
0	The paper analyzes a Lagrangian system which is controlled by directly assigning some of the coordinates as functions of time , by means of frictionless constraints .	In a natural system of coordinates , the equations of motions contain terms which are linear or quadratic w.r.t.time derivatives of the control functions .	After reviewing the basic equations , we explain the significance of the quadratic terms , related to geodesics orthogonal to a given foliation .	We then study the problem of stabilization of the system to a given point , by means of oscillating controls .	This problem is first reduced to the weak stability for a related convex-valued differential inclusion , then studied by Lyapunov functions methods .
3	This improves earlier results which only discovered SL_2-tilings with infinitely many entries equal to 1 .	An SL_2-tiling is a bi-infinite matrix of positive integers such that each adjacent 2 by 2 submatrix has determinant 1 .	Such tilings are infinite analogues of Conway-Coxeter friezes , and they have strong links to cluster algebras , combinatorics , mathematical physics , and representation theory .	We show that , by means of so-called Conway-Coxeter counting , every SL_2-tiling arises from a triangulation of the disc with two , three or four accumulation points .	Indeed , our methods show that there are large classes of tilings with only finitely many entries equal to 1 , including a class of tilings with no 1 's at all .
1	In a TCS system , instead of using a random sensing matrix and a predefined dictionary , the average-case performance can be further improved by employing an optimized multidimensional sensing matrix and a learned multilinear sparsifying dictionary .	Tensor Compressive Sensing ( TCS ) is a multidimensional framework of Compressive Sensing ( CS ) , and it is advantageous in terms of reducing the amount of storage , easing hardware implementations and preserving multidimensional structures of signals in comparison to a conventional CS system .	In this paper , we propose a joint optimization approach of the sensing matrix and dictionary for a TCS system .	For the sensing matrix design in TCS , an extended separable approach with a closed form solution and a novel iterative non-separable method are proposed when the multilinear dictionary is fixed .	In addition , a multidimensional dictionary learning method that takes advantages of the multidimensional structure is derived , and the influence of sensing matrices is taken into account in the learning process .
3	The final formulas are quite simple .	We present a very quick and powerful method for the calculation of heat-kernel coefficients .	It makes use of rather common ideas , as integral representations of the spectral sum , Mellin transforms , non-trivial commutation of series and integrals and skilful analytic continuation of zeta functions on the complex plane .	We apply our method to the case of the heat-kernel expansion of the Laplace operator on a $ D $ -dimensional ball with either Dirichlet , Neumann or , in general , Robin boundary conditions .	Using this case as an example , we illustrate in detail our scheme -- -which serves for the calculation of an ( in principle ) arbitrary number of heat-kernel coefficients in any situation when the basis functions are known .
4	In past research that has been done in the field of quantum circuits design , only one cost metrics ( usually quantum cost ) has been investigated .	Quantum computing is a new way of data processing based on the concept of quantum mechanics .	Quantum circuit design is a process of converting a quantum gate to a series of basic gates and is divided into two general categories based on the decomposition and composition .	In the second group , using evolutionary algorithms and especially genetic algorithms , multiplication of matrix gates was used to achieve the final characteristic of quantum circuit .	Genetic programming is a subfield of evolutionary computing in which computer programs evolve to solve studied problems .
2	% The $ \Xi^- N $ , $ \Xi^- p $ and $ \Xi^- n $ elastic cross sections are The $ \Xi^- N $ elastic cross sections are derived from the $ ^9 $ Be $ ( K^- , K^+ ) $ data of the BNL-E906 experiment , which is useful to determine the hard-core radii in $ P $ -states .	$ \Xi^- $ escaping and scattering probabilities in the $ ( K^- , K^+ ) $ reaction with nuclear targets is investigated on the basis of the eikonal approximation .	Calculations are performed using the $ S=-2 $ sector of the Nijmegen model-D interaction , whose hard core radii are treated phenomenologically .	The $ \Xi $ single-particle potential energy is investigated with the G-matrix calculation in nuclear matter , which is sensitive to the hard-core radii in $ S $ -states .	The important constraint for the $ \Xi N $ interaction is obtained by combining the two analyses .
2	However , differences in material and device technology result in significant processing challenges .	Single electron charging effects in a surface-gated InSb/AlInSb QW structure are reported .	This material , due to its large g-factor and light effective mass , offers considerable advantages over more commonly used materials , such as GaAs , for quantum information processing devices .	Simple Coulomb blockade and quantised confinement models are considered to explain the observation of conductance oscillations in these structures .	The charging energy is found to be comparable with the energy spectrum for single particle states .
3	In particular , we show how the Verlinde formula for the dimensions $ D_ { \vec { \lambda } } ( \mathbf { \Sigma } _ { g , n } ) = \dim \mathcal { V } _ { \vec { \lambda } } ( \mathbf { \Sigma } _ { g , n } ) $ is retrieved from the topological recursion .	Given a topological modular functor $ \mathcal { V } $ in the sense of Walker \cite { Walker } , we construct vector bundles over $ \bar { \mathcal { M } } _ { g , n } $ , whose Chern classes define semi-simple cohomological field theories .	This construction depends on a determination of the logarithm of the eigenvalues of the Dehn twist and central element actions .	We show that the intersection of the Chern class with the $ \psi $ -classes in $ \bar { \mathcal { M } } _ { g , n } $ is computed by the topological recursion of \cite { EOFg } , for a local spectral curve that we describe .	We analyze the consequences of our result on two examples : modular functors associated to a finite group $ G $ ( for which $ D_ { \vec { \lambda } } ( \mathbf { \Sigma } _ { g , n } ) $ enumerates certain $ G $ -principle bundles over a genus $ g $ surface with $ n $ boundary conditions specified by $ \vec { \lambda } $ ) , and the modular functor obtained from Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory associated to a simple , simply-connected Lie group $ G $ ( for which $ \mathcal { V } _ { \vec { \lambda } } ( \mathbf { \Sigma } _ { g , n } ) $ is the Verlinde bundle ) .
0	The results of three-dimensional numerical simulations of the flow of matter in non-magnetic semidetached binary systems are presented .	Self-consistent solutions indicate the absence of a shock interaction between the stream of matter flowing from the inner Lagrange point and the accretion disk ( a `` hot spot '' ) .	At the same time , the interaction between the stream and the common envelope of the system forms an extended shock wave along the edge of the stream , whose observational properties are roughly equivalent to those of a hot spot in the disk .	Comparison of synethesized and observed light curves confirm the adequacy of the proposed model for the flow of matter without formation of a hot spot .	The model makes it possible for the first time to reproduce the variety of the observed light curves of cataclysmic variables in the framework of a single model , without invoking additional assumptions .
2	Even if suggested formalism is , generally speaking , phenomenological and rough , obtained final results , unexpectedly , are non-trivial .	In this work we suggest a very simple , approximate formalism for description of some basic ( especially thermodynamical ) characteristics of a rotating , very thin black ring .	( In fact , our formalism is not theoretically dubious , since , at it is not hard to see , it can correspond to an extreme simplification of a more accurate , Copeland-Lahiri string formalism for the black hole description . )	Concretely , given formalism reproduces exactly Bekenstein-Hawking entropy , Bekenstein quantization of the entropy or horizon area and Hawking temperature of a rotating , very thin black ring obtained earlier using more accurate analysis by Reall , Emparan , Elvang , Virmani etc .	( Conceptually it is similar to situation in Bohr 's atomic model where energy levels are determined practically exactly even if electron motion is described roughly . )
1	By geometric invariant theory , we will construct a smooth coarse moduli space $ M_n^ { \balpha } ( \bt , \blambda , L ) $ of stable parabolic connection on $ \BP^1 $ with logarithmic poles at $ D ( \bt ) = t_1 + ... + t_n $ as well as its natural compactification .	In this paper , we will give a complete geometric background for the geometry of Painlev\'e $ VI $ and Garnier equations .	Moreover the moduli space $ \cR ( \cP_ { n , \bt } ) _ { \ba } $ of Jordan equivalence classes of $ SL_2 ( \C ) $ -representations of the fundamental group $ \pi_1 ( \BP^1 \setminus D ( \bt ) , \ast ) $ are defined as the categorical quotient .	We define the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence $ \RH : M_n^ { \balpha } ( \bt , \blambda , L ) \lra \cR ( \cP_ { n , \bt } ) _ { \ba } $ and prove that $ \RH $ is a bimeromorphic proper surjective analytic map .	Painlev\'e and Garnier equations can be derived from the isomonodromic flows and Painlev\'e property of these equations are easily derived from the properties of $ \RH $ .
1	It is based on the ground-state Lorentz force density acting on the charge and current densities attributed to the polarization and magnetization in linearly , locally , and causally responding media .	A unified approach to the calculation of dispersive forces on ground-state bodies and atoms is given .	The theory is applied to dielectric macro- and micro-objects , including single atoms .	Existing formulas valid for weakly polarizable matter are generalized to allow also for strongly polarizable matter .	In particular when micro-objects can be regarded as single atoms , well-known formulas for the Casimir-Polder force on atoms and the van der Waals interaction between atoms are recovered .
3	The formula consists of a `` dynamic '' and `` geometric '' term .	Suppose that the initial triangle formed by the three moving masses of the three-body problem is similar to the triangle formed at some later time .	We derive a simple integral formula for the overall rotation relating the two triangles .	The formula is based on the fact that the space of similarity classes of triangles forms a two-sphere which we call the shape sphere .	The geometric term is the integral of a universal two-form on a `` reduced configuration space '' .
1	These precise calculations are accurate to leading and next-to-leading order in the plasma coupling parameter , and to all orders for two-body quantum scattering within the plasma .	Brown , Preston , and Singleton ( BPS ) produced an analytic calculation for energy exchange processes for a weakly to moderately coupled plasma : the electron-ion temperature equilibration rate and the charged particle stopping power .	Classical molecular dynamics can provide another approach that can be rigorously implemented .	It is therefore useful to compare the predictions from these two methods , particularly since the former is theoretically based and the latter numerically .	An agreement would provide both confidence in our theoretical machinery and in the reliability of the computer simulations .
2	This additional knowledge , the side information , is integrated into CS via L1-L1 and L1-L2 minimization .	We address the problem of Compressed Sensing ( CS ) with side information .	Namely , when reconstructing a target CS signal , we assume access to a similar signal .	We then provide lower bounds on the number of measurements that these problems require for successful reconstruction of the target signal .	If the side information has good quality , the number of measurements is significantly reduced via L1-L1 minimization , but not so much via L1-L2 minimization .
1	Little is known , however , about their effect on potassium channels .	Theoretical and experimental evidences support the hypothesis that extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields can affect voltage-gated channels .	Kv1.3 , a member of the voltage-gated potassium channels family originally discovered in the brain , is a key player in important biological processes including antigen-dependent activation of T-cells during the immune response .	We report that Kv1.3 expressed in CHO-K1 cells can be modulated in cell subpopulations by extremely low frequency and relatively low intensity electromagnetic fields .	In particular , we observed that field exposure can cause an enhancement of Kv1.3 potassium conductance and that the effect lasts for several minutes after field removal .
3	( 2007 ) calculated the fraction of time spent by Mrk 421 in flaring states with fluxes above 1 Crab at TeV energies ( i.e. , TeV - duty cycle ) .	The blazar Markarian 421 ( Mrk 421 ) is one of the brightest sources in the extragalactic X-ray/TeV sky .	It is also one of the fastest varying TeV $ \gamma $ -ray sources , showing flaring activity on time scales as short as tens of minutes .	To know the level of activity of this source , Tluczykont et al .	Here we present an alternative approach to calculate the TeV duty cycle of Mrk 421 taking advantage of the continuous monitoring of the source by the Milagro observatory .
1	We call it the intermediate disorder regime .	We introduce a new disorder regime for directed polymers in dimension $ 1+1 $ that sits between the weak and strong disorder regimes .	It is accessed by scaling the inverse temperature parameter $ \beta $ to zero as the polymer length $ n $ tends to infinity .	The natural choice of scaling is $ \beta_n : =\beta n^ { -1/4 } $ .	We show that the polymer measure under this scaling has previously unseen behavior .
1	The total energy of the starburst is provided by young central stellar clusters and parts of the galactic interstellar medium are pushed out as part of the galactic wind ( in some cases the galactic wind contains an important part of the metals produced in the new generation of stars ) .	We present results from models of galactic winds driven by energy injected by nuclear starbursts .	We have performed adiabatic and radiative 3D N-Body/Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of galactic winds using the GADGET-2 code .	The numerical models cover a wide range of starburst ( from $ \sim10^2 $ to $ \sim10^7 $ M $ _\odot $ ) and galactic gas masses ( from $ \sim6\times10^6 $ to $ \sim10^ { 11 } $ M $ _\odot $ ) .	The concentrated central starburst regions are an efficient engine for producing of the mass and metal loss in galaxies , and also for driving the metal redistribution in the galaxies .
2	We relate the replica-symmetry breaking to ergodicity breaking and use the concept of real replicas to restore thermodynamic homogeneity of the equilibrium free energy in a replicated phase space .	We discuss the mean-field theory of spin-glass models with frustrated long-range random spin exchange .	We analyze the reasons for breakdown of the simple mean-field theory of Sherrington and Kirkpatrick .	Embedded replications of the spin variables result in a set of hierarchical free energies and overlap susceptibilities between replica hierarchies as order parameters .	The limit to infinite number of replica hierarchies leads to the Parisi solution with a continuous replica-symmetry breaking .
3	The non-uniform longitudinal distribution of these reveals four longitudinal zones at the surface of the sun from which sunspots erupt preferentially over the 5-year observing interval ( 2006 January to 2011 April ) .	We use time-series ultraviolet full sun images to construct limb-synoptic maps of the Sun .	On these maps , large-scale , long-lived coronal streamers appear as repetitive sinusoid-like arcs projected over the polar regions .	They are caused by high altitude plasma produced from sunspot-rich regions at latitudes generally far from the poles .	Spots in these zones ( or `` clusters '' ) have individual lifetimes short compared to the lifetimes of the coronal features which they sustain , and erupt at different times .
2	We find that trapezium-like systems are frequently formed in the first 2 Myr in initially cool and clumpy clusters and can survive for significant amounts of time in such clusters .	We investigate the formation and evolution of high-order massive star multiples similar to the Trapezium in the Orion Nebula Cluster .	We perform ensembles of N-body simulations of the evolution of N=1000 Orion-like clusters with initial conditions ranging from cool and clumpy to relatively smooth and relaxed .	We also find that these systems are highly dynamical entities , constantly interacting with the surrounding cluster , changing their appearance and membership regularly .	The eventual decay of trapezium-like systems can even destroy the host cluster .
1	The host star is an F star with $ T_ { \rm eff } =6206\pm75 $ K , $ \log g=4.108\pm0.014 $ , $ \left [ { \rm Fe } / { \rm H } \right ] =-0.116_ { -0.069 } ^ { +0.065 } $ , $ { \rm M_* } =1.201_ { -0.061 } ^ { +0.067 } \ { \rm M } _ { \odot } $ , and $ { \rm R_* } =1.610_ { -0.068 } ^ { +0.078 } \ { \rm R } _ { \odot } $ .	We report the discovery of KELT-4Ab , an inflated , transiting Hot Jupiter orbiting the brightest component of a hierarchical triple stellar system .	The best-fit linear ephemeris is $ \rm { BJD_ { TDB } } = 2456193.29157 \pm 0.00021 + E\left ( 2.9895936 \pm 0.0000048\right ) $ .	With a magnitude of $ V\sim10 $ , a planetary radius of $ 1.699_ { -0.045 } ^ { +0.046 } \ { \rm R_J } $ , and a mass of $ 0.902_ { -0.059 } ^ { +0.060 } \ { \rm M_J } $ , it is the brightest host among the population of inflated Hot Jupiters ( $ R_P & gt ; 1.5R_J $ ) , making it a valuable discovery for probing the nature of inflated planets .	In addition , its existence within a hierarchical triple and its proximity to Earth ( $ 210 $ pc ) provides a unique opportunity for dynamical studies with continued monitoring with high resolution imaging and precision radial velocities .
0	We study macroscopic matters in the recently developed Lorentz gauge theory of gravity and , based on the exact source field that is already derived , introduce a classically valid source field which makes further macroscopic studies practically doable .	By studying a static matter distribution in the linear order of the perturbation theory , the approximate formulation of the source field is found and its non-linear form is justified .	Next the general nonlinear source field is introduced and is utilized to study an incompressible spherical star .	It is shown that although the interior Schwarzschild space-time is an exact solution , it ca n't be physically understood within the framework of this theory .	Finally , we present a numerical solution for the interior of a star and analytically show that , to the first order of perturbation , it is consistent with the interior Schwarzschild space-time .
4	The residual resistivity is extremely pressure sensitive and passes through a maximum and then a minimum in the vicinity of p_c .	The influence of pressure on the magnetically ordered CePd_ { 2.02 } Ge_ { 1.98 } has been investigated by a combined measurement of electrical resistivity , $ \rho ( T ) $ , and ac-calorimetry , C ( T ) , for temperatures in the range 0.3 K & lt ; T & lt ; 10 K and pressures , p , up to 22 GPa .	Simultaneously CePd_2Ge_2 has been examined by $ \rho ( T ) $ down to 40 mK .	In CePd_ { 2.02 } Ge_ { 1.98 } and CePd_2Ge_2 the magnetic order is suppressed at a critical pressure p_c=11.0 GPa and p_c=13.8 GPa , respectively .	In the case of CePd_ { 2.02 } Ge_ { 1.98 } not only the temperature coefficient of $ \rho ( T ) $ , A , indicates the loss of magnetic order but also the ac-signal $ 1/V_ { ac } \propto C/T $ recorded at low temperature .
0	I present a new algorithm , CALCLENS , for efficiently computing weak gravitational lensing shear signals from large N-body light cone simulations over a curved sky .	This new algorithm properly accounts for the sky curvature and boundary conditions , is able to produce redshift-dependent shear signals including corrections to the Born approximation by using multiple-plane ray tracing , and properly computes the lensed images of source galaxies in the light cone .	The key feature of this algorithm is a new , computationally efficient Poisson solver for the sphere that combines spherical harmonic transform and multgrid methods .	As a result , large areas of sky ( ~10 , 000 square degrees ) can be ray traced efficiently at high-resolution using only a few hundred cores on widely available machines .	Using this new algorithm and curved-sky calculations that only use a slower but more accurate spherical harmonic transform Poisson solver , I study the shear B-mode and rotation mode power spectra .
0	One-electron self-interaction and an incorrect asymptotic behavior of the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation potential are among the most prominent limitations of many present-day density functionals .	However , a one-electron self-interaction-free energy does not necessarily lead to the correct long-range potential .	This is here shown explicitly for local hybrid functionals .	Furthermore , carefully studying the ratio of the von Weizs\ '' acker kinetic energy density to the ( positive ) Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density , $ \tau_\mathrm { W } /\tau $ , reveals that this ratio , which frequently serves as an iso-orbital indicator and is used to eliminate one-electron self-interaction effects in meta-generalized-gradient approximations and local hybrid functionals , can fail to approach its expected value in the vicinity of orbital nodal planes .	This perspective article suggests that the nature and consequences of one-electron self-interaction and some of the strategies for its correction need to be reconsidered .
1	The analysis in both cases centers around a numerical version of the gap lemma of Gardner -- Zumbrun and Kapitula -- Sandstede , giving uniform error estimates for apparently ill-posed projective boundary-value problems with asymptotically constant coefficients , so long as the rate of convergence of coefficients is greater than the `` badness '' of the boundary projections as measured by negative spectral gap .	We perform error analyses explaining some previously mysterious phenomena arising in numerical computation of the Evans function , in particular ( i ) the advantage of centered coordinates for exterior product and related methods , and ( ii ) the unexpected stability of the ( notoriously unstable ) continuous orthogonalization method of Drury in the context of Evans function applications .	In the second case , we use also the simple but apparently previously unremarked observation that the Drury method is in fact ( neutrally ) stable when used to approximate an unstable subspace , so that continuous orthogonalization and the centered exterior product method are roughly equally well-conditioned as methods for Evans function approximation .	The latter observation makes possible an extremely simple nonlinear boundary-value method for possible use in large-scale systems , extending ideas suggested by Sandstede .	We suggest also a related linear method based on the conjugation lemma of M\'etivier -- Zumbrun , an extension of the gap lemma mentioned above .
3	A third approach , the Bialas Peschanski ( BP ) model , based on the dipole formalism is then described .	We describe the most recent data on the diffractive structure functions from the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations at HERA using four models .	First , a Pomeron Structure Function ( PSF ) model , in which the Pomeron is considered as an object with parton distribution functions .	Then , the Bartels Ellis Kowalski Wusthoff ( BEKW ) approach is discussed , assuming the simplest perturbative description of the Pomeron using a two-gluon ladder .	Finally , we discuss the Golec-Biernat-W\ '' usthoff ( GBW ) saturation model which takes into account saturation effects .
4	We determine the nucleon-nucleon potential in the strong coupling limit , as well as masses m_A of nuclei as a function of their atomic number A .	The strong coupling limit ( beta_gauge = 0 ) of QCD offers a number of remarkable research possibilities , of course at the price of large lattice artifacts .	Here , we determine the complete phase diagram as a function of temperature T and baryon chemical potential mu_B , for one flavor of staggered fermions in the chiral limit , with emphasis on the determination of a tricritical point and on the T ~ 0 transition to nuclear matter .	The latter is known to happen for mu_B substantially below the baryon mass , indicating strong nuclear interactions in QCD at infinite gauge coupling .	This leads us to studying the properties of nuclear matter from first principles .
1	However , DCs are generally not provided with statistical uncertainties , since the standard approach is to perform Monte Carlo bootstrap simulations to evaluate them , which can be quite time consuming for a large sample of sources .	The duty cycle ( DC ) of astrophysical sources is generally defined as the fraction of time during which the sources are active .	As an alternative , considerably less time-consuming approach , we derived the theoretical expectation value for the DC and its error for sources whose state is one of two possible , mutually exclusive states , inactive ( off ) or flaring ( on ) , as based on a finite set of independent observational data points .	Following a Bayesian approach , we derived the analytical expression for the posterior , the conjugated distribution adopted as prior , and the expectation value and variance .	We applied our method to the specific case of the inactivity duty cycle ( IDC ) for supergiant fast X-ray transients .
1	We contrast results from quenched simulations with ones with two flavors of dynamical overlap fermions .	We study the role of diquarks in light baryons through point to point baryon correlators .	The scalar , pseudoscalar and axial vector diquarks are combined with light quarks to form color singlets .	The quenched simulation shows large zero mode effects in correlators containing the scalar and pseudoscalar diquark .	The two scalar diquarks created by gamma_5 and gamma_0gamma_5 lead to different behavior in baryon correlators , showing that the interaction of diquarks with the third light quark matters : we do not see an isolated diquark .
0	We present Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) far-UV and near-UV mosaic observations covering the entirety of M31 and M33 .	For both targets , we measure the decline of surface brightness ( in FUV and NUV ) and changes in FUV -- NUV color as a function of galactocentric radius .	These UV radial profiles are compared to the distribution of ionized gas traced by H-alpha emission .	We find that the extent of the UV emission , in both targets , is greater than the extent of the observed HII regions and diffuse ionized gas .	We determine the ultraviolet diffuse fraction in M33 using our FUV observations and compare it to the H-alpha diffuse fraction obtained from wide-field narrow-band imaging .
4	An electronic version is available from the ASI Science Data Center web site at http : //www.asdc.asi.it/bzcat	We present a new catalogue of blazars based on multi-frequency surveys and on an extensive review of the literature .	Blazars are classified as BL Lacertae objects , as flat spectrum radio quasars or as blazars of uncertain/transitional type .	Each object is identified by a root name , coded as BZB , BZQ and BZU for these three subclasses respectively , and by its coordinates .	This catalogue is being built as a tool useful for the identification of the extragalactic sources that will be detected by present and future experiments for X and gamma-ray astronomy , like Swift , AGILE , Fermi-GLAST and Simbol-X .
1	In the presence of the trapping harmonic-oscillator ( HO ) potential , we report the existence of even , odd , and asymmetric spatial modes .	We consider a binary Bose-Einstein condensate ( BEC ) with nonlinear repulsive interactions and linear spin-orbit ( SO ) and Zeeman-splitting couplings .	They feature alternating domains with opposite directions of the pseudo-spin , i.e. , anti-ferromagnetic structures , which is explained by the interplay of the linear couplings , HO confinement , and repulsive self-interaction .	The number of the domains is determined by the strength of the SO coupling .	The modes are constructed analytically in the weakly nonlinear system .
2	Moreover , the magic squares presented have some interesting properties , such as : they remains the same if we rotate them by 180 degree , or see in the mirror , or see on the other side of the paper , etc .	In this short note we have produced different kind of magic squares using digital letter having only the algorisms : 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 , and 8 .	The interesting fact in considering these five digits is that the day 8th May 2010 also have these ones ( 08.05.2010 ) .	Two palindrome semi-magic squares of order 3x3 are also given .	Still , we have considered other dates having four digits .
0	In this paper we analyze and extend the neural network based associative memory proposed by Gripon and Berrou .	This associative memory resembles the celebrated Willshaw model with an added partite cluster structure .	In the literature , two retrieving schemes have been proposed for the network dynamics , namely sum-of-sum and sum-of-max .	They both offer considerably better performance than Willshaw and Hopfield networks , when comparable retrieval scenarios are considered .	Former discussions and experiments concentrate on the erasure scenario , where a partial message is used as a probe to the network , in the hope of retrieving the full message .
2	The MDF is extremely broad , with the classic red and blue subpopulations heavily overlapped , but a double-Gaussian model can still formally match the MDF closely .	We present new deep photometry of the globular cluster system ( GCS ) around NGC 6166 , the central supergiant galaxy in Abell 2199 .	HST data from the ACS and WFC3 cameras in F475W , F814W are used to determine the spatial distribution of the GCS , its metallicity distribution function ( MDF ) , and the dependence of the MDF on galactocentric radius and on GC luminosity .	The spatial distribution follows a Sersic-like profile detectably to a projected radius of at least $ R_ { gc } = 250 $ kpc .	To that radius , the total number of clusters in the system is N_ { GC } = 39000 +- 2000 , the global specific frequency is S_N = 11.2 +- 0.6 , and 57\ % of the total are blue , metal-poor clusters .
3	This raises the question as to how much data are needed to attain a target pFDR level .	The positive false discovery rate ( pFDR ) is a useful overall measure of errors for multiple hypothesis testing , especially when the underlying goal is to attain one or more discoveries .	Control of pFDR critically depends on how much evidence is available from data to distinguish between false and true nulls .	Oftentimes , as many aspects of the data distributions are unknown , one may not be able to obtain strong enough evidence from the data for pFDR control .	We study the asymptotics of the minimum number of observations per null for the pFDR control associated with multiple Studentized tests and $ F $ tests , especially when the differences between false nulls and true nulls are small .
3	These would be consistent with a triplet d-vector d { k } aligned along the c-axis .	The superconductor Sr_2RuO_4 is widely believed to be a spin triplet system with a chiral order parameter analogous to the A phase of superfluid helium-3 .	The best evidence for this pairing state is that the Knight shift or spin susceptibility measured in neutron scattering is constant below T_c , unlike in a spin-singlet superconductor .	The original Knight shift and neutron scattering measurements were performed for magnetic fields aligned in the ruthenate a-b plane .	However recently the Knight shift for fields along c was also found to be constant below T_c , which is not expected for this symmetry state .
1	Of these , 16 were detected in at least two Planck frequencies .	The all-sky Planck survey in 9 frequency bands was used to search for emission from all 274 known Galactic supernova remnants .	The radio-through-microwave spectral energy distributions were compiled to determine the emission mechanism for microwave emission .	In only one case , IC 443 , is there high-frequency emission clearly from dust associated with the supernova remnant.In all cases , the low-frequency emission is from synchrotron radiation .	A single power law , as predicted for a population of relativistic particles with energy distribution that extends continuously to high energies , is evident for many sources , including the Crab and PKS 1209-51/52 .
4	This behavior is not affected by the mass difference of the two species , but it only depends on the packing fractions .	We discuss the behavior of the extended sound modes of a dense binary hard-sphere mixture .	In a dense simple hard-sphere fluid the Enskog theory predicts a gap in the sound propagation at large wave vectors .	In a binary mixture the gap is only present for low concentrations of one of the two species .	At intermediate concentrations sound modes are always propagating .
4	As an example , we applied this method to the state-of-the-art data and derived descriptive statistical properties of segmented supergranules -- typical size of 20 -- 30 Mm , characteristic lifetime of 18.7 hours , and estimated depth of 15 -- 20 Mm .	Solar supergranulation remains a mystery in spite of decades of intensive studies .	Most of the papers about supergranulation deal with its surface properties .	Local helioseismology provides an opportunity to look below the surface and see the vertical structure of this convective structure .	We present a concept of a ( 3+1 ) -D segmentation algorithm capable of recognising individual supergranules in a sequence of helioseismic 3-D flow maps .
1	The standard flare model predicts both downward and upward outflow plasmas with speeds close to the coronal Alfv\ ' { e } n speed .	Magnetic reconnection is believed to be the dominant energy release mechanism in solar flares .	Yet , spectroscopic observations of such outflows , especially the downflows , are extremely rare .	With observations of the newly launched Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph ( IRIS ) , we report the detection of greatly redshifted ( $ \sim $ 125 km s $ ^ { -1 } $ along line of sight ) Fe { \sc { xxi } } 1354.08\AA { } emission line with a $ \sim $ 100 km s $ ^ { -1 } $ nonthermal width at the reconnection site of a flare .	The redshifted Fe { \sc { xxi } } feature coincides spatially with the loop-top X-Ray source observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager ( RHESSI ) .
4	We address the problem by proposing a simplified version of the model that allows analytical treatment , and by performing numerical simulations for the full model .	Within systems biology there is an increasing interest in the stochastic behavior of genetic and biochemical reaction networks .	An appropriate stochastic description is provided by the chemical master equation , which represents a continuous time Markov chain ( CTMC ) .	In this paper we consider the stochastic properties of a biochemical circuit , known to control eukaryotic cell cycle and possibly involved in oncogenesis , recently proposed in the literature within a deterministic framework .	Due to the inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes and the small number of molecules involved , the stochastic approach should be more correct in describing the real system : we study the agreement between the two approaches by exploring the system parameter space .
1	Similarly , if superstring theory is related to a non-perturbative 11D M-theory , then an 11D supermultiplet structure is expected , even though the multiplet may contain states of different masses .	U duality transformations must act on a basis of states that form complete multiplets of the U group , at any coupling , even though the states may not be mass degenerate , as for a broken symmetry .	We analyse the consistency between these two multiplet schemes at the higher excited string levels for various compactifications of the type IIA superstring .	While we find complete consistency for a number of compactifications , there remain some unanswered questions in others .	The relation to D-branes also needs further clarification .
0	In quantum parameter estimation , the ultimate precision limit is given by the so-called Cramer-Rao bound .	The calculation of this bound , which is expressed in terms of the quantum Fisher information ( QFI ) and determination of the optimal probe state , in the presence of the inevitable impact of decoherence is still a challenging problem .	In this article , this challenge is circumvented by introducing a lower bound on the QFI to estimate the ultimate precision limit .	The calculation of this bound ( which is mostly close to the exact value of the QFI ) requires only the matrix representation of the parameter encoding map .	This property allows us to use the bound in open quantum systems which are governed by general ( semigroup and non-semigroup ) dynamical maps .
1	In one chapter we consider adaptive prefix coding , for which we must read the input character by character , outputting each character 's self-delimiting codeword before reading the next one .	This thesis concerns sequential-access data compression , i.e. , by algorithms that read the input one or more times from beginning to end .	We show how to encode and decode each character in constant worst-case time while producing an encoding whose length is worst-case optimal .	In another chapter we consider one-pass compression with memory bounded in terms of the alphabet size and context length , and prove a nearly tight tradeoff between the amount of memory we can use and the quality of the compression we can achieve .	In a third chapter we consider compression in the read/write streams model , which allows us passes and memory both polylogarithmic in the size of the input .
0	This is the second paper in a series studying the photometric and spectroscopic properties of galaxies of different luminosities in the Coma cluster .	The sample selection , spectroscopic observations and completeness functions are presented here .	To study the spectral properties of galaxies as a function of their local environment , two fields were selected for spectroscopic observations to cover both the core ( Coma1 ) and outskirts ( ie .	south-west of the core and centered on NGC4839 ) - ( Coma3 ) of the cluster .	Medium resolution spectroscopy ( 6-9 \AA ) was carried out for a total of 490 galaxies in both fields ( 302 in Coma1 and 188 in Coma3 ) , using the WYFFOS multi-fiber spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope .
4	It is proved that the asymptotic standard errors ( a.s.e .	A general structural equation model is fitted on a panel data set that consists of $ I $ correlated samples .	The correlated samples could be data from correlated populations or correlated observations from occasions of panel data .	We consider cases in which the full pseudo-normal likelihood can not be used , for example , in highly unbalanced data where the participating individuals do not appear in consecutive years .	The model is estimated by a partial likelihood that would be the full and correct likelihood for independent and normal samples .
1	The high-resolution spectra were obtained at -9 and -2 days to allow the detection of narrow hydrogen and/or helium emission lines from the circumstellar medium of the SN .	We present early time high-resolution ( VLT/UVES ) and late time low-resolution ( VLT/FORS ) optical spectra of the normal type Ia supernova , SN 2001el .	No such lines were detected , and we therefore use photoionisation models to derive upper limits of 9x10^-6 Msun/yr and 5x10^-5 Msun/yr for the mass loss rate from the progenitor system assuming velocities of 10 km/s and 50 km/s , respectively , for a wind extending to outside at least a few x 10^15 cm away from the SN explosion site .	These limits exclude a symbiotic star in the upper mass loss rate regime from being the progenitor of SN 2001el .	The low resolution spectrum was obtained in the nebular phase of the SN , 400 days after the maximum light , to search for any hydrogen rich gas originating from the SN progenitor system .
2	CTCP builds upon the ideas of TCP/NC introduced by Sundararajan et al .	We introduce CTCP , a novel multi-path transport protocol using network coding .	CTCP is designed to incorporate TCP 's good features , such as congestion control and reliability , while improving on TCP 's performance in lossy and/or dynamic networks .	and uses network coding to provide robustness against losses .	We introduce the use of multiple paths to provide robustness against mobility and network failures .
4	Furthermore , the field strength can be minimized and an upper limit for the field gradient can be determined .	We demonstrate a simple method for the determination of the magnetic field in an ion trap using laser-cooled Be+ ions .	The method is not based on magnetic resonance and thus does not require delivering radiofrequency ( RF ) radiation to the trap .	Instead , stimulated Raman spectroscopy is used , and only an easily generated optical sideband of the laser cooling wave is required .	The d.c. magnetic vector , averaged over the Be+ ion ensemble , is determined .
4	Relations are first derived for the simplest case of two light flavors of quarks .	A systematic expansion in 1/N is constructed for baryons in QCD .	Predictions of the 1/N expansion at leading and subleading order for baryon axial current coupling constant ratios such as F/D , baryon masses and magnetic moments are derived .	The baryon sector of QCD has a light quark spin-flavor symmetry at leading order in 1/N .	The formalism of induced representations for contracted Lie algebras is introduced to explain the consequences of this symmetry .
3	Two modes of gravitational redshift , shift and distortion , become stronger with the emitting region closer to the Kerr black hole .	We study and quantify gravitational redshift by means of relativistic ray tracing simulations of emission lines .	The emitter model is based on thin , Keplerian rotating rings in the equatorial plane of a rotating black hole .	Emission lines are characterised by a generalized fully relativistic Doppler factor or redshift associated with the line core .	Shifts of the line cores reveal an effect at levels of 0.0015 to 60 % at gravitational radii ranging from 100000 to 2 .
2	This allows us to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a sample almost complete to K ( AB ) =21 .	[ Abridged ] We present the results of new near-IR spectroscopic observations of passive galaxies at z & gt ; 1.4 in a concentration of BzK-selected galaxies in the COSMOS field .	The observations have been conducted with Subaru/MOIRCS , and have resulted in absorption lines and/or continuum detection for 18 out of 34 objects .	COSMOS photometric redshifts are found in fair agreement overall with the spectroscopic redshifts , with a standard deviation of ~0.05 ; however , ~30 % of objects have photometric redshifts systematically underestimated by up to ~25 % .	We show that these systematic offsets in photometric redshifts can be removed by using these objects as a training set .
0	State estimation is necessary in diagnosing anomalies in Water Demand Systems ( WDS ) .	In this paper we present a neural network performing such a task .	State estimation is performed by using optimization , which tries to reconcile all the available information .	Quantification of the uncertainty of the input data ( telemetry measures and demand predictions ) can be achieved by means of robust estate estimation .	Using a mathematical model of the network , fuzzy estimated states for anomalous states of the network can be obtained .
4	Moreover , we prove that for any integer $ l $ there exist integers $ n_1 , n_2 , n_3 $ such that the Graver complexity of $ \mathcal { A } $ is greater than $ l $ .	Let $ \mathcal { A } =\ { { \bf a } _1 , \ldots , { \bf a } _n\ } \subset\Bbb { N } ^m $ .	We give an algebraic characterization of the universal Markov basis of the toric ideal $ I_ { \mathcal { A } } $ .	We show that the Markov complexity of $ \mathcal { A } =\ { n_1 , n_2 , n_3\ } $ is equal to two if $ I_ { \mathcal { A } } $ is complete intersection and equal to three otherwise , answering a question posed by Santos and Sturmfels .	We prove that for any $ r\geq 2 $ there is a unique minimal Markov basis of $ \mathcal { A } ^ { ( r ) } $ .
3	In the new joint processing level , the algorithms run in the same computing nodes , thus sharing resources , minimizing the data transfer from the detector buffers and increasing the algorithm flexibility .	After the current shutdown , the LHC is about to resume operation for a new data-taking period , when it will operate with increased luminosity , event rate and center of mass energy .	The new conditions will impose more demanding constraints on the ATLAS online trigger reconstruction and selection system .	To cope with such increased constraints , the ATLAS High-Level Trigger , placed after a first hardware-based Level~1 trigger , has been redesigned by merging two previously separated software-based processing levels .	The jet trigger software selects events containing high transverse momentum hadronic jets .
4	The energy gap for the brickwork lattice is obviously 2J on finite systems and predicted to be the same in the thermodynamic limit .	An exact algorithm is used to investigate the distributions of the degeneracies of low-energy excited states for the bimodal Ising spin glass on the brickwork lattice .	Since the distributions are extreme and do not self-average , we base our conclusions on the most likely values of the degeneracies .	Our main result is that the degeneracy of the first excited state per ground state and per spin is finite in the thermodynamic limit .	This is very different from the same model on a square lattice where a divergence proportional to the linear lattice size is expected .
3	Instead of being fundamentally predictable , the universe is fundamentally unpredictable .	When most people think of physics , they think of what they learned in high school physics : that the world is fundamentally predictable .	Given the position and velocity of a particle in space , it should be possible to predict its position at any moment in the future , right ?	Though this was thought to be true for thousands of years , recent developments in the field of physics have shown that this is n't actually true .	However , this does n't seem to make sense .
2	For the first problem where experimental data have already been observed , the classical statistical analysis involves constructing confidence intervals for the parameter { \Delta } m^2_ { 32 } .	Statistical methods of presenting experimental results in constraining the neutrino mass hierarchy ( MH ) are discussed .	Two problems are considered and are related to each other : how to report the findings for observed experimental data , and how to evaluate the ability of a future experiment to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , namely , sensitivity of the experiment .	These intervals are deduced from the parent distribution of the estimation of { \Delta } m^2_ { 32 } based on experimental data .	Due to existing experimental constraints on | { \Delta } m^2_ { 32 } | , the estimation of { \Delta } m^2_ { 32 } is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution ( a Binomial distribution with 1 trial ) rather than a Gaussian distribution .
1	We show that a fixed point with Diophantine frequency vector $ \o_0 $ is always accumulated by invariant complex analytic KAM-tori .	We study the accumulation of an elliptic fixed point of a real analytic Hamiltonian by quasi-periodic invariant tori .	Indeed , the following alternative holds : If the Birkhoff normal form of the Hamiltonian at the invariant point satisfies a R\ '' ussmann transversality condition , the fixed point is accumulated by real analytic KAM-tori which cover positive Lebesgue measure in the phase space ( in this part it suffices to assume that $ \o_0 $ has rationally independent coordinates ) .	If the Birkhoff normal form is degenerate , there exists an analytic subvariety of complex dimension at least $ d+1 $ passing through 0 that is foliated by complex analytic KAM-tori with frequency $ \omega_0 $ .	This is an extension of previous results obtained in \cite { EFK } to the case of an elliptic fixed point .
1	We show that time development of sub-wavelength resolution exhibits universal features , independent of model details .	The time evolution of evanescent modes in Pendry 's perfect lens proposal for ideally lossless and homogeneous , left-handed materials is analyzed .	This is due to the unavoidable near-degeneracy of surface electromagnetic modes in the deep sub-wavelength region .	By means of a mechanical analog , it is shown that an intrinsic time scale ( missed in stationary studies ) has to be associated with any desired lateral resolution .	A time-dependent cut-off length emerges , removing the problem of divergences claimed to invalidate Pendry 's proposal .
1	Finite truncations of this series are called multiple harmonic sums and are known to have interesting arithmetic properties .	Multiple zeta values are real numbers defined by an infinite series generalizing values of the Riemann zeta function at positive integers .	When the truncation point is one less than a prime $ p $ , the mod $ p $ values of multiple harmonic sums are called finite multiple zeta values .	The present work introduces a new class of congruence for multiple harmonic sums , which we call weighted congruences .	These congruences can hold modulo arbitrarily large powers of $ p $ .
0	Observations of the thermal X-ray emission from radio pulsars implicate that the size of hot spots is much smaller then the size of the polar cap that follows from the purely dipolar geometry of pulsar magnetic field .	Most plausible explanation of this phenomena is an assumption that the magnetic field at the stellar surface differs essentially from the purely dipolar field .	We can determine magnetic field at the surface by the conservation of the magnetic flux through the area bounded by open magnetic field lines .	Then the value of the surface magnetic field can be estimated as of the order of $ 10^ { 14 } $ G. On the other hand observations show that the temperature of the hot spot is about a few million Kelvins .	Based on these observations the Partially Screened Gap ( PSG ) model was proposed which assumes that the temperature of the actual polar cap ( hot spot ) equals to the so called critical temperature .
1	However , the computational demand for these algorithms is too high to work in real time , without specialized hardware or software solutions .	Recurrent neural networks are powerful tools for handling incomplete data problems in computer vision , thanks to their significant generative capabilities .	In this paper , we propose a framework for augmenting recurrent processing capabilities into a feedforward network without sacrificing much from computational efficiency .	We assume a mixture model and generate samples of the last hidden layer according to the class decisions of the output layer , modify the hidden layer activity using the samples , and propagate to lower layers .	For visual occlusion problem , the iterative procedure emulates feedforward-feedback loop , filling-in the missing hidden layer activity with meaningful representations .
0	The eigenvalue distribution of Hoppe 's two matrix model is investigated in detail as a function of the model 's coupling .	For small couplings it is a perturbed Wigner semicircle , while for large couplings it is a parabolic distribution which crosses over to a Wigner semicircle for eigenvalues within approximatley an inverse coupling from the boundary of the distribution .	The model is approximately commuting at large couplings and we find the joint eigenvalue distribution of the two matrices .	We also study a related three matrix model finding the corresponding three dimensional eigenvalue distribution there also .	The techniques developed here are more widely applicable to other multi-matrix models .
3	In the case of diffusive shock acceleration , which is the most promising acceleration mechanism in SNRs , very strong magnetic fluctuations with amplitudes well above the mean magnetic field must be present .	Synchrotron X-ray emission components were recently detected in many young supernova remnants ( SNRs ) .	There is even an emerging class - SN1006 , RXJ1713.72-3946 , Vela Jr , and others - that is dominated by non-thermal emission in X-rays , also probably of synchrotron origin .	Such emission results from electrons/positrons accelerated well above TeV energies in the spectral cut-off regime .	Starting from such a fluctuating field , we have simulated images of polarized X-ray emission of SNR shells and show that these are highly clumpy with high polarizations up to 50 % .
0	In this work , we identify 63 bona fide new candidates to T Tauri stars ( TTSs ) in the Taurus-Auriga region using as baseline its ultraviolet excess .	The initial data set has been defined from the GALEX all sky survey ( AIS ) .	The GALEX satellite obtained images in the near ultraviolet ( NUV ) and far ultraviolet ( FUV ) bands where the TTSs show a prominent excess , compared with main sequence or giants stars .	GALEX AIS surveyed the Taurus-Auriga molecular complex , as well as , a fraction of the California Nebula and the Perseus complex ; bright sources and the dark clouds themselves are avoided .	The properties of the TTSs in the ultraviolet ( GALEX ) , optical ( UCAC4 ) and infrared ( 2MASS ) have been defined using as qualification sample the TTSs observed with the International Ultraviolet Explorer .
1	It is based on accurate near infrared ( K ) photometry combined with 2MASS and other literature data .	The Period - metallicity - K band luminosity ( PLK ) relation for RR Lyrae stars in 15 Galactic globular clusters and in the LMC globular cluster Reticulum has been derived .	The PLK relation has been calibrated and compared with the previous empirical and theoretical determinations in literature .	The zero point of the absolute calibration has been obtained from the K magnitude of RR Lyr whose distance modulus has been measured via trigonometric parallax with HST .	Using this relation we obtain a distance modulus to the LMC of ( m-M ) _0 = 18.54 \pm 0.15 mag , in good agreement with recent determinations based on the analysis of Cepheid variable stars .
2	There , it was also shown that there exist infinitely many connected graphs of maximal degree $ \Delta= 5 $ that are neither regular nor biregular of class 1 which satisfy the Zagreb indices equality .	For a simple graph $ G $ with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges , the first Zagreb index and the second Zagreb index are defined as $ M_1 ( G ) =\sum_ { v\in V } d ( v ) ^2 $ and $ M_2 ( G ) =\sum_ { uv\in E } d ( u ) d ( v ) $ .	In \cite { VGFAD } , it was shown that if a connected graph $ G $ has maximal degree 4 , then $ G $ satisfies $ M_1 ( G ) /n = M_2 ( G ) /m $ ( also known as the Zagreb indices equality ) if and only if $ G $ is regular or biregular of class 1 ( a biregular graph whose no two vertices of same degree are adjacent ) .	Here , we generalize that result by showing that there exist infinitely many connected graphs of maximal degree $ \Delta \geq 5 $ that are neither regular nor biregular graphs of class 1 which satisfy the Zagreb indices equality .	We also consider when the above equality holds when the degrees of vertices of a given graph are in a prescribed interval of integers .
3	These are expressed as the closure of three-forms which depend on two discrete and a continuous parameter .	Exact , degenerate two-forms on time-extended space R X M which are invariant under the unsteady , incompressible fluid motion on 3D region M are introduced .	The equivalence class up to exact one-forms of each potential one-form is splitted by the velocity field .	The components of this splitting corresponds to Lagrangian and Eulerian conservation laws for helicity densities .	Each two-form is extended to a symplectic form on R X M. The subclasses of potential one-forms giving rise to Eulerian helicity conservations is shown to result in conformally symplectic structures on R X M. The connection between Lagrangian and Eulerian conservation laws for helicity is shown to be the same as the conformal equivalence of a Poisson bracket algebra to infinitely many local Lie algebra of functions on R X M .
2	However , here we find that , because of the non-linear nature of the metallicity-to-color transformation , a coeval group of old clusters with a unimodal metallicity spread can exhibit color bimodality .	The colors of globular clusters in most of large elliptical galaxies are bimodal .	This is generally taken as evidence for the presence of two cluster subpopulations that have different geneses .	The models of cluster colors indicate that the horizontal-branch stars are the main drivers behind the empirical non-linearity .	We show that the scenario gives simple and cohesive explanations for all the key observations , and could simplify theories of elliptical galaxy formation .
3	Standard clustering methods first generate a set of reference structures to any desired precision .	Assessing the convergence of a biomolecular simulation is an essential part of any computational investigation .	This is because many important quantities ( e.g. , free energy differences ) depend on the relative populations of different conformers ; insufficient convergence translates into systematic errors .	Here we present a simple method to self-consistently assess the convergence of a simulation .	The trajectory is then classified by proximity to the reference structures , yielding a one-dimensional histogram of structurally distinct populations .
3	We first assess the relative bias between these prescriptions when constraining \sigma_8 by sampling the ESP mass function to generate mock catalogs and using the T08 fit to analyse them , for various choices of survey selection threshold , mass definition and statistical priors .	We investigate potential systematic effects in constraining the amplitude of primordial fluctuations \sigma_8 arising from the choice of halo mass function in the likelihood analysis of current and upcoming galaxy cluster surveys .	We study the widely used N-body simulation fit of Tinker et al .	( T08 ) and , as an alternative , the recently proposed analytical model of Excursion Set Peaks ( ESP ) .	To assess the level of absolute bias in each prescription , we then repeat the analysis on dark matter halo catalogs in N-body simulations designed to mimic the mass distribution in the current data release of Planck SZ clusters .
2	Light inside such materials experiences no spatial phase change and extremely large phase velocity , properties that can be applied for realizing directional emission , tunneling waveguides , large area single mode devices , and electromagnetic cloaks .	Metamaterials offer unprecedented flexibility for manipulating the optical properties of matter , including the ability to access negative index , ultra-high index and chiral optical properties .	Recently , metamaterials with near-zero refractive index have drawn much attention .	However , at optical frequencies previously demonstrated zero- or negative-refractive index metamaterials require the use of metallic inclusions , leading to large ohmic loss , a serious impediment to device applications .	Here , we experimentally demonstrate an impedance matched zero-index metamaterial at optical frequencies based on purely dielectric constituents .
2	Consequently the outflow powering the highly-polarized reverse shock optical emission was mildly-magnetized at a degree $ \sigma \sim $ a few percent .	GRB 120308A , a long duration $ \gamma- $ ray burst detected by { \it Swift } , was distinguished by a highly-polarized early optical afterglow emission that strongly suggests an ordered magnetic field component in the emitting region .	In this work we model the optical and X-ray emission in the reverse and forward shock scenario and show that the strength of the magnetic field in reverse shock region is $ \sim 10 $ times stronger than that in the forward shock region .	Considering the plausible magnetic energy dissipation in both the acceleration and prompt emission phases of the Gamma-ray Burst ( GRB ) outflow , the afterglow data of GRB 120308A provides us the compelling evidence that at least for some GRBs a non-ignorable fraction of the energy was released in the form of Poynting-flux , confirming the finding firstly made in the reverse-forward shock emission modeling of the optical afterglow of GRB 990123 ( Fan et al .	2002 ; Zhang et al.2003 ) .
0	In two dimensions a vortex lattice can melt by quantum fluctuations into a non-superfluid Quantum Vortex Liquid ( QVL ) .	To determine the melting conditions , we compute the bare vortex hopping rate by exact diagonalization of square clusters near half filling .	Mapping our effective Hamiltonian to the Boson Coloumb Liquid simulated in Phys.Rev.Lett .	73 , 826 ( 1994 ) , we expect a QVL above a melting density of 0.0065 vortices per lattice site .	We also compute the Hall conductivity using adiabatic curvatures .
0	Coexistence of competing species is , due to unavoidable fluctuations , always transient .	In this Letter , we investigate the ultimate survival probabilities characterizing different species in cyclic competition .	We show that they often obey a surprisingly simple , though non-trivial behavior .	Within a model where coexistence is neutrally stable , we demonstrate a robust zero-one law : When the interactions between the three species are ( generically ) asymmetric , the `weakest ' species survives at a probability that tends to one for large population sizes , while the other two are guaranteed to extinct .	We rationalize our findings from stochastic simulations by an analytic approach .
4	Our results suggest that , in the case of the non-availability of full spectral features , the limited band integrated features can be used to segregate the two classes of objects ; although the band data classification is less accurate than the full spectral data classification .	We employ an Artificial Neural Network ( ANN ) based technique to develop a pipeline for automated segregation of stars from the galaxies to be observed by Tel-Aviv University Ultra-Violet Experiment ( TAUVEX ) .	We use synthetic spectra of stars from UVBLUE library and selected International Ultraviolet Explorer ( IUE ) low resolution spectra for galaxies in the ultraviolet ( UV ) region from 1250 to 3220\AA as the training set and IUE low-resolution spectra for both the stars and the galaxies as the test set .	All the data sets have been pre-processed to get band integrated fluxes so as to mimic the observations of the TAUVEX UV imager .	We also perform the ANN based segregation scheme using the full length spectral features ( which will also be useful for the ASTROSAT mission ) .
0	We aim to construct a general framework for portfolio management in continuous time , encompassing both stocks and bonds .	In these lecture notes we give an overview of the state of the art of optimal bond portfolios and we re-visit main results and mathematical constructions introduced in our previous publications ( Ann.Appl.Probab .	\textbf { 15 } , 1260 -- 1305 ( 2005 ) and Fin.Stoch .	{ \bf9 } , 429 -- 452 ( 2005 ) ) .	A solution of the optimal bond portfolio problem is given for general utility functions and volatility operator processes , provided that the market price of risk process has certain Malliavin differentiability properties or is finite dimensional .
2	In order to reduce the time to fix user 's position , we propose the Instant-On GPS receiver system which is implemented on an ARM based FPGA board , and operates under a very low power mode .	This paper introduces a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) Receiver that locates user 's position instantly .	Recently , many mobile devices require location information to add user position into their contents , and some applications require quick positioning when the device is initially switched on .	We 've developed a repeated sleep mode by periods to control the GPS receiver 's main power in order to achieve reduced power consumption .	By using a high resolution Real Time Clock ( RTC ) , we can estimate frame sync timing without receiving the current frame sync preamble data from a satellite when GPS turns back on .
1	The optical conductivity of graphene is computed by using the Kubo formula , within the framework of a full \pi-band tight-binding model .	In this paper we systemically study the optical conductivity and density of states of disorded graphene beyond the Dirac cone approximation .	Different types of non-correlated and correlated disorders are considered , such as random or Gaussian potentials , random or Gaussian nearest-neighbor hopping parameters , randomly distributed vacancies or their clusters , and random adsorbed hydrogen atoms or their clusters .	For a large enough concentration of resonant impurities , a new peak in the optical conductivity is found , associated to transitions between the midgap states and the Van Hove singularities of the main \pi-band .	We further discuss the effect of doping on the spectrum , and find that small amounts of resonant impurities are enough to obtain a background contribution to the conductivity in the infra-red part of the spectrum , in agreement with recent experiments .
1	Our measurement is based on analysis of a far ultraviolet ( FUV ) image of comet C/2004 Q2 ( Machholz ) recorded by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) on 2005 March 1 .	We present a measurement of the lifetime of ground state atomic carbon , C ( ^3P ) , against ionization processes in interplanetary space and compare it to the lifetime expected from the dominant physical processes likely to occur in this medium .	The bright CI 1561 A and 1657 A multiplets dominate the GALEX FUV band .	We used the image to create high S/N radial profiles that extended beyond one million km from the comet nucleus .	Our measurements yielded a total carbon lifetime of 7.1 -- 9.6 x 10^5 s ( scaled to 1 AU ) .
2	For very low probe fields , the dominant nonlinearities are of the third order and they can be exactly evaluated in a steady state regime .	We investigate dispersive optical nonlinearities that arise from Rydberg excitation blockade in cold Rydberg gases .	We consider a two-photon transition scheme and study the non-linear response to a weak optical probe in presence of a strong control beam .	In a more general case , the change in average atomic populations and coherences due to Rydberg interactions can be characterized by properly defined scaling parameters , which are generally complex numbers but in certain situations take the usual meaning of the number of atoms in a blockade sphere .	They can be used in a simple `` universal scaling '' formula to determine the dispersive optical nonlinearity of the medium .
2	This holds for star formation in molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood as well as for the formation of the very first stars in the early universe .	We discuss results from numerical simulations of star cluster formation in the turbulent interstellar medium ( ISM ) .	The thermodynamic behavior of the star-forming gas plays a crucial role in fragmentation and determines the stellar mass function as well as the dynamic properties of the nascent stellar cluster .	The thermodynamic state of the ISM is a result of the balance between heating and cooling processes , which in turn are determined by atomic and molecular physics and by chemical abundances .	Features in the effective equation of state of the gas , such as a transition from a cooling to a heating regime , define a characteristic mass scale for fragmentation and so set the peak of the initial mass function of stars ( IMF ) .
2	This raises the question to what degree high P_T physics , in particular leading-parton energy loss , which takes place in the background of an evolving medium , is sensitive to the presence of the event-by-event density fluctuations in the background .	Recently it has become apparent that event-by-event fluctuations in the initial state of hydrodynamical modelling of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are crucial in order to understand the full centrality dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient v_2 .	In particular , in central collisions the density fluctuations play a major role in generating the spatial eccentricity in the initial state .	In this work , we report results for the effects of fluctuations on the nuclear modification factor R_AA in both central and noncentral sqrt ( s_NN ) = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC .	Two different types of energy-loss models , a radiative and an elastic , are considered .
0	This note is a shortened version of my dissertation thesis , defended at Stony Brook University in December 2004 .	It illustrates how dynamic complexity of a system evolves under deformations .	The objects I considered are quartic polynomial maps of the interval that are compositions of two logistic maps .	In the parameter space $ P^ { Q } $ of such maps , I considered the algebraic curves corresponding to the parameters for which critical orbits are periodic , and I called such curves left and right bones .	Using quasiconformal surgery methods and rigidity I showed that the bones are simple smooth arcs that join two boundary points .
2	We evolve some of these solutions and study their nonlinear stability in light of recent work \cite { Bizon:2011gg } arguing that a weakly turbulent instability drives scalar perturbations of AdS to black hole formation .	We construct boson stars in global Anti de Sitter ( AdS ) space and study their stability .	Linear perturbation results suggest that the ground state along with the first three excited state boson stars are stable .	However evolutions suggest that boson stars are nonlinearly stable and immune to the instability for sufficiently small perturbation .	Furthermore , these studies find other families of initial data which similarly avoid the instability for sufficiently weak parameters .
1	We are interested in determining maximum end-to-end delays and backlogs of messages or packets going from a source node to a destination node , through a given virtual path in the network .	We present a model of performance bound calculus on feedforward networks where data packets are routed under wormhole routing discipline .	Our objective here is to give a network calculus approach for calculating the performance bounds .	First we propose a new concept of curves that we call packet curves .	The curves permit to model constraints on packet lengths of a given data flow , when the lengths are allowed to be different .
2	We consider a quench setup , where initial states are chosen from a microcanonical ensemble of finite energy in free theory , and then evolve with an arbitrary non-perturbative Hamiltonian .	It has been recently shown that small subsystems of finite quantum systems generically equilibrate .	We extend these results to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of field theories and matrix models .	Given a dynamical assumption on the expectation value of particle number density , we prove that small subsystems reach equilibrium at the level of quantum wave-function , and with respect to all observables .	The picture that emerges is that at higher energies , larger subsystems can reach equilibrium .
4	Fermions may also be charged under a gauge group $ G $ with a weak coupling $ g $ .	Explaining cosmic inflation by the effective dynamics of an $ SU ( N_C ) $ pure gauge theory of scale $ \La\sim 10^ { -6 } M_p $ is lacking an explanation of the ( Gaussian ) spatial curvature perturbations needed to seed the formation of large-scale structure after inflation .	In this work it is demonstrated how fundamentally charged fermions of mass $ m_F\sim 10^ { -12 } \La $ , whose approximate chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation , can cure this shortcoming .	The associated gas of weakly interacting pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons ( PNGB ) undergoes Bose-Einstein ( BE ) condensation well before the end of inflation .	This causes the occurence of condensed light scalar fields effectively acting as a curvaton .
4	We also found that in the absence of tension-oriented cell divisions and in the presence of increased tissue tension , EVL cells undergo ectopic fusions , suggesting that the reduction of tension anisotropy by oriented cell divisions is required to prevent EVL cells from fusing .	Epithelial spreading is a common and fundamental aspect of various developmental and disease-related processes such as epithelial closure and wound healing .	A key challenge for epithelial tissues undergoing spreading is to increase their surface area without disrupting epithelial integrity .	Here we show that orienting cell divisions by tension constitutes an efficient mechanism by which the Enveloping Cell Layer ( EVL ) releases anisotropic tension while undergoing spreading during zebrafish epiboly .	The control of EVL cell-division orientation by tension involves cell elongation and requires myosin II activity to align the mitotic spindle with the main tension axis .
1	In the charge-ordered state of PCSMO both conductivity and dielectric permittivity increase as function of magnetic field and temperature .	Magnetic field and temperature dependence of the Terahertz conductivity and permittivity of the colossal magnetoresistance manganite Pr_ { 0.65 } Ca_ { 0.28 } Sr_ { 0.07 } MnO_3 ( PCSMO ) is investigated approaching the metal-to-insulator transition ( MIT ) from the insulating side .	Universal scaling relationships between the changes in permittivity and conductivity are observed in a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields .	Similar scaling is also seen in La_ { 1-x } Sr_xMnO_3 for different doping levels .	The observed proportionality points towards the importance of pure ac-conductivity and phononic energy scale at MIT in manganites .
1	The set $ X_+ $ of dominant weights is a union of closed alcoves $ \oC_w $ numbered by the elements $ w\in W^f $ of a certain subset of affine Weyl group $ W $ .	We study the tensor category $ \cQ $ of tilting modules over a quantum group $ U_q $ with divided powers .	G.Lusztig and N.Xi defined a partition of $ W^f $ into canonical right cells and the right order $ \le_R $ on the set of cells .	For a cell $ A\subset W^f $ we consider a full subcategory $ \cQ_ { & lt ; A } $ formed by direct sums of tilting modules $ Q ( \lambda ) $ with highest weights $ \lambda \in \bigcup_ { w\in B & lt ; _RA } \oC_w $ .	We prove that $ \cQ_ { & lt ; A } $ is a tensor ideal in $ \cQ $ , generalizing H.Andersen 's Theorem about the ideal of negligible modules which in our notations is nothing else then $ \cQ_ { & lt ; \ { e\ } } $ .
2	We report on the experimental generation of two-mode squeezed vacuum on non-orthogonal quadratures depending on the plate angle .	We study theoretically and experimentally the quantum properties of a type II frequency degenerate optical parametric oscillator below threshold with a quarter-wave plate inserted inside the cavity which induces a linear coupling between the orthogonally polarized signal and idler fields .	This original device provides a good insight into general properties of two-mode gaussian states , illustrated in terms of covariance matrix .	After a simple operation , the entanglement is maximized and put into standard form , \textit { i.e . }	quantum correlations and anti-correlations on orthogonal quadratures .
2	The boundary value problem is under determined and a one parameter family of solutions can be found by means of arclength continuation .	Recently , a flexible and stable algorithm was introduced for the computation of 2D unstable manifolds of periodic solutions to systems of ordinary differential equations .	The main idea of this approach is to represent orbits in this manifold as the solutions of an appropriate boundary value problem .	This family of orbits covers a piece of the manifold .	The quality of this covering depends on the way the boundary value problem is discretised , as do the tractability and accuracy of the computation .
4	If instead rho is light-tailedsuch that the mean friction constant exist , S ( Q , t ) decays exponentially and the MSD scales as t^ ( 1/2 ) .	We consider the dynamics of a one-dimensional system consisting of dissimilar hardcore interacting ( bouncy ) random walkers .	The walkers ' ( diffusing particles ' ) friction constants xi_n , where n labels different bouncy walkers , are drawn from a distribution rho ( xi_n ) .	We provide an approximate analytic solution to this recent single-file problem by combining harmonization and effective medium techniques .	Two classes of systems are identified : when rho ( xi_n ) is heavy-tailed , rho ( xi_n ) =A xi_n^ ( -1-\alpha ) ( 0 & lt ; alpha & lt ; 1 ) for large xi_n , we identify a new universality class in which density relaxations , characterized by the dynamic structure factor S ( Q , t ) , follows a Mittag-Leffler relaxation , and the the mean square displacement of a tracer particle ( MSD ) grows as t^delta with time t , where delta=alpha/ ( 1+\alpha ) .
0	The Monster tower , also known as the Semple tower , is a sequence of manifolds with distributions of interest to both differential and algebraic geometers .	Each manifold is a projective bundle over the previous .	Moreover , each level is a fiber compactified jet bundle equipped with an action of finite jets of the diffeomorphism group .	There is a correspondence between points in the tower and curves in the base manifold .	These points admit a stratification which can be encoded by a word called the RVT code .
4	Nonlinear generalizations of quantum mechanics have been proposed .	Quantum dynamics is linear .	How do we know ?	From theory or experiment ?	The history of this question is reviewed .
2	The parity of the field across the Galactic plane is also not well established .	The magnetic field in our Galaxy is not well known and is difficult to measure .	A spiral regular field in the disk between the Galactic arms is favored by observations , however it is still controversial if the field reverses from arm to arm .	In this letter we demonstrate that cosmic ray protons in the energy range 10^18 to 10^19 eV , if accelerated near the center of the Galaxy , can probe the large scale structure of the Galactic Magnetic Field .	In particular if the field is of even parity , and the spiral field reverses direction from arm to arm , i.e.if it is bi-symmetric ( BSS ) , ultra high energy protons will predominantly come from the Southern Galactic hemisphere , and predominantly from the Northern Galactic hemisphere if the field is of even parity and axi-symmetric ( ASS ) .
4	This allows us to prove the invariance of the generic Milnor number ( resp .	In this paper , we show how to apply a theorem by L\^e D.T .	and the author about linear families of curves on normal surface singularities to get new results in this area .	The main concept used is a specific definition of { \em general elements } of an ideal in the local ring of the surface .	We make explicit the connection between this notion and the elementary notion of general element of a linear pencil , through the use of { \em reduction } .
3	The constant complicates isolating the spin-diffusion length , lsf ( IrMn ) , in bulk IrMn , but lsf ( IrMn ) is probably short , less than or equal to 1 nm .	To study spin flipping within the antiferromagnet IrMn , we extended prior Current-Perpendicular-to-Plane ( CPP ) Giant Magnetoresistance ( GMR ) studies of Py-based exchange-biased-spin-valves containing IrMn inserts to thicker IrMn layers-5 nm less than or equal to t ( IrMn ) less than or equal to 30 nm .	Unexpectedly , A { \Delta } R = A [ R ( AP ) - R ( P ) ] -- the difference in specific resistance between the anti-parallel ( AP ) and parallel ( P ) magnetic states of the two Py layers-did not decrease with increasing t ( IrMn ) , for t ( IrMn ) greater than 5 nm , but rather became constant to within our measuring uncertainty .	This constant looks to be due mostly to a new , small MR in thin Py layers .	Similar results were found with FeMn .
0	The collapse of flexible polyelectrolytes in a solution of multivalent counterions is studied by means of a two state model .	The states correspond to rod-like and spherically collapsed conformations respectively .	We focus on the very dilute monomer concentration regime where the collapse transition is found to occur when the charge of the multivalent salt is comparable ( but smaller ) to that of the monomers .	The main contribution to the free energy of the collapsed conformation is linear in the number of monomers $ N $ , since the internal state of the collapsed polymer approaches that of an amorphous ionic solid .	The free energy of the rod-like state grows as $ N\ln N $ , due to the electrostatic energy associated with that shape .
1	Indeed , the common perception is that X-ray emission from FRI 's is synchrotron emission whereas that from FRII 's may be IC/CMB and/or synchrotron .	The overall classification of X-ray jets has clung to that prevalent in the radio : FRI vs. FRII ( including quasars ) .	Now that we have a sizable collection of sources with detected X-ray emission from jets and hotspots , it seems that a more unbiased study of these objects could yield additional insights on jets and their X-ray emission .	The current contribution is a first step in the process of analyzing all of the relevant parameters for each detected component for the sources collected in the XJET website .	This initial effort involves measuring the ratio of X-ray to radio fluxes and evaluating correlations with other jet parameters .
2	The force field is based on hydrogen bonds and effective hydrophobicity forces .	We study the thermodynamic behavior of a model protein with 54 amino acids that forms a three-helix bundle in its native state .	The model contains three types of amino acids and five to six atoms per amino acid and has the Ramachandran torsional angles $ \phi_i $ , $ \psi_i $ as its degrees of freedom .	For a suitable choice of the relative strength of these interactions , we find that the three-helix-bundle protein undergoes an abrupt folding transition from an expanded state to the native state .	Also shown is that the corresponding one- and two-helix segments are less stable than the three-helix sequence .
0	Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that the switching behavior of magnetic nanoparticles can be well controlled by external time-dependent magnetic fields .	In this work , we inspect theoretically the influence of the temperature and the magnetic anisotropy on the spin-dynamics and the switching properties of single domain magnetic nanoparticles ( Stoner-particles ) .	Our theoretical tools are the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation extended as to deal with finite temperatures within a Langevine framework .	Physical quantities of interest are the minimum field amplitudes required for switching and the corresponding reversal times of the nanoparticle 's magnetic moment .	In particular , we contrast the cases of static and time-dependent external fields and analyze the influence of damping for a uniaxial and a cubic anisotropy .
2	We use finite collections of essential circles to define `` circle covers , '' which extend and contain as special cases the delta-covers of Sormani and Wei ( equivalently the epsilon-covers of the authors ) ; the constructions are metric adaptations of those utilized by Berestovskii-Plaut in the construction of entourage covers of uniform spaces .	We give various applications of essential circles ( introduced in an earlier paper by the authors ) in a compact geodesic space X .	Essential circles completely determine the homotopy critical spectrum of X , which we show is precisely 2/3 the covering spectrum of Sormani-Wei .	We show that , unlike delta- and epsilon-covers , circle covers are in a sense closed with respect to Gromov-Hausdorff convergence , and we prove a finiteness theorem concerning their deck groups that does not hold for covering maps in general .	This allows us to completely understand the structure of Gromov-Hausdorff limits of delta-covers .
2	The latter is a solution of our model of index dynamics defined by the nonhomogeneous fractional relaxation equation .	We analyse the dynamics of the Warsaw Stock Exchange index WIG at a daily time horizon before and after its well defined local maxima of the cusp-like shape decorated with oscillations .	The rising and falling paths of the index peaks can be described by the Mittag-Leffler function superposed with various types of oscillations .	This solution is a generalised analog of an exactly solvable model of viscoelastic materials .	We found that the Warsaw Stock Exchange can be considered as an intermediate system lying between two complex ones , defined by short and long-time limits of the Mittag-Leffler function ; these limits are given by the Kohlraush-Williams-Watts law for the initial times , and the power-law or the Nutting law for asymptotic time .
1	Moreover , there is a correspondence between these solutions and certain solutions of 2-dimensional BF theory on Sigma .	Working in the Palatini formalism , we describe a procedure for constructing degenerate solutions of general relativity on 4-manifold M from certain solutions of 2-dimensional BF theory on any framed surface Sigma embedded in M. In these solutions the cotetrad field e ( and thus the metric ) vanishes outside a neighborhood of Sigma , while inside this neighborhood the connection A and the field E = e ^ e satisfy the equations of 4-dimensional BF theory .	Our construction works in any signature and with any value of the cosmological constant .	If M = R x S for some 3-manifold S , at fixed time our solutions typically describe `flux tubes of area ' : the 3-metric vanishes outside a collection of thickened links embedded in S , while inside these thickened links it is nondegenerate only in the two transverse directions .	We comment on the quantization of the theory of solutions of this form and its relation to the loop representation of quantum gravity .
1	The solution is based on the iterative search for constrained dense realizations using linear programming .	In this paper an algorithm is given to determine all possible structurally different linearly conjugate realizations of a given kinetic polynomial system .	Since there might exist exponentially many different reaction graph structures , we can not expect to have a polynomial-time algorithm , but we can organize the computation in such a way that polynomial time is elapsed between displaying any two consecutive realizations .	The correctness of the algorithm is proved , and possibilities of a parallel implementation are discussed .	The operation of the method is shown on two illustrative examples .
4	A comparison with the S stars identified in the Magellanic Clouds and in the Fornax dwarf elliptical galaxy reveals that they have luminosities similar to the galactic Tc-rich S stars .	HIPPARCOS trigonometrical parallaxes make it possible to compare the location of Tc-rich and Tc-poor S stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell ( HR ) diagram : Tc-rich S stars are found to be cooler and intrinsically brighter than Tc-poor S stars .	The comparison with the Geneva evolutionary tracks reveals that the line marking the onset of thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) matches well the observed limit between Tc-poor and Tc-rich S stars .	Tc-rich S stars are , as expected , identified with thermally-pulsing AGB stars of low and intermediate masses , whereas Tc-poor S stars comprise mostly low-mass stars ( with the exception of 57 Peg ) located either on the red giant branch or on the early AGB .	Like barium stars , Tc-poor S stars are known to belong exclusively to binary systems , and their location in the HR diagram is consistent with the average mass of 1.6 +- 0.2 Msun derived from their orbital mass-function distribution .
4	Here , unlike single-agent settings , a player can not myopically maximize its reward -- - it must speculate on how the other agents may act to influence the game 's outcome .	Modeling the purposeful behavior of imperfect agents from a small number of observations is a challenging task .	When restricted to the single-agent decision-theoretic setting , inverse optimal control techniques assume that observed behavior is an approximately optimal solution to an unknown decision problem .	These techniques learn a utility function that explains the example behavior and can then be used to accurately predict or imitate future behavior in similar observed or unobserved situations .	In this work , we consider similar tasks in competitive and cooperative multi-agent domains .
0	In the Solar system the planets ' compositions vary with orbital distance , with rocky planets in close orbits and lower-density gas giants in wider orbits .	The detection of close-in giant planets around other stars was the first clue that this pattern is not universal , and that planets ' orbits can change substantially after their formation .	Here we report another violation of the orbit-composition pattern : two planets orbiting the same star with orbital distances differing by only 10 % , and densities differing by a factor of 8 .	One planet is likely a rocky `super-Earth ' , whereas the other is more akin to Neptune .	These planets are thirty times more closely spaced -- and have a larger density contrast -- than any adjacent pair of planets in the Solar system .
3	In the latter case , it is shown how vector-valued regularization functions in these multiple Hilbert scales can be used .	Several convergence results in Hilbert scales under different source conditions are proved and orders of convergence and optimal orders of convergence are derived .	Also , relations between those source conditions are proved .	The concept of a multiple Hilbert scale on a product space is introduced , regularization methods on these scales are defined , both for the case of a single observation and for the case of multiple observations .	In all cases convergence is proved and orders and optimal orders of convergence are shown .
0	We review the connection between noncommutative field theories and gravity .	When the noncommutativity is induced by the Moyal product we can use the Seiberg-Witten map in order to deal with ordinary fields .	We then show that the effect of the noncommutativity is the same as a field dependent gravitational background .	The gravitational background is that of a gravitational plane wave and the coupling is charge dependent .	Uncharged fields couple more strongly than the charged ones .
2	the usual basis of $ \mathcal { H } _0 $ .	Given a positive definite , bounded linear operator $ A $ on the Hilbert space $ \mathcal { H } _0 : =l^2 ( E ) $ , we consider a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $ \mathcal { H } _+ $ with a reproducing kernel $ A ( x , y ) $ .	Here $ E $ is any countable set and $ A ( x , y ) $ , $ x , y\in E $ , is the representation of $ A $ w.r.t .	Imposing further conditions on the operator $ A $ , we also consider another reproducing kernel Hilbert space $ \mathcal { H } _- $ with a kernel function $ B ( x , y ) $ , which is the representation of the inverse of $ A $ in a sense , so that $ \mathcal { H } _-\supset\mathcal { H } _0\supset\mathcal { H } _+ $ becomes a rigged Hilbert space .	We investigate a relationship between the ratios of determinants of some partial matrices related to $ A $ and $ B $ and the suitable projections in $ \mathcal { H } _- $ and $ \mathcal { H } _+ $ .
4	A consistent definition of the charge-raising operator is discussed .	We study the sine-Gordon ( SG ) model at finite densities of the topological charge and small SG interaction constant , related to the one-dimensional Hubbard model near half-filling .	Using the modified WKB approach , we find that the spectrum of the Gaussian fluctuations around the classical solution reproduces the results of the Bethe ansatz studies .	The modification of the collective coordinate method allows us to write down the action , free from infra-red divergencies .	The behaviour of the density-type correlation functions is non-trivial and we demonstrate the existence of leading and sub-leading asymptotes .
3	The formal logic supports first-order reasoning and reasoning about protocol invariants , taking concrete security bounds into account .	We present a formal logic for quantitative reasoning about security properties of network protocols .	The system allows us to derive concrete security bounds that can be used to choose key lengths and other security parameters .	We provide axioms for reasoning about digital signatures and random nonces , with security properties based on the concrete security of signature schemes and pseudorandom number generators ( PRG ) .	Proofs constructed in our logic also provide conventional asymptotic security guarantees because of the way that concrete bounds accumulate in proofs .
4	Finally , using the techniques developed to deal with Fulton-MacPherson spaces , we study the automorphism groups of some Kontsevich moduli spaces $ \overline { M } _ { 0 , n } ( \mathbb { P } ^N , d ) $ .	Let $ X [ n ] $ be the Fulton-MacPherson configuration space of $ n $ ordered points on a smooth projective variety $ X $ .	We prove that if either $ n\neq 2 $ or $ \dim ( X ) \geq 2 $ , then the connected component of the identity of $ Aut ( X [ n ] ) $ is isomorphic to the connected component of the identity of $ Aut ( X ) $ .	When $ X = C $ is a curve of genus $ g ( C ) \neq 1 $ we classify the dominant morphisms $ C [ n ] \rightarrow C [ r ] $ , and thanks to this we manage to compute the whole automorphism group of $ C [ n ] $ , namely $ Aut ( C [ n ] ) \cong S_n\times Aut ( C ) $ for any $ n\neq 2 $ , while $ Aut ( C [ 2 ] ) \cong S_2\ltimes ( Aut ( C ) \times Aut ( C ) ) $ .	Furthermore , we extend these results on the automorphisms to the case where $ X = C_1\times ... \times C_r $ is a product of curves of genus $ g ( C_i ) \geq 2 $ .
3	To illustrate the feasibility of this approach , we classify all pairs $ ( G , S^1 ) $ such that $ G $ is compact connected Lie and the embedded $ S^1 $ subgroup of $ G $ acts equivariantly formally on $ G/S^1 $ .	It is an open question for which pairs $ ( G , K ) $ of compact Lie groups $ G $ and closed , connected subgroups $ K $ the left action of $ K $ on the homogeneous space $ G/K $ is equivariantly formal .	In this work , we reduce this question to the case $ K $ is a torus and $ G $ is simply-connected by successively replacing members of the pair $ ( G , K ) $ with simpler groups .	The results , combined , essentially reduce equivariant formality of isotropy actions to the study of embeddings of tori in simply-connected groups .	The computation depends only on the dimension of the cohomology ring $ H^* ( G/S^1 ) $ and the number of components of the normalizer $ N_G ( S^1 ) $ .
2	The energy bounds in the process and the measurement disturbances are modeled using a sum quadratic constraint .	This article approaches deterministic filtering via an application of the min-plus linearity of the corresponding dynamic programming operator .	This filter design method yields a set-valued state estimator for discrete-time nonlinear systems ( nonlinear dynamics and output functions ) .	The filtering problem is recast into an optimal control problem in the form of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman ( HJB ) equation , the solution to which is obtained by employing the min-plus linearity property of the dynamic programming operator .	This approach enables the solution to the HJB equation and the design of the filter without recourse to linearization of the system dynamics/ output equation .
1	We find that the transient ( NGC300 OT2008-1 ) has a peak absolute magnitude of M_bol~-11.8 mag , intermediate between novae and supernovae , and similar to the recent events M85 OT2006-1 and SN2008S .	[ abridged ] We present multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectroscopy , UV/radio/X-ray imaging , and archival Hubble and Spitzer observations of an intermediate luminosity optical transient recently discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC300 .	Our high-resolution spectra , the first for this event , are dominated by intermediate velocity ( ~200-1000 km/s ) hydrogen Balmer lines and CaII emission and absorption lines that point to a complex circumstellar environment , reminiscent of the yellow hypergiant IRC+10420 .	In particular , we detect broad CaII H & amp ; K absorption with an asymmetric red wing extending to ~1000 km/s , indicative of gas infall onto a massive and relatively compact star ( blue supergiant or Wolf-Rayet star ) ; an extended red supergiant progenitor is unlikely .	The origin of the inflowing gas may be a previous ejection from the progenitor or the wind of a massive binary companion .
4	In case ( iii ) , we show that the supercurrent path can be tailored by incorporating magnetic elements in planar Josephson junctions which also lead to a strong modulation of the density of states .	An extension of quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel theory to higher spatial dimensions than one is crucial in order to describe physical phenomena like charge/spin Hall effects and topological excitations like vortices and skyrmions , none of which are captured in one-dimensional models .	We here present a numerical finite element method which solves the non-linearized 2D and 3D quasiclassical Usadel equation relevant for the diffusive regime .	We show the application of this on three model systems with non-trivial geometries : ( i ) a bottlenecked Josephson junction with external flux , ( ii ) a nanodisk ferromagnet deposited on top of a superconductor and ( iii ) superconducting islands in contact with a ferromagnet .	In case ( i ) , we demonstrate that one may control externally not only the geometrical array in which superconducting vortices arrange themselves , but also to cause coalescence and tune the number of vortices .
1	Here we present an analysis of these two outbursts using a set of cometary observations .	Jupiter-family comet 15P/Finlay has been reportedly quiet in activity for over a century but has harbored two outbursts during its 2014/2015 perihelion passage .	The outbursts took place between 2014 Dec. 15.4 -- 16.0 UT and 2015 Jan. 15.5 -- 16.0 UT as constrained by ground-based and spacecraft observations .	We find a characteristic ejection speed of $ V_0=300 $ to $ 650 \mathrm { m \cdot s^ { -1 } } $ for the ejecta of the first outburst and $ V_0=550 $ to $ 750 \mathrm { m \cdot s^ { -1 } } $ for that of the second outburst using a Monte Carlo dust model .	The mass of the ejecta is calculated to be $ M_\mathrm { d } =2 $ to $ 3\times10^5 \mathrm { kg } $ for the first outburst and $ M_\mathrm { d } =4 $ to $ 5\times10^5 \mathrm { kg } $ for the second outburst , corresponds to less than $ 10^ { -7 } $ of the nucleus mass .
2	In addition , due to the large volume of vision data , it is desired for each sensor to execute processing through local computation and communication .	This paper investigates cooperative environmental monitoring for Pan-Tilt-Zoom ( PTZ ) visual sensor networks .	We first present a novel formulation of the optimal environmental monitoring problem , whose objective function is intertwined with the uncertain state of the environment .	To address the issues , we present a distributed solution to the problem based on game theoretic cooperative control and payoff-based learning .	At the first stage , a utility function is designed so that the resulting game constitutes a potential game with potential function equal to the group objective function , where the designed utility is shown to be computable through local image processing and communication .
3	Moreover the beat frequency in the Faraday rotation angle is determined mainly by the Zeeman splitting , red shifted by the Coulomb scattering and the electron hole spin exchange .	We study the kinetics of spin coherence of optically excited electrons in an undoped insulating ZnSe/Zn $ _ { 1-x } $ Cd $ _x $ Se quantum well under moderate magnetic fields in the Voigt configuration .	After clarifying the optical coherence and the spin coherence , we build the kinetic Bloch equations and calculate dephasing and relaxation kinetics of laser pulse excited plasma due to statically screened Coulomb scattering and electron hole spin exchange .	We find that the Coulomb scattering can not cause the spin dephasing , and that the electron-hole spin exchange is the main mechanism of the spin decoherence .	Our numerical results are in agreement with experiment findings .
3	Here , we reported a facile and scalable chemical vapor deposition method to fabricate high-quality Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 microbelts , they have shown ultrahigh mobility up to 1.15*10^5 cm^2/V s and pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations .	Three dimensional ( 3D ) Dirac semimetals are 3D analogue of graphene , which display Dirac points with linear dispersion in k-space , stabilized by crystal symmetry .	Cd3As2 and Na3Bi were predicted to be 3D Dirac semimetals and were subsequently demonstrated by photoemission experiments .	As unveiled by transport measurements , several exotic phases , such as Weyl semimetals , topological insulators , and topological superconductors , can be deduced by breaking time reversal or inversion symmetry .	Such extraordinary features are attributed to the suppression of electron backscattering .
4	We analyze the new system by dealing with directed heterogeneous couplings among the units .	The role of intermediaries in the synchronization of small groups of light controlled oscillators ( LCO ) is addressed .	A single LCO is a two-time-scale phase oscillator .	When pulse-coupling two LCOs , the synchronization time decreases monotonously as the coupling strength increases , independent of the initial conditions and frequency detuning .	In this work we study numerically the effects that a third LCO induces to the collective behavior of the system .
3	Conversely in the case of N=2 supersymmetries we obtain a non-covariant counterterm with both curved and flat indices .	Worldline N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric sigma models in curved background are useful to describe spin one-half and spin one particles coupled to external gravity , respectively .	It is well known that worldline path integrals in curved space require regularization : we present here the mode-regularization for these models , finding in particular the corresponding counterterms , both in the case of flat and curved indices for worldline fermions .	For N=1 , using curved indices we find a contribution to the counterterm from the fermions that cancels the contribution of the bosons , leading to a vanishing total counterterm and thus preserving the covariance and supersymmetry of the classical action .	This work completes the analysis of the known regularization schemes for N=1,2 nonlinear sigma models in one dimension .
2	These possibilities imply differences not only in the spectral energy distribution ( SED ) but also in the variability signatures , especially in the X- and $ \gamma $ -ray regime .	We investigate the origin of high-energy emission in blazars within the context of the leptohadronic one-zone model .	We find that $ \gamma $ -ray emission can be attributed to synchrotron radiation either from protons or from secondary leptons produced via photohadronic processes .	Thus , the temporal behavior of each leptohadronic scenario can be used to probe the particle population responsible for the high-energy emission as it can give extra information not available by spectral fits .	In the present work we apply these ideas to the non-thermal emission of Mrk 421 .
3	This allows a single step determination of the distance modulus to M31 $ \mu_ { 0 , M31 } = 24.471\pm 0.035 \pm 0.045 $ mag ( statistical plus systematic error ) and the corresponding distance $ R_ { M31 } = 784\pm 13\pm 17 kpc $ .	Following an approach by Paczy\'nski & amp ; Stanek we compare red clump stars with parallaxes known to better than 10 % in the Hipparcos catalog with the red clump stars observed in three fields in M31 using the HST .	There are $ \sim 600 $ and $ \sim 6,300 $ such stars in the two data sets , respectively .	The local red clump luminosity function is well represented by a Gaussian with the peak at $ M_ { I , m } =-0.23 $ , and the dispersion $ \sigma_ { RC } \approx0.2 $ mag .	The number of red clump stars is large enough that the formal statistical error in the distance is only $ \lesssim 2 $ % .
1	By combining ARPES measurements in different experimental configurations , we clearly resolve their elliptic shape .	Despite many ARPES investigations of iron pnictides , the structure of the electron pockets is still poorly understood .	Comparison with band calculation identify a deep electron band with the dxy orbital and a shallow electron band along the perpendicular ellipse axis with the dxz/dyz orbitals .	We find that , for both electron and hole bands , the lifetimes associated with dxy are longer than for dxz/dyz .	This suggests that the two types of orbitals play different roles in the electronic properties and that their relative weight is a key parameter to determine the ground state .
2	In the weak disorder limit we obtain explicit nonperturbative analytical results for the density of states and the two-level correlation function by mapping the chRBM onto a nonlinear sigma model .	We study the spectral properties of a chiral random banded matrix ( chRBM ) with elements decaying as a power-law $ { { \cal H } _ { ij } } \sim |i-j|^ { -\alpha } $ .	This model is equivalent to a chiral 1D Anderson Hamiltonian with long range power-law hopping .	We also put forward , by exploiting the relation between the chRBM at $ \alpha=1 $ and a generalized chiral random matrix model , an exact expression for the above correlation functions .	We give compelling analytical and numerical evidence that for this value the chRBM reproduces all the features of an Anderson transition .
1	We investigate observations of the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 with unusually high hardness and low flux .	Aims .	In particular , we study the characteristic frequencies seen in the PDS and the hardness-flux correlation within and between these observations.Methods .	We analyse observations of Cyg X-1 during periods when the source reaches its highest hardness levels ( & gt ; 1 for the 9-20 keV over 2-4 keV RXTE/PCA count ratios , corresponding to Gamma & lt ; 1.6 ) .	Using the relativistic precession model to interpret the PDS we estimate a value for the inner radius of the accretion disc .
0	This paper discusses the multi-wavelength scanning Raman lidar being built at Lidar Division , CEILAP ( CITEDEF-CONICET ) in the frame of the Argentinean Cherenkov Telescope Array ( CTA ) collaboration to measure the spectral characteristics of the atmospheric aerosol extinction profiles to provide better transmission calculations at the future CTA site .	This lidar emits short laser pulses of 7-9 ns at 355 , 532 and 1064 nm at 50 Hz with nominal energy of 125 mJ at 1064 nm .	This wavelengths are also used to retrieve the atmospheric ( air , aerosol and clouds ) backscattered radiation in the UV , VIS and IR ranges .	Raman capabilities were added in the UV and VIS wavelengths to retrieve the spectral characteristics of the aerosol extinction and the water vapor profile .	Due to the expected low aerosol optical depth of the future site , the short observation period as well as the extension of the observation , an enhanced collection area is required .
2	We find that the onset of condensation of $ K^- $ and $ \bar K^0 $ highly depends not only on the strength of optical potential but also on the new couplings .	We investigate the role of higher order couplings , along with the condensation of antikaons ( $ K^- $ and $ \bar K^0 $ ) , on the properties of neutron star ( NS ) .	We employ extended versions of the relativistic mean-field model , in which kaon-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon interactions are taken on the same footing .	The presence of antikaons leads to a softer equation of state and makes the neutron star core symmetric and lepton-deficient .	We show that these effects strongly influence the mass-radius relation as well as the composition of neutron star .
2	When D is totally atomic , these maps are the idempotent Schur multipliers and we characterise those with norm \eta_k for 0 & lt ; = k & lt ; = 6 .	Let D be a masa in B ( H ) where H is a separable Hilbert space .	We find real numbers \eta_0 & lt ; \eta_1 & lt ; \eta_2 & lt ; ... & lt ; \eta_6 so that for every bounded , normal D-bimodule map { \Phi } on B ( H ) either ||\Phi|| & gt ; \eta_6 , or ||\Phi|| = \eta_k for some k & lt ; = 6 .	We also show that the Schur idempotents which keep only the diagonal and superdiagonal of an n x n matrix , or of an n x ( n+1 ) matrix , both have norm 2/ ( n+1 ) cot ( pi/ ( n+1 ) ) , and we consider the average norm of a random idempotent Schur multiplier as a function of dimension .	Many of our arguments are framed in the combinatorial language of bipartite graphs .
2	The analytic solution of the path equation under the Kepler potential is presented .	The central force problem is considered in a three dimensional space in which the Poisson bracket among the spatial coordinates is the one by the SU ( 2 ) Lie algebra .	It is shown that among attractive power-law potentials it is only the Kepler one that all of its bound-states make closed orbits .	It is shown that except the Kepler potential , in contrast to ordinary space , all of the potentials for which all of the almost circular orbits are closed are non-power-law ones .	For the non-power-law potentials examples of the numerical solutions of the path equations are presented .
1	In the first part , starting from the Maxwell equations , a basic understanding of the processes is given and explained with examples of simple geometry and time behaviour .	This paper covers the main eddy current effects in accelerator magnets - field modification ( time delay and field quality ) and resistive power losses .	Useful formulas are derived for an analytic estimate of the size of the effects .	In the second part the effects in real magnets are analysed and described in comparison with numerical and measured results .	Finally , based on the previous parts , design recommendations are given regarding how to minimize eddy current effects .
3	The method has been implemented for a type-I downconversion source , pumped by ultrashort laser pulses .	We propose and demonstrate a method for measuring the spectral density matrix of a single photon pulse .	The method is based on registering Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between photon to be measured and a pair of attenuated and suitably delayed laser pulses described by a known spectral amplitude .	The density matrix is retrieved from a two-dimensional interferogram of coincidence counts .	The experimental results agree well with a theoretical model which takes into account the temporal as well as spatial effects in the source .
3	An industrial evaluation indicated that the ISBST system could find test cases that are not created by testers employing manual techniques .	Context : Search-based software testing promises to provide users with the ability to generate high-quality test cases , and hence increase product quality , with a minimal increase in the time and effort required .	One result that emerged out of a previous study to investigate the application of search-based software testing ( SBST ) in an industrial setting was the development of the Interactive Search-Based Software Testing ( ISBST ) system .	ISBST allows users to interact with the underlying SBST system , guiding the search and assessing the results .	The validity of the evaluation was threatened , however , by the low number of participants .
2	We first find that the non-commutative dipole field does not induce the chiral symmetry breaking even if the supersymmetry was completely broken , contrast to the conventional believing that the chiral symmetry will be broken in the non-supersymmetric theory .	Apply the T-duality and smeared twist to the D3-brane solution one can construct the supergravity backgrounds which may dual to supersymmetric or non-supersymmetric non-commutative dipole field theory .	We introduce D7-brane probe into the dual supergravity background to study the chiral dynamics and meson spectrum therein .	Next , we find that the dipole field does not modify the meson spectrum in the supersymmetric theory while it will reduce the meson bound-state energy in the non-supersymmetric theory .	We also evaluate the static quark anti-quark potential and see that the dipole field has an effect to produce attractive force between the quark and anti-quark .
4	I demonstrate that the use of phylogenies constructed in this fashion is inappropriate for many questions involving traits .	The statistical estimation of phylogenies is always associated with uncertainty , and accommodating this uncertainty is an important component of modern phylogenetic comparative analysis .	The birth-death polytomy resolver is a method of accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty that places missing ( unsampled ) taxa onto phylogenetic trees , using taxonomic information alone .	Recent studies of birds and mammals have used this approach to generate pseudo-posterior distributions of phylogenetic trees that are complete at the species level , even in the absence of genetic data for many species .	Many researchers have used these distributions of phylogenies for downstream evolutionary analyses that involve inferences on phenotypic evolution , geography , and community assembly .
2	The resonance in Ag broadens significantly below the transition temperature Tc as expected from the emerging field lines of the vortex lattice in YBCO .	Beta-NMR has been used to study vortex lattice disorder near the surface of the high-Tc superconductor YBCO .	The magnetic field distribution from the vortex lattice was detected by implanting a low energy beam of highly polarized 8Li into a thin overlayer of silver on optimally doped , twinned and detwinned YBCO samples .	However , the lineshape is more symmetric and the dependence on the applied magnetic field is much weaker than expected from an ideal vortex lattice , indicating that the vortex density varies across the face of the sample , likely due to pinning at twin boundaries .	At low temperatures the broadening from such disorder does not scale with the superfluid density .
2	in the beginning and late universe accelerates after 8.58 Gyrs .	In the present paper , it is found that dark energy emerges spontaneously from the modified gravity .	According to cosmological scenario , obtained here , the universe inflates for $ \sim 10^ { -37 } $ sec .	During the long intermediate period , it decelerates driven by radiation and subsequently by matter .	Emerged gravitational dark energy mimics quintessence and its density falls by 115 orders from its initial value $ 2.58\times 10^ { 68 } { \rm GeV } ^4 $ to its current value $ 2.19\times 10^ { -47 } { \rm GeV } ^4 $ .
0	In this paper the essential theoretical predictions for the nuclear muonic radioactivity are presented by using a special fission-like model similar with that used in description of the pionic emission during fission .	Hence , a fission-like model for the muonic radioactivity takes into account the essential degree of freedom of the system : muon-fissility , muon-fission barrier height , etc .	Using this model it was shown that most of the SHE-nuclei lie in the region where the muonic fissility parameters attain their limiting value X=1 .	Hence , the SHE-region is characterized by the absence of a classical barrier toward spontaneous muon and pion emissions .	Numerical estimations on the yields for the natural muonic radioactivities of the transuranium elements as well numerical values for barrier heights are given only for even-even parent nuclei .
3	In addition , as an example of anharmonic system , the pure quartic oscillator is analyzed .	In a previous paper a formalism to analyze the dynamical evolution of classical and quantum probability distributions in terms of their moments was presented .	Here the application of this formalism to the system of a particle moving on a potential is considered in order to derive physical implications about the classical limit of a quantum system .	The complete set of harmonic potentials is considered , which includes the particle under a uniform force , as well as the harmonic and the inverse harmonic oscillators .	Classical and quantum moments corresponding to stationary states of these systems are analytically obtained without solving any differential equation .
0	We present results from ultraviolet and X-ray observations of the low mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2 .	The simultaneous HST/GHRS and ASCA observations took place during the low state of an 82-day cycle .	We compare our observations as well as archival IUE and RXTE data with models that predict ultraviolet and optical continuum emission from an X-ray heated disk and a Roche-lobe-filling star .	The model predictions are consistent with observed optical , ultraviolet , and X-ray variations over both orbital and long-term periods .	The X-ray spectral state , the luminosities implied by fits to the X-ray data , the ultraviolet continuum and line fluxes , and the mass accretion rates obtained from fits to the ultraviolet continuum are consistent with location of our observations on the normal and horizontal branches of the Z-shaped X-ray color-color diagram .
3	These are characterized by two constants only : the tension and spin magnitude .	The dynamics of brane-like extended objects in spacetimes with torsion is derived from the conservation equations of stress-energy and spin tensors .	Thus obtained world-sheet equations are applied to macroscopic test membranes made of spinning matter .	Specifically , we consider membranes with maximally symmetric distribution of stress-energy and spin .	By solving the world-sheet equations , we discover a similarity between such membranes in Riemann-Cartan backgrounds , and string theory membranes in low-energy string backgrounds .
1	A quantitative characterization of the mechanisms intertwining structure , chemistry and dynamics with the PDZ function represent a challenge in molecular biology .	PDZ domains are typical examples of binding motifs mediating the formation of protein-protein assemblies in many different cells .	Here we investigated the influence of native state topology on the thermodynamics and the dissociation kinetics for a complex PDZ-peptide via Molecular Dynamics simulations based on a coarse-grained description of PDZ domains .	Our native-centric approach neglects chemical details but incorporates the basic structural information to reproduce the protein functional dynamics as it couples to the binding .	We found that at physiological temperatures the unbinding of a peptide from the PDZ domain becomes increasingly diffusive rather than thermally activated , as a consequence of the significant reduction of the free energy barrier with temperature .
1	Over the past few decades , several theories of emotion have been proposed , each based around the existence of a set of 'basic emotions ' , and each supported by an extensive variety of research including studies in facial expression , ethology , neurology and physiology .	A plethora of words are used to describe the spectrum of human emotions , but how many emotions are there really , and how do they interact ?	Here we present research based on a theory that people transmit their understanding of emotions through the language they use surrounding emotion keywords .	Using a labelled corpus of over 21,000 tweets , six of the basic emotion sets proposed in existing literature were analysed using Latent Semantic Clustering ( LSC ) , evaluating the distinctiveness of the semantic meaning attached to the emotional label .	We hypothesise that the more distinct the language is used to express a certain emotion , then the more distinct the perception ( including proprioception ) of that emotion is , and thus more 'basic ' .
1	Spasmodic bipolar ejections , in changing directions have occurred over thousands of years to create KjPn 8 .	Narrow-band images of the core of the extraordinary poly-polar planetary nebula KjPn 8 have been obtained with the WFPC2 camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope .	The central star is finally revealed in these observations and its compact nebular core is resolved into a remarkably young , aprox .	500 years old , elliptical ring .	The highest speed bipolar outflows are perpendicular to this central ring which is identified as the latest event in the creation of this nebula .
0	We examine bipartite and multipartite correlations within the construct of unitary orbits .	We show that the set of product states is a very small subset of set of all possible states , while all unitary orbits contain classically correlated states .	Using this we give meaning to degeneration of quantum correlations due to a unitary interactions , which we call coherent correlations .	The remaining classical correlations are called incoherent correlations and quantified in terms of the distance of the joint probability distributions to its marginals .	Finally , we look at how entanglement looks in this picture for the two-qubit case .
2	We find that gw 's damp NS wobble on a timescale tau_ { theta } approx 2 x 10^5 yr [ 10^ { -7 } / ( DId/I_0 ) ] ^2 ( kHz/ nu_s ) ^4 , where nu_s is the spin frequency and DId is the piece of the NS 's inertia tensor that `` follows '' the crust 's principal axis ( as opposed to its spin axis ) .	We calculate the effect of gravitational wave ( gw ) back-reaction on realistic neutron stars ( NS 's ) undergoing torque-free precession .	By `realistic ' we mean that the NS is treated as a mostly-fluid body with an elastic crust , as opposed to a rigid body .	We give two different derivations of this result : one based solely on energy and angular momentum balance , and another obtained by adding the Burke-Thorne radiation reaction force to the Newtonian equations of motion .	This problem was treated long ago by Bertotti and Anile ( 1973 ) , but their claimed result is wrong .
4	The actual number of zeros calculated numerically for systems of finite size agrees fairly well with the analytical results .	We characterize the breaking of analyticity with respect to the replica number which occurs in random energy models via the complex zeros of the moment of the partition function .	We perturbatively evaluate the zeros in the vicinity of the transition point based on an exact expression of the moment of the partition function utilizing the steepest descent method , and examine an asymptotic form of the locus of the zeros as the system size tends to infinity .	The incident angle of this locus indicates that analyticity breaking is analogous to a phase transition of the second order .	We also evaluate the number of zeros utilizing the argument principle of complex analysis .
1	The metric g_ { ab } describes null hypersurfaces of the gravitational field while light moves on null hypersurfaces of the optical metric \bar { g } _ { ab } .	We introduce a linearized bi-metric theory of gravity with two metrics .	Bi-metrism naturally arises in vector-tensor theories with matter being non-minimally coupled to gravity via long-range vector field .	We derive explicit Lorentz-invariant solution for a light ray propagating in space-time of the bi-metric theory and disentangle relativistic effects associated with the two metrics .	This anlysis can be valuable for future spaceborne laser missions ASTROD and LATOR dedicated to map various relativistic gravity parameters in the solar system to unparalleled degree of accuracy .
4	This result highlights the ambiguity in interpreting VLBP data , and illustrates the importance of simulations in providing a framework for proper interpretation of such data .	Evidence that the magnetic fields of extragalactic jets have a significant fraction of their energy in a random component is briefly summarized , and a detailed model of evolving , jet polarization structures is constructed , based on this picture .	The evolving magnetic field structure of an oblique shock complex that forms in a relativistic jet simulation is explored by using velocity data from the hydrodynamical simulation to advect an initially random magnetic field distribution .	Radiative transfer calculations reveal that emission from a propagating region of magnetic field , `ordered ' by the shock , and lying approximately transverse to the flow direction , merges with that from an evolving sheared region at the flow periphery .	If such a flow were barely resolved , observation would suggest evolution from a somewhat oblique , to a more longitudinal , magnetic field structure with respect to the flow axis , while higher resolution observations would infer a component following a non-linear trajectory , and with a magnetic field orientation that rotates during evolution .
1	The subelliptic structure on SL ( 2 , R ) comes from the fibration $ SO ( 2 ) - & gt ; SL ( 2 , R ) - & gt ; H^2 $ and it can be lifted to its universal covering .	In this paper , we study a subelliptic heat kernel on the Lie group SL ( 2 , R ) and on its universal covering .	First , we derive an integral representation for these heat kernels .	These expressions allow us to obtain some asymptotics in small time of the heat kernels and give us a way to compute the subriemannian distances .	Then , we establish some gradient estimates and some functional inequalities like a Li-Yau type estimate and a reverse Poincar\'e inequality that are valid for both heat kernels .
0	We analyse 20 star cluster candidates projected mostly in the bulge direction ( $ |\ell| & lt ; 60^\circ $ ) .	The sample contains all candidates in that sector classified by \citet { FSRcat } with quality flags denoting high probability of being star clusters .	Bulge contamination in the colour-magnitude diagrams ( CMDs ) is in general important , while at lower Galactic latitudes disk stars contribute as well .	Properties of the candidates are investigated with 2MASS CMDs and stellar radial density profiles ( RDPs ) built with field star decontaminated photometry .	To uncover the nature of the structures we decontaminate the CMDs from field stars using tools that we previously developed to deal with objects in dense fields .
1	But how do we appropriately define availability ?	A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal , given its resource value .	Step-selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data , by matching each used step ( connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal ) with a set of available steps randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics .	Here we present a simple extension to this approach , termed integrated step-selection analysis ( iSSA ) , which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes ( i.e.velocities and their temporal autocorrelations ) are independent of resource selection .	Instead , iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource-selection parameters , thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model .
4	But sorted according to the weightings given to each link by the number of visit made by the particular user and the amount of time spent on the particular link .	Looking into the growth of information in the web it is a very tedious process of getting the exact information the user is looking for .	Many search engines generate user profile related data listing .	This paper involves one such process where the rating is given to the link that the user is clicking on .	Rather than avoiding the uninterested links both interested links and the uninterested links are listed .
3	However , this concept may not be valid , since the large data sets acquired in recent years do not show two distinct peaks in the CME velocity distribution and reveal that both fast and slow CMEs can be accompanied by both weak and strong flares .	Solar coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) show a large variety in their kinematic properties .	CMEs originating in active regions and accompanied by strong flares are usually faster and accelerated more impulsively than CMEs associated with filament eruptions outside active regions and weak flares .	It has been proposed more than two decades ago that there are two separate types of CMEs , fast ( impulsive ) CMEs and slow ( gradual ) CMEs .	We present numerical simulations which confirm our earlier analytical result that a flux-rope CME model permits describing fast and slow CMEs in a unified manner .
1	We study the relation between theta-antieigenvalue and centre of mass of a bounded linear operator and compute antieigenvalue using the relation .	We introduce the concept of theta-antieigenvalue and theta-antieigenvector of a bounded linear operator on complex Hilbert space .	This follows the notion of symmetric antieigenvalues introduced by Hossein et al.in \cite { 19 } .	We show that the concept of real antieigenvalue , imaginary antieigenvalue and symmetric antieigenvalue follows as a special case of theta-antieigenvalue .	We also show how the concept of total antieigenvalue is related to the $ \theta $ -antieigenvalue .
0	Some radio pulsars show clear drifting subpulses , in which subpulses are seen to drift in pulse longitude in a systematic pattern .	Here we examine how the drifting subpulses of PSR B0809+74 evolve with time and observing frequency .	We show that the subpulse period ( P3 ) is constant on timescales of days , months and years , and between 14-5100 MHz .	Despite this , the shapes of the driftbands change radically with frequency .	Previous studies have concluded that , while the subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly at low frequencies ( & lt ; 500 MHz ) , a discrete step of 180 degrees in subpulse phase is observed at higher frequencies ( & gt ; 820 MHz ) near to the peak of the average pulse profile .
4	The solution is constructed exactly .	We analyze the integrability properties of models defined on the symmetric space SU ( 2 ) /U ( 1 ) in 3+1 dimensions , using a recently proposed approach for integrable theories in any dimension .	We point out the key ingredients for a theory to possess an infinite number of local conservation laws , and discuss classes of models with such property .	We propose a 3+1-dimensional , relativistic invariant field theory possessing a toroidal soliton solution carrying a unit of topological charge given by the Hopf map .	Construction of the action is guided by the requirement that the energy of static configuration should be scale invariant .
2	This implies a relatively high spatial velocity and indicates that the star is unlikely to be re-heated by accretion of matter from the interstellar medium .	We obtained deep optical imaging of the thermally emitting X-ray bright and radio-quiet isolated neutron star RX J1605.3+3249 with the Subaru telescope in 1999 and 2003 .	Together with archival HST images acquired in 2001 these data reveal a proper motion of mu = 144.5 +/- 13.2 mas/yr .	Assuming that RX J1605.3+3249 is a young ( 10^5-10^6 yr ) cooling neutron star , its apparent trajectory is consistent with a birth in the nearby Sco OB2 OB association at a location close to that derived for RX J1856.5-3754 and perhaps also to that of RX J0720.4-3125 .	This suggests that the X-ray bright part of ROSAT-discovered isolated neutron stars is dominated by the production of the Sco OB2 complex which is the closest OB association and a part of the Gould belt .
0	The Prime Focus Spectrograph ( PFS ) is a major instrument under development for the 8.2 m Subaru telescope .	Four identical spectrograph modules are located in a room above one Nasmyth focus .	A 55~m fiber optic cable feeds light to the spectrographs from a robotic positioner at the prime focus , behind the wide-field corrector developed for Hyper Suprime-Cam .	The positioner contains 2400 fibers and covers a 1.3~degree hexagonal field of view .	The spectrograph optical design consists of a Schmidt collimator , two dichroic beamsplitters to split the light into three channels , and for each channel a volume phase holographic ( VPH ) grating and a dual-corrector , modified Schmidt reimaging camera .
1	These inequalities can show violations that grow exponentially with $ N $ , but we prove this is not the typical case .	We estimate the probability of random $ N $ -qudit pure states violating full-correlation Bell inequalities with two dichotomic observables per site .	For many-qubit states the probability to violate any of these inequalities by an amount that grows linearly with $ N $ is vanishingly small .	If each system 's Hilbert space dimension is larger than two , on the other hand , the probability of seeing \emph { any } violation is already small .	For the qubits case we discuss furthermore the consequences of this result for the probability of seeing arbitrary violations ( \emph i.e. , of any order of magnitude ) when experimental imperfections are considered .
3	We also find that the edge states are robust against the electronic correlations , resulting in edge effective spins which can flip almost freely .	A \pi-electron network in nanographite systems with zigzag edges exhibits strongly localized edge states , which are expected to have peculiar properties .	We study effects of electron-electron interactions on ground-state properties of the systems by means of the weak-coupling renormalization group and the density-matrix renormalization-group method .	It is shown that the ground state is a spin-singlet Mott insulator with finite charge and spin gaps .	The schematic picture for the low-energy physics of the systems is discussed .
0	The compact Abelian Higgs model is simulated on a cubic lattice where it possesses vortex lines and pointlike magnetic monopoles as topological defects .	The focus of this high-precision Monte Carlo study is on the vortex network , which is investigated by means of percolation observables .	In the region of the phase diagram where the Higgs and confinement phases are separated by a first-order transition , it is shown that the vortices percolate right at the phase boundary , and that the first-order nature of the transition is reflected by the network .	In the crossover region , where the phase boundary ceases to be first order , the vortices are shown to still percolate .	In contrast to other observables , the percolation observables show finite-size scaling .
3	The Higgs spectrum and couplings can be significantly modified compared to the MSSM ones , often allowing for interesting new decay modes .	We consider supersymmetric models that include particles beyond the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ( MSSM ) with masses in the TeV range , and that couple significantly to the MSSM Higgs sector .	We perform a model-independent analysis of the spectrum and couplings of the MSSM Higgs fields , based on an effective theory of the MSSM degrees of freedom .	The tree-level mass of the lightest CP-even state can easily be above the LEP bound of 114 GeV , thus allowing for a relatively light spectrum of superpartners , restricted only by direct searches .	We also observe that the gluon fusion production cross section of the SM-like Higgs can be enhanced with respect to both the Standard Model and the MSSM .
3	We state supporting evidence of the claim that 5 is a typical rank of $ 2\times2\times2\times2 $ real tensors .	We study an upper bound of ranks of $ n $ -tensors with size $ 2\times\cdots\times2 $ over the complex and real number field .	We characterize a $ 2\times 2\times 2 $ tensor with rank 3 by using the Cayley 's hyperdeterminant and some function .	Then we see another proof of Brylinski 's result that the maximal rank of $ 2\times2\times2\times2 $ complex tensors is 4 .	Recall that Kong and Jiang show that the maximal rank of $ 2\times2\times2\times2 $ real tensors is less than or equal to 5 .
1	The statistical properties of our sample are found to be in agreement with those from previous work in the literature .	We present a catalogue of MgII absorption systems obtained from high resolution UVES/VLT data of 77 QSOs in the redshift range 0.6 & lt ; z & lt ; 2.0 , and down to an equivalent width W_0 & gt ; 0.1 \AA .	However , we point out that the previously observed increase with redshift of dN/dz for weak absorbers , pertains exclusively to very weak absorbers with W_0 & lt ; 0.1 \AA .	Instead , dN/dz for absorbers with W_0 in the range 0.1-0.3 \AA actually decreases with redshift , similarly to the case of strong absorbers .	We then use this catalogue to extend our earlier analysis of the links between the Faraday Rotation Measure of the quasars and the presence of intervening MgII absorbing systems in their spectra .
1	We employ an estimator based on recurrence plots -- - the Correlation of Probability of Recurrence ( CPR ) -- - to analyze connections between nine stock indices spread worldwide .	Financial data has been extensively studied for correlations using Pearson 's cross-correlation coefficient { \rho } as the point of departure .	We suggest a slight modification of the CPR approach in order to get more robust results .	We examine trends in CPR for an approximately 19-month window moved along the time series and compare them to { \rho } .	Binning CPR into three levels of connectedness : strong , moderate and weak , we extract the trends in number of connections in each bin over time .
0	Graphene plasmonics is of great interest for compact optical devices working in broad frequency domains with ultrahigh speed and very low energy consumption .	However , graphene plasmons damp out quickly on most substrates mainly due to scattering loss from substrate surface phonons and impurities .	Here we discover a new hybridized plasmon-phonon polariton mode in graphene/h-BN van der Waals heterostructures , which enables ultralong hybrid plasmon lifetime up to 1.6 picosecond , the longest plasmon lifetime ever demonstrated .	Such remarkably long lifetime arises from the coupling of long-lifetime h-BN transverse optical phonon with graphene plasmons , which uniquely exists in monolayer heterostructures .	Our findings and understanding of this unexploited hybrid mode offer a novel approach to tune the plasmon behaviours in the frequency , time and space domains .
1	The action is not hermitian but causes no harm .	A free fermion without doubler is formulated on 1+D dimensional discrete Minkowski space-time .	In 1+3 dimensional massless case the equation describes a single species of Dirac particle in the continuous space-time limit .	In 1+1 dimensional massless case the equation is the same as the automaton equation by 't Hooft and describes a chiral fermion .	The time evolution operator is unitary and the norm is conserved .
2	One expects the mathematical behavior of almost commuting Hermitian matrices to depend on two factors .	The behavior of fermionic systems depends on the geometry of the system and the symmetry class of the Hamiltonian and observables .	Almost commuting matrices arise from band-projected position observables in such systems .	One factor will be the approximate polynomial relations satisfied by the matrices .	The other factor is what algebra the matrices are in , either the matrices over A for A the real numbers , A the complex numbers or A the algebra of quaternions .
3	We show that this length increases with the slope angle and jumps to a length comparable to the depth of the granular bed at an angle below the angle of repose .	By means of contact dynamics simulations , we analyze the stress state in a granular bed slowly tilted towards its angle of repose .	An increasingly large number of grains are overloaded in the sense that they are found to carry a stress ratio above the Coulomb yield threshold of the whole packing .	Using this property , we introduce a coarse-graining length scale at which all stress ratios are below the packing yield threshold .	This transition coincides with the onset of dilatation in the packing .
1	In this paper we study the relation between their construction and algebraic bundles on noncommutative projective spaces .	Recently N.Nekrasov and A.Schwarz proposed a modification of the ADHM construction of instantons which produces instantons on a noncommutative deformation of the 4-dimensional real affine space .	We exhibit one-to-one correspondences between three classes of objects : framed bundles on a noncommutative projective plane , certain complexes of sheaves on a noncommutative 3-dimensional projective space , and the modified ADHM data .	The modified ADHM construction itself is interpreted in terms of a noncommutative version of the twistor transform .	We also prove that the moduli space of framed bundles on the noncommutative projective plane has a natural hyperkahler metric and is isomorphic as a hyperkahler manifold to the moduli space of framed torsion free sheaves on the commutative projective plane .
1	As it is well known , the problem of MQT in a point-like JJ is reduced to the study of the under-barrier motion of a quantum particle in the washboard potential .	We study the phenomenon of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( MQT ) in a finite size Josephson junction ( JJ ) with an externally applied magnetic field .	In the case of a finite size JJ placed in magnetic field , this problem is considerably more complex since , besides the phase , the potential itself , depends on space variables .	We find the general expressions both for the crossover temperature $ T_ { 0 } $ between thermally activated and macroscopic quantum tunneling regimes and the escape time $ \tau_ { \mathrm { esc } } $ .	It turns out that in proximity of particular values of magnetic field the crossover temperature can vary non-monotonically .
3	By using $ Planck $ 2015 data only , we obtain the 95 % CL bound $ \gamma & lt ; 0.0017 $ for $ n=4 $ , which is further tightened to $ \gamma & lt ; 0.00075 $ by adding Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations ( BAO ) data .	We study induced gravity dark energy models coupled with a simple monomial potential $ \propto \sigma^n $ and a positive exponent $ n $ .	These simple potentials lead to viable dark energy models with a weak dependence on the exponent , which characterizes the accelerated expansion of the cosmological model in the asymptotic attractor , when ordinary matter becomes negligible .	We use recent cosmological data to constrain the coupling $ \gamma $ to the Ricci curvature , under the assumptions that the scalar field starts at rest deep in the radiation era and that the gravitational constant in the Einstein equations is compatible with the one measured in a Cavendish-like experiment .	This latter bound improves by $ \sim 30 $ % the limit obtained with the $ Planck $ 2013 data and the same compilation of BAO data .
1	In this paper , we use Young integration to study the integral of determinate functions $ \int_ { \mathbb R } f ( x ) { \mathscr L } ^H ( dx , t ) $ .	Let $ { \mathscr L } ^H ( x , t ) =2H\int_0^t\delta ( B^H_s-x ) s^ { 2H-1 } ds $ be the weighted local time of fractional Brownian motion $ B^H $ with Hurst index $ 1/2 & lt ; H & lt ; 1 $ .	As an application , we investigate the { \it weighted quadratic covariation } $ [ f ( B^H ) , B^H ] ^ { ( W ) } $ defined by $ $ [ f ( B^H ) , B^H ] ^ { ( W ) } _t : =\lim_ { n\to \infty } 2H\sum_ { k=0 } ^ { n-1 } k^ { 2H-1 } \ { f ( B^H_ { t_ { k+1 } } ) -f ( B^H_ { t_ { k } } ) \ } ( B^H_ { t_ { k+1 } } -B^H_ { t_ { k } } ) , $ $ where the limit is uniform in probability and $ t_k=kt/n $ .	We show that it exists and $ $ [ f ( B^H ) , B^H ] ^ { ( W ) } _t=-\int_ { \mathbb R } f ( x ) { \mathscr L } ^H ( dx , t ) , $ $ provided $ f $ is of bounded $ p $ -variation with $ 1\leq p & lt ; \frac { 2H } { 1-H } $ .	Moreover , we extend this result to the time-dependent case .
3	The leading supergraphs with two and four external lines are evaluated .	We develop the background field method for studying classical and quantum aspects of N=3 , d=3 Chern-Simons and matter theories in N=3 harmonic superspace .	As one of the immediate consequences , we prove a nonrenormalization theorem implying the ultra-violet finiteness of the corresponding supergraph perturbation theory .	We also derive the general hypermultiplet and gauge superfield propagators in a Chern-Simons background .	In contrast to the non-supersymmetric theory , the leading quantum correction to the massive charged hypermultiplet proves to be the super Yang-Mills action rather than the Chern-Simons one .
3	Based on a pre-selection of solar-twin candidates performed at medium resolution by Pasquini et al .	The rich open cluster M67 is known to have a chemical composition close to solar , and an age around 4Gyr .	It thus offers the opportunity to check our understanding of the physics and the evolution of solar-type stars in a cluster environment .	We present the first spectroscopic study at high resolution , R~50,000 , of the potentially best solar twin , M67-1194 , identified among solar-like stars in M67 .	( 2008 ) , we explore the chemical-abundance similarities and differences between M67-1194 and the Sun , using VLT/FLAMES-UVES .
1	However , the accurate calculation of the electron-phonon coupling constants is computationally expensive as it involves solving the Schrodinger equation for O ( N ) nuclear configurations , where N is the number of nuclei .	The coupling between electrons and phonons plays important roles in physics , chemistry and biology .	Herein we show that by considering the forces on the nuclei caused by the addition or subtraction of an arbitrarily small electronic charge one may calculate the electron-phonon coupling constants from O ( 1 ) solutions of the Schrodinger equation .	We show that Janak 's theorem means that this procedure is exact within the density functional formalism .	We demonstrate that the O ( 1 ) approach produces numerically accurate results by calculating the electron-phonon coupling constants for a series of molecules ranging in size from H_2 to C_60 .
3	Diffusion of the magnetic field and radiative heating and cooling are taken into account .	A three-dimensional numerical model for an accretion process investigation in the magnetosphere of a white dwarf in magnetic cataclysmic variables is developed .	The model assumes that the white dwarf has a dipole magnetic field with its symmetry axis inclined to the rotation axis .	The model is based on the equations of modified MHD , that describe the mean flow parameters in the wave MHD turbulence .	The suitability of the model is confirmed by modeling the accretion in a typical intermediate polar .
2	Joyce , Schoen and the author show that given any compact rigid Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian in $ \C^n $ , one can always find a family of Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians of the same type in any compact symplectic manifolds with a compatible metric .	Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians are Lagrangian submanifolds that are critical points of the volume functional under Hamiltonian deformations .	They can be considered as a generalization of special Lagrangians or Lagrangian and minimal submanifolds .	The advantage of this result is that it holds in very general classes .	But the disadvantage is that we do not know where these examples locate and examples in this family might be far apart .
4	Although there are concerns about possible foregrounds and non-Gaussian fluctuations , we believe that the existence of a peak at degree-scales is established by the data .	Fluctuations in the CMB have now been detected over a wide range of angular scales , and a consistent picture seems to be emerging .	The data can not currently constrain a large number of cosmological parameters , but it is clear that there is more information than just the normalization of the models .	Here we use the data to constrain a second parameter , namely the amplitude of the Doppler peak , using a phenomenological approach to the power spectrum .	We find that the data prefer a peak of height ~3 , with a purely flat spectrum ruled out at the 95 % CL .
1	A stretch-affected nonlinear and nonlocal equation , derived from an inhomogeneous Michelson-Sivashinsky equation , is used as a starting point , and pole decompositions are used as a tool .	Localized wrinkles of thin premixed flames subject to hydrodynamic instability and geometrical stretch of uniform intensity ( S ) are studied .	Analytical and numerical descriptions of isolated ( centered or multicrested ) wrinkles with steady shapes ( in a frame ) and various amplitudes are provided ; their number increases rapidly with 1/S & gt ; 0 .	A large constantS & gt ; 0 weakens or suppresses all localized wrinkles ( the larger the wrinkles , the easier the suppression ) , whereasS & lt ; 0 strengthens them ; oscillations of S further restrict their existence domain .	Self-similar evolutions of unstable many-crested patterns are obtained .
2	IR luminosities , stellar masses and star formation rates ( SFRs ) are determined for supercluster members via spectral energy distribution fitting and the Kennicutt relation .	We determine the galaxy infrared ( IR ) luminosity function ( LF ) as a function of the environment in a supercluster at z=0.23 , using optical , near-IR , and mid- to far-IR photometry , as well as redshifts from optical spectroscopy .	We identify 467 supercluster members in a sample of 24-micron-selected galaxies , on the basis of their spectroscopic ( 153 ) and photometric ( 314 ) redshifts .	Galaxies with active galactic nuclei are excluded from the sample .	We determine the IR LF of the whole supercluster as well as the IR LFs of three different regions in the supercluster : the cluster core , a large-scale filament , and the cluster outskirts ( excluding the filament ) .
1	We interpret this limit in the context of Inverse Compton emission from upscattered optical photons by the supernova shock and constrain the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of the stellar progenitor system to be & lt ; 10^ { -9 } M_sun yr-1 ( for wind velocity v_w=100 km/s ) .	Deep X-ray observations of the post-explosion environment around the very nearby Type Ia SN\,2014J ( Dl=3.5 Mpc ) reveal no X-ray emission down to a luminosity L & lt ; 7x10^ { 36 } erg/s ( 0.3-10 keV ) at t~20 days after the explosion .	Alternatively , the SN shock might be expanding into a uniform medium with density $ n_CSM & lt ; 3 cm-3 .	These results rule out single-degenerate ( SD ) systems with steady mass-loss until the terminal explosion and constrain the fraction of transferred material lost at the outer Lagrangian point to be & lt ; 1 % .	The allowed progenitors are ( i ) WD-WD progenitors , ( ii ) SD systems with unstable hydrogen burning experiencing recurrent nova eruptions with recurrence time t & lt ; 300 yrs and ( iii ) stars where the mass loss ceases before the explosion .
1	When an entire population can not be immunized and the effect of immunization is not perfect , we need the targeted immunization with immunization rate .	We investigate the spread of diseases , computer viruses or information on complex networks and also immunization strategies to prevent or control the spread .	Under such a circumstance we calculate epidemic thresholds for the SIR and SIS epidemic models .	It is shown that , in scale-free networks , the targeted immunization is effective only if the immunization rate is equal to one .	We analyze here epidemic spreading on directed complex networks , but similar results are also valid for undirected ones .
2	None was detected in the four short-wavelength IRAC bands , but all four were clearly imaged at 24 microns , and two at 70 microns .	We present first results from an extensive survey of Magellanic Clouds supernova remnants ( SNRs ) with the Spitzer Space Telescope .	We describe IRAC and MIPS imaging observations at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8 , 24 , and 70 microns of four Balmer-dominated Type Ia SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) : DEM L71 ( 0505-67.9 ) , 0509 -- 67.5 , 0519 -- 69.0 , and 0548-70.4 .	A comparison of these images to Chandra broadband X-ray images shows a clear association with the blast wave , and not with internal X-ray emission associated with ejecta .	Our observations are well described by 1-D shock models of collisionally heated dust emission , including grain size distributions appropriate for the LMC , grain heating by collisions with both ions and electrons , and sputtering of small grains .
4	This algorithm , and the accompanying software tool , advances state-of-the-art in quantum CAD methodologies and methods while considering key characteristics and constraints of the ion-trap quantum circuit fabric .	Quantum computers are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts in terms of solving some specific , but important problems .	The biggest challenge in realizing a quantum computing system is the environmental noise .	One way to decrease the effect of noise ( and hence , reduce the overhead of building fault tolerant quantum circuits ) is to reduce the latency of the quantum circuit that runs on a quantum circuit .	In this paper , a novel algorithm is presented for scheduling , placement , and routing of a quantum algorithm , which is to be realized on a target quantum circuit fabric technology .
4	By investigating the long time evolution of the soliton train solving the 1D GPE with three-body dissipation we find that adjacent solitons repel each other due to their phase difference .	We study the formation of bright solitons in a Bose-Einstein condensate of $ ^7 $ Li atoms induced by a sudden change in the sign of the scattering length from positive to negative , as reported in a recent experiment ( Nature { \bf 417 } , 150 ( 2002 ) ) .	The numerical simulations are performed by using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation ( GPE ) with a dissipative three-body term .	We show that a number of bright solitons is produced and this can be interpreted in terms of the modulational instability of the time-dependent macroscopic wave function of the Bose condensate .	In particular , we derive a simple formula for the number of solitons that is in good agreement with the numerical results of 3D GPE .
2	These lines arise from energy levels between ~400 K and ~1950 K above the ground state , and are observed in absorption against the HC-HII region associated with NGC7538 IRS1 .	To constrain theoretical models of high-mass star formation , observational signatures of mass accretion in O-type forming stars are desirable .	Using the JVLA , we have mapped the hot and dense molecular gas in the hot core NGC7538 IRS1 , with 0.2 '' angular resolution , in seven metastable ( J=K ) inversion transitions of ammonia : ( J , K ) = ( 6,6 ) , ( 7,7 ) , ( 9,9 ) , ( 10,10 ) , ( 12,12 ) , ( 13,13 ) , and ( 14,14 ) .	With a 500 AU linear resolution , we resolve the elongated North-South ammonia structure into two compact components : the main core and a southernmost component .	Previous observations of the radio continuum with a 0.08 '' ( or 200 AU ) resolution , resolved in turn the compact core in two ( northern and southern ) components .
3	However , the generalized extreme value distribution might not be a suitable model when each observed maximum does not come from a large number of observations .	The generalized extreme value distribution and its particular case , the Gumbel extreme value distribution , are widely applied for extreme value analysis .	The Gumbel distribution has certain drawbacks because it is a non-heavy-tailed distribution and is characterized by constant skewness and kurtosis .	The generalized extreme value distribution is frequently used in this context because it encompasses the three possible limiting distributions for a normalized maximum of infinite samples of independent and identically distributed observations .	Hence , other forms of generalizations of the Gumbel distribution might be preferable .
4	The spectrum of this operator was completely determined by Prellberg .	We consider several statistical models defined on the Farey fractions .	Two of these models may be regarded as `` spin chains '' , with long-range interactions , while another arises in the study of multifractals associated with chaotic maps exhibiting intermittency .	We prove that these models all have the same free energy .	Their thermodynamic behavior is determined by the spectrum of the transfer operator ( Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius operator ) , which is defined using the maps ( presentation functions ) generating the Farey `` tree '' .
0	We investigate evolution of star clusters in external tidal field by means of $ N $ -body simulations .	We followed seven sets of cluster models whose central concentration and strength of the tidal field are different .	We found that the mass loss timescale due to escape of stars , $ t_ { mloss } $ , and its dependence on the two-body relaxation timescale , $ t_ { rh , i } $ , are determined by the strength of the tidal field .	The logarithmic slope [ $ = dln ( t_ { mloss } ) /dln ( t_ { rh , i } ) $ ] approaches to near unity for the cluster models in weaker tidal field .	The timescale and the dependence are almost independent of the central concentration for clusters in the tidal field of the same strength .
0	Scientific analyses commonly compose multiple single-process programs into a dataflow .	An end-to-end dataflow of single-process programs is known as a many-task application .	Typically , tools from the HPC software stack are used to parallelize these analyses .	In this work , we investigate an alternate approach that uses Apache Spark -- a modern big data platform -- to parallelize many-task applications .	We present Kira , a flexible and distributed astronomy image processing toolkit using Apache Spark .
0	We study structure and dynamics of the turbulent photospheric magnetic field in the active region NOAA 11158 by characterizing the spatial and temporal scaling properties of the line-of-sight ( LOS ) component .	Using high-resolution high-cadence LOS magnetograms from SDO/HMI , we measured power-law exponents $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ describing wavenumber- ( $ k $ ) and frequency-domain ( $ f $ ) Fourier power spectra , respectively , and investigated their evolution during the passage of the active region through the field of view of HMI .	Flaring active region NOAA 11158 produces an average one-dimensional spatial power spectral density that follows approximately a $ k^ { -2 } $ power law -- a spectrum that suggests parallel MHD fluctuations in an anisotropic turbulent medium .	In addition , we found that values of $ \alpha $ capture systematic changes in the configuration of LOS photospheric magnetic field during flaring activity in the corona .	Position-dependent values of the temporal scaling exponent $ \beta $ showed that , on average , the core of the active region scales with $ \beta & gt ; $ 3 surrounded by a diffusive region with an approximately $ f^ { -2 } $ -type spectrum .
2	The effectiveness of the measure is illustrated in the example of the Ising chain in a homogeneous tilted magnetic field .	We propose a phase-space Wigner harmonics entropy measure for many-body quantum dynamical complexity .	This measure , which reduces to the well known measure of complexity in classical systems and which is valid for both pure and mixed states in single-particle and many-body systems , takes into account the combined role of chaos and entanglement in the realm of quantum mechanics .	We provide numerical evidence that the multipartite entanglement generation leads to a linear increase of entropy until saturation in both integrable and chaotic regimes , so that in both cases the number of harmonics of the Wigner function grows exponentially with time .	The entropy growth rate can be used to detect quantum phase transitions .
2	In this paper , method to estimate the number of wind turbine towers that would be buckled by hurricanes is discussed .	Wind is one of the important reasonable resources .	However , wind turbine towers are sure to be threatened by hurricanes .	Monte Carlo simulations show that our method is much better than the previous one .	Since in our method , the probability density function of the buckling probability of a single turbine tower in a single hurricane is obtained accurately but not from one approximated expression .
2	Potential systematic uncertainties related to the determination of peculiar velocities in the Zone of Avoidance are discussed in some detail .	Deep J , H and Ks photometry of the low Galactic latitude Norma cluster has been obtained with the 1.4-m Infrared Survey Facility ( IRSF ) and with SOFI on the NTT .	Together with spectroscopy taken at the Anglo-Australian Observatory using 2dF , the near-infrared Fundamental Plane of the Norma cluster will be used to determine the distance to this cluster and to assess its location within the Great Attractor overdensity .	In particular the effects ( uncertainties , systematics and scatter ) of extinction and star-crowding on the derived magnitudes at low latitudes are investigated in great detail .	We present a first look at the emerging Ks-band Fundamental Plane of the Norma cluster .
1	Instead of observing multiple micro-lensing events in a single system , we combine single epoch X-ray snapshots of ten quadruple systems , and compare the measured relative magnifications for the images with those computed from macro-models .	We measure the stellar mass surface densities of early type galaxies by observing the micro-lensing of macro-lensed quasars caused by individual stars , including stellar remnants , brown dwarfs and red dwarfs too faint to produce photometric or spectroscopic signatures .	We use these to normalize a stellar mass fundamental plane constructed using a Salpeter IMF with a low mass cutoff of 0.1 solar mass and treat the zeropoint of the surface mass density as a free parameter .	Our method measures the graininess of the gravitational potential produced by individual stars , in contrast to methods that decompose a smooth total gravitational potential into two smooth components , one stellar and one dark .	We find the median likelihood value for the normalization factor F by which the Salpeter stellar masses must be multiplied is 1.23 , with a one sigma confidence range , dominated by small number statistics , of 0.77 & lt ; F & lt ; 2.10
1	These changes are connected with the Doppler effect and aberration and exhibit a strong spectral and spatial dependence .	In this work we consider the changes of the SZ cluster brightness , flux and number counts induced by the motion of the Solar System with respect to the frame defined by the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) .	The correction to the SZ cluster brightness and flux has an amplitude and spectral dependence , which is similar to the first order cluster peculiar velocity correction to the thermal SZ effect .	Due to the change in the received cluster CMB flux the motion of the Solar System induces a dipolar asymmetry in the observed number of clusters above a given flux level .	Similar effects were discussed for $ \gamma $ -ray bursts and radio galaxies , but here , due to the very peculiar frequency-dependence of the thermal SZ effect , the number of observed clusters in one direction of the sky can be both , decreased or increased depending on the frequency band .
4	We make use of recently developed on-shell methods for evaluating coefficients of loop integrals , in particular a discrete Fourier projection as a means of improving numerical stability .	We describe BlackHat , an automated C++ program for calculating one-loop amplitudes , and the techniques used in its construction .	These include the unitarity method and on-shell recursion .	The other ingredients are compact analytic formulae for tree amplitudes for four-dimensional helicity states .	The program computes amplitudes numerically , using analytic formulae only for the tree amplitudes , the starting point for the recursion , and the loop integrals .
2	We find a transition to an ordered state of the same symmetry as that seen in the experiments , but the clear phase separation observed in the vibrated system is absent .	Recent experimental and computational studies of vibrated thin layers of identical spheres have shown transitions to ordered phases similar to those seen in equilibrium systems .	Motivated by these results , we carry out simulations of hard inelastic spheres forced by homogenous white noise .	Simulations of purely elastic spheres also show no evidence for phase separation .	We show that the energy injection in the vibrated system is dramatically different in the different phases , and suggest that this creates an effective surface tension not present in the equilibrium or randomly forced systems .
0	In this paper , we present a new semantics to check file safety of multithreaded programs .	A file-safe program is one that reaches a final configuration under the proposed semantics .	We extend the While language with file operations and multi-threading commands , and call the new language whilef .	This paper shows that the file safety is an un-decidable property for whilef .	The file safety becomes a decidable property in a special case shown in this paper .
4	The study is based on the first hydro-simulations of cluster formation for diferent models of dark energy .	Clusters are potentially powerful tools for cosmology provided their observed properties such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ( SZ ) or X-ray signals can be translated into physical quantities like mass and temperature .	Scaling relations are the appropriate mean to perform this translation .	It is therefore , important to understand their evolution and their modifications with respect to the physics and to the underlying cosmology .	In this spirit , we investigate the effect of dark energy on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations .
3	This , folded with thermal momentum distributions for the scattering partners , suggests a mean dissociation lifetime $ \simeq $ 20 fm/c .	Production of J/ $ \psi $ from nucleus-nucleus reactions depends sensitively on the dissociation cross section with light hadrons .	Effective lagrangian methods are used to describe the hadronic degrees of freedom , including strangeness and charm .	Cross sections with pions , rho mesons , kaons and nucleons having magnitudes 4 -- 8 mb are found , and with steep thresholds .	Therefore , the `` abnormal '' J/ $ \psi $ suppression seen in recent Pb+Pb experiments seems to owe to expected hadron kinetics .
4	Instead , the frequency distribution , averaged over each packing-fraction interval $ \Delta \phi $ , grows exponentially with increasing $ \phi $ .	Relative frequencies of mechanically stable ( MS ) packings of frictionless bidisperse disks are studied numerically in small systems .	The packings are created by successively compressing or decompressing a system of soft purely repulsive disks , followed by energy minimization , until only infinitesimal particle overlaps remain .	For systems of up to 14 particles most of the MS packings were generated .	We find that the packings are not equally probable as has been assumed in recent thermodynamic descriptions of granular systems .
3	Very little information exists on this subject at the moment , especially for varying hydrological conditions .	From July-December 2004 the experimental campaign 'Bray 2004 ' was conducted in the coniferous forest of Les Landes near Bordeaux , France , using a multi-angle L-band ( 1.4 GHz ) radiometer to measure upwelling radiation above the forest .	At the same time , ground measurements were taken of soil and litter moisture content .	This experiment was done in the context of the upcoming SMOS mission in order to improve our understanding of the behaviour of the L-band signal above forested areas .	Furthermore , additional measurements were done at the University of Bordeaux ( PIOM laboratory ) to determine the dielectric behaviour of a litter layer such as that found at the Bray site .
1	This is a very important task to be completed , in particular to test whether it is indeed the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model ( SM ) .	After the discovery of a Higgs boson in 2012 at the CERN Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) the detailed study of its properties , and most importantly its couplings to other particles , has started .	The precise study of the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons is of particular importance and requires as much information as possible .	In this view this paper provides the next-to-leading order ( NLO ) QCD corrections to the production cross sections and differential distributions of a SM Higgs boson in association with a pair of weak bosons $ W^+W^- $ , $ W^\pm Z $ and $ ZZ $ , matched with parton shower ( PS ) in the POWHEG-BOX framework .	The NLO QCD corrections are found to be significant and PS effects are sizable at low $ p_T $ in the jet differential distributions , as expected , while these effects are negligible in other distributions .
3	The case $ \omega=0 $ is related to the renormalisation group transformation of a recently introduced graph with a fat-tail edge-length distribution .	A coagulation process is studied in a set of random masses , in which two randomly chosen masses and the smallest mass of the set multiplied by some fixed parameter $ \omega\in [ -1,1 ] $ are iteratively added .	Besides masses ( or primary variables ) , secondary variables are also considered that are correlated with primary variables and coagulate according to the above rule with $ \omega=0 $ .	This process interpolates between known statistical physical models : The case $ \omega=-1 $ corresponds to the strong disorder renormalisation group transformation of certain disordered quantum spin chains whereas $ \omega=1 $ describes coarsening in the one-dimensional Glauber-Ising model .	In the intermediate range $ -1 & lt ; \omega & lt ; 1 $ , the exponents $ \alpha_ { \omega } $ and $ \beta_ { \omega } $ that characterise the growth of the primary and secondary variable , respectively , are accurately estimated by analysing the differential equations describing the process in the continuum formulation .
1	In the large N limit , each theory appearing in the flow is holographically dual to M-theory on AdS4 times a toric Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifold .	We study renormalization group flows among three dimensional superconformal gauge theories which closely resemble the renowned Klebanov-Witten flow in four dimensions .	The theories are obtained through the so-called flavoring method , which adds some fundamental matter fields to the dimensionally reduced Klebanov-Witten theories .	We reconfirm the matching between the gauge theories and the dual geometries by comparing the chiral ring structure .	As a more refined test of the flows , we compute the three-sphere partition function of the gauge theories .
3	The parameters of these two components change in correlation with the position of the source in the color-color diagram .	Based on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data , we discuss the classification of the soft X-ray transient Aquila X-1 in the Z/atoll scheme , and the relation of its kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations ( kHz QPO ) properties to the X-ray colors .	The color-color diagram shows one elongated ( `` banana '' ) structure and several `` islands '' of data points .	The power spectra of the island are best represented by a broken power-law , whereas those of the banana by a power-law below ~ 1 Hz plus an exponentially cut-off component at intermediate frequencies ( 30-60 Hz ) .	Based on the pattern that the source shows in the color-color diagram and its aperiodic variability we conclude that Aquila X-1 is an atoll source .
0	In this paper we describe a new approach to data modelling called the concept-oriented model ( CoM ) .	This model is based on the formalism of nested ordered sets which uses inclusion relation to produce hierarchical structure of sets and ordering relation to produce multi-dimensional structure among its elements .	Nested ordered set is defined as an ordered set where an each element can be itself an ordered set .	Ordering relation in CoM is used to define data semantics and operations with data such as projection and de-projection .	This data model can be applied to very different problems and the paper describes some its uses such grouping with aggregation and multi-dimensional analysis .
3	We refer to the resulting convective instability as the magnetothermal instability ( MTI ) .	In dilute astrophysical plasmas , thermal conduction is primarily along magnetic field lines , and therefore highly anisotropic .	As a result , the usual convective stability criterion is modified from a condition on entropy to a condition on temperature .	For small magnetic fields or small wavenumbers , instability occurs in any atmosphere where the temperature and pressure gradients point in the same direction .	We present fully three-dimensional simulations of the MTI and show that saturation results in an atmosphere with different vertical structure , dependent upon the boundary conditions .
4	The proof uses a theory of convergence of stochastic integrals developed by Kurtz and Protter .	We study a class of systems of stochastic differential equations describing diffusive phenomena .	The Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation is used to describe their dynamics in the small mass limit .	Our systems have arbitrary state-dependent friction and noise coefficients .	We identify the limiting equation and , in particular , the additional drift term that appears in the limit is expressed in terms of the solution to a Lyapunov matrix equation .
1	We have realized an experiment in which a superconducting two-level system , playing the role of an artificial atom , is strongly coupled to a single photon stored in an on-chip cavity .	Under appropriate conditions , superconducting electronic circuits behave quantum mechanically , with properties that can be designed and controlled at will .	We show that the atom-photon coupling in this circuit can be made strong enough for coherent effects to dominate over dissipation , even in a solid state environment .	This new regime of matter light interaction in a circuit can be exploited for quantum information processing and quantum communication .	It may also lead to new approaches for single photon generation and detection .
1	Field-effect transistors with sputtered SrTiO $ _3 $ and copper-phthalocyanine ( CuPc ) as semiconducting layer were fabricated .	The use of SrTiO $ _3 $ dielectrics as high-permittivity insulator in organic thin film field effect transistors ( FET ) is evaluated .	The device preparation was performed in-situ in an ultra high vacuum chamber system .	The dielectric in the transistors had a permittivity of up to 200 which led to low driving voltages of 3 V. The field effect transistors were p-type and reached mobilities of about $ \mu = 1.5\times 10^ { -3 } $ cm $ ^2 $ /Vs and an on/off ratio of $ 10^3 $ .	These properties are compared to devices based on other dielectric materials .
2	We notice that the bursts can be divided into three groups : big photospheric radius expansion ( PRE ) bursts are about ten times more luminous than medium bursts , while the latter are about ten times more luminous than small bursts .	We use the 2011 Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) proportional counter array ( PCA ) data of the 401 Hz accreting pulsar and burster IGR J17498-2921 to perform timing analysis and time-resolved spectroscopy of 12 thermonuclear X-ray bursts .	We confirm previously reported burst oscillations from this source with a much higher significance ( 8.8\sigma ) .	The PCA field-of-view of these observations contains several known bursters , and hence some of the observed bursts might not be from IGR J17498-2921 .	The oscillations during big bursts at the known pulsar frequency show that these bursts were definitely from IGR J17498-2921 .
1	Moreover , automatic timing devices , based on RFID technology , have become cheaper .	A manually time-measuring tool in mass sporting competitions can not be imagined nowadays because many modern disciplines , such as IronMan , take a long time and , therefore , demand additional reliability .	However , these devices can not operate stand-alone because they need a computer measuring system that is capable of processing the incoming events , encoding the results , assigning them to the correct competitor , sorting the results according to the achieved times , and then providing a printout of the results .	In this article , the domain-specific language EasyTime is presented , which enables the controlling of an agent by writing the events in a database .	In particular , we are focused on the implementation of EasyTime with a LISA tool that enables the automatic construction of compilers from language specifications using Attribute Grammars .
4	For arbitrary `` regular '' point the same technique results in AKSZ ( Alexandrov , Kontsevich , Schwarz , Zaboronsky ) version of Chern-Simons theory ( BF theory ) in accord with [ 2,3 ] .	The general procedure for obtaining explicit expressions for all cohomologies of N.Berkovits 's operator is suggested .	It is demonstrated that calculation of BV integral for the classical Chern-Simons-like theory ( Witten 's OSFT-like theory ) reproduces BV version of two dimensional gauge model at the level of effective action .	This model contains gauge field , scalars , fermions and some other fields .	We prove that this model is an example of `` singular '' point from the perspective of the suggested method for cohomology evaluation .
3	By preserving both global and local data structure , XIM combines the virtues of classical and advanced recent embedding methods .	In this paper , we present a novel computational framework for nonlinear dimensionality reduction which is specifically suited to process large data sets : the Exploratory Inspection Machine ( XIM ) .	XIM introduces a conceptual cross-link between hitherto separate domains of machine learning , namely topographic vector quantization and divergence-based neighbor embedding approaches .	There are three ways to conceptualize XIM , namely ( i ) as the inversion of the Exploratory Observation Machine ( XOM ) and its variants , such as Neighbor Embedding XOM ( NE-XOM ) , ( ii ) as a powerful optimization scheme for divergence-based neighbor embedding cost functions inspired by Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ( SNE ) and its variants , such as t-distributed SNE ( t-SNE ) , and ( iii ) as an extension of topographic vector quantization methods , such as the Self-Organizing Map ( SOM ) .	It permits direct visualization of large data collections without the need for prior data reduction .
3	Depending on the interaction strengths , topological quantum anomalous/spin Hall , charge nematic , and nematic-spin-nematic phases , develop separately .	We show that topological states are often developed in two dimensional semimetals with quadratic band crossing points ( BCPs ) by electron-electron interactions .	To illustrate this , we construct a concrete model with the BCP on an extended Lieb lattice and investigate the interaction-driven topological instabilities .	We find that the BCP is marginally unstable against infinitesimal repulsions .	Possible physical realizations of quadratic BCPs are provided .
2	In the limit of a large , dense network , however , we show that these dynamics coincide .	We study binary state dynamics on a network where each node acts in response to the average state of its neighborhood .	Allowing varying amounts of stochasticity in both the network and node responses , we find different outcomes in random and deterministic versions of the model .	We construct a general mean field theory for random networks and show this predicts that the dynamics on the network are a smoothed version of the average response function dynamics .	Thus , the behavior of the system can range from steady state to chaotic depending on the response functions , network connectivity , and update synchronicity .
0	The current status of leptonic jet models for gamma-ray blazars is reviewed .	Differences between the quasar and BL-Lac subclasses of blazars may be understood in terms of the dominance of different radiation mechanisms in the gamma-ray regime .	Spectral variability patterns of different blazar subclasses appear to be significantly different and require different intrinsic mechanisms causing gamma-ray flares .	As examples , recent results of long-term multiwavelength monitoring of PKS 0528+134 and Mrk 501 are interpreted in the framework of leptonic jet models .	A simple quasi-analytic toy model for broadband spectral variability of blazars is presented .
2	Together these results confirm the Einstein Equivalence Principle which underlies the concept that gravitation is synonymous with spacetime geometry , and must be described by a metric theory .	We review the experimental evidence for Einstein 's special and general relativity .	A variety of high precision null experiments verify the weak equivalence principle and local Lorentz invariance , while gravitational redshift and other clock experiments support local position invariance .	Solar system experiments that test the weak-field , post-Newtonian limit of metric theories strongly favor general relativity .	The Binary Pulsar provides tests of gravitational-wave damping and of strong-field general relativity .
2	A twisted virtual birack is an algebraic structure with axioms derived from the twisted virtual Reidemeister moves .	A virtual link can be understood as a link in a trivial I-bundle over an orientable compact surface with genus .	A twisted virtual link is a link in a trivial I-bundle over a not-necessarily orientable compact surface .	We extend a method previously used with racks and biracks to the twisted case to define computable invariants of twisted virtual links using finite twisted virtual biracks with birack rank $ N\ge 1 $ .	As an application , we classify twist structures on the virtual Hopf link .
4	In this paper , we propose a novel multi-label learning method `` Structured Decomposition + Group Sparsity ( SDGS ) '' .	In multi-label learning , each sample is associated with several labels .	Existing works indicate that exploring correlations between labels improve the prediction performance .	However , embedding the label correlations into the training process significantly increases the problem size .	Moreover , the mapping of the label structure in the feature space is not clear .
3	We find that this dissipative system has the ability to flow as a perfect fluid even though its entropy density does not match the equilibrium form .	In this paper we obtain an analytical solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation under the relaxation time approximation that describes the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a radially expanding massless gas .	This solution is found by mapping this expanding system in flat spacetime to a static flow in the curved spacetime $ \mathrm { AdS } _ { 2 } \otimes \mathrm { S } _ { 2 } $ .	We further derive explicit analytic expressions for the momentum dependence of the single particle distribution function as well as for the spatial dependence of its moments .	The non-equilibrium contribution to the entropy density is shown to be due to higher order scalar moments ( which possess no hydrodynamical interpretation ) of the Boltzmann equation that can remain out of equilibrium but do not couple to the energy-momentum tensor of the system .
4	It proposes pattern growth mining paradigm based FP-tree growth algorithm , which employs a tree structure to compress the database .	Data mining has been widely recognized as a powerful tool to explore added value from large-scale databases .	Finding frequent item sets in databases is a crucial in data mining process of extracting association rules .	Many algorithms were developed to find the frequent item sets .	This paper presents a summary and a comparative study of the available FP-growth algorithm variations produced for mining frequent item sets showing their capabilities and efficiency in terms of time and memory consumption on association rule mining by taking application of specific information into account .
1	While the capacity of this channel is known , it is not clear how to construct optimal coding schemes that achieve this capacity .	The problem of sending a secret message over the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) wiretap channel is studied .	In this work we show how to use linear operations along with successive interference cancellation in order to reduce the problem to that of designing optimal codes for the single-antenna additive-noise Gaussian wiretap channel .	Much like popular communication techniques in the absence of an eavesdropper , the data is carried over parallel streams .	The derivation of the schemes is based upon joint triangularization of channel matrices .
4	For Dirac semimetal or Weyl semimetal with time-reversal symmetry , a combination effect of a pair of Weyl nodes and its time-reversal counterpart leads to a discrete value of phase shift of $ \pm 1/8 $ or $ \pm 5/8 $ .	Berry phase physics is closely related to a number of topological states of matter .	Recently discovered topological semimetals are believed to host a nontrivial $ \pi $ Berry phase , which is thought to induce a phase shift of $ \pm 1/8 $ in the quantum oscillation ( $ + $ for hole and $ - $ for electron carriers ) .	We theoretically study the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation of topological Weyl and Dirac semimetals , taking into account their topological nature and inter-Landau band scattering .	For Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry , the phase shift can change smoothly but non-monotonically from $ \pm 1/8 $ near the Weyl nodes to $ \pm 5/8 $ at higher Fermi energies .
4	UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic characterization reveals the formation of only H-type aggregates of R6G in their aqueous solution and both H and J-type aggregates in PAH/SDS/R6G complex LbL films as well as the kinetics of adsorption of R6G onto the complex films .	Fabrication of complex molecular films of organic materials is one of the most important issues in modern nanoscience and nanotechnology .	Soft materials with flexible properties have been given much attention and can be obtained through bottom up processing from functional molecules , where self-assembly based on supramolecular chemistry and designed assembly have become crucial processes and technologies .	In this short communication , we report the successful incorporation of cationic laser dye Rhodamine 6G abbreviated as R6G into the pre-assembled polyelectrolyte/Surfactant complex film onto quartz substrate by electrostatic adsorption technique .	Poly ( allylamine hydrochloride ) ( PAH ) was used as polycation and Sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) was used as anionic surfactant .
1	Here we introduce one single straight forward definition of a general geometric Fourier transform covering most versions in the literature .	The increasing demand for Fourier transforms on geometric algebras has resulted in a large variety .	We show which constraints are additionally necessary to obtain certain features like linearity or a shift theorem .	As a result , we provide guidelines for the target-oriented design of yet unconsidered transforms that fulfill requirements in a specific application context .	Furthermore , the standard theorems do not need to be shown in a slightly different form every time a new geometric Fourier transform is developed since they are proved here once and for all .
4	Fits to $ B\to D^ { ( * ) } \tau\nu $ data require couplings of the new Higgs doublet to down-type quarks , opening the door to many highly constrained flavor-changing neutral current ( FCNC ) processes .	There are indications of a possible breakdown of the standard model , suggesting that $ \tau $ lepton interactions violate flavor universality .	BABAR , Belle and LHCb report high ratios of $ B\to D^ { ( * ) } \tau\nu $ .	There are long-standing excesses in $ B\to\tau\nu $ and $ W\to\tau\nu $ decays , and a deficit in inclusive $ \tau $ to strange decays .	We investigate whether two Higgs doublet models with the most general allowed couplings to quarks , and a large coupling to $ \tau $ leptons , can explain these anomalies while respecting other flavor constraints and technical naturalness .
4	A strong correlation is found , however , between the H-alpha+ [ NII ] luminosity and the optical luminosity within the region occupied by the ionized gas , which suggests hot ( post-AGB and/or blue HB ) stars within the old stellar population being a dominant source of ionization of the gas .	Results from IRAS and recent X-ray and optical surveys are reviewed to discuss the properties and nature of the interstellar medium in elliptical galaxies .	As to the dust component , there is a strong contrast with the situation among spiral galaxies in that masses of dust in ellipticals as derived from optical extinction are an order of magnitude LOWER than those derived from IRAS data .	This dilemma can be resolved by assuming an extra , extended , diffusely distributed component of dust which is not detectable in optical data .	Bona-fide global correlations among ISM components -- -and between ionized gas , dust , and global ( stellar ) properties of ellipticals -- - are hard to find , which most probably reflects an external origin of dust and ionized gas in ellipticals .
1	It is shown that this dependence may drive the system unstable towards a long-wave length charge density wave ( CDW ) where the associated second order instability occurs in close vicinity to global phase separation .	We investigate a two-dimensional electron model with Rashba spin-orbit interaction where the coupling constant $ g=g ( n ) $ depends on the electronic density .	For very low electron densities the CDW instability is nesting-induced and the modulation follows the Fermi momentum $ k_F $ .	At higher density the instability criterion becomes independent of $ k_F $ and the system may become unstable in a broad momentum range .	Finally , upon filling the upper spin-orbit split band , finite momentum instabilities disappear in favor of phase separation alone .
4	Further , the sub-stellar Trapezium IMF breaks from a steady power-law decline and forms a significant secondary peak at the lowest masses ( 10-20 times the mass of Jupiter ) .	We use the results of a new , multi-epoch , multi-wavelength , near-infrared census of the Trapezium Cluster in Orion to construct and to analyze the structure of its infrared ( K band ) luminosity function .	Specifically , we employ an improved set of model luminosity functions to derive this cluster 's underlying Initial Mass Function ( IMF ) across the entire range of mass from OB stars to sub-stellar objects down to near the deuterium burning limit .	We derive an IMF for the Trapezium Cluster that rises with decreasing mass , having a Salpeter-like IMF slope until near ~0.6 M_sun where the IMF flattens and forms a broad peak extending to the hydrogen burning limit , below which the IMF declines into the sub-stellar regime .	Independent of the details , we find that sub-stellar objects account for no more than ~22 % of the total number of likely cluster members .
4	In this note , we prove a generalization of the conjecture .	For any configuration of pebbles on the nodes of a graph , a pebbling move replaces two pebbles on one node by one pebble on an adjacent node .	A cover pebbling is a move sequence ending with no empty nodes .	The number of pebbles needed for a cover pebbling starting with all pebbles on one node is trivial to compute and it was conjectured that the maximum of these simple cover pebbling numbers is indeed the general cover pebbling number of the graph .	That is , for any configuration of this size , there exists a cover pebbling .
3	This will allow the Astrobiology community to look for targets of interest such as hydrothermal minerals , sulfate minerals and hydrous minerals and be able to map the extent of these minerals using the most up-to-date and effective algorithms .	We describe a computer application designed to analyze hyperspectral data collected by the Compact Infrared Spectrometer for Mars ( CRISM ) .	The application links the spectral , imaging and mapping perspectives on the eventual CRISM dataset by presenting the user with three different ways to analyze the data .	One of the goals when developing this instrument is to build in the latest algorithms for detection of spectrally compelling targets on the surface of the Red Planet , so they may be available to the Planetary Science community without cost and with a minimal learning barrier to cross .	The application is programmed in Java and will be made available for Windows , Mac and Linux platforms .
3	We measure the scaling relation between velocity dispersion and SZ mass estimates from the integrated Compton parameter for an SZ complete sample of 83 clusters .	We estimate cluster masses and velocity dispersions for 123 clusters from optical spectroscopy to compare the Sunyaev-Zeldovich ( SZ ) mass proxy and dynamical masses .	Our new survey , HeCS-SZ ( Hectospec Cluster Survey of SZ-selected clusters ) , includes 7,721 new or remeasured redshifts from MMT/Hectospec observations of 24 SZ-selected clusters at redshifts $ z $ =0.05-0.20 and not in previous surveys .	We supplement the Hectospec data with spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) and cluster data from the Cluster Infall Regions in SDSS ( CIRS ) project and the Hectospec Cluster Survey ( HeCS ) , our Hectospec survey of clusters selected by X-ray flux .	The observed relation agrees very well with a simple virial scaling from mass ( based on SZ ) to velocity dispersion .
4	By analyzing the spectral energy distribution of thermal dust emission at that location , we show that there are warm ( $ \sim $ 100 K ) and cool ( $ \sim $ 40 K ) SN dust components and that the latter is responsible for the observed $ E ( J-H ) $ .	We present the results of extinction measurements toward the main ejecta shell of the Cassiopeia A supernova ( SN ) remnant using the flux ratios between the two near-infrared ( NIR ) [ Fe II ] lines at 1.26 and 1.64 $ \mu { \rm m } $ .	We find a clear correlation between the NIR extinction ( $ E ( J-H ) $ ) and the radial velocity of ejecta knots , showing that redshifted knots are systematically more obscured than blueshifted ones .	This internal `` self-extinction '' strongly indicates that a large amount of SN dust resides inside and around the main ejecta shell .	At one location in the southern part of the shell , we measure $ E ( J-H ) $ by the SN dust of 0.23 $ \pm $ 0.05 mag .
1	The imager IBIS allows accurate positiioning of GRBs and broad band spectral analysis , while SPI provides high resolution spectroscopy .	The Gamma-ray instruments on-board INTEGRAL offer an unique opportunity to perform time resolved analysis on GRBs .	GRB 030501 was discovered by the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System in the ISGRI field of view .	Although the burst was fairly weak ( fluence F = 3.5 * 10^-6 erg cm^-2 in the 20-200 keV energy band ) it was possible to perform time resolved spectroscopy with a resolution of a few seconds .	The GRB shows a spectrum in the 20 - 400 keV range which is consistent with a spectral photon index of -1.7 .
0	Quantum computation is a novel way of information processing which allows , for certain classes of problems , exponential speedups over classical computation .	Various models of quantum computation exist , such as the adiabatic , circuit and measurement-based models .	They have been proven equivalent in their computational power , but operate very differently .	As such , they may be suitable for realization in different physical systems , and also offer different perspectives on open questions such as the precise origin of the quantum speedup .	Here , we give an introduction to the one-way quantum computer , a scheme of measurement-based quantum computation .
0	The interaction topology among the constituents of a complex network plays a crucial role in the network 's evolutionary mechanisms and functional behaviors .	However , some network topologies are usually unknown or uncertain .	Meanwhile , coupling delay are ubiquitous in various man-made and natural networks .	Hence , it is necessary to gain knowledge of the whole or partial topology of a complex dynamical network by taking into consideration communication delay .	In this paper , topology identification of complex dynamical networks is investigated via generalized synchronization of a two-layer network .
4	Interpreting the findings in the context of a scalar contact interaction between fermionic dark matter particles and top quarks , lower limits on the interaction scale are set .	A search is presented for particle dark matter produced in association with a pair of top quarks in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt ( s ) = 8 TeV .	The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns .	This search requires the presence of one lepton , multiple jets , and large missing transverse energy .	No excess of events is found above the SM expectation , and upper limits are derived on the production cross section .
0	We present near-IR photometry and imaging observations of a small sample of sources identified in the BeppoSAX 5-10 keV survey ( HELLAS ) which resolves ~ 20-30 % of the X-ray background at these energies .	The near-IR data are combined with optical spectra and photometry .	Only 40 % of the sources in our sample have the blue , power law continuum typical of color-selected QSOs .	The remaining 60 % are dominated by a galactic component which , on the basis of the continuum colors and shape , have ages ranging from 10^9 to 10^10 years .	The images show that the blue QSOs are pointlike at our angular resolution , while all the other sources are extended , consistent with their spectral appearance and low redshift .
2	These are ( i ) hypercritical accretion , which allows neutron stars to accrete enough matter to collapse to a black hole during their spiral-in into another star .	In this article we consider the formation and evolution of black holes , especially those in binary stars where radiation from the matter falling on them can be seen .	We consider a number of effects introduced by some of us , which are not traditionally included in binary evolution of massive stars .	( ii ) the strong mass loss of helium stars , which causes their evolution to differ from that of the helium core of a massive star .	( iii ) The direct formation of low-mass black holes ( $ M\sim2\msun $ ) from single stars , a consequence of a significant strange-matter content of the nuclear-matter equation of state at high density .
3	Furthermore , coupling between qubits has been successfully realized that was followed by the construction of multiple-qubit logic gates and the implementation of several algorithms .	Quantum bits or qubits are at the heart of quantum information processing schemes .	At the moment , solid-state qubits , and in particular the superconducting ones , seem to satisfy the requirements for being the building blocks of viable quantum computers , since they exhibit relatively high coherence times , extremely low dissipation , and scalability .	The possibility of achieving quantum coherence in macroscopic circuits comprising Josephson junctions , envisioned by Legett in the 1980 's , was demonstrated for the first time in a charge qubit ; since then , the exploitation of the macroscopic quantum effects in low-capacitance Josephson junction circuits allowed for the realization of several kinds of superconducting qubits .	Here it is demonstrated that induced qubit pulse coherence as well as two remarkable quantum coherent optical phenomena , i.e. , self-induced transparency and Dicke-type superradiance , may occur during light-pulse propagation in quantum metamaterials comprising superconducting charge qubits .
2	Textures are a type of topological defect that can be produced during a cosmological phase transition in the early universe , and which leave characteristic hot and cold spots in the CMB .	Fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) contain information which has been pivotal in establishing the current cosmological model .	These data can also be used to test well-motivated additions to this model , such as cosmic textures .	We apply Bayesian methods to carry out a rigorous test of the texture hypothesis , using full-sky data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe .	We conclude that current data do not warrant augmenting the standard cosmological model with textures .
3	The $ ^ { 11 } $ C produced from the reaction $ ^ { 10 } $ B ( $ d , n $ ) $ ^ { 11 } $ C is estimated to be 7.4 $ \times $ 10 $ ^ { 9 } $ per laser-shot at the Titan laser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .	We investigate the feasibility of using laser accelerated protons/deuterons for positron emission tomography ( PET ) isotope production by means of the nuclear reactions $ ^ { 11 } $ B ( $ p , n $ ) $ ^ { 11 } $ C and $ ^ { 10 } $ B ( $ d , n $ ) $ ^ { 11 } $ C .	The second reaction has a positive Q-value and no energy threshold .	One can , therefore , make use of the lower energy part of the laser-generated deuterons , which includes the majority of the accelerated deuterons .	Meanwhile a high-repetition table top laser irradiation is estimated to generate 3.5 $ \times $ 10 $ ^7 $ $ ^ { 11 } $ C per shot from the same reaction .
4	A stator affects the switching dynamics through two mechanisms : accelerating the conformation flipping rates of individual rotor switching units , which favours slower motor speed and thus increasing torque ; and affecting more switching units within unit time , which favours faster speed .	The bacterial flagellar motor plays a crucial role in both bacterial locomotion and chemotaxis .	Recent experiments reveal that the switching dynamics of the motor depends on the motor rotation speed , and thus the motor torque , non-monotonically .	Here we present a unified mathematical model which models motor torque generation based on experimental torque-speed curves and torque-dependent switching based on the conformational spread model .	The model successfully reproduces the observed switching rate as a function of the rotation speed , and provides a generic physical explanation independent of most details .
4	The Shapiro Conjecture for Grassmannians is equivalent to a special case of our result for Calogero-Moser spaces , namely for the fibres of \Upsilon over C^n/S_n \times 0 .	We prove a criterion for the reality of irreducible representations of the rational Cherednik algebras H_ { 0,1 } ( S_n ) .	This is shown to imply a criterion for the real loci of the Calogero-Moser spaces C_n in terms of the Etingof-Ginzburg finite maps \Upsilon \colon C_n \to C^n/S_n \times C^n/S_n , recovering a result of Mikhin , Tarasov , and Varchenko [ MTV2 ] .	As a consequence we obtain a criterion for the real locus of the Wilson 's adelic Grassmannian of rank one bispectral solutions of the KP hierarchy .	Using Wilson 's first parametrisation of the adelic Grassmannian , we give a new proof of a result of [ MTV2 ] on real bases of spaces of quasi polynomials .
1	Furthermore , it is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and its realm , relativistic quantum mechanics , is considered as the natural transition to quantum field theory .	The Dirac equation is a cornerstone in the history of physics , merging successfully quantum mechanics with special relativity , providing a natural description of the electron spin and predicting the existence of anti-matter .	However , the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects such as Klein 's paradox and Zitterbewegung , an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle first examined by Schr\ '' odinger .	These and other predictions would be difficult to observe in real particles , while constituting key fundamental examples to understand relativistic quantum effects .	Recent years have seen an increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects in different physical setups , where parameter tunability allows accessibility to different physical regimes .
4	We have solved the time-dependent Schr\ '' odinger equation numerically for small size systems with various exchange interactions .	We introduce quantum fluctuations into the simulated annealing process of optimization problems , aiming at faster convergence to the optimal state .	Quantum fluctuations cause transitions between states and thus play the same role as thermal fluctuations in the conventional approach .	The idea is tested by the transverse Ising model , in which the transverse field is a function of time similar to the temperature in the conventional method .	The goal is to find the ground state of the diagonal part of the Hamiltonian with high accuracy as quickly as possible .
1	We calculate the phase diagram , metallization pressure , phonon spectrum , and proton zero-point energy using three popular exchange-correlation functionals : the local density approximation ( LDA ) , the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof ( PBE ) generalized gradient approximation , and the semi-local Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr ( BLYP ) functional .	This paper investigates some of the successes and failures of density functional theory in the study of high-pressure solid hydrogen at low temperature .	We focus on the solid molecular P $ 6_3 $ /m , C2/c , Cmca-12 , and Cmca structures in the pressure range from $ 100 & lt ; P & lt ; 500 $ GPa over which phases I , II and III are observed experimentally .	At the static level of theory , in which proton zero-point energy is ignored , the LDA , PBE and BLYP functionals give very different structural transition and metallization pressures , with the BLYP phase diagram in better agreement with experiment .	Nevertheless , all three functionals provide qualitatively the same information about the band gaps of the four structures and the phase transitions between them .
2	The distance between the 2 , measured in the HST/ACS image , is 0.495 '' that , at the redshift of the source , corresponds to a projected separation of 2.46 kpc .	We present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the COSMOS survey at z=0.359 .	Source CXOCJ100043.1+020637 ( CID-42 ) presents two compact optical sources embedded in the same galaxy .	A large ( ~1200 km/s ) velocity offset between the narrow and broad components of Hbeta has been measured in three different optical spectra from the VLT/VIMOS and Magellan/IMACS instruments .	CID-42 is also the only X-ray source having in its X-ray spectra a strong redshifted broad absorption iron line , and an iron emission line , drawing an inverted P-Cygni profile .
2	Therefore , universal adiabatic quantum computation requires a method for approximating quantum many-body Hamiltonians up to arbitrary spectral error using at most 2-body interactions .	Application of the adiabatic model of quantum computation requires efficient encoding of the solution to computational problems into the lowest eigenstate of a Hamiltonian that supports universal adiabatic quantum computation .	Experimental systems are typically limited to restricted forms of 2-body interactions .	Hamiltonian gadgets , introduced around a decade ago , offer the only current means to address this requirement .	Although the applications of Hamiltonian gadgets have steadily grown since their introduction , little progress has been made in overcoming the limitations of the gadgets themselves .
0	Stars born from the same molecular cloud should be nearly homogeneous in their element abundances .	The concept of chemical tagging is to identify members of disrupted clusters by their clustering in element abundance space .	Chemical tagging requires large samples of stars with precise abundances for many individual elements .	With uncertainties of $ \sigma_ { [ X/ { \rm Fe } ] } $ and $ \sigma_ { \rm [ Fe/H ] } \simeq 0.05 $ for 10 elements measured for $ & gt ; 10^4 $ stars , the APOGEE DR12 spectra may be the first well-suited data set to put this idea into practice .	We find that even APOGEE data offer only $ \sim 500 $ independent volume elements in the 10-dimensional abundance space , when we focus on the $ \alpha $ -enhanced Galactic disk .
2	A unified treatment of dimensionality reduction algorithms is presented with the aid of least squares optimization techniques , in which several techniques for designing the transformation matrix that performs dimensionality reduction are reviewed .	We present a tutorial on reduced-rank signal processing , design methods and algorithms for dimensionality reduction , and cover a number of important applications .	A general framework based on linear algebra and linear estimation is employed to introduce the reader to the fundamentals of reduced-rank signal processing and to describe how dimensionality reduction is performed on an observed discrete-time signal .	Among the dimensionality reduction techniques are those based on the eigen-decomposition of the observed data vector covariance matrix , Krylov subspace methods , joint and iterative optimization ( JIO ) algorithms and JIO with simplified structures and switching ( JIOS ) techniques .	A number of applications are then considered using a unified treatment , which includes wireless communications , sensor and array signal processing , and speech , audio , image and video processing .
0	We have placed limits on the cosmological significance of gas-rich low surface-brightness ( LSB ) galaxies as a proportion of the total population of gas-rich galaxies by carrying out a very deep survey ( HIDEEP ) for neutral hydrogen ( HI ) with the Parkes multibeam system .	Such a survey avoids the surface-brightness selection effects that limit the usefulness of optical surveys for finding LSB galaxies .	To complement the HIDEEP survey we have digitally stacked eight 1-hour R-band Tech Pan films from the UK Schmidt Telescope covering 36 square degrees of the survey area to reach a very deep isophotal limit of 26.5 R mag/sq.arcsec .	At this level , we find that all of the 129 HI sources within this area have optical counterparts and that 107 of them can be identified with individual galaxies .	We have used the properties of the galaxies identified as the optical counterparts of the HI sources to estimate the significance of LSB galaxies ( defined to be those at least 1.5 magnitudes dimmer in effective surface-brightness than the peak in the observed distribution seen in optical surveys ) .
0	We present three holographic constructions of fractional quantum Hall effect ( FQHE ) via string theory .	The first model studies edge states in FQHE using supersymmetric domain walls in N=6 Chern-Simons theory .	We show that D4-branes wrapped on CP^1 or D8-branes wrapped on CP^3 create edge states that shift the rank or the level of the gauge group , respectively .	These holographic edge states correctly reproduce the Hall conductivity .	The second model presents a holographic dual to the pure U ( N ) _k ( Yang-Mills- ) Chern-Simons theory based on a D3-D7 system .
2	We also note a programming error in fullgen that caused problems for 136 or more vertices .	We describe an efficient new algorithm for the generation of fullerenes .	Our implementation of this algorithm is more than 3.5 times faster than the previously fastest generator for fullerenes -- fullgen -- and the first program since fullgen to be useful for more than 100 vertices .	We tabulate the numbers of fullerenes and IPR fullerenes up to 400 vertices .	We also check up to 316 vertices a conjecture of Barnette that cubic planar graphs with maximum face size 6 are hamiltonian and verify that the smallest counterexample to the spiral conjecture has 380 vertices .
0	Being able to safely distinguish astrophysical from potential dark matter ( DM ) annihilation signals is of utmost importance for indirect DM searches .	To this end , one has to rely on distinctive -- and unique -- spectral signatures to look for .	Internal bremsstrahlung ( IB ) , unavoidable in the presence of charged annihilation products , provides such a signature .	In fact , as it generically dominates the gamma-ray spectrum expected from DM annihilations , at high energies , it may well turn out to be more important for indirect DM searches than the traditionally looked-for line signals .	As illustrated in some detail , the observation of IB signatures would even allow to distinguish between different DM candidates or to constrain significantly the parameter space of , e.g. , neutralino DM .
1	These new coronagraphs provide a key advance to enabling direct imaging and spectroscopy of Earth twins with future large space missions .	We introduce a new class of solutions for Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraphs ( APLC ) with segmented aperture telescopes to remove broadband diffracted light from a star with a contrast level of $ 10^ { 10 } $ .	Building on shaped pupil ( SP ) apodization optimizations , our approach enables two-dimensional optimizations of the system to address any aperture features such as central obstruction , support structures or segment gaps .	We illustrate the technique with a design that could reach $ 10^ { 10 } $ contrast level at 34\ , mas for a 12\ , m segmented telescope over a 10\ % bandpass centered at a wavelength $ \lambda_0= $ 500\ , nm .	These designs can be optimized specifically for the presence of a resolved star , and in our example , for stellar angular size up to 1.1\ , mas .
3	Points ( i-iii ) have been shown to be incorrect in [ Kiriushcheva et al. , Phys.Lett .	A conventional wisdom often perpetuated in the literature states that : ( i ) a 3+1 decomposition of space-time into space and time is synonymous with the canonical treatment and this decomposition is essential for any Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity ( GR ) ; ( ii ) the canonical treatment unavoidably breaks the symmetry between space and time in GR and the resulting algebra of constraints is not the algebra of four-dimensional diffeomorphism ; ( iii ) according to some authors this algebra allows one to derive only spatial diffeomorphism or , according to others , a specific field-dependent and non-covariant four-dimensional diffeomorphism ; ( iv ) the analyses of Dirac [ Proc.Roy.Soc .	A 246 ( 1958 ) 333 ] and of ADM [ Arnowitt , Deser and Misner , in `` Gravitation : An Introduction to Current Research '' ( 1962 ) 227 ] of the canonical structure of GR are equivalent .	We provide some general reasons why these statements should be questioned .	A 372 ( 2008 ) 5101 ] and now we thoroughly re-examine all steps of the Dirac Hamiltonian formulation of GR .
0	Additive white noise may significantly increase the response of bistable systems to a periodic driving signal .	We consider two classes of double-well potentials , symmetric and asymmetric , modulated periodically in time with period $ 1/\eps $ , where $ \eps $ is a moderately ( not exponentially ) small parameter .	We show that the response of the system changes drastically when the noise intensity $ \sigma $ crosses a threshold value .	Below the threshold , paths are concentrated near one potential well , and have an exponentially small probability to jump to the other well .	Above the threshold , transitions between the wells occur with probability exponentially close to 1/2 in the symmetric case , and exponentially close to 1 in the asymmetric case .
2	Counterterms from the $ { \cal O } ( q^6 ) $ chiral lagrangian , required to absorb divergences and scale dependence encountered at the two-loop level , are constructed .	We perform a calculation of the isospin and hypercharge vector current propagators ( $ \Delta_ { V33 } ^ { \mu\nu } ( q^2 ) $ and $ \Delta_ { V88 } ^ { \mu\nu } ( q^2 ) $ ) to two loops in chiral perturbation theory .	The analysis is carried out with straightforward Feynman diagram methods by making appropriate use of external vector sources .	Our final results are finite , covariant , and scale-independent .	Several applications are described , including a comparison of the two-loop isospin vector spectral function with data and the construction of new chiral sum rules .
2	Using the comoving gauge action we calculate the trispectrum at leading order in slow-roll , finding agreement with a previously known result in the literature .	We compute the fourth order action in perturbation theory for scalar and second order tensor perturbations for a minimally coupled single field inflationary model , where the inflaton 's lagrangian is a general function of the field 's value and its kinetic energy .	We obtain the fourth order action in two gauges , the comoving gauge and the uniform curvature gauge .	We point out that in general to obtain the correct leading order trispectrum one can not ignore second order tensor perturbations as previously done by others .	The next-to-leading order corrections may become detectable depending on the shape and we provide the necessary formalism to calculate them .
4	Despite being polar , the surface of both as-grown and annealed Co3O4 ( 111 ) films are ( 1 * 1 ) , which can be explained in terms of inversion in the surface spinel structure .	The growth and characterization of epitaxial Co3O4 ( 111 ) films grown by oxygen plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on single crystalline a-Al2O3 ( 0001 ) is reported .	The Co3O4 ( 111 ) grows single crystalline with the epitaxial relation Co3O4 ( 111 ) [ -12-1 ] ||a-Al2O3 ( 0001 ) [ 10-10 ] , as determined from in situ electron diffraction .	Film stoichiometry is confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy , while ex situ x-ray diffraction measurements show that the Co3O4 films are fully relaxed .	Post-growth annealing induces significant modifications in the film morphology , including a sharper Co3O4/a-Al2O3 interface and improved surface crystallinity , as shown by x-ray reflectometry , atomic force microscopy and electron diffraction measurements .
3	Based on our total energy calculations using DFT-D2 method , the \emph { Cmcm } structure is found to be the preferred thermodynamic equilibrium phase under studied pressure and temperature range .	Silver fulminate ( AgCNO ) is a primary explosive , which exists in two polymorphic phases namely orthorhombic ( \emph { Cmcm } ) and trigonal ( \emph { R $ \bar { 3 } $ } ) forms at ambient conditions .	In the present study , we have investigated the effect of pressure and temperature on relative phase stability of the polymorphs using planewave pseudopotential approaches based on Density Functional Theory ( DFT ) .	van der Waals interactions play a significant role in predicting the phase stability and they can be effectively captured by semiempirical dispersion correction methods incontrast to standard DFT functionals .	Hitherto \emph { Cmcm } and \emph { R $ \bar { 3 } $ } phases denoted as $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ -forms of AgCNO , respectively .
4	Our main result is a counting estimate for the number of well-rounded cyclic lattices , indicating that well-rounded lattices are more common among cyclic lattices than generically .	Cyclic lattices are sublattices of $ \mathbb Z^N $ that are preserved under the rotational shift operator .	Cyclic lattices were introduced by D.~Micciancio and their properties were studied in the recent years by several authors due to their importance in cryptography .	In particular , Peikert and Rosen showed that on cyclic lattices in prime dimensions , the shortest independent vectors problem SIVP reduces to the shortest vector problem SVP with a particularly small loss in approximation factor , as compared to general lattices .	In this paper , we further investigate geometric properties of cyclic lattices .
2	We have shown that for strong disorder the quenching of the impurity moments is absent .	Exact results for the thermodynamic properties of ensembles of magnetic impurities with randomly distributed host-impurity couplings in the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model are presented .	Exact calculations are done for arbitrary values of temperature and external magnetic field .	For weak disorder the screening persists , but with the critical non-Fermi-liquid behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat .	A comparison with the disordered Kondo effect experiments in dirty metallic alloys is performed .
2	In contrast with [ 2 ] , we find that not all gravitational normal modes of AdS can be nonlinearly extended into periodic horizonless smooth solutions of the Einstein equation .	Anti-de Sitter ( AdS ) is conjectured to be nonlinear unstable to a weakly turbulent mechanism that develops a cascade towards high frequencies , leading to black hole formation [ 1,2 ] .	We give evidence that the gravitational sector of perturbations behaves differently from the scalar one studied in [ 2 ] .	In particular , we show that even seeds with a single normal mode can develop secular resonances , unlike the spherically symmetric scalar field collapse studied in [ 2 ] .	Moreover , if the seed has two normal modes , more than one resonance can be generated at third order , unlike the spherical collapse of [ 2 ] .
3	Despite the number of optimization techniques available nowadays the author of this paper thinks that Genetic Algorithms still play a central role for their versatility , robustness , theoretical framework and simplicity of use .	The rapid advances in the field of optimization methods in many pure and applied science pose the difficulty of keeping track of the developments as well as selecting an appropriate technique that best suits the problem in-hand .	From a practitioner point of view is rightful to wander `` which optimization method is the best for my problem ? `` .	Looking at the optimization process as a `` system '' of intercon- nected parts , in this paper are collected some ideas about how to tackle an optimization problem using a class of tools from evolutionary computations called Genetic Algorithms .	The paper can be considered a `` collection of tips '' ( from literature and personal experience ) for the non-computer-scientist that has to deal with optimization problems both in the science and engineering practice .
0	We improve a recently developed expansion technique for calculating real frequency spectral functions of any one-dimensional model with short-range interactions , by postprocessing computed Chebyshev moments with linear prediction .	This can be achieved at virtually no cost and , in sharp contrast to existing methods based on the dampening of the moments , improves the spectral resolution rather than lowering it .	We validate the method for the exactly solvable resonating level model and the single impurity Anderson model .	It is capable of resolving sharp Kondo resonances , as well as peaks within the Hubbard bands when employed as an impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory ( DMFT ) .	Our method works at zero temperature and allows for arbitrary discretization of the bath spectrum .
4	However , for a particular choice of interaction constants , when the ground state is strongly degenerate , our simulations suggest that the slow-dynamics regime extends up to the melting transition .	Using Monte Carlo simulations we study the dynamics of three-dimensional Ising models with nearest- , next-nearest- , and four-spin ( plaquette ) interactions .	During coarsening , such models develop growing energy barriers , which leads to very slow dynamics at low temperature .	As already reported , the model with only the plaquette interaction exhibits some of the features characteristic of ordinary glasses : strong metastability of the supercooled liquid , a weak increase of the characteristic length under cooling , stretched-exponential relaxation and aging .	The addition of two-spin interactions , in general , destroys such behaviour : the liquid phase loses metastability and the slow-dynamics regime terminates well below the melting transition , which is presumably related with a certain corner-rounding transition .
4	Contributions of different simplifications which are applied at Monte Carlo muon transportation to the resulting error are considered and ranked .	We present a new Monte Carlo muon propagation algorithm MUM ( MUons+Medium ) which possesses some advantages over analogous algorithms presently in use .	The most important features of algorithm are described .	Results on the test for accuracy of treatment the muon energy loss with MUM are presented and analyzed .	It is evaluated to be of 0.002 or better , depending upon simulation parameters .
1	We employ a combinatorial method to restrict the nuclear states to a fixed polarisation and show that the centre of the resonance is shifted linearly with the nuclear polarisation by up to the zero polarisation line width .	We study the polarisation dependence of the homogeneously broadened nuclear spin resonance in a crystal .	The width shrinks from its maximum value at zero polarisation to zero at full polarisation .	This suggests to use the line shape as a direct measure of nuclear polarisation reached under dynamical pumping .	In the limit of single quantum of excitation above the fully ferromagnetic state , we provide an explicit solution to the problem of nuclear spin dynamics which links a bound on the fastest decay rate to the observable width of the resonance line .
2	Hence any phenomenon associated to G^ ( 2 ) is invisible to abelian invariants .	The classical abelian invariants of a knot are the Alexander module , which is the first homology group of the the unique infinite cyclic covering space of S^3-K , considered as a module over the ( commutative ) Laurent polynomial ring , and the Blanchfield linking pairing defined on this module .	From the perspective of the knot group , G , these invariants reflect the structure of G^ ( 1 ) /G^ ( 2 ) as a module over G/G^ ( 1 ) ( here G^ ( n ) is the n-th term of the derived series of G ) .	This paper begins the systematic study of invariants associated to solvable covering spaces of knot exteriors , in particular the study of what we call the n-th higher-order Alexander module , G^ ( n+1 ) /G^ ( n+2 ) , considered as a Z [ G/G^ ( n+1 ) $ -module .	We show that these modules share almost all of the properties of the classical Alexander module .
0	We systematically examine corrections to the gravitational inverse square law , which are due to compactified extra dimensions .	We find the induced Yukawa-type potentials for which we calculate the strength \alpha and range .	In general the range of the Yukawa correction is given by the wavelength of the lightest Kaluza-Klein state and its strength , relative to the standard gravitational potential , by the corresponding degeneracy .	In particular , when n extra dimensions are compactified on an n-torus , we find that the strength of the potential is \alpha=2n , whereas the compactification on an n-sphere gives \alpha= n+1 .	For Calabi-Yau compactifications the strength can be at most \alpha=20 .
1	This leads to a new rationale for quantum computing which makes use of sequential processing of one-particle states rather than the parallel processing associated with multiparticle states .	There is a direct correspondence between two-particle , entangled quantum states , for example , Bell states , and the relative values of the component one-particle states .	It is shown that deterministic transformations can correspond to certain Bell state operations .	There are some implications for the continuing discussion of quantum realism and entanglement .	A principle of relative realism is advocated .
4	The high figure of $ 50\ % $ can be achieved because 1-loop graphs involving the physical charged Higgs boson give corrections to $ m_ { \tau } -m_b $ that are proportional to the large top quark mass .	A simple Pati-Salam SU ( 4 ) model with a low symmetry breaking scale of about 1000 TeV is presented .	The analysis concentrates on calculating radiative corrections to tree-level mass relations for third generation fermions .	The tree-level relation $ m_b/m_ { \tau } =1 $ predicted by such models can receive large radiative corrections up to about $ 50\ % $ due to threshold effects at the mass unification scale .	These corrections are thus of about the same importance as those that give rise to renormalisation group running .
0	Very few AdS_6 x M_4 supersymmetric solutions are known : one in massive IIA , and two IIB solutions dual to it .	The IIA solution is known to be unique ; in this paper , we use the pure spinor approach to give a classification for IIB supergravity .	We reduce the problem to two PDEs on a two-dimensional space Sigma .	M_4 is then a fibration of S^2 over Sigma ; the metric and fluxes are completely determined in terms of the solution to the PDEs .	The results seem likely to accommodate near-horizon limits of ( p , q ) -fivebrane webs studied in the literature as a source of CFT_5 's .
4	These results are accounted for by assuming a 2D local flow over the cylinder with a characteristic velocity independent of $ L/W $ for a given $ V_ { cx } $ value .	The different types of instabilities of free cylinders ( diameter $ D $ , length $ L $ ) have been studied in a viscous flow ( velocity $ U $ ) between parallel vertical walls of horizontal width $ W $ at a distance $ H $ : the influence of the confinement parameters $ D/H $ and $ L/W $ has been investigated .	As $ D/H $ increases , there is a transition from stable flow to oscillations transverse to the walls and then to a fluttering motion with oscillations of the angle of the axis with respect to the horizontal .	The two types of oscillations may be superimposed in the transition domain .	The frequency $ f $ of the transverse oscillations is independent of the lateral confinement $ L/W $ in the range : 0.055 \le L/W \le 0.94 $ for a given cylinder velocity $ V_ { cx } $ and increases only weakly with $ V_ { cx } $ .
0	Let $ R $ be a unital ring with involution .	We first show that the EP elements in $ R $ can be characterized by three equations .	Namely , let $ a\in R $ , then $ a $ is EP if and only if there exists $ x\in R $ such that $ ( xa ) ^ { \ast } =xa $ , $ xa^ { 2 } =a $ and $ ax^ { 2 } =x. $ It is well known that all EP elements in $ R $ are core invertible and Moore-Penrose invertible .	We give more equivalent conditions for a core ( Moore-Penrose ) invertible element to be an EP element .	Finally , the EP elements are characterized in terms of $ n $ -EP property , which is a generalization of bi-EP property .
1	In principle , both classical and quantum protocols can be used for this processing .	After carrying out a protocol for quantum key agreement over a noisy quantum channel , the parties Alice and Bob must process the raw key in order to end up with identical keys about which the adversary has virtually no information .	It is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful .	We prove for general states but under the assumption of incoherent eavesdropping that Alice and Bob share some so-called intrinsic information in their classical random variables , resulting from optimal measurements , if and only if the parties ' quantum systems are entangled .	In addition , we provide evidence that the potentials of classical and of quantum protocols are equal in every situation .
1	The speical case for $ Q $ being the Boolean lattice $ B_n $ is well-studied , and the optiamal value is denoted as $ \lanp $ .	For two posets $ P $ and $ Q $ , we say $ Q $ is $ P $ -free if there does not exist any order-preserving injection from $ P $ to $ Q $ .	Let us define $ \La ( Q , P ) $ to be the largest size of any $ P $ -free subposet of $ Q $ .	In this paper , we give an upper bound for $ \La ( Q , P ) $ when $ Q $ is a double chain and $ P $ is any graded poset , which is better than the previous known upper bound , by means of finding the indpendence number of an auxiliary graph related to $ P $ .	For the auxiliary graph , we can find its independence number in polynomial time .
3	The combined model including the empirically modified intranuclear cascade followed by statistical multifragmentation was used to generate starting conditions for these calculations .	The relative angle correlation of intermediate mass fragments has been studied for p+Au collisions at 3.6 GeV .	Strong suppression at small angles is observed caused by IMF-IMF Coulomb repulsion .	Experimental correlation function is compared to that obtained by the multi-body Coulomb trajectory calculations with the various decay time of fragmenting system .	The model dependence of the results obtained has been carefully checked .
2	We analyze natural classes of games that are induced by this decomposition , and in particular , focus on games with no harmonic component and games with no potential component .	In this paper we introduce a novel flow representation for finite games in strategic form .	This representation allows us to develop a canonical direct sum decomposition of an arbitrary game into three components , which we refer to as the potential , harmonic and nonstrategic components .	We show that the first class corresponds to the well-known potential games .	We refer to the second class of games as harmonic games , and study the structural and equilibrium properties of this new class of games .
1	) , and body-centered cubic ( b.c.c . )	Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to study bond percolation on the simple cubic ( s.c. ) , face-centered cubic ( f.c.c .	lattices , using an epidemic kind of approach .	These simulations provide very precise values of the critical thresholds for each of the lattices : pc ( s.c. ) = 0.248 812 6 ( 5 ) , pc ( f.c.c . )	= 0.120 163 5 ( 10 ) , and pc ( b.c.c . )
1	The sensors are equipped with a PIN diode and a calibrated V-filter , and a blue/UV filter matching the spectral response of the photomultipliers to be employed in the CTA cameras .	The site selection group for the future Cherenkov Telescope Array ( CTA ) has deployed sensitive light sensors at 9 candidate sites , 5 of them in the Southern and 4 in the Northern hemisphere .	All sensor installations , denominated `` Atmoscopes '' , have been cross-calibrated before deployment , and their sensitivity is monitored every two to five months .	We show that a thoroughly developed model of the integral contribution of starlight to the overall light measure serves as an additional cross-calibration for each device during each night , reducing the systematic uncertainty of this measurement to less than 15 % .	The starlight can then be subtracted from the measurements , and the residuals compared among the different sites .
3	The simulation which involves the Voronoi diagrams is done in a cubic box with sides of 100 Mpc .	The all-sky maps of the observed variation of the Hubble constant can be reproduced from a theoretical point of view by introducing an intergalactic plasma with a variable number density of electrons .	The observed averaged value and variance of the Hubble constant are reproduced by adopting a rim model , an auto-gravitating model , and a Voronoi diagrams model as the backbone for an auto-gravitating medium .	We also analyze an astronomer 's model based on the 3D spatial distribution of galaxies as given by the 2MASS Redshift Survey and an auto-gravitating Lane -- Emden ( $ n=5 $ ) profile of the electrons .	The simulation which involves the 2MASS covers the range of redshift smaller than 0.05 .
1	( 2006 ) discovered two molecular loops in the Galactic center and argued that the foot points of the molecular loops , two bright spots at both loops ends , represent the gas accumulated by the falling motion along the loops , subsequent to magnetic flotation by the Parker instability .	Fukui et al .	We have carried out sensitive CO observations of the foot points toward l=356 deg at a few pc resolution in the six rotational transitions of CO ; 12CO ( J=1-0 , 3-2 , 4-3 , 7-6 ) , 13CO ( J=1-0 ) and C18O ( J=1-0 ) .	The high resolution image of 12CO ( J=3-2 ) has revealed the detailed distribution of the high excitation gas including U shapes , the outer boundary of which shows sharp intensity jumps accompanying strong velocity gradients .	An analysis of the multi-J CO transitions shows that the temperature is in a range from 30-100 K and density is around 10^3-10^4 cm^-3 , confirming that the foot points have high temperature and density although there is no prominent radiative heating source such as high mass stars in or around the loops .
2	This work gives a unified scheme for both time and space shifting to reduce costs .	This paper describes TARDIS ( Traffic Assignment and Retiming Dynamics with Inherent Stability ) which is an algorithmic procedure designed to reallocate traffic within Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) networks .	Recent work has investigated the idea of shifting traffic in time ( from peak to off-peak ) or in space ( by using different links ) .	Particular attention is given to the commonly used 95th percentile pricing scheme .	The work has three main innovations : firstly , introducing the Shapley Gradient , a way of comparing traffic pricing between different links at different times of day ; secondly , a unified way of reallocating traffic in time and/or in space ; thirdly , a continuous approximation to this system is proved to be stable .
4	This is the best result up to date for cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane .	In this paper , we construct a new weakly universal cellular automaton on the ternary heptagrid .	The previous result , obtained by the same author and Y .	Song required six states only .	This time , the number of states is four .
3	The method is extended to infinite dimensional Holstein-Hubbard model using dynamical mean field theory .	We show that information on the probability density of local fluctuations can be obtained from a numerical renormalisation group calculation of a reduced density matrix .	We apply this approach to the Anderson-Holstein impurity model to calculate the ground state probability density $ \rho ( x ) $ for the displacement $ x $ of the local oscillator .	From this density we can deduce an effective local potential for the oscillator and compare its form with that obtained from a semiclassical approximation as a function of the coupling strength .	We use this approach to compare the probability densities for the displacement of the local oscillator in the normal , antiferromagnetic and charge ordered phases .
3	We find that neither power law expansion nor $ \Lambda $ CDM is strongly preferred over the other when the SN Ia and BAO data are analyzed separately but that power law expansion is strongly disfavored by the combination .	Late-time power law expansion has been proposed as an alternative to the standard cosmological model and shown to be consistent with some low-redshift data .	We test power law expansion against the standard flat $ \Lambda $ CDM cosmology using goodness-of-fit and model comparison criteria .	We consider Type Ia supernova ( SN Ia ) data from two current compilations ( JLA and Union2.1 ) along with a current set of baryon acoustic oscillation ( BAO ) measurements that includes the high-redshift Lyman- $ \alpha $ forest measurements from BOSS quasars .	We treat the $ R_\text { h } = ct $ cosmology ( a constant rate of expansion ) separately and find that it is conclusively disfavored by all combinations of data that include SN Ia observations and a poor overall fit when systematic errors in the SN Ia measurements are ignored , despite a recent claim to the contrary .
0	We discuss how to extract renormalized from bare Polyakov loops in SU ( N ) lattice gauge theories at nonzero temperature in four spacetime dimensions .	Single loops in an irreducible representation are multiplicatively renormalized without mixing , through a renormalization constant which depends upon both representation and temperature .	The values of renormalized loops in the four lowest representations of SU ( 3 ) were measured numerically on small , coarse lattices .	We find that in magnitude , condensates for the sextet and octet loops are approximately the square of the triplet loop .	This agrees with a large $ N $ expansion , where factorization implies that the expectation values of loops in adjoint and higher representations are just powers of fundamental and anti-fundamental loops .
4	Recent X-ray observations reveal that SNRs around magnetar candidates do not show evidence for a larger energy content than standard SNRs ( Vink & amp ; Kuiper 2006 ) .	Soft Gamma Repeaters and the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars are believed to contain slowly spinning `` magnetars '' .	The enormous energy liberated in the 2004 Dece 27 giant flare from SGR 1806-20 , together with the likely recurrence time of such events , points to an internal magnetic field strength ~ 10^ { 16 } G. Such strong fields are expected to be generated by a coherent alpha-Omega dynamo in the early seconds after the Neutron Star formation , if its spin period is of a few milliseconds at most .	A substantial deformation of the NS is caused by such fields and a newborn millisecond-spinning magnetar would thus radiate for a few days a strong gravitational wave signal .	Such a signal may be detected with Advanced LIGO-class detectors up to the distance of the Virgo cluster , where ~ 1 magnetar per year are expected to form .
2	In both models we constrain the MgII halo sizes of field and cluster galaxies using observational results on the observed MgII statistics .	Based on recent results on the frequency of MgII absorption line systems in the `` QSO behind RCS clusters '' survey ( QbC ) , we analyse the effects of the cluster environment on the sizes of baryonic haloes around galaxies .	We use two independent models , i ) an empirical halo occupation model which fits current measurements of the clustering and luminosity function of galaxies at low and high redshifts , and ii ) the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation , which follows the evolution of the galaxy population from first principles , adjusted to match the statistics of low and high redshift galaxies .	Our results for the field are in good agreement with previous works , indicating a typical \mgii\ halo size of $ r_MgII ~ 50h_71^-1kpc in the semi-analytic model , and slightly lower in the halo occupation number approach .	For the cluster environment , we find that both models require a median MgII halo size of r_MgII & lt ; 10h_71^-1kpc in order to reproduce the observed statistics on absorption line systems in clusters of galaxies .
4	Second order Taub numbers give the contribution of second order perturbations to the background quantity .	Taub numbers are studied on asymptotically flat backgrounds with Killing symmetries .	When the field equations are solved for a background spacetime and higher order functional derivatives ( higher order variational derivatives of the Hilbert Lagrangean ) are solved for perturbations from the background , such perturbed space-times admit zeroth , first , and second order Taub numbers .	Zeroth order Taub numbers are Komar constants ( upto numerical factors ) or Penrose-Goldberg constants of the background .	For a Killing symmetry of the background , first order Taub numbers give the contribution of the linearized perturbation to the associated backgound quantity , such as the perturbing mass .
2	Whereas the gamma-ray emission is likely to be connected with the non-thermal jet emission , dominating also the radio band , the situation is less clear at hard X-rays .	A number of radio galaxies has been detected by Fermi/LAT in the gamma-ray domain .	In some cases , like Cen A and M 87 , these objects have been seen even in the TeV range by Cherenkov telescopes .	While the smoothly curved continuum emission and the overall spectral energy distribution indicate a non-thermal emission , other features such as the iron line emission and the low variability appear to be rather of Seyfert type , i.e.created in the accretion disk and corona around the central black hole .	We investigate several prominent cases using combined X-ray and gamma-ray data in order to constrain the possible contributions of the jet and the accretion disk to the overall spectral energy distribution in radio galaxies .
1	The approach utilizes properties of Gaussian distribution , properties of Hermite polynomials and Fourier analysis .	A method for time-frequency analysis is given .	We begin by the definitions of a set of functions called harmonic Gaussian functions .	Then these functions are used to define a set of transformations , noted T_n , which associate to a function { \psi } , of the time variable t , a set of functions { \Psi } _n which depend on time , frequency and frequency ( or time ) standard deviation .	Some properties of the transformations T_n and the functions { \Psi } _n are given .
4	Various wall movements , including translation , oscillation , and rotation , are supported .	We present a new particle-based ( discrete element ) numerical method for the simulation of granular dynamics , with application to motions of particles on small solar system body and planetary surfaces .	The method employs the parallel N-body tree code pkdgrav to search for collisions and compute particle trajectories .	Collisions are treated as instantaneous point-contact events between rigid spheres .	Particle confinement is achieved by combining arbitrary combinations of four provided wall primitives , namely infinite plane , finite disk , infinite cylinder , and finite cylinder , and degenerate cases of these .
4	Applying some properties , upper bounds on the probability of error are established in this paper .	In this paper we shall consider some famous means such as arithmetic , harmonic , geometric , root square mean , etc .	Considering the difference of these means , we can establish .	some inequalities among them .	Interestingly , the difference of mean considered is convex functions .
1	This component shows a striking time variation with an average temporal rms near the limb of 1.7 G at ~3 '' resolution .	The photospheric magnetic field outside of active regions and the network has a ubiquitous and dynamic line-of-sight component that strengthens from disk center to limb as expected for a nearly horizontal orientation .	In our moderate resolution observations the nearly horizontal component has a frequency variation power law exponent of -1.4 below 1.5 mHz and is spatially patchy on scales up to ~15 arcsec .	The field may be a manifestation of changing magnetic connections between eruptions and evolution of small magnetic flux elements in response to convective motions .	It shows no detectable latitude or longitude variations .
3	Furthermore , these correlators are found to be spatially modulated according to a wave-vector related to the topological invariants .	We investigate the arguably simplest $ SU ( 2 ) $ -invariant wave functions capable of accounting for spin-liquid behavior , expressed in terms of nearest-neighbor valence-bond states on the square lattice and characterized by different topological invariants .	While such wave-functions are known to exhibit short-range spin correlations , we perform Monte Carlo simulations and show that four-point correlations decay algebraically with an exponent $ 1.16 ( 4 ) $ .	This is reminiscent of the { \it classical } dimer problem , albeit with a slower decay .	We conclude that a recently proposed spin Hamiltonian that stabilizes the here considered wave-function ( s ) as its ( degenerate ) ground-state ( s ) should exhibit gapped spin and gapless non-magnetic excitations .
4	On the other hand our exhaustive computer searches show that NS ( 31 ) and NS ( 33 ) are void .	The normal sequences NS ( n ) and near-normal sequences NN ( n ) play an important role in the construction of orthogonal designs and Hadamard matrices .	They can be identified with certain base sequences ( A ; B ; C ; D ) , where A and B have length n+1 and C and D length n. C.H .	Yang conjectured that near-normal sequences exist for all even n. While this has been confirmed for n not exceeding 30 , so far nothing else was known for larger n. We show that NN ( 32 ) consists of 8 equivalence classes and we exhibit their representatives .	We also construct representatives for two equivalence classes of NN ( 34 ) .
2	At high temperature regime , a positive effective range gives rise to stronger repulsive interaction energy for positive scattering length , and weaker attractive interaction energy for negative scattering length .	We show that s-wave scattering resonances induced by dipolar interactions in a polar molecular gas have a universal large and positive effective range , which is very different from Feshbach resonances realized in cold atoms before , where the effective range is either negligible or negative .	Such a difference has important consequence in many-body physics .	While at low-temperatures , we study polaron problem formed by single impurity molecule , and we find that the polaron binding energy increases at the BEC side and decreases at the BCS side .	All these effects are in opposite to narrow Feshbach resonances where the effective range is negative .
4	In particular , we study the variation in the $ 10\mu m $ and $ 18\mu m $ emission features with the volume fraction of the inclusions and porosities .	In this paper we study the effects of inclusions and porosities on the emission properties of silicate grains and compare the model curves with the observed infrared emission from circumstellar dust .	We calculate the absorption efficiency of the composite grain , made up of a host silicate oblate spheroid and inclusions of ice/graphite/or voids , in the spectral region 5.0-25.0 $ \mu m $ .	The absorption efficiencies of the composite spheroidal oblate grains for three axial ratios are computed using the discrete dipole approximation ( DDA ) .	We study the absorption as a function of the volume fraction of the inclusions and porosity .
3	In the first protocol , a 1/2 spin ( a qubit ) is coupled with the quantum fluctuation in the vacuum state and measured in order to obtain one-bit information about the fluctuation for the teleportation .	It is well known that usual quantum teleportation protocols can not transport energy .	Recently , new protocols called quantum energy teleportation ( QET ) have been proposed , which transport energy by local operations and classical communication with the ground states of many-body quantum systems .	In this paper , we compare two different QET protocols for transporting energy with electromagnetic field .	In the second protocol , a harmonic oscillator is coupled with the fluctuation and measured in order to obtain continuous-variable information about the fluctuation .
4	The same sample grown on STO revealed a complex behavior , which entails charge ordering at ~300 K , a Neel order at ~150 K and finally a weak ferromagnetic phase below 50 K. A strong correlation between charge ordering temperature ( TCO ) and the c-axis lattice parameter ( c ) of the type ( dTCO/dc ~-350 K/A ) imerges from measurements on films deposited under different growth conditions .	The dynamics of the charge ordered ( CO ) state under non-equilibrium conditions created by strong dc-electric field ( ~106 V/cm ) and photo-illumination with short ( ~ 6 ns ) laser pulses is investigated in Bi1-xCaxMnO3 ( x & gt ; 0.5 ) epitaxial films .	A pulsed laser deposition method was used to synthesize films on ( 100 ) LaAlO3 ( LAO ) and ( 100 ) SrTiO3 ( STO ) substrates .	The crystallographic structure , temperature dependence of electrical resistivity and magnetization of the samples of different composition prepared under different oxygen partial pressure ( pO2 ) and deposition temperature ( TD ) are studied .	For the x = 0.6 sample grown on LAO , a clear signature of charge ordering at ~275 K is seen in the magnetization and at ~ 260 K in the resistivity data .
1	For each nucleus , we compute the lowest ten thousand states ( $ 5000 $ of each parity ) up to around $ 8 $ MeV in excitation energy , by allowing as many as four broken pairs .	Even tin isotopes of mass number $ A = 108 \sim 124 $ are calculated with realistic interactions in the generalized-seniority approximation of the nuclear shell model .	The lowest fifty eigen energies of each parity are compared with the exact results of the large-scale shell-model calculation .	The wavefunctions of the mid-shell nuclei show a clear pattern of the stepwise breakup of condensed coherent pairs with increasing excitation energy .	We also compute in the canonical ensemble the thermal properties -- level density , entropy , and specific heat -- in relation to the thermal pairing phase transition .
0	We perform the resummation of soft-gluon emissions for squark and gluino production at next- to-next-to-leading-logarithmic ( NNLL ) accuracy .	We include also the one-loop hard matching coefficients as well as Coulomb corrections to second order , using Mellin-moment methods .	We study the characteristics of this resummation in detail for a centre-of-mass ( CM ) energy of 8 TeV at the LHC , and for squark and gluino masses up to 2.5 TeV .	We find significant enhancing effects for all four processes of squark- and gluino-pair production .	Scale dependence is generally reduced compared to NLL resummation , except for gluino-pair production where we find a moderate enhancement .
3	We find that the GMC population in NGC4526 is gravitationally bound , with a virial parameter $ \alpha \sim 1 $ .	We present a high spatial resolution ( $ \approx 20 $ pc ) of $ ^ { 12 } $ CO ( $ 2-1 $ ) observations of the lenticular galaxy NGC4526 .	We identify 103 resolved Giant Molecular Clouds ( GMCs ) and measure their properties : size $ R $ , velocity dispersion $ \sigma_v $ , and luminosity $ L $ .	This is the first GMC catalog of an early-type galaxy .	The mass distribution , $ dN/dM \propto M^ { -2.39 \pm 0.03 } $ , is steeper than that for GMCs in the inner Milky Way , but comparable to that found in some late-type galaxies .
0	Since their discovery at radio wavelengths pulsars have been persistent targets for widespread multi-wave observations throughout optics , radio , X-rays , and high-energy gamma-rays .	Observations with the EGRET gamma-ray telescope , on board Compton GRO satellite , confirmed the expectation of a pulsed high-energy emission up to a few GeV .	Presently , at least seven objects are known as well established high-energy gamma-ray pulsars .	A few of those emit gamma-rays well above 1 GeV .	Forthcoming ground-based Cherenkov telescopes will enable observations of gamma-rays well below 100 GeV , finally reaching the yet unexplored energy gap at tens of GeV.H.E.S.S .
4	In places where the lines are complex and broader , the additional width is most likely due to overlap of narrower features along the line of sight .	We present the first results of a study of the kinematics and morphology of ultracompact HII regions using a new observational technique .	We used very high spatial ( 1.5 '' ) and spectral ( 3.4 km/s ) resolution observations of the [ NeII ] line at 12.8 microns to study the ionized gas in Monoceros R2 .	The [ NeII ] emission shows an HII region with highest emission measure in a ~24 '' shell .	Line widths are as narrow as 8 km/s at some positions .
0	In medical practice , when more than one treatment option is viable , there is little systematic use of individual patient characteristics to estimate which treatment option is most likely to result in a better outcome for the patient .	We introduce a new framework for using statistical models for personalized medicine .	Our framework exploits ( 1 ) data from a randomized comparative trial , and ( 2 ) a regression model for the outcome constructed from domain knowledge and no requirement of correct model specification .	We introduce a new `` improvement '' measure summarizing the extent to which the model 's treatment allocations improve future subject outcomes on average compared to a business-as-usual treatment allocation approach .	Procedures are provided for estimating this measure as well as asymptotically valid confidence intervals .
3	MMJ100047+021021 shows no radio emission and is tentatively identified with a very faint K-band peak which lies at ~1.2 '' from a clumpy optical source .	We present high-resolution interferometric Submillimeter Array ( SMA ) imaging at 890 microns ( ~2 '' resolution ) of two millimeter selected galaxies -- MMJ100015+021549 and MMJ100047+021021 -- discovered with the Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer ( MAMBO ) on the IRAM 30 m telescope and also detected with Bolocam on the CSO , in the COSMOS field .	The first source is significantly detected at the ~11 sigma level , while the second source is tentatively detected at the ~4 sigma level , leading to a positional accuracy of ~0.2-0.3 '' .	MM100015+021549 is identified with a faint radio and K-band source .	The submillimeter-to-radio flux ratio for MM100015+021549 yields a redshift of ~4.8 , consistent with the redshift implied by the UV-to-submillimeter photometry , z~3.0-5.0 .
4	Since relation groups are orbit closed the results here imply that many classes of imprimitive permutation groups are orbit closed .	For a set $ \Omega $ an unordered relation on $ \Omega $ is a family R of subsets of $ \Omega. $ If R is such a relation we let G ( R ) be the group of all permutations on $ \Omega $ that preserves R , that is g belongs to G ( R ) if and only if x in R implies x^ { g } \in R. We are interested in permutation groups which can be represented as G=G ( R ) for a suitable unordered relation R on $ \Omega. $ When this is the case , we say that G is defined by the relation R , or that G is a relation group .	We prove that a primitive permutation group different from the Alternating Group and of degree bigger or equal to 11 is a relation groups .	The same is true for many classes of finite imprimitive groups , and we give general conditions on the size of blocks of imprmitivity , and the groups induced on such blocks , which guarantee that the group is defined by a relation .	This property is closely connected to the orbit closure of permutation groups .
4	Mathematically , it corresponds to the projected characteristic curve of the transport equation of the density-weighted probability density function ( PDF ) .	The Lagrangian dynamics of a single fluid element within a self-gravitational matter field is intrinsically non-local due to the presence of the tidal force .	This complicates the theoretical investigation of the non-linear evolution of various cosmic objects , e.g.dark matter halos , in the context of Lagrangian fluid dynamics , since a fluid parcel with given initial density and shape may evolve differently depending on their environments .	In this paper , we provide a statistical solution that could decouple this environmental dependence .	After deriving the probability distribution evolution equation of the matter field , our method produces a set of closed ordinary differential equations whose solution is uniquely determined by the initial condition of the fluid element .
1	It illustrates properties surprisingly different from its counterpart for points ; for example , a single order- $ k $ Voronoi region may consist of $ \Omega ( n ) $ disjoint faces .	Surprisingly , the order- $ k $ Voronoi diagram of line segments had received no attention in the computational-geometry literature .	We analyze the structural properties of this diagram and show that its combinatorial complexity for $ n $ non-crossing line segments is $ O ( k ( n-k ) ) $ , despite the disconnected regions .	The same bound holds for $ n $ intersecting line segments , when $ k\geq n/2 $ .	We also consider the order- $ k $ Voronoi diagram of line segments that form a planar straight-line graph , and augment the definition of an order- $ k $ Voronoi diagram to cover non-disjoint sites , addressing the issue of non-uniqueness for $ k $ -nearest sites .
2	We prove that the slope of an exceptional truly cosmetic surgery on a hyperbolic knot in $ S^3 $ must be $ \pm 1 $ and the surgery must be toroidal but not Seifert fibred .	This paper concerns the truly or purely cosmetic surgery conjecture .	We give a survey on exceptional surgeries and cosmetic surgeries .	As consequence we show that there are no exceptional truly cosmetic surgeries on certain types of hyperbolic knot in $ S^3 $ .	We also give some properties of Heegaard Floer correction terms and torsion invariants for exceptional cosmetic surgeries on $ S^3 $ .
0	Low missing mass , single- and double diffraction dissociation is calculated for the LHC energies from a dual-Regge model , dominated by a Pomeron Regge pole exchange .	The model reproduces the rich resonance structure in the low missing mass Mx region .	The diffractionly excited states lie on the nucleon trajectory , appended by the isolated Roper resonance .	Detailed predictions for the squared momentum transfer and missing mass dependence of the differential and integrated single- and double diffraction dissociation in the kinematical range of present and future LHC measurements are given .	The model predicts a possible turn-down of the cross section towards , t - & gt ; 0 in a region probably accessible in future experiments in the nearly forward direction .
4	{ \bf41 } ( 2001 ) , 1002 -- 1005 ] , Gutman and Vidovi\ ' { c } conjectured that the bicyclic graph with maximal energy is $ P^ { 6,6 } _n $ , for $ n=14 $ and $ n\geq 16 $ .	The energy of a simple graph $ G $ , denoted by $ E ( G ) $ , is defined as the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix .	Let $ C_n $ denote the cycle of order $ n $ and $ P^ { 6,6 } _n $ the graph obtained from joining two cycles $ C_6 $ by a path $ P_ { n-12 } $ with its two leaves .	Let $ \mathscr { B } _n $ denote the class of all bipartite bicyclic graphs but not the graph $ R_ { a , b } $ , which is obtained from joining two cycles $ C_a $ and $ C_b $ ( $ a , b\geq 10 $ and $ a \equiv b\equiv 2\ , ( \ , \textmd { mod } \ , 4 ) $ ) by an edge .

1	The solution is exact in the weak disorder limit at a fixed inter-chain coupling .	We solve the Anderson localization problem on a two-leg ladder by the Fokker-Planck equation approach .	The study is motivated by progress in investigating the hybrid particles such as cavity polaritons .	This application corresponds to parametrically different intra-chain hopping integrals ( a `` fast '' chain coupled to a `` slow '' chain ) .	We show that the canonical Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar ( DMPK ) equation is insufficient for this problem .
3	We argue in this paper that both behaviours may be at least qualitatively understood in terms of a dynamically evolving self-similarity , rather than the form for self-similar infall that is fixed by cosmological initial conditions .	Simulated dark matter profiles are often modelled as a `NFW ' density profile rather than a single power law .	Recently , attention has turned to the rather rigorous power-law behaviour exhibited by the `pseudo phase-space density ' of the dark matter halo , which is defined dimensionally in terms of the local density and velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles .	The non-power-law behaviour of the density profile is generally taken to exclude simple scale-free , in-fall models ; however the power-law behaviour of the `pseudo-density ' is a counter indication .	The evolution is likely due to collective relaxation such as that provided by the radial-orbit instability on large scales .
2	We present a general overview of the problem , together with a more detailed discussion of the prototype example , namely , Guinier-Preston zones in Al-based alloys .	Nanoscale inhomogeneities are typical for numerous metallic alloys and crucially important for their practical applications .	At the same time , stabilization mechanisms of such a state are poorly understood .	It is shown that coherent strain due to a misfit between inclusion and host crystal lattices plays a decisive role in the emergence of the inhomogeneous state .	We suggest a model explaining formation of ultrathin plates ( with the thickness of a few lattice constants ) typical for Al-Cu alloys .
0	Phonon dynamics , charge response and the phonon density of states are calculated for the high-temperature superconductors HgBa $ _ { 2 } $ CuO $ _ { 4 } $ and Bi $ _ { 2 } $ Sr $ _ { 2 } $ CuO $ _ { 6 } $ within a microscopic model for the electronic density response .	The results are compared with previous calculations for La $ _ { 2 } $ CuO $ _ { 4 } $ and Nd $ _ { 2 } $ CuO $ _ { 4 } $ .	Our main focus is on the phononanomalies which are connected with the high-frequency oxygen bond-stretching modes ( OBSM ) found before in our calculations for $ p $ -doped La $ _ { 2 } $ CuO $ _ { 4 } $ and $ n $ -doped Nd $ _ { 2 } $ CuO $ _ { 4 } $ .	We investigate the question if the characteristic softening of the OBSM and the related strong coupling to the electrons is also present in HgBa $ _ { 2 } $ CuO $ _ { 4 } $ and Bi $ _ { 2 } $ Sr $ _ { 2 } $ CuO $ _ { 6 } $ .	In particular the importance of the contribution of the more delocalized Cu $ 4s $ state besides the localized Cu3d state on the softening is investigated and the different anticrossing behaviour due to the presence of several phonon modes with the same symmetry as the OBSM is studied making the identification of the anomalies quite complicate .
3	The problem is formulated as joint power and subcarrier allocation with the objective of maximizing average aggregate information rate of all NU 's while maintaining an average secrecy rate for each individual SU under a total transmit power constraint for the base station .	Providing physical-layer security for mobile users in future broadband wireless networks is of both theoretical and practical importance .	In this paper , we formulate an analytical framework for resource allocation in a downlink OFDMA-based broadband network with coexistence of secure users ( SU ) and normal users ( NU ) .	The SU 's require secure data transmission at the physical layer while the NU 's are served with conventional best-effort data traffic .	We solve this problem in an asymptotically optimal manner using dual decomposition .
0	The transition of several East and Central European countries and the countries of the Former Soviet Union from the socialist economic system to the capitalist one is studied .	A recently developed microeconomic model for the personal income distribution and its evolution and a simple functional relationship between the rate of the per capita GDP growth and the attained level of the per capita GDP are used to describe the transition process .	The developed transition model contains only three defining parameters and describes the process of real GDP per capita evolution during the last 15 years .	It is found that the transition process finished in the Central European countries several years ago and their economic evolution is defined by pure capitalist rules .	In the long run , this means that the future of these countries has to follow the same path , i.e.dependence on the per capita GDP growth rate of the per capita GDP itself , as the developed countries have had in the past .
0	We analyse the relationship between irrationality and quasiperiodicity in nonlinear driven systems .	To that purpose we consider a nonlinear system whose steady-state response is very sensitive to the periodic or quasiperiodic character of the input signal .	In the infinite time limit , an input signal consisting of two incommensurate frequencies will be recognised by the system as quasiperiodic .	We show that this is in general not true in the case of finite interaction times .	An irrational ratio of the driving frequencies of the input signal is not sufficient for it to be recognised by the nonlinear system as quasiperiodic , resulting in observations which may differ by several orders of magnitude from the expected quasiperiodic behavior .
4	Also , the upper bound on the size of the complement automaton is not linear in the bound of its state space .	The precise complexity of complementing B\ '' uchi automata is an intriguing and long standing problem .	While optimal complementation techniques for finite automata are simple - it suffices to determinize them using a simple subset construction and to dualize the acceptance condition of the resulting automaton - B\ '' uchi complementation is more involved .	Indeed , the construction of an EXPTIME complementation procedure took a quarter of a century from the introduction of B\ '' uchi automata in the early 60s , and stepwise narrowing the gap between the upper and lower bound to a simple exponent ( of ( 6e ) n for B\ '' uchi automata with n states ) took four decades .	While the distance between the known upper ( O ' ( 0.96 n ) n ' ) and lower ( ' ( 0.76 n ) n ' ) bound on the required number of states has meanwhile been significantly reduced , an exponential factor remains between them .
1	In the maximally non-hermitean limit , we give a simple `` one-line '' proof of this feature .	Recent analytical and numerical work have shown that the spectrum of the random non-hermitean Hamiltonian on a ring which models the physics of vortex line pinning in superconductors is one dimensional .	We then study the spectral curves for various distributions of the random site energies .	We find that a critical transition occurs when the average of the logarithm of the random site energy squared vanishes .	For a large class of probability distributions of the site energies , we find that as the randomness increases the energy at which the localization-delocalization transition occurs increases , reaches a maximum , and then decreases .
4	Present-day horizontal slab segments may thus explain the diminution of the convergence velocity between the Nazca and South American plates since Late Miocene .	We discuss the relationships between Andean shortening , plate velocities at the trench , and slab geometry beneath South America .	Although some correlation exists between the convergence velocity and the westward motion of South America on the one hand , and the shortening of the continental plate on the other hand , plate kinematics neither gives a satisfactory explanation to the Andean segmentation in general , nor explains the development of the Bolivian orocline in Paleogene times .	We discuss the Cenozoic history of horizontal slab segments below South America , arguing that they result from the subduction of oceanic plateaus whose effect is to switch the buoyancy of the young subducting plate to positive .	We argue that the existence of horizontal slab segments , below the Central Andes during Eocene-Oligocene times , and below Peru and North-Central Chile since Pliocene , resulted ( 1 ) in the shortening of the continental plate interiors at a large distance from the trench , ( 2 ) in stronger interplate coupling and ultimately , ( 3 ) in a decrease of the trenchward velocity of the oceanic plate .
0	Slovenia 's Current Research Information System ( SICRIS ) currently hosts 86,443 publications with citation data from 8,359 researchers working on the whole plethora of social and natural sciences from 1970 till present .	Using these data , we show that the citation distributions derived from individual publications have Zipfian properties in that they can be fitted by a power law $ P ( x ) \sim x^ { -\alpha } $ , with $ \alpha $ between 2.4 and 3.1 depending on the institution and field of research .	Distributions of indexes that quantify the success of researchers rather than individual publications , on the other hand , can not be associated with a power law .	We find that for Egghe 's g-index and Hirsch 's h-index the log-normal form $ P ( x ) \sim \exp [ -a\ln x -b ( \ln x ) ^2 ] $ applies best , with $ a $ and $ b $ depending moderately on the underlying set of researchers .	In special cases , particularly for institutions with a strongly hierarchical constitution and research fields with high self-citation rates , exponential distributions can be observed as well .
1	Here we consider such pulses for selective measurements on a single system .	The quantum Zeno effect ( QZE ) predicts a slow-down of the time development of a system under rapidly repeated ideal measurements , and experimentally this was tested for an ensemble of atoms using short laser pulses for non-selective state measurements .	Each probe pulse will cause a burst of fluorescence or no fluorescence .	If the probe pulses were strictly ideal measurements , the QZE would predict periods of fluorescence bursts alternating with periods of no fluorescence ( light and dark periods ) which would become longer and longer with increasing frequency of the measurements .	The non-ideal character of the measurements is taken into account by incorporating the laser pulses in the interaction , and this is used to determine the corrections to the ideal case .
3	The next generation of stars then must form in this gas-poor environment , creating the first galaxies that produce the majority of ionizing radiation during cosmic reionization .	The first stars in the universe are thought to be massive , forming in dark matter halos with masses around 10^6 solar masses .	Recent simulations suggest that these metal-free ( Population III ) stars may form in binary or multiple systems .	Because of their high stellar masses and small host halos , their feedback ionizes the surrounding 3 kpc of intergalactic medium and drives the majority of the gas from the potential well .	I will review the latest developments in the field of Population III star formation and feedback and its impact on galaxy formation prior to reionization .
1	The novelty of the present work is twofold .	We revisit and generalize , to the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system , previous results of D. Christodoulou and D. Chae concerning global solutions for the Einstein-scalar field and the Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs equations .	For one thing the assumption on the self-interaction potential is improved .	For another thing explanation is furnished why the solutions obtained here and those proved by Chae for the Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs decay more slowly than those established by Christodoulou in the case of self-gravitating scalar fields .	Actually this latter phenomenon stems from the non-vanishing local charge in Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs and Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs models .
4	In this paper , we propose an alternative approach for merging multiple SI frames , using a piecewise constant ( PWC ) function as the merge operator .	The ability to efficiently switch from one pre-encoded video stream to another ( e.g. , for bitrate adaptation or view switching ) is important for many interactive streaming applications .	Recently , stream-switching mechanisms based on distributed source coding ( DSC ) have been proposed .	In order to reduce the overall transmission rate , these approaches provide a `` merge '' mechanism , where information is sent to the decoder such that the exact same frame can be reconstructed given that any one of a known set of side information ( SI ) frames is available at the decoder ( e.g. , each SI frame may correspond to a different stream from which we are switching ) .	However , the use of bit-plane coding and channel coding in many DSC approaches leads to complex coding and decoding .
4	Finally , a regularity of tropical curves in the duality sense is generally defined and , studied for families of tropical quadrics .	Duality of curves is one of the important aspects of the `` classical '' algebraic geometry .	In this paper , using this foundation , the duality of tropical polynomials is constructed to introduce the duality of Non-Archimedean curves .	Using the development of `` mechanism '' which is based on `` distortion '' values and their matrices , we discuss some aspects refereing to quadrics with respect to their dual objects .	This topic includes also the induced dual subdivision of Newton Polytope and its compatible properties .
4	Ordinary gravitating matter , i.e. , matter without microscopic internal degrees of freedom , can probe only the Riemannian spacetime geometry .	We derive the equations of motion in metric-affine gravity by making use of the conservation laws obtained from Noether 's theorem .	The results are given in the form of propagation equations for the multipole decomposition of the matter sources in metric-affine gravity , i.e. , the canonical energy-momentum current and the hypermomentum current .	In particular , the propagation equations allow for a derivation of the equations of motion of test particles in this generalized gravity theory , and allow for direct identification of the couplings between the matter currents and the gauge gravitational field strengths of the theory , namely , the curvature , the torsion , and the nonmetricity .	We demonstrate that the possible non-Riemannian spacetime geometry can only be detected with the help of the test bodies that are formed of matter with microstructure .
1	The equations of motion of the stars in the cluster are solved by direct N-body integration while taking the effects of stellar evolution and the hydrodynamics of the natal gas content into account .	We study the evolution of embedded clusters .	The gravity of the stars and the surrounding gas are coupled self consistently to allow the realistic dynamical evolution of the cluster .	While the equations of motion are solved , a stellar evolution code keeps track of the changes in stellar mass , luminosity and radius .	The gas liberated by the stellar winds and supernovae deposits mass and energy into the gas reservoir in which the cluster is embedded .
0	The quark-model baryon-baryon interaction fss2 , proposed by the Kyoto-Niigata group , is a unified model for the complete baryon octet ( B_8=N , Lambda , Sigma and Xi ) , which is formulated in a framework of the ( 3q ) - ( 3q ) resonating-group method ( RGM ) using the spin-flavor SU_6 quark-model wave functions and effective meson-exchange potentials at the quark level .	Model parameters are determined to reproduce properties of the nucleon-nucleon system and the low-energy cross section data for the hyperon-nucleon scattering .	Due to the several improvements including the introduction of vector-meson exchange potentials , fss2 has achieved very accurate description of the NN and YN interactions , comparable to various one-boson exchange potentials .	We review the essential features of fss2 and our previous model FSS , and their predictions to few-body systems in confrontation with the available experimental data .	Some characteristic features of the B_8 B_8 interactions with the higher strangeness , S=-2 , -3 , -4 , predicted by fss2 are discussed .
1	These observations raise new questions about the formation and evolution of these sources .	The INTEGRAL satellite , observing the sky at high energy , has quadrupled the number of supergiant X-ray Binaries known in the Galaxy and has revealed new populations of previously hidden High Mass X-ray Binaries .	The number of detected sources is now high enough to allow us to carry out a statistical analysis of the distribution of HMXBs in the Milky Way .	We derive the distance of each HMXB using a Spectral Energy Distribution fitting procedure , and we examine the correlation with the distribution of star forming complexes ( SFCs ) in the Galaxy .	We show that HMXBs are clustered with SFCs , with a typical size of 0.3 kpc and a characteristic distance between clusters of 1.7 kpc .
0	Geometric aspects of the filtration on classical links by k-quasi-isotopy are discussed , including the effect of Whitehead doubling , relations with Smythe 's n-splitting and Kobayashi 's k-contractibility .	One observation is : \omega-quasi-isotopy is equivalent to PL isotopy for links in a homotopy 3-sphere ( resp .	contractible open 3-manifold ) M if and only if M is homeomorphic to S^3 ( resp.R^3 ) .	As a byproduct of the proof of the `` if '' part , we obtain that every compact subset of an acyclic open set in a compact orientable 3-manifold M is contained in a PL homology 3-ball in M. We show that k-quasi-isotopy implies ( k+1 ) -cobordism of Cochran and Orr .	If z^ { m-1 } ( c_0 + c_1 z^2 + ... + c_n z^ { 2n } ) denotes the Conway polynomial of an m-component link , it follows that the residue class of c_k modulo gcd ( c_0 , .. , c_ { k-1 } ) is invariant under k-quasi-isotopy .
2	The approach is based on the position/velocity phase-space particle distribution .	Modeling dispersed solid phases in fluids still represents a computational challenge when considering a small-scale coupling in wide systems , such as the atmosphere or industrial processes at high Reynolds numbers .	A numerical method is here introduced for simulating the dynamics of diffusive heavy inertial particles in turbulent flows .	The discretization of velocities is inspired from lattice Boltzmann methods and is chosen to match discrete displacements between two time steps .	For each spatial position , the time evolution of particles momentum is approximated by a finite-volume approach .
1	In a previous paper we have constructed a 10-local finite-range interaction among qubits on a 2D lattice having this property .	What is the simplest Hamiltonian which can implement quantum computation without requiring any control operations during the computation process ?	Here we show that pair-interactions among qutrits on a 2D lattice are sufficient , too , and can also implement an ergodic computer where the result can be read out from the time average state after some post-selection with high success probability .	Two of the 3 qutrit states are given by the two levels of a spin-1/2 particle located at a specific lattice site , the third state is its absence .	Usual hopping terms together with an attractive force among adjacent particles induce a coupled quantum walk where the particle spins are subjected to spatially inhomogeneous interactions implementing holonomic quantum computing .
0	We discuss charged lepton flavour violating processes occurring in the presence of muonic atoms , such as muon-electron conversion in nuclei $ \text { CR } ( \mu -e , \text { N } ) $ , the ( Coulomb enhanced ) decay of muonic atoms into a pair of electrons BR ( $ \mu^- e^- \to e^- e^- $ , N ) , as well as Muonium conversion and decay , $ \text { Mu } -\bar { \text { Mu } } $ and $ \text { Mu } \to e^+ e^- $ .	Any experimental signal of these observables calls for scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model .	In this work , we consider minimal extensions of the Standard Model via the addition of sterile fermions , providing the corresponding complete analytical expressions for all the considered observables .	We first consider an `` ad hoc '' extension with a single sterile fermion state , and investigate its impact on the above observables .	Two well motivated mechanisms of neutrino mass generation are then considered : the Inverse Seesaw embedded into the Standard Model , and the $ \nu $ MSM .
2	We focus on the regime where one of the phases has very small volume fraction , thus creating small `` droplets '' of the minority phase in a `` sea '' of the majority phase .	This is the first in a series of two papers in which we derive a $ \Gamma $ -expansion for a two-dimensional non-local Ginzburg-Landau energy with Coulomb repulsion , also known as the Ohta-Kawasaki model in connection with diblock copolymer systems .	In that model , two phases appear , which interact via a nonlocal Coulomb type energy .	In this paper we show that an appropriate setting for $ \Gamma $ -convergence in the considered parameter regime is via weak convergence of the suitably normalized charge density in the sense of measures .	We prove that , after a suitable rescaling , the Ohta-Kawasaki energy functional $ \Gamma $ -converges to a quadratic energy functional of the limit charge density generated by the screened Coulomb kernel .
3	Our basic strategy for reducing the number of features is to employ the idea of recently proposed safe feature screening ( SFS ) rule .	Taking into account high-order interactions among covariates is valuable in many practical regression problems .	This is , however , computationally challenging task because the number of high-order interaction features to be considered would be extremely large unless the number of covariates is sufficiently small .	In this paper , we propose a novel efficient algorithm for LASSO-based sparse learning of such high-order interaction models .	An SFS rule has a property that , if a feature satisfies the rule , then the feature is guaranteed to be non-active in the LASSO solution , meaning that it can be safely screened-out prior to the LASSO training process .
3	The proposal is conveniently formulated in a democratic basis , with Yukawas and soft terms of the form const .	CP violation in the SM is naturally implemented as a small imaginary perturbation to real Yukawa couplings .	For example , a large CP asymmetry in B_d decays can arise if the imaginary parts of quark mass matrices are of order 10^ ( -3 ) m_t , b or smaller .	Applying the same principle of `` additive CP violation '' to soft SUSY-breaking terms , the electric dipole moments of the neutron and mercury atom are predicted near current experimental limits ; for nonuniversal A-terms , EDM bounds can be satisfied given certain flavour structures .	x ( 1+eps+i zeta ) where eps & lt ; & lt ; 1 , zeta & lt ; ~10^ ( -3 ) , motivated by approximate permutation x CP symmetry .
4	Recently a redshift z=0.18 +/- 0.01 has been claimed on the basis of the detection of a single X-ray line at 5.44 +/- 0.05 keV interpreted as a 6.4 keV ( rest frame ) fluorescent line .	The Fermi/LAT instrument has detected about two thousands Extragalactic High Energy ( E & gt ; 100 MeV ) gamma-ray sources .	One of the brightest is 3FGL 1603.9-4903 , associated to the radio source PMN J1603-4904 .	Its nature is not yet clear , it could be either a very peculiar BL Lac or a CSO ( Compact Symmetric Object ) radio source , considered as the early stage of a radio galaxy .	The latter , if confirmed , would be the first detection in gamma-rays for this class of objects .
4	Few-cycle optical pulses help reveal that quantum-mechanically determined molecular symmetry contributes to strong field molecular ionization .	Few-cycle pulses of intense 800 nm light are used to probe ionization and dissociation of carbon disulfide in the intensity and temporal regime where rescattering is expected to dominate the laser-molecule interaction .	The wavepacket of the rescattered electron destructively interferes with the anti-bonding $ \pi $ -orbital of CS $ _2^+ $ such that rescattering is effectively `` switched off '' .	Direct signature of enhanced ionization being `` switched off '' in the ultrashort domain is also obtained .	Consequently , dissociation becomes an almost non-existent channel when few-cycle pulses are used , with only long-lived singly- , doubly- , and triply-charged molecular ions dominating the mass spectrum .
1	The optical trap allows us to couple the |F =1 , mF =0 & gt ; \rightarrow |F =2 , mF =0 & gt ; clock states using a single photon 6.8GHz microwave transition , while state selective readout is achieved with absorption imaging .	We present a Ramsey-type atom interferometer operating with an optically trapped sample of 10^6 Bose-condensed Rb-87 atoms .	Interference fringes with contrast approaching 100 % are observed for short evolution times .	We analyse the process of absorption imaging and show that it is possible to observe atom number variance directly , with a signal-to-noise ratio ten times better than the atomic projection noise limit on 10^6 condensate atoms .	We discuss the technical and fundamental noise sources that limit our current system , and outline the improvements that can be made .
3	Our investigation reveals detailed analytical results on fragmentations in a three-opinion model , which are confirmed by agent-based simulations .	Adaptive models of opinion formation among humans can display a fragmentation transition , where a social network breaks into disconnected components .	Here , we investigate this transition in a class of models with arbitrary number of opinions .	In contrast to previous work we do not assume that opinions are equidistant or arranged on a one-dimensional conceptual axis .	Furthermore , we show that in certain models the number of opinions can be reduced without affecting the fragmentation points .
4	Hence , the semidirect product $ G $ is of central type .	A finite group $ G $ is of central type ( in the non-classical sense ) if it admits a non-degenerate cohomology class $ [ c ] \in H^2 ( G , \C^* ) $ ( $ G $ acts trivially on $ \C^* $ ) .	Groups of central type play a fundamental role in the classification of semisimple triangular complex Hopf algebras and can be determined by their representation theoretical properties .	Suppose that a finite group $ Q $ acts on an abelian group $ A $ so that there exists a bijective 1-cocycle $ \pi\in Z^1 ( Q , \ach ) $ , where $ \ach=\rm { Hom } ( A , \C^* ) $ is endowed with the diagonal $ Q $ -action .	Under this assumption , Etingof and Gelaki gave an explicit formula for a non-degenerate 2-cocycle in $ Z^2 ( G , \C^* ) $ , where $ G : =A\rtimes Q $ .
4	We study the correlation between the CP ( and forward -- backward ) asymmetries and the expected value of the inclusive branching ratio .	We study the effect of new flavor changing SUSY phases arising in the squark mass matrix in semileptonic decays B- & gt ; Xs ll and B- & gt ; K ( * ) ll ( l=e , mu ) .	SUSY effects are parametrized using the mass insertion approximation formalism .	Constraints on SUSY contributions coming from other processes ( e.g.b- & gt ; s gamma , B- & gt ; K* ll ) are taken into account .	Chargino and gluino contributions to photon and Z-mediated decays are included and non-perturbative corrections are considered .
1	These phase transitions are analyzed both in terms of the empirical measure and the spin per site by studying bifurcation phenomena of the corresponding sets of canonical equilibrium macrostates , which are defined via large deviation principles .	In this paper we give a complete analysis of the phase transitions in the mean-field Blume-Emery-Griffiths lattice-spin model with respect to the canonical ensemble , showing both a second-order , continuous phase transition and a first-order , discontinuous phase transition for appropriate values of the thermodynamic parameters that define the model .	Analogous phase transitions with respect to the microcanonical ensemble are also studied via a combination of rigorous analysis and numerical calculations .	Finally , probabilistic limit theorems for appropriately scaled values of the total spin are proved with respect to the canonical ensemble .	These limit theorems include both central-limit-type theorems when the thermodynamic parameters are not equal to critical values and non-central-limit-type theorems when these parameters equal critical values .
2	We have also attempted to detect flaring radio emission from the HR 8799 planetary system , guided by theoretical work indicating that hot , massive exoplanets may have strong magnetic fields capable of generating radio emission at GHz frequencies .	We present the results of a 4.75 GHz survey of 33 brown dwarfs and one young exoplanetary system for flaring radio emission , conducted with the 305-m Arecibo radio telescope .	The goal of this program was to detect and characterize the magnetic fields of objects cooler than spectral type L3.5 , the coolest brown dwarf detected prior to our survey .	We have detected and confirmed radio flares from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS J10475385+2124234 .	This detection dramatically extends the temperature range over which brown dwarfs appear to be at least sporadic radio-emitters , from ~1900 K ( L3.5 ) down to ~900 K ( T6.5 ) .
2	Specifically , we use query feedback from a workload as training data to estimate a histogram with a small memory footprint that minimizes the expected error on future queries .	In this paper , we consider the problem of estimating self-tuning histograms using query workloads .	To this end , we propose a general learning theoretic formulation .	Our formulation provides a framework in which different approaches can be studied and developed .	We first study the simple class of equi-width histograms and present a learning algorithm , EquiHist , that is competitive in many settings .
1	Our calculations accurately reproduce Feshbach spectroscopy data on Na $ ^ { 40 } $ K and explain the origin of the observed multiplets in the p-wave [ Phys.Rev .	We study theoretically magnetically induced Feshbach resonances and near-threshold bound states in isotopic NaK pairs .	A 85 , 051602 ( R ) ( 2012 ) ] .	We apply the model to predict scattering and bound state threshold properties of the boson-boson Na $ ^ { 39 } $ K and Na $ ^ { 41 } $ K systems .	We find that the Na $ ^ { 39 } $ K isotopic pair presents broad magnetic Feshbach resonances and favorable ground-state features for producing non-reactive polar molecules by two-photon association .
0	In this talk , we describe the effects of extended fermion sectors , respecting custodial symmetry , on Higgs production and decay .	The resulting protection for the Z- & gt ; b_L b_L and Z- & gt ; \tau_R \tau_R decays allows for potentially interesting signals in Higgs physics , while maintaining the good agreement of the Standard Model with precision tests .	The setups can be motivated as the low energy effective theories of the composite Higgs models MCHM_5 and MCHM_10 , where the spectra can be identified with the light custodians present in these theories .	We will show that these describe the relevant physics in the fermion sectors in a simplified and transparent way .	In contrast to previous studies of composite models , the impact of a realistic lepton sector on the Higgs decays is taken into account .
4	The small value of the electric field indicates participation of the collective state in formation of the energy levels inside the Peierls gap .	Energy structure of the Peierls gap in orthorhombic TaS $ _3 $ is examined by spectral study of photoconduction .	The gap edge and energy levels inside the Peierls gap are observed .	The amplitude of the energy levels is found to depend on both the temperature and the electric field .	The electric field of the order of 10 V/cm affects the energy levels and leads to the redistribution of intensity between peaks .
1	We investigate three main galaxy samples : $ 18.0 & lt ; i_ { \rm AB } & lt ; 22.0 $ , $ 18.0 & lt ; i_ { \rm AB } & lt ; 23.0 $ , $ 18.0 & lt ; i_ { \rm AB } & lt ; 24.0 $ in the redshift range $ 0.2 & lt ; z & lt ; 1.3 $ in each of the four CFHTLenS wide fields .	We measure the cross-power spectrum between galaxy density from Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Lensing Survey ( CFHTLenS ) catalogues and gravitational lensing convergence from Planck data release 1 ( 2013 ) and 2 ( 2015 ) .	By comparing the measured cross-spectrum with model predictions , linear galaxy-dark matter biases of $ b=0.82^ { +0.24 } _ { -0.23 } , 0.83^ { +0.19 } _ { -0.18 } , 0.82^ { +0.16 } _ { -0.14 } $ are inferred at significances of $ 3.5 , 4.5 , 5.6\sigma $ using the Planck 2015 release .	These measurements are marginally consistent with biases derived from galaxy-galaxy auto-correlations : $ b=1.15^ { +0.02 } _ { -0.01 } , 1.08^ { +0.01 } _ { -0.01 } $ and $ 0.96^ { +0.01 } _ { -0.01 } $ respectively .	Using the 2013 Planck release , we obtain biases of $ b=1.33^ { +0.29 } _ { -0.28 } , 1.19^ { +0.23 } _ { -0.23 } , 1.16^ { +0.19 } _ { -0.18 } $ , showing significant differences between the releases .
3	Theoretical calculations were carried out using the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method within the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation for exchange and correlation effects .	The structural behaviour of CsCdF3 under pressure is investigated by means of theory and experiment .	High-pressure powder x-ray diffraction experiments were performed up to a maximum pressure of 60 GPa using synchrotron radiation .	The cubic $ Pm\bar { 3 } m $ crystal symmetry persists throughout this pressure range .	The calculated ground state properties -- the equilibrium lattice constant , bulk modulus and elastic constants -- are in good agreement with experimental results .
4	Because of the severe absorption of the optical light , the featureless mid-infrared spectrum , and the relatively flat radio continuum , the dusty star-cluster SEDs are good approximations to most of the submm sources in our samples .	There is growing evidence that some star-forming galaxies at z & gt ; 1 are characterized by high efficiencies and specific star formation rates .	In the local universe , these traits are shared by `` active '' Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies ( BCDs ) with compact and dense star-forming regions .	The Spectral Energy Distributions ( SEDs ) of these BCDs are dominated by young massive star clusters , embedded in a cocoon of dust .	In this Letter , we incorporate these BCD SEDs as templates for two samples of high-redshift galaxy populations selected at submm wavelengths .
0	A recent lattice calculation of the QCD running coupling is presented .	The coupling is extracted from the force between two static quarks in the framework of the valence quark approximation .	A value of the Lambda-parameter for zero quark flavours is determined : Lambda_msbar=0.630 ( 38 ) \sqrt { \sigma } =293 ( 18 ) ^ { +25 } _ { -63 } MeV .	The first error is statistical , the second stems from the overall scale uncertainty in the string tension sigma .	Combining this value with results from full QCD lattice simulations , we end up with the estimate $ \Lambda^ { ( 4 ) } _ { \overline { MS } } =129 ( 8 ) ^ { +43 } _ { -60 } $ ~MeV or $ \alpha_ { \overline { MS } } ( m_Z ) =0.102^ { +06 } _ { -11 } $ .
3	We also obtain the solutions of the field equation inside a spherically symmetric body and show how they can be connected to exterior solutions that accommodate the Vainshtein mechanism .	We study how the Vainshtein mechanism operates in the most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order equations of motion .	The field equations of motion , which can be also applicable to most of other screening scenarios proposed in literature , are generally derived in a spherically symmetric space-time with a matter source .	In the presence of a field coupling to the Ricci scalar , we clarify conditions under which the Vainshtein mechanism is at work in a weak gravitational background .	We apply our general results to a number of concrete models such as the covariant/extended Galileons and the DBI Galileons with Gauss-Bonnet and other terms .
4	Using two concrete examples involving spin-1/2 fermions , we show how the original system can be mapped into a model describing spinless fermions with nearest neighbor p-wave interaction , whose ground state can be a topological superfluid that supports Majorana fermions under proper conditions .	P-wave interaction in cold atoms may give rise to exotic topological superfluids .	However , the realization of p-wave interaction in cold atom system is experimentally challenging .	Here we propose a simple scheme to synthesize effective $ p $ -wave interaction in conventional $ s $ -wave interacting quantum gases .	The key idea is to load atoms into spin-dependent optical lattice potential .
3	The remaining range of probability $ p $ is discussed with more attention .	Emergence of dominating cliques in Erd\ '' os-R\'enyi random graph model $ { \bbbg ( n , p ) } $ is investigated in this paper .	It is shown this phenomenon possesses a phase transition .	Namely , we have argued that , given a constant probability $ p $ , an $ n $ -node random graph $ G $ from $ { \bbbg ( n , p ) } $ and for $ r= c \log_ { 1/p } n $ with $ 1 \leq c \leq 2 $ , it holds : ( 1 ) if $ p & gt ; 1/2 $ then an $ r $ -node clique is dominating in $ G $ almost surely and , ( 2 ) if $ p \leq ( 3 - \sqrt { 5 } ) /2 $ then an $ r $ -node clique is not dominating in $ G $ almost surely .	A detailed study shows that this problem is answered by examination of sub-logarithmic growth of $ r $ upon $ n $ .
3	By analyzing real App usage log data , we discover two kinds of features : The Explicit Feature ( EF ) from sensing readings of built-in sensors , and the Implicit Feature ( IF ) from App usage relations .	With the increasing number of mobile Apps developed , they are now closely integrated into daily life .	In this paper , we develop a framework to predict mobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status of a smartphone .	Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial prerequisite for fast App launching , intelligent user experience , and power management of smartphones .	The IF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph ( abbreviated as AUG ) that models App usage transitions .
4	[ A ] and in [ AB ] ( joint work with A. Burchard ) where tools are developed for establishing a curve -- regularity condition which plays a key role in the construction of the limit .	The talk presented at ICMP 97 focused on the scaling limits of critical percolation models , and some other systems whose salient features can be described by collections of random lines .	In the scaling limit we keep track of features seen on the macroscopic scale , in situations where the short -- distance scale at which the system 's basic variables are defined is taken to zero .	Among the challenging questions are the construction of the limit , and the explanation of some of the emergent properties , in particular the behavior under conformal maps as discussed in [ LPS 94 ] .	A descriptive account of the project , and some related open problems , is found in ref .
0	Apart from its mass and width , the most important property of a new charged gauge boson , $ W ' $ , is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions .	Such particles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model .	In this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $ W ' $ coupling helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $ \ell +E_T^ { miss } $ discovery channel .	We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution , reconstructed from this final state in the $ W-W ' $ interference region , provides the best determination of this quantity .	To make such measurements requires integrated luminosities of $ \sim 10 ( 60 ) fb^ { -1 } $ assuming $ M_ { W ' } =1.5 ( 2.5 ) $ TeV and provided that the $ W ' $ couplings have Standard Model magnitude .
4	In this paper we study Ricci-flat ALE Kahler metrics on X .	Let G be a nontrivial finite subgroup of U ( m ) acting freely on C^m - 0 .	Then C^m/G has an isolated quotient singularity at 0 .	Let X be a resolution of C^m/G , and g a Kahler metric on X .	We say that g is Asymptotically Locally Euclidean ( ALE ) if it is asymptotic in a certain way to the Euclidean metric on C^m/G .
4	Bouncing universes can also be constructed .	Inclusion of $ f ( R ) $ term in the action of Horava-Lifshitz quantum gravity with projectability but without detailed balance condition is investigated , where $ R $ denotes the 3-spatial dimensional Ricci scalar .	Conditions for the spin-0 graviton to be free of ghosts and instability are studied .	The requirement that the theory reduce to general relativity in the IR makes the scalar mode unstable in the Minkowski background but stable in the de Sitter .	It is remarkable that the dark sector , dark matter and dark energy , of the universe has a naturally geometric origin in such a setup .
2	The hypothesis is checked in the case of the compact abelian theories , where we show how condensing monopole -instanton fields are reproduced by the summation over surfaces .	We propose a hypothesis that all gauge theories are equivalent to a certain non-standard string theory .	Different gauge groups are accounted for by weights ascribed to the world sheets of different topologies .	In the non-abelian case we prove that the loop equations are satisfied modulo contact terms .	The structure of these terms unfortunately remains undetermined .
2	Here , we consider the minimal ingredients for the existence of dynamic instability by considering a single polymorphic filament that grows by binding to a substrate , undergoes a conformation change , and may unbind as a consequence of the residual strains induced by this change .	The intermittent transition between slow growth and rapid shrinkage in polymeric assemblies is termed dynamic instability , a feature observed in a variety of biochemically distinct assemblies including microtubules , actin and their bacterial analogs .	The existence of this labile phase of a polymer has many functional consequences in cytoskeletal dynamics , and its repeated appearance suggests that it is relatively easy to evolve .	We identify two parameters that control the phase space of possibilities for the filament : a structural mechanical parameter that characterizes the ratio of the bond strengths along the filament to those with the substrate ( or equivalently the ratio of longitudinal to lateral interactions in an assembly ) , and a kinetic parameter that characterizes the ratio of time scales for growth and conformation change .	In the deterministic limit , these parameters serve to demarcate a region of uninterrupted growth from that of collapse .
4	Second , the fast decay of turbulence is not related to the compressibility of fluid .	Recent advances in understanding of the basic properties of compressible Magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD ) turbulence call for revisions of some of the generally accepted concepts .	First , MHD turbulence is not so messy as it is usually believed .	In fact , the notion of strong non-linear coupling of compressible and incompressible motions is not tenable .	Alfven , slow and fast modes of MHD turbulence follow their own cascades and exhibit degrees of anisotropy consistent with theoretical expectations .
0	Diffusion limited reaction of the Lotka-Volterra type is analyzed taking into account the discrete nature of the reactants .	In the continuum approximation , the dynamics is dominated by an elliptic fixed-point .	This fixed-point becomes unstable due to discretization effects , a scenario similar to quantum phase transitions .	As a result , the long-time asymptotic behavior of the system changes and the dynamics flows into a limit cycle .	The results are verified by numerical simulations .
0	We investigate the behavior of the Weak Gravity Conjecture ( WGC ) under toroidal compactification and RG flows , finding evidence that WGC bounds for single photons become weaker in the infrared .	By contrast , we find that a photon satisfying the WGC will not necessarily satisfy it after toroidal compactification when black holes charged under the Kaluza-Klein photons are considered .	Doing so either requires an infinite number of states of different charges to satisfy the WGC in the original theory or a restriction on allowed compactification radii .	These subtleties suggest that if the Weak Gravity Conjecture is true , we must seek a stronger form of the conjecture that is robust under compactification .	We propose a `` Lattice Weak Gravity Conjecture '' that meets this requirement : a superextremal particle should exist for every charge in the charge lattice .
1	Our study is based on the dynamical mean field theory ( DMFT ) combined with the numerical renormalization group ( NRG ) , which allows us to handle both strong electron-electron and strong electron-phonon interactions .	We explore the quantum phase transitions between two ordered states in the infinite dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model at half filling .	The transition line is characterized by an effective electron-electron interaction .	Depending on this effective interaction and the phonon frequency $ \omega_0 $ one finds either a continuous transition or discontinuous transition .	Here , the analysis focuses on the behavior of the system when the electron-electron repulsion $ U $ and the phonon-mediated attraction $ \lambda $ are equal .
1	Expressions are derived for the Drude and superfluid weights for general variational wavefunctions .	The linear response theory for current is investigated in a variational context .	The expression for the Drude weight highlights the difficulty in its calculation since it depends on the exact energy eigenvalues which are usually not available in practice .	While the Drude weight is not available in a simple form , the linear current response is shown to be expressible in terms of a geometric phase , or alternatively in terms of the expectation value of the total position shift operator .	The contribution of the geometric phase to the current response is then analyzed for some commonly used projected variational wavefunctions ( Baeriswyl , Gutzwiller , and combined ) .
1	We report an experiment conducted with four experts .	This paper presents a study aiming to analyse the design strategies of experts in object-oriented programming .	Each subject solved three problems .	Our results show that three strategies may be used in program design according to the solution structure .	An object-centred strategy and a function-centred strategy are used when the solution has a hierarchical structure with vertical communication between objects .
2	For this purpose a non-experimental descriptive quantitative methodology has been used , with a sample of subjects ( N=282 ) of the Autonomous Region of Extremadura ( Spain ) .	The importance of knowing ICT training and motivation -so relevant in today 's society- which currently offers the first year college students , mostly in degrees in Education , focuses the object of interest in this study .	The following targets have been proposed : [ 1 ] knowing what basic skills regarding initial instrumental knowledge presents the prospective teacher ( aptitudes ) and [ 2 ] knowing their motivation for the educational use of ICT in the classroom ( attitudes ) .	The results show that new degree college students possess a basic knowledge of ICT alongside a highly positive motivation towards the use of these .	However , it is worrying that they only show an instrumental and technical knowledge of computing and telematic tools implied in social environments , but not pedagogical ones .
2	Channel estimation gathers different schemes and algorithms , some of them are dedicated for slowly time varying ( such as block type arrangement insertion , Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound , Kalman estimator , Subspace estimator , ... ) whereas the others concern highly time varying channels ( comb type insertion , ... ) .	In this paper , we have evaluated various methods of time-frequency-selective fading channels estimation in OFDM system and some of them improved under time varying conditions .	So , these different techniques will be studied through different algorithms and for different schemes of modulations ( 16 QAM , BPSK , QPSK , ... ) .	There are others methods that are just suitable for stationary channels like blind or semi blind estimators .	For this aim , diverse algorithms were used for these schemes such as Least Squares estimator LS , Least Minimum Squares LMS , Minimum Mean-Square-Error MMSE , Linear Minimum Mean-Square-Error LMMSE , Maximum Likelihood ML , ... to refine estimators shown previously .
1	It is based on the two-phase thermodynamic model of [ Lin et al. , J. Chem.Phys .	We present a simple , fast , and reliable method to compute the melting curves of materials with ab initio molecular dynamics .	119 , 11792 ( 2003 ) ] and its improved version given by [ Desjarlais , Phys.Rev .	E , 88 , 062145 ( 2013 ) ] .	In this model , the velocity autocorrelation function is utilized to calculate the contribution of the nuclei motion to the entropy of the solid and liquid phases .
1	The system considered is a quasi-periodic perturbation of the Restricted Planar Circular three-body Problem ( RPC3BP ) .	This paper constructs a certain planar four-body problem which exhibits fast energy growth .	Gelfreich-Turaev 's and de la Llave 's mechanism is employed to obtain the fast energy growth .	The diffusion is created by a heteroclinic cycle formed by two Lyapunov periodic orbits surrounding $ L_1 $ and $ L_2 $ Lagrangian points and their heteroclinic intersections .	Our model is the first known example in celestial mechanics of the a priori chaotic case of Arnold diffusion .
0	The one loop Renormalization Group Equations for the Yukawa couplings of quarks are solved .	From the solution we find the explicit energy dependence on $ t=\ln E/\mu $ of the evolution of the { \em down } quark masses $ q=d , s , b $ from the grand unification scale down to the top quark mass $ m_ { t } $ .	These results together with the earlier published evolution of the { \em up } quark masses completes the pattern of the evolution of the quark masses .	We also find the energy dependence of the absolute values of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa ( CKM ) matrix $ |V_ { ij } | $ .	The interesting property of the evolution of the CKM matrix and the ratios of the quark masses : $ m_ { u , c } /m_ { t } $ and $ m_ { d , s } /m_ { b } $ is that they all depend on $ t $ through only one function of energy $ h ( t ) $ .
3	Since the low-kT plasma has solar metal abundances , it is thought to be of interstellar medium origin .	We present Suzaku results of the two Galactic supernova remnants ( SNRs ) , G350.1-0.3 and G349.7+0.2 .	We find Al and Ni K alpha lines from both the SNRs for the first time , in addition to previously detected K-shell lines of Mg , Si , S , Ar , Ca and Fe .	The spectra are well described by two optically thin thermal plasmas : a low-temperature ( low-kT ) plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium and a high-temperature ( high-kT ) plasma in non-equilibrium ionization .	The high-kT plasma has super-solar abundances , hence it is likely to be of ejecta origin .
3	According to both the Adam-Gibbs and the Random First Order theory the correlation length grows as $ \xi \sim ( T-T_k ) ^ { -1/ ( d-\theta ) } $ , even though the two theories disagree on the value of $ \theta $ .	There is a certain consensus that the very fast growth of the relaxation time $ \tau $ occurring in glass-forming liquids on lowering the temperature must be due to the thermally activated rearrangement of correlated regions of growing size .	Even though measuring the size of these regions has defied scientists for a while , there is indeed recent evidence of a growing correlation length $ \xi $ in glass-formers .	If we use Arrhenius law and make the mild assumption that the free-energy barrier to rearrangement scales as some power $ \psi $ of the size of the correlated regions , we obtain a relationship between time and length , $ T\log\tau \sim \xi^\psi $ .	Therefore , the super-Arrhenius growth of the relaxation time with the temperature is regulated by the two exponents $ \psi $ and $ \theta $ through the relationship $ T\log\tau \sim ( T-T_k ) ^ { -\psi/ ( d-\theta ) } $ .
0	I examine the phenomenology of particle multiplicity distributions , with special emphasis on the low multiplicities that are a background in the study of rapidity gaps .	In particular , I analyze the multiplicity distribution in a rapidity interval between two jets , using the HERWIG QCD simulation with some necessary modifications .	The distribution is not of the negative binomial form , and displays an anomalous enhancement at zero multiplicity .	Some useful mathematical tools for working with multiplicity distributions are presented .	It is demonstrated that ignoring particles with pt & lt ; 0.2 has theoretical advantages , in addition to being convenient experimentally .
0	A short introduction is given on the functional renormalization group method , putting emphasis on its nonperturbative aspects .	The method enables to find nontrivial fixed points in quantum field theoretic models which make them free from divergences and leads to the concept of asymptotic safety .	It can be considered as a generalization of the asymptotic freedom which plays a key role in the perturbative renormalization .	We summarize and give a short discussion of some important models , which are asymptotically safe such as the Gross-Neveu model , the nonlinear $ \sigma $ model , the sine-Gordon model , and we consider the model of quantum Einstein gravity which seems to show asymptotic safety , too .	We also give a detailed analysis of infrared behavior of such scalar models where a spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place .
3	Between these concentrations , clear NFL signatures are observed , such as \rho ( T ) \approx \rho_0 + A T^n ( with n & lt ; 1.5 ) and C_P ( T ) \propto -T ln ( T ) dependencies .	In this paper we report a comprehensive study of the magnetic susceptibility ( \chi ) , resistivity ( \rho ) , and specific heat ( C_P ) , down to 0.5 K of the cubic CeIn_ ( 3-x ) Sn_x alloy .	The ground state of this system evolves from antiferromagnetic ( AF ) in CeIn_3 ( T_N=10.2 K ) to intermediate-valent in CeSn_3 , and represents the first example of a Ce-lattice cubic non-Fermi liquid ( NFL ) system where T_N ( x ) can be traced down to T=0 over more than a decade of temperature .	Our results indicate that the disappearance of the AF state occurs near x_c ~ 0.7 , although already at x ~ 0.4 significant modifications of the magnetic ground state are observed .	Within the ordered phase a first order phase transition occurs for 0.25 & lt ; x & lt ; 0.5 .
2	We show here that this is an experimental manifestation of a novel { \it macroscopic } quantum phenomenon induced by the magnetic field , qualitatively different from the usual quantum Hall effects .	High- $ T_c $ superconductivity is unconventional because the gap is not isotropic as in simple metals but has $ d_ { x^2-y^2 } $ symmetry with lines of nodes .	In a fascinating thermal transport experiment on a high- $ T_c $ superconductor , Krishana et al \cite { Krishana } have reported mysterious magnetic field induced first order transitions from a superconducting state with gap nodes to a state without gap nodes .	It corresponds to the { \it quantization of the superfluid density } in a superconductor with gap nodes due to the generation of Confined Field Induced Density Waves ( CFIDW ) in the node regions of the Fermi surface .	The Landau numbers $ L $ are not sufficient to index these macroscopic quantum states and the addition of a new quantum number $ \zeta $ is necessary .
4	The circulation velocity scales with the Kolmogorov velocity , in contrast to the case of intense vortex tubes alone where the circulation velocity scales with the rms velocity fluctuation .	The elementary structures of turbulence , i.e. , vortex tubes , are studied using velocity data obtained in laboratory experiments for boundary layers and duct flows at microscale Reynolds numbers 332-1934 .	While past experimental studies focused on intense vortex tubes , the present study focuses on all vortex tubes with various intensities .	We obtain the mean velocity profile .	The radius scales with the Kolmogorov length .
1	We experimentally demonstrate magnetically induced spin reorientation phenomena simultaneous with a Dirac-metal to gapped-insulator transition on the surfaces of manganese-doped Bi2Se3 thin films .	Understanding and control of spin degrees of freedom on the surfaces of topological materials are key to future applications as well as for realizing novel physics such as the axion electrodynamics associated with time-reversal ( TR ) symmetry breaking on the surface .	The resulting electronic groundstate exhibits unique hedgehog-like spin textures at low energies , which directly demonstrate the mechanics of TR symmetry breaking on the surface .	We further show that an insulating gap induced by quantum tunnelling between surfaces exhibits spin texture modulation at low energies but respects TR invariance .	These spin phenomena and the control of their Fermi surface geometrical phase first demonstrated in our experiments pave the way for the future realization of many predicted exotic magnetic phenomena of topological origin .
1	Perhaps the clearest examples are found in the asteroid belt .	The physical basis of chaos in the solar system is now better understood : in all cases investigated so far , chaotic orbits result from overlapping resonances .	Overlapping resonances account for its Kirkwood gaps and were used to predict and find evidence for very narrow gaps in the outer belt .	Further afield , about one new `` short-period '' comet is discovered each year .	They are believed to come from the `` Kuiper Belt '' ( at 40 AU or more ) via chaotic orbits produced by mean-motion and secular resonances with Neptune .
0	We investigate the dynamics of solitons in generalized Klein-Gordon equations in the presence of nonlinear damping and spatiotemporal perturbations .	We will present different mechanisms for soliton explosions .	We show ( both analytically and numerically ) that some space-dependent perturbations or nonlinear damping can make the soliton internal mode unstable leading to soliton explosion .	We will show that , in some cases , while some conditions are satisfied , the soliton explodes becoming a permanent , extremely complex , spatiotemporal dynamics .	We believe these mechanisms can explain some of the phenomena that recently have been reported to occur in excitable media .
1	We determine a phase diagram for this system including fluctuation corrections to the mean-field theory .	We investigate the thermodynamics and signatures of a polariton condensate over a range of densities , using a model of microcavity polaritons with internal structure .	At low densities the condensation temperature , T_c , behaves like that for point bosons .	At higher densities , when T_c approaches the Rabi splitting , T_c deviates from the form for point bosons , and instead approaches the result of a BCS-like mean-field theory .	This crossover occurs at densities much less than the Mott density .
3	We conclude that either the scatter of the v_c-sigma_c relation is a function of v_c ( and hence galaxy mass ) or that the character of the v_c-sigma_c relation changes at v_c ~ 80 km/s .	We present an updated investigation of the relation between large scale disk circular velocity , v_c , and bulge velocity dispersion , sigma_c .	New bulge velocity dispersions are measured for a sample of 11 low surface brightness ( LSB ) and 7 high surface brightness ( HSB ) spiral galaxies for which v_c is known from published optical or HI rotation curves .	We find that , while LSB galaxies appear to define the upper envelope of the region occupied by HSB galaxies ( having relatively larger v_c for any given sigma_c ) , the distinction between LSB and HSB galaxies in the v_c-sigma_c plane becomes less pronounced for sigma_c & lt ; = 80 km/s .	Some inplications of our findings are discussed .
3	Diffusion , on the other hand , is not greatly modified by stress .	Density functional calculations are employed to study the molecular dissociation of hydrogen on graphene , the diffusion of chemisorbed atomic species , and the electronic properties of the resulting hydrogen on graphene system .	Our results show that applying stress to the graphene substrate can lower the barrier to dissociation of molecular hydrogen by a factor of six , and change the process from endothermic to exothermic .	These values for the barrier and the heat of reaction , unlike the zero stress values , are compatible with the time scales observed in experiments .	We analyse the electronic structure for configurations relevant to molecular dissociation and adsorption of atomic hydrogen on a graphene single layer .
1	In this work , we discuss the gamma-ray emission from X-ray transient sources formed by a Be star and a highly magnetized neutron star .	Context : Some high mass X-ray binaries ( HMXB ) have been recently confirmed as gamma-ray sources by ground based Cherenkov telescopes .	This kind of systems can produce variable hadronic gamma-ray emission through the mechanism proposed by Cheng and Ruderman , where a proton beam accelerated in the pulsar magnetosphere impacts the transient accretion disk .	We choose as case of study the best known system of this class : A0535+26 .	Aims : We aim at making quantitative predictions about the very high-energy radiation generated in Be-X ray binary systems with strongly magnetized neutron stars .
1	These arise as sums of submodules induced from centraliser subgroups , and their Frobenius characteristics have elegant descriptions , often as a multiplicity-free sum of power-sum symmetric functions .	We study representations related to the conjugacy action of the symmetric group .	We describe a general framework in which such representations , and consequently such linear combinations of power-sums , can be analysed .	The conjugacy action for the symmetric group , and more generally for a large class of groups , is known ( from work of Frumkin and Heide-Saxl-Thiep-Zalesski , respectively ) to contain every irreducible .	We find other representations of dimension $ n ! $ with this property , including a twisted analogue of the conjugacy action .
4	We derive stellar parameters ( metallicity , [ m/H ] , effective temperature , $ T_ { \rm eff } $ , stellar diameter , $ \theta $ ) and interstellar extinction , $ E ( B-V ) $ , for all $ \beta $ Cep stars observed by { \it International Ultraviolet Explorer } satellite .	In early type stars the ultraviolet spectral region is important for several reasons .	Firstly , since the majority of the total flux is emitted here , it provides a rather sensitive indicator of a photospheric temperature and luminosity .	Secondly , the UV spectra are dominated by lines of the iron-group elements , which cause the origin of the opacity bump at temperature $ 2 \times 10^5 $ K , where the classical $ \kappa $ mechanism drives pulsations of $ \beta $ Cep stars .	Consequently , the position of the instability domain in the HR diagram strongly depends on the metal abundance ( Pamyatnykh 1999 ) .
1	This can be done by determining critical points of the objective function restricted to the model .	In many areas of applied mathematics and statistics , it is a fundamental problem to find the best representative of a model by optimizing an objective function .	We compile ideas arising from numerical algebraic geometry to compute the critical points of an objective function .	Our method consists of using numerical homotopy continuation and a monodromy action on the total critical space to compute all of the complex critical points of an objective function .	To illustrate the relevance of our method , we apply it to the Euclidean distance function to compute ED-degrees and the likelihood function to compute maximum likelihood degrees .
0	We derive a suite of generalized Boltzmann equations , based on the density-matrix formalism , that incorporates the physics of neutrino oscillations for two- and three-flavor oscillations , matter refraction , and self-refraction .	The resulting equations are straightforward extensions of the classical transport equations that nevertheless contain the full physics of quantum oscillation phenomena .	In this way , our broadened formalism provides a bridge between the familiar neutrino transport algorithms employed by supernova modelers and the more quantum-heavy approaches frequently employed to illuminate the various neutrino oscillation effects .	We also provide the corresponding angular-moment versions of this generalized equation set .	Our goal is to make it easier for astrophysicists to address oscillation phenomena in a language with which they are familiar .
4	In this situation one typically scales the prior globally to normalise the average of the prior variance across vertices .	We consider learning on graphs , guided by kernels that encode similarity between vertices .	Our focus is on random walk kernels , the analogues of squared exponential kernels in Euclidean spaces .	We show that on large , locally treelike , graphs these have some counter-intuitive properties , specifically in the limit of large kernel lengthscales .	We consider using these kernels as covariance matrices of e.g.\ Gaussian processes ( GPs ) .
1	Thresholded singular value decomposition ( SVD ) is a popular technique in implementing many of them .	Over the past decade , various matrix completion algorithms have been developed .	A sizable number of studies have shown its theoretical and empirical excellence , but choosing the right threshold level still remains as a key empirical difficulty .	This paper proposes a novel matrix completion algorithm which iterates thresholded SVD with theoretically-justified and data-dependent values of thresholding parameters .	The estimate of the proposed algorithm enjoys the minimax error rate and shows outstanding empirical performances .
4	Our model agrees well with commonly used models from existing literature .	Experimental results for condensation in compact heat exchangers show that the heat transfer due to condensation is significantly better compared to classical heat exchangers , especially when using R134a instead of water as the refrigerant .	This suggests that surface tension plays a role .	Using generalized dimensional analysis we derive reduced model equations and jump conditions for condensation in a vertical tube with cylindrical cross section .	Based on this model we derive a single ordinary differential equation for the thickness of the condensate film as function of the tube axis .
1	We regard the gauge theory system as a fluid with shear viscosity .	We consider a gravity dual description of time dependent , strongly interacting large-Nc N=4 SYM .	Our fluid is expanding in one direction following the Bjorken 's picture that is relevant to RHIC experiments .	We obtain the dual geometry at the late time that is consistent with dissipative hydrodynamics .	We show that the integration constants that can not be determined by hydrodynamics are given by looking at the horizon of the dual geometry .
4	We find that the commensurability patterns present in the known ETNO population resemble those found in the main and trans-Neptunian belts .	Many asteroids in the main and trans-Neptunian belts are trapped in mean motion resonances with Jupiter and Neptune , respectively .	As a side effect , they experience accidental commensurabilities among themselves .	These commensurabilities define characteristic patterns that can be used to trace the source of the observed resonant behaviour .	Here , we explore systematically the existence of commensurabilities between the known ETNOs using their heliocentric and barycentric semimajor axes , their uncertainties , and Monte Carlo techniques .
2	In the nonrelativistic limit the brane action is reduced to that of the Galileon theory .	We present exact classical solutions of the higher-derivative theory that describes the dynamics of the position modulus of a probe brane within a five-dimensional bulk .	The solutions can be interpreted as static or time-dependent throats connecting two parallel branes .	We derive exact solutions for the Galileon , which reproduce correctly the shape of the throats at large distances , but fail to do so for their central part .	We also determine the parameter range for which the Vainshtein mechanism is reproduced within the brane theory .
1	The $ Sn_ { Zr } ^ { \times } $ site defect was shown to be dominant across most oxygen partial pressures , with $ Sn_ { Zr } ^ { `` } $ charge compensated by fully charged oxygen vacancies occurring at partial pressures below $ 10^ { -31 } $ atm .	Atomic scale computer simulations using density functional theory were used to investigate the behaviour of tin in the tetragonal phase oxide layer on Zr-based alloys .	Insertion of additional positive charge into the system was shown to significantly increase the critical partial pressure at which $ Sn_ { Zr } ^ { `` } $ is stable .	Recently developed low-Sn nuclear fuel cladding alloys have demonstrated an improved corrosion resistance and a delayed transition compared to Sn-containing alloys , such as Zircaloy-4 .	The interaction between the positive charge and the tin defect is discussed in the context of alloying additions , such as niobium and their influence on corrosion of cladding alloys .
1	We find that halos formed in simulations with gas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed in adiabatic simulations .	We analyze the effect of dissipation on the shapes of dark matter ( DM ) halos using high-resolution cosmological gasdynamics simulations of clusters and galaxies in the LCDM cosmology .	Gas cooling results in an average increase of the principle axis ratios of halos by ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions .	The systematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to the virial radius .	We argue that the differences in simulations with and without cooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution , when gas cools and condenses toward the center , and during major mergers .
3	Our first result is to describe this quasi-Poisson structure in terms of an intersection form on the fundamental groupoid of the surface , generalizing results of Massuyeau and Turaev .	Let G be a Lie group endowed with a bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric .	Then the moduli space of flat connections on a principal G-bundle , P\to \Sigma , over a compact oriented surface , \Sigma , carries a Poisson structure .	If we trivialize P over a finite number of points on the boundary of \Sigma , then the moduli space carries a quasi-Poisson structure instead .	Our second result is to extend this framework to quilted surfaces , i.e.surfaces where the structure group varies from region to region and a reduction ( or relation ) of structure occurs along the borders of the regions , extending results of the second author .
3	The family of models is delimited by the data to a relatively narrow allowed range of parameters , and then input into N-body simulations .	N-body simulations are used to model the tidal disruption of the Sagittarius ( Sgr ) dwarf galaxy with constraints set by the positions and velocities of M giants in the Sgr tidal arms recently revealed by the Two Micron All-Sky Survey ( 2MASS ) .	The simulated Sgr dwarf is placed on a variety of orbits within a Milky Way potential parameterized by variable circular velocities , halo flattenings and radial profiles .	Two hundred separate test particle orbits have been used to explore a wide range of model Milky Way potentials and dwarf galaxy characteristics .	We present our best-fitting model , and discuss the orbital period , apoGalacticon distance , current space velocity , mass-to-light ratio , and other characteristics of the Sgr dwarf .
0	We revisit the case of a light neutralino LSP in the framework of the MSSM .	We consider a model with eleven free parameters .	We show that all scenarios where the annihilation of light neutralinos rely mainly on the exchange of a light pseudoscalar are excluded by direct detection searches and by Fermi measurements of the gamma-flux from dwarf spheroidal galaxies .	On the other hand , we find scenarios with light sleptons that satisfy all collider and astroparticle physics constraints .	In this case , the lower limit on the LSP mass is 12.6 GeV .
1	Although it is generally believed that these galaxies host intense star-formation activity , there is growing evidence that a substantial fraction also harbor an AGN .	Deep SCUBA surveys have uncovered a large population of massive submm galaxies ( SMGs ) at z & gt ; ~1 .	We present here possibly the strongest evidence for this viewpoint to date : the combination of ultra-deep X-ray observations ( the 2 Ms CDF-N ) and deep Keck spectroscopic data .	We find that the majority ( ~75 % ) of the spectroscopically identified SMGs host AGN activity ; the other ~25 % have X-ray properties consistent with star formation ( X-ray derived SFRs of ~1300-2700 solars/yr ) .	The AGNs have properties generally consistent with those of nearby luminous AGNs ( L_X~1E43-3E44 ) and the majority ( ~80 % ) are heavily obscured .
1	From this model we are able to extract an idealized roadmap of all hydrostatic states of the isothermal protoplanets .	We present a model for the equilibrium of solid planetary cores embedded in a gaseous nebula .	The complete classification of the isothermal protoplanetary equilibria should improve the understanding of the general problem of giant planet formation , within the framework of the nucleated instability hypothesis .	We approximate the protoplanet as a spherically symmetric , isothermal , self-gravitating classical ideal gas envelope in equilibrium , around a rigid body of given mass and density , with the gaseous envelope required to fill the Hill-sphere .	Starting only with a core of given mass and an envelope gas density at the core surface , the equilibria are calculated without prescribing the total protoplanetary mass or nebula density .
0	We report room temperature ferromagnetism in Ni doped CeO2 nanoparticles using X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( HR-TEM ) , and dc magnetization measurements .	Nanoparticles of Ce1-xNixO2 ( 0.0 \leq x \leq 0.10 ) were prepared by using a co-precipitation method .	XRD measurements indicate that all samples exhibit single phase nature with cubic structure and ruled out the presence of any secondary phase .	Lattice parameters , strain and particle size calculated from XRD data have been found to decrease with increase in Ni doping .	Inter-planner distance measured from HR-TEM images for different Ni doped samples indicate that Ni ions are substituting Ce ions in CeO2 matrix .
3	It is noted that the buckling first decreases with the strain ( up to 10 % ) and then increases again , which is accompanied by a band gap variation .	The effects of biaxial tensile strain on the structure , electronic states , and mechanical properties of silicene are studied by ab-initio calculations .	Our results show that up to 5 % strain the Dirac cone remains essentially at the Fermi level , while higher strain induces hole doping because of weakening of the Si $ - $ Si bonds .	We demonstrate that the silicene lattice is stable up to 17 % strain .	We also calculate the Gr\ '' uneisen parameter and demonstrate a strain dependence similar to that of graphene .
3	We investigate the semantics and properties of data cleaning through the enforcement of matching dependencies for the pure case .	Matching dependencies ( MDs ) were introduced to specify the identification or matching of certain attribute values in pairs of database tuples when some similarity conditions are satisfied .	Their enforcement can be seen as a natural generalization of entity resolution .	In what we call the `` pure case '' of MDs , any value from the underlying data domain can be used for the value in common that does the matching .	We characterize the intended clean instances and also the `` clean answers '' to queries as those that are invariant under the cleaning process .
1	Unfortunately , under therapy , in some patients the hepatitis virus mutates and gives rise to variants which are drug resistant .	Sequential monotherapy is the most widely used therapeutic approach in the treatment of HBV chronic infection .	We conjecture that combination therapy is able to delay drug resistance for a longer time than sequential monotherapy .	To study the action of these two therapeutic approaches in the event of unknown mutations and to explain the emergence of drug resistance , we propose a stochastic model for the infection within a patient which is treated with two drugs , either sequentially or contemporaneously , and develops a two-step mutation which is resistant to both drugs .	We study the deterministic approximation of our stochastic model and give a biological interpretation of its asymptotic behaviour .
1	In physical experiments , billions of values can now be measured within a second .	One form of big data are signals - time series of consecutive values .	Signals of heart and brain in intensive care , as well as seismic waves , are measured with 100 up to 1000 Hz over hours , days or even years .	A song of 3 minutes on CD comprises 16 million values .	Music and seismic vibrations basically consist of harmonic oscillations for which classical tools like autocorrelation and spectrogram work well .
2	The Muon Forward Tracker ( MFT ) is a proposal in view of this upgrade , motivated both by the possibility to increase the physics potential of the muon spectrometer and to allow new measurements of general interest for the whole ALICE physics .	ALICE is the experiment dedicated to the study of the quark gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions at the CERN LHC .	Improvements of ALICE sub-detectors are envisaged for the upgrade plans of year 2017 .	In order to evaluate the feasibility of this upgrade , a detailed simulation of the MFT setup is being performed within the AliRoot framework , with emphasis on the tracking capabilities as a function of the number , position and size of the pixel planes , and the corresponding physics performances .	In this report , we present preliminary results on the MFT performances in a low-multiplicity environment .
4	The large-velocity-gradient model suggests that the molecular gas in the starburst galaxies have warmer and denser conditions than that in the non-starburst galaxies , and the photon-dominated-region model suggests that the denser molecular gas is irradiated by stronger interstellar radiation field in the starburst galaxies than that in the non-starburst galaxies .	We performed 12CO ( 1-0 ) , 13CO ( 1-0 ) , and HCN ( 1-0 ) single-dish observations ( beam size ~14 '' -18 '' ) toward nearby starburst and non-starburst galaxies using the Nobeyama 45 m telescope .	The 13CO ( 1-0 ) and HCN ( 1-0 ) emissions were detected from all the seven starburst galaxies , with the intensities of both lines being similar ( i.e. , the ratios are around unity ) .	On the other hand , for case of the non-starburst galaxies , the 13CO ( 1-0 ) emission was detected from all three galaxies , while the HCN ( 1-0 ) emission was weakly or not detected in past observations .	This result indicates that the HCN/13CO intensity ratios are significantly larger ( ~1.15+-0.32 ) in the starburst galaxy samples than the non-starburst galaxy samples ( & lt ; 0.31+-0.14 ) .
1	We argue that this kind of quantum space-times can be used as regulators for quantum field theories .	We give a perturbative quantization of space-time $ R^4 $ in the case where the commutators $ C^ { { \mu } { \nu } } = [ X^ { \mu } , X^ { \nu } ] $ of the underlying algebra generators are not central .	In particular we show in the case of the $ { \phi } ^4 $ theory that by choosing appropriately the commutators $ C^ { { \mu } { \nu } } $ we can remove all the infinities by reproducing all the counter terms .	In other words the renormalized action on $ R^4 $ plus the counter terms can be rewritten as only a renormalized action on the quantum space-time $ QR^4 $ .	We conjecture therefore that renormalization of quantum field theory is equivalent to the quantization of the underlying space-time $ R^4 $ .
4	In addition , new redshift-selected isodensity plots significantly reduce the prominence of the previously reported subgroup to the north-west of the main cluster .	The galaxy cluster A3667 was observed using the Two-degree Field ( 2dF ) multifibre spectroscopic system on the Anglo-Australian Telescope in a program designed to examine the velocity structure in the region .	Specifically , we sought evidence from the optical data for the putative cluster merger believed to be responsible for the observed radio and X-ray emission .	We present 184 new redshifts in the region , of which 143 correspond to member galaxies of A3667 .	We find the cluster velocity distribution to be well modelled by a single Gaussian in agreement with previous results .
4	A measurement of the neutral-current interaction rate has confirmed oscillation between three active neutrino flavours .	The MINOS experiment has used the world 's most powerful neutrino beam to make precision neutrino oscillation measurements .	By observing the disappearance of muon neutrinos , MINOS has made the world 's most precise measurement of the larger neutrino mass splitting , and has measured the neutrino mixing angle $ \theta_ { 23 } $ .	Using a dedicated antineutrino beam , MINOS has made the first direct precision measurements of the corresponding antineutrino parameters .	A search for \nue and \nuebar appearance has enabled a measurement of the mixing angle $ \theta_ { 13 } $ .
3	About 10 % of the nonthermal emission from M33 at 3.6 cm is polarized .	Using the linearly polarized intensity and polarization angle data at 3.6 , 6.2 and 20 cm , we determine variations of Faraday rotation and depolarization across the nearby galaxy M33 .	A 3-D model of the regular magnetic field is fitted to the observed azimuthal distribution of polarization angles .	Faraday rotation , measured between 3.6 and 6.2 cm at a linear resolution of 0.7 kpc , shows more variation in the south than in the north of the galaxy .	We estimate the average total and regular magnetic field strengths in M33 as ~ 6.4 and 2.5 $ \mu $ G , respectively .
2	This indicates that there is a class of solutions to the Self Dual Yang-Mills equations which can be constructed using the soliton techniques like the $ \tau $ function method .	Exploiting the formulation of the Self Dual Yang-Mills equations as a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem , we present a theory of pulling back soliton hierarchies to the Self Dual Yang-Mills equations .	We show that for each map $ \C^4 \to \C^ { \infty } $ satisfying a simple system of linear equations formulated below one can pull back the ( generalized ) Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies to the Self Dual Yang-Mills equations .	In particular this class contains the solutions obtained via the symmetry reductions of the Self Dual Yang-Mills equations .	It also contains genuine 4 dimensional solutions .
2	In fact , what they really prove is that the cosmological expansion can not be described in terms of real motions in Minkowski spacetime .	In two recent papers , Abramowicz et al .	claim that the expansion of the Universe can be interpreted only as the expansion of space .	However , there is no controversy about this issue .	Abramowicz et al .
4	We highlight the need for caution in interpreting sterile neutrino limits given the context of incomplete cross-section model information .	Charged-Current Quasi-Elastic ( CCQE ) neutrino scattering is the signal channel for sterile neutrino oscillation experiments .	Recent cross-section measurements have made it clear that the current understanding of this channel in the few-GeV region is incomplete , and several sophisticated theoretical models have been proposed to tackle this issue , although it is not clear which model best describes the global dataset .	In this paper we argue that the current uncertainty surrounding CCQE cross-sections is a serious problem for experiments seeking to produce sterile neutrino limits .	We perform a sterile neutrino analysis with published MINERvA data as an illustrative example .
4	The corresponding decay rate and critical exponents for the phase-transition are calculated explaining the non-monotonic pump-dependent atomic damping rate observed in recent experiments .	We investigate the near-critical dynamics of atomic density fluctuations in the non-equilibrium self-organization transition of an optically driven quantum gas coupled to a single mode of a cavity .	In this system cavity-mediated long-range interactions between atoms , tunable by the drive strength , lead to softening of an excitation mode recently observed in experiments .	This phenomenon has previously been studied within a two-mode approximation for the collective motional degrees of freedom of the atomic condensate which results in an effective open-system Dicke model .	Here , including the full spectrum of atomic modes we find a finite lifetime for a roton-like mode in the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum that is strongly pump-dependent .
1	The crossover from an initial regime of slow corrosion rate ( pit nucleation ) to a regime of rapid corrosion ( propagation of the pit ) takes place at the incubation time .	We study a model for corrosion and passivation of a metallic surface after small damage of its protective layer .	The model is defined in a lattice whose sites represent the possible states of the metal ( bulk , reactive and passive ) and the solution ( neutral , acidic or basic ) .	Probabilistic rules describe passivation of the metal surface , dissolution of the passive layer , which is enhanced in acidic media , and spatially separated electrochemical reactions , which may create pH inhomogeneities in the solution .	From a suitable matching of characteristic times of creation and annihilation of pH inhomogeneities in the solution , a scaling theory gives the average radius of the dissolved region at the incubation time as a function of the model parameters .
0	We investigate `` the Wojcik model '' introduced and studied by Wojcik et al. , which is a one-defect quantum walk ( QW ) having a single phase at the origin .	They reported that giving a phase at one point causes an astonishing effect for localization .	There are three types of measures having important roles in the study of QWs : time-averaged limit measure , weak limit measure , and stationary measure .	The first two measures imply a coexistence of localized behavior and the ballistic spreading in the QW .	As Konno et al .
0	We present a compelling response of a low-dimensional strongly correlated system to an external perturbation .	Using the time-dependent Lanczos method we investigate a nonequilibrium evolution of the half-filled one-dimensional extended Hubbard model , driven by a transient laser pulse .	When the system is close to the phase boundary , by tuning the laser frequency and strength , a sustainable charge order enhancement is found that is absent in the Mott insulating phase .	We analyze the conditions and investigate possible mechanisms of emerging charge order enhancement .	Feasible experimental realizations are proposed .
2	Two calculations are given for the Feynman integral ; one based on an interpretation of the integral as an inhomogeneous solution of a classical Picard-Fuchs differential equation , and the other using arithmetic algebraic geometry , motivic cohomology , and Eisenstein series .	We study the Feynman integral for the three-banana graph defined as the scalar two-point self-energy at three-loop order .	The Feynman integral is evaluated for all identical internal masses in two space-time dimensions .	Both methods use the rather special fact that the Feynman integral is a family of regulator periods associated to a family of K3 surfaces .	We show that the integral is given by a sum of elliptic trilogarithms evaluated at sixth roots of unity .
4	Mobile defects dynamics , kinetics of polarization and electric current reversal are defined by the complex interplay between the donor , electron and phonon relaxation times , misfit strain , finite size effect and Vegard stresses .	We present a theoretical description of the influence of misfit strain on mobile defects dynamics in thin strained ferroelectric films .	Self-consistent solutions obtained by coupling the Poissons equation for electric potential with continuity equations for mobile donor and electron concentrations and time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire equations reveal that the Vegard mechanism ( chemical pressure ) leads to the redistribution of both charged and electro-neutral defects in order to decrease the effective stress in the film .	Internal electric fields , both built-in and depolarization ones , lead to a strong accumulation of screening space charges ( charged defects and electrons ) near the film interfaces .	Importantly , the corresponding screening length is governed by the misfit strain and Vegard coefficient .
4	Our results are consistent with deduced spectroscopic strengths for neutrons and protons from intermediate energy nucleon knockout reactions , and for protons from ( e , e'p ) reactions , on well-bound nuclei .	We carry out a systematic analysis of angular distribution measurements for selected ground-state to ground-state ( d , p ) and ( p , d ) neutron transfer reactions , including the calcium isotopes .	We propose a consistent three-body model reaction methodology in which we constrain the transferred-neutron bound state and nucleon-target optical potential geometries using modern Hartree-Fock calculations .	Our deduced neutron spectroscopic factors are found to be suppressed by ~30 % relative to independent-particle shell-model values , from 40Ca through 49Ca .	The other nuclei studied , ranging from B to Ti , show similar average suppressions with respect to large-basis shell-model expectations .
0	We obtain an efficient description for the dynamics of nonspinning compact binaries moving in inspiralling eccentric orbits to implement the phasing of gravitational waves from such binaries at the 3.5 post-Newtonian ( PN ) order .	Our computation heavily depends on the phasing formalism , presented in [ T. Damour , A. Gopakumar , and B. R. Iyer , Phys.Rev .	D \textbf { 70 } , 064028 ( 2004 ) ] , and the 3PN accurate generalized quasi-Keplerian parametric solution to the conservative dynamics of nonspinning compact binaries moving in eccentric orbits , available in [ R.-M. Memmesheimer , A. Gopakumar , and G. Sch\ '' afer , Phys.Rev .	D \textbf { 70 } , 104011 ( 2004 ) ] .	The gravitational-wave ( GW ) polarizations $ h_ { + } $ and $ h_ { \times } $ with 3.5PN accurate phasing should be useful for the earth-based GW interferometers , current and advanced , if they plan to search for gravitational waves from inspiralling eccentric binaries .
1	We sketch the history of the subject and some of its recent developments .	This is an expository talk on a topic of classical analysis , arising from the VMO theory of the topological degree due to Br\'ezis and Nirenberg ( 1995 ) .	The paper is organized as a sequence of questions .	Most of them , in particular the last one , deal with Fourier series of continuous functions of constant absolute value .	One of them contains new results on the comparison of summation processes .
3	We demonstrate its performance using historical data on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus .	Given a sample of genome sequences from an asexual population , can one predict its evolutionary future ?	Here we demonstrate that the branching patterns of reconstructed genealogical trees contains information about the relative fitness of the sampled sequences and that this information can be used to predict successful strains .	Our approach is based on the assumption that evolution proceeds by accumulation of small effect mutations , does not require species specific input and can be applied to any asexual population under persistent selection pressure .	We predict the progenitor lineage of the upcoming influenza season with near optimal performance in 30 % of cases and make informative predictions in 16 out of 19 years .
3	This is the only candidate at present for a theory of fundamental physics which reconciles gravity and quantum field theory in a potentially realistic fashion .	A self-contained review is given of the matrix model of M-theory .	The introductory part of the review is intended to be accessible to the general reader .	M-theory is an eleven-dimensional quantum theory of gravity which is believed to underlie all superstring theories .	Evidence for the existence of M-theory is still only circumstantial -- -no complete background-independent formulation of the theory yet exists .
1	This problem is a generalization of the famous Hamiltonian Path problem .	We consider the NP-hard problem of finding a spanning tree with a maximum number of internal vertices .	Our dynamic-programming algorithms for general and degree-bounded graphs have running times of the form O* ( c^n ) ( c & lt ; = 3 ) .	The main result , however , is a branching algorithm for graphs with maximum degree three .	It only needs polynomial space and has a running time of O* ( 1.8669^n ) when analyzed with respect to the number of vertices .
0	We study the long time behaviour of a Markov process evolving in $ \mathbb { N } $ and conditioned not to hit 0 .	Assuming that the process comes back quickly from infinity , we prove that the process admits a unique quasi-stationary distribution ( in particular , the distribution of the conditioned process admits a limit when time goes to infinity ) .	Moreover , we prove that the distribution of the process converges exponentially fast in total variation norm to its quasi-stationary distribution and we provide an explicit rate of convergence .	As a first application of our result , we bring a new insight on the speed of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution for birth and death processes : we prove that these processes converge exponentially fast to a quasi-stationary distribution if and only if they have a unique quasi-stationary distribution .	Also , considering the lack of results on quasi-stationary distributions for non-irreducible processes on countable spaces , we show , as a second application of our result , the existence and uniqueness of a quasi-stationary distribution for a class of possibly non-irreducible processes .
0	Continuous symmetry breaking ( CSB ) in low-dimensional systems , forbidden by the Mermin-Wagner theorem for short-range interactions , may take place in the presence of slowly decaying long-range interactions .	Nevertheless , there is no stringent bound on how slowly interactions should decay to give rise to CSB in 1D quantum systems at zero temperature .	Here , we study a long-range interacting spin chain with $ U ( 1 ) $ symmetry and power-law interactions $ V ( r ) \sim1/r^\alpha $ , directly relevant to ion-trap experiments .	Using bosonization and renormalization group theory , we find CSB for $ \alpha $ smaller than a critical exponent $ \alpha_c ( \le 3 ) $ depending on the microscopic parameters of the model .	Furthermore , the transition from the gapless XY phase to the gapless CSB phase is mediated by the breaking of conformal symmetry due to long-range interactions , and is described by a new universality class akin to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition .
1	In particular , we propose an optimal universal entangler which entangles a qubit in unknown state $ |\Psi & gt ; $ with a qubit in a reference ( known ) state $ |0 & gt ; $ .	We analyze various scenarios for entangling two initially unentangled qubits .	That is , our entangler generates the output state which is as close as possible to the pure ( symmetrized ) state $ ( |\Psi & gt ; |0 & gt ; +|0 & gt ; |\Psi & gt ; ) $ .	The most attractive feature of this entangling machine , is that the fidelity of its performance ( i.e.the distance between the output and the ideally entangled -- symmetrized state ) does not depend on the input and takes the constant value $ F= ( 9+3\sqrt { 2 } ) /14\simeq 0.946 $ .	We also analyze how to optimally generate from a single qubit initially prepared in an unknown state $ |\Psi\r $ a two qubit entangled system which is as close as possible to a Bell state $ ( |\Psi\r|\Psi^\perp\r+|\Psi^\perp\r|\Psi\r ) $ , where $ \l\Psi|\Psi^\perp\r =0 $ .
0	We present a global fit to single- and double-inclusive suppression data of high- $ p_T $ particles in central Au+Au collisions at top RHIC energy .	We also include in this analysis data on heavy quarks via their D and B meson semi-leptonic decays ( i.e.non-photonic electrons ) .	The analysis is based on the parton quenching weights for medium-induced gluon radiation computed in the BDMPS approximation then embedded in a hydrodynamical description of the bulk medium .	Our results indicate that values of the transport coefficient $ \hat q $ more than four times larger than perturbative estimates are preferred by experimental data .	This confirms previous calculations based on simpler implementations of the medium geometry or only the single-inclusive suppression .
2	We find that the Lyman continuum ( LyC ) luminosity of an average star forming galaxy in our sample declines from z=3.6 to 2.4 due to the steady gas infall and higher gas clumping at lower redshifts , increasingly hampering the escape of ionizing radiation .	Based on cosmological simulations , we model Lyman continuum emission from a sample of 11 high-redshift star forming galaxies spanning a mass range of a factor 20 .	Each of the 11 galaxies has been simulated both with a Salpeter and a Kroupa initial mass function ( IMF ) .	The galaxy-to-galaxy variation of apparent LyC emission at a fixed redshift is caused in approximately equal parts by the intrinsic variations in the LyC emission and by orientation effects .	The combined scatter of an order of magnitude can explain the variance in the far-UV spectra of high-redshift galaxies detected by Shapley et al . ( 2006 ) .
1	Our simulation extends a previous work by Casati and Prosen and it is aimed to test their surprising conclusion that the fringes disappear in the experiments with fully chaotic billiards .	We carry out a numerical simulation about the occurrence of interference fringes in experiments where an initial Gaussian wave packet evolves inside a billiard domain with two slits on the boundary .	According to the results found , we are led to reassess this remarkable effect of classical dynamics on quantum interference .	Actually , we highlight another factor which acts on interference : a symmetry condition ( SC ) concerning the experimental set-up .	This condition seems even to play a role more important than classical chaos .
0	First , we show that in the $ ( 1,0 ) \oplus ( 0,1 ) $ representation space there exist not one but two theories for charged particles .	In the Weinberg construct , the boson and its antiboson carry { \it same } relative intrinsic parity , whereas in our construct the relative intrinsic parities of the boson and its antiboson are { \it opposite } .	These results originate from the commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation and Parity in Weinberg 's theory , and from the anti-commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation and Parity in our theory .	We thus claim that we have constructed a first non-trivial quantum theory of fields for the Wigner-type particles .	Second , the massless limit of both theories seems formally identical and suggests a fundamental modification of Maxwell equations .
4	The reason is that not the functional structure of the log-law itself is misleading , but that its invariant Lie-group based derivation yielding this function is what is misleading .	The invariance method of Lie-groups in the theory of turbulence carries the high expectation of being a first principle method for generating statistical scaling laws .	The purpose of this comment is to show that this expectation has not been met so far .	In particular for wall-bounded turbulent flows , the prospects for success are not promising in view of the facts we will present herein .	Although the invariance method of Lie-groups is explicitly able to generate statistical scaling laws for wall-bounded turbulent flows , like the log-law for example , these invariant results yet not only fail to fulfil the basic requirements for a first principle result , but also are strongly misleading .
0	The ubiquity of planets and diversity of planetary systems reveal planet formation encompass many complex and competing processes .	In this series of papers , we develop and upgrade a population synthesis model as a tool to identify the dominant physical effects and to calibrate the range of physical conditions .	Recent planet searches leads to the discovery of many multiple-planet systems .	Any theoretical models of their origins must take into account dynamical interaction between emerging protoplanets .	Here , we introduce a prescription to approximate the close encounters between multiple planets .
1	Nullity zero turns out to be equivalent to the notion of a contranormal subgroup .	We give algebraic equivalents for certain desirable properties of pullback functors on categories of coverings and group sets , namely nullity zero , essential injectivity , and essential surjectivity .	We observe a Tannakian-like phenomenon with essential injectivity .	Essential surjectivity is intimately related to Zappa-Sz { \'e } p products .	We include several examples , and some open questions .
4	Dependence of bound-state energies on the asymptotic twist of the nanotubes is determined .	We construct exactly solvable models of twisted carbon nanotubes via supersymmetry , by applying the matrix Darboux transformation .	We derive the Green 's function for these systems and compute the local density of states .	Explicit examples of twisted carbon nanotubes are produced , where the back-scattering is suppressed and bound states are present .	We find that the local density of states decreases in the regions where the bound states are localized .
2	The now standard numerical approach for studying such structures is based on expansion of the propagating field into approximate leaky waveguide modes .	This work compares computational methods for laser pulse propagation in hollow waveguides filled with rare gases at high pressures , with applications in extreme nonlinear optics in the mid-infrared wavelength region .	As the wavelength of light \lambda=2\pi/k increases with respect to the transverse size R of a leaky waveguide , the loss of light out of the waveguide upon propagation , in general , increases .	We compare this approach to a new method that resolves the electric field in real space and correctly captures the energy loss through the waveguide wall .	The comparison reveals that the expansion-based approach overestimates losses that occur in nonlinearly reshaped pulsed waveforms .
4	The nodes are separated by a dynamically induced chiral shift .	We study the phase diagram of a Dirac semimetal in a magnetic field at a nonzero charge density .	It is shown that there exists a critical value of the chemical potential at which a first-order phase transition takes place .	At subcritical values of the chemical potential the ground state is a gapped state with a dynamically generated Dirac mass and a broken chiral symmetry .	The supercritical phase is the normal ( gapless ) phase with a nontrivial chiral structure : it is a Weyl semimetal with a pair of Weyl nodes for each of the original Dirac points .
3	The $ z $ -series parametrization for $ f_ { B\pi } ^+ $ is employed to extrapolate our results to large momentum transfer , and to compare with the lattice QCD results .	We address the problem of extrapolating the vector form factor $ f_ { B\pi } ^+ $ , which is relevant to $ B\to \pi\ell \nu_\ell $ decays , from the region of small to the region of large momentum transfer .	As input , we use the QCD light-cone sum rule at small momentum transfer .	We carry out a comprehensive Bayesian uncertainty analysis and obtain correlated uncertainties for the normalization and shape parameters of the form factor .	To test the validity of our extrapolation we use the upper and lower bounds from the unitarity and positivity of the two-point correlator of heavy-light quark currents .
4	Thus a long -- duration burst far from any star -- forming region would also be a signature of this class .	We consider gamma -- ray bursts produced by the merger of a massive white dwarf with a neutron star .	We show that these are likely to produce long -- duration GRBs , in some cases definitely without an accompanying supernova , as observed recently .	This class of burst would have a strong correlation with star formation , and occur close to the host galaxy .	However rare members of the class need not be near star -- forming regions , and could have any type of host galaxy .
3	We present model predictions for the composition of Fe-peak elements in AGB stars .	Presolar SiC grains formed around Asymptotic Giant Branch ( AGB ) stars during their carbon-rich phase and contain heavy elements in trace amounts showing the signature of the slow neutron capture process ( s process ) .	Thanks to recent advances in analysis techniques , SiC data now provide extremely precise information on neutron capture cross sections and AGB models .	For example , high-precision data for Mo in single SiC grains indicate that a revision of the 95Mo neutron capture cross section is needed , while data for Zr indicates that the 22Ne ( alpha , n ) 25Mg reaction can not be a dominant neutron source for the s process in AGB stars .	These elements could be analysed in the near future thus providing further stringent constraints to our understanding of AGB stars .
3	A stochastic optimization problem is formulated to minimize the microgrid net cost , which includes conventional generation cost as well as the expected transaction cost incurred by wind uncertainty .	Decentralized energy management is of paramount importance in smart microgrids with renewables for various reasons including environmental friendliness , reduced communication overhead , and resilience to failures .	In this context , the present work deals with distributed economic dispatch and demand response initiatives for grid-connected microgrids with high-penetration of wind power .	To cope with the challenge of the wind 's intrinsically stochastic availability , a novel energy planning approach involving the actual wind energy as well as the energy traded with the main grid , is introduced .	To bypass the prohibitively high-dimensional integration involved , an efficient sample average approximation method is utilized to obtain a solver with guaranteed convergence .
2	In this article , by an appropriate use of wave packets , we reveal the space-time structure of these correlations .	In homogeneous universes the propagation of quantum fields gives rise to pair creation of quanta with opposite momenta .	When computing expectation values of operators , the correlations between these quanta are averaged out and no space-time structure is obtained .	We show that every pair emerges from vacuum configurations which are torn apart so as to give rise to two semi-classical currents : that carried by the particle and that of its `partner ' .	The partner 's current lives behind the Hubble horizon centered around the particle .
3	They agree with each other except for Nf=2Nc-2 and 2Nc cases .	We study the low-energy effective theory in N=2 SU ( Nc ) supersymmetric QCD with Nf = & lt ; 2Nc fundamental hypermultiplets in the Coulomb branch by microscopic and exact approaches .	We calculate the one-instanton correction to the modulus u= & lt ; 1/2 Tr A^2 & gt ; from microscopic instanton calculation .	We also study the one-instanton corrections from the exact solutions for Nc=3 with massless hypermultiplets .	These differences come from possible ambiguities in the constructions of the exact solutions or the definitions of the operators in the microscopic theories .
0	Fuel cells offer an alternative to burning fossil fuels , but use platinum as a catalyst which is expensive and scarce .	Cheap , alternative catalysts could enable fuel cells to become serious contenders in the green energy sector .	One promising class of catalyst for electrochemical oxygen reduction is iron-containing , nanostructured , nitrogen-doped carbon .	The catalytic activity of such N-doped carbons has improved vastly over the years bringing industrial applications ever closer .	Stoichiometric carbon nitride powder has only been observed in recent years .
2	Two model-independent parametrization methods ( the binned parametrization and the polynomial interpolation parametrization ) are used in this paper .	We explore the cosmological consequences of the recently released Union2 sample of 557 Type Ia supernovae ( SNIa ) .	Combining this latest SNIa dataset with the Cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) anisotropy data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 year ( WMAP7 ) observations and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( BAO ) results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) Data Release 7 ( DR7 ) , we measure the dark energy density function $ f ( z ) \equiv \rho_ { de } ( z ) /\rho_ { de } ( 0 ) $ as a free function of redshift .	By using the $ \chi^2 $ statistic and the Bayesian information criterion , we find that the current observational data are still too limited to distinguish which parametrization method is better , and a simple model has advantage in fitting observational data than a complicated model .	Moreover , it is found that all these parametrizations demonstrate that the Union2 dataset is still consistent with a cosmological constant at 1 $ \sigma $ confidence level .
4	Our studies provide detailed information on the FFLO pairing states with spin-orbit coupling and Fermi surface asymmetry , and will facilitate experimental detection of these interesting pairing states in the future .	We study the phase diagram in a two-dimensional Fermi gas with the synthetic spin-orbit coupling that has recently been realized experimentally .	In particular , we characterize in detail the properties and the stability region of the unconventional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov ( FFLO ) states in such a system , which are induced by spin-orbit coupling and Fermi surface asymmetry .	We identify several distinct nodal FFLO states by studying the topology of their respective gapless contours in momentum space .	We then examine the phase structure and the number density distributions in a typical harmonic trapping potential under the local density approximation .
3	Such a space-time represents a black hole without an apparent horizon .	We consider a class of black holes for which the area of the two-dimensional spatial cross-section has a minimum on the horizon with respect to a quasiglobal ( Krusckal-like ) coordinate .	If the horizon is regular , one can generate a tubelike counterpart of such a metric and smoothly glue it to a black hole region .	The resulting composite space-time is globally regular , so all potential singuilarities under the horizon of the original metrics are removed .	It is essential that the matter should be non-vacuum in the outer region but vacuumlike in the inner one .
0	The lists of bits processed in quantum key distribution are necessarily of finite length .	The need for finite-key unconditional security bounds has been recognized long ago , but the theoretical tools have become available only very recently .	We provide finite-key unconditional security bounds for two practical implementations of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 coding : prepare-and-measure implementations without decoy states , and entanglement-based implementations .	A finite-key bound for prepare-and-measure implementations with decoy states is also derived under a simplified treatment of the statistical fluctuations .	The presentation is tailored to allow direct application of the bounds in experiments .
0	The clique number of an undirected graph $ G $ is the maximum order of a complete subgraph of $ G $ and is a well-known lower bound for the chromatic number of $ G $ .	Every proper $ k $ -coloring of $ G $ may be viewed as a homomorphism ( an edge-preserving vertex mapping ) of $ G $ to the complete graph of order $ k $ .	By considering homomorphisms of oriented graphs ( digraphs without cycles of length at most 2 ) , we get a natural notion of ( oriented ) colorings and oriented chromatic number of oriented graphs .	An oriented clique is then an oriented graph whose number of vertices and oriented chromatic number coincide .	However , the structure of oriented cliques is much less understood than in the undirected case .
3	The computations are done at lattice spacings of a \approx 0.11 fm and a \approx 0.08 fm , and the results demonstrate the improvement of rotational symmetry as a is reduced .	The spectrum of baryons containing three b quarks is calculated in nonperturbative QCD , using the lattice regularization .	The energies of ten excited bbb states with J^P = 1/2^+ , 3/2^+ , 5/2^+ , 7/2^+ , 1/2^- , and 3/2^- are determined with high precision .	A domain-wall action is used for the up- , down- and strange quarks , and the bottom quarks are implemented with NRQCD .	A large lattice volume of ( 2.7 fm ) ^3 is used , and extrapolations of the bbb spectrum to realistic values of the light sea-quark masses are performed .
2	A ballistic FET model is used to evaluate the capacitance and current-voltage characteristics .	Bandstructure effects in PMOS transport of strongly quantized silicon nanowire field-effect-transistors ( FET ) in various transport orientations are examined .	A 20-band sp3d5s* spin-orbit-coupled ( SO ) atomistic tight-binding model coupled to a self consistent Poisson solver is used for the valence band dispersion calculation .	The dispersion shapes and curvatures are strong functions of device size , lattice orientation , and bias , and can not be described within the effective mass approximation .	The anisotropy of the confinement mass in the different quantization directions can cause the charge to preferably accumulate in the ( 110 ) and secondly on the ( 112 ) rather than ( 100 ) surfaces , leading to significant charge distributions for different wire orientations .
4	At higher chemical potential , there occurs a `` three-stripe '' phase aligned parallel to the groove ( except for xenon ) .	We explore the behavior of neon , xenon , and methane filmas adsorbed on the external surface of a bundle of carbon nanotubes .	The methods used are classical : a ground state calculation , by grand potential energy minimization , and the grand canonical Monte Carlo ( GCMC ) method of simulation .	Our results are similar to those found recently in a GCMC study of Ar and Kr .	At low chemical potential ( pressure ) the particles form a quasi-one dimensional phase within the groove formed by two contiguous tubes .
4	We discuss several scenarios and tentatively propose that the radio emission could arise in a static ionized atmosphere around a fossil photoevaporated disk .	We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the compact ( ~ 0.05 '' ) , time-variable radio source projected near the center of the ultracompact HII region W3 ( OH ) .	The analysis of our new data as well as of VLA archival observations confirms the variability of the source on timescales of years and for a given epoch indicates a spectral index of \alpha = 1.3 +- 0.3 ( S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha ) .	This spectral index and the brightness temperature of the source ( ~6,500 K ) suggest that we are most probably detecting partially optically thick free-free radiation .	The radio source is probably associated with the ionizing star of W3 ( OH ) , but an interpretation in terms of an ionized stellar wind fails because the detected flux densities are orders of magnitude larger than expected .
2	The work emphasizes the importance of a correct description of the BN-C frontier .	We present a density functional theory study on the shape and arrangement of small BN domains embedded into single-walled carbon nanotubes .	We show a strong tendency for the BN hexagons formation at the simultaneous inclusion of B and N atoms within the walls of carbon nanotubes .	We suggest that BN-C interface will be formed preferentially with the participation of N-C bonds .	Thus , we propose a new way of stabilizing the small BN inclusions through the formation of nitrogen terminated borders .
0	We provide a novel model of gravity by using adjoint frame fields in four dimensions .	It has a natural interpretation as a gravitational theory of a complex metric field , which describes interactions between two real metrics .	The classical solutions establish three appealing features .	The spherical symmetric black hole solution has an additional hair , which includes the Schwarzschild solution as a special case .	The de Sitter solution is realized without introducing a cosmological constant .
2	However , if the free boundary condition is applied , quality factors will be greatly reduced by two effects resulting from free edges : the imaginary edge vibration effect and the artificial effect .	Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate edge effects on the quality factor of graphene nanoresonators with different edge configurations and of various sizes .	If the periodic boundary condition is applied , very high quality factors ( $ 3\times10^ { 5 } $ ) are obtained for all kinds of graphene nanoresonators .	Imaginary edge vibrations will flip between a pair of doubly degenerate warping states during the mechanical oscillation of nanoresonators .	The flipping process breaks the coherence of the mechanical oscillation of the nanoresonator , which is the dominant mechanism for extremely low quality factors .
3	Numerical examples illustrate the influence of different factors on the Resampling method efficiency .	The work is devoted to the analysis of the Resampling method proposed by A. Andronov and to the analysis of the Resampling method application possibility to the estimation and simulation of the calculation and logical systems reliability .	The work Simple and Hierarchical method properties are considered , algorithms for variance are shown .	The methods are applied for processes in the multitask operation system and queries to database analysis , a comparison with the classical method , that uses the empirical distribution functions , is made .	The task of the sample size optimization has been considered .
4	Should it be the case , it would be one of the most confident and closest ( to the Milky Way ) detections of a tidal dwarf galaxy and , at the same time , a most detached from its parent galaxy ( $ \approx $ 140 kpc ) object of this type .	We report discovery of a dwarf galaxy in the Leo Triplet .	Analysis of the neutral hydrogen distribution shows that it rotates independently of the tidal tail of NGC 3628 , with a radial velocity gradient of 35-40 km s $ ^ { -1 } $ over approximately 13 kpc .	The galaxy has a very high neutral gas content , explaining large part of its total dynamic mass - suggesting small dark matter content .	As it is located at the tip of the gaseous tail , this strongly suggests its tidal origin .
1	It well describes the nonlinear oscillator dynamics away from resonance .	We study the dissipative quantum Duffing oscillator in the deep quantum regime with two different approaches : The first is based on the exact Floquet states of the linear oscillator and the nonlinearity is treated perturbatively .	The second , in contrast , is applicable at and in the vicinity of a N-photon resonance and it exploits quasi-degenerate perturbation theory for the nonlinear oscillator in Floquet space .	It is perturbative both in driving and nonlinearity .	A combination of both approaches yields the possibility to cover the whole range of driving frequencies .
3	For the case of a clamped , thermally isolated plate , we show an exponential energy decay rate under a full damping for all elastic variables .	In the present article , we consider a thermoelastic plate of Reissner-Mindlin-Timoshenko type with the hyperbolic heat conduction arising from Cattaneo 's law .	In the absense of any additional mechanical dissipations , the system is often not even strongly stable unless restricted to the rotationally symmetric case , etc .	We present a well-posedness result for the linear problem under general mixed boundary conditions for the elastic and thermal parts .	Restricting the problem to the rotationally symmetric case , we further prove that a single frictional damping merely for the bending compoment is sufficient for exponential stability .
4	The low N abundance excludes CN cycling as being responsible for the low C abundance .	This paper reports the detection of a heavy element enriched RV Tauri variable with an abundance pattern that differs significantly from a standard s-process enriched object : V453 Oph .	Based on optical high-resolution spectra , we determined that this object of low intrinsic metallicity ( [ Fe/H ] = -2.2 ) has a mild , but significant , enrichment ( [ s/Fe ] ~ +0.5 ) of heavy elements for which the distribution points to slow neutron capture nucleosynthesis .	This result is strengthened by a comparative analysis to the non-enriched RV Tauri star DS Aqr ( [ s/Fe ] = 0.0 ) .	Although V453 Oph is the first RV Tauri star showing a strong s-process signature , it is NOT accompanied by C enhancement , challenging our current nucleosynthetic models of post-AGB stars that predict a simultaneous enrichment in C and s-process elements .
4	The X-ray and radio `` trails '' seen in other pulsar bow shocks may similarly represent the surface of the termination shock , rather than particles in the postshock flow as is usually argued .	We present an observation with the Chandra X-ray Observatory of the unusual radio source G359.23-0.82 ( `` the Mouse '' ) , along with updated radio timing data from the Parkes radio telescope on the coincident young pulsar J1747-2958 .	We find that G359.23-0.82 is a very luminous X-ray source ( L_X [ 0.5-8.0 keV ] = 5e34 ergs/s for a distance of 5 kpc ) , whose morphology consists of a bright head coincident with PSR J1747-2958 , plus a 45 '' -long narrow tail whose power-law spectrum steepens with distance from the pulsar .	We thus confirm that G359.23-0.82 is a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula powered by PSR J1747-2958 ; the nebular stand-off distance implies that the pulsar is moving with a Mach number of ~60 , suggesting a space velocity ~600 km/s through gas of density ~0.3 cm^-3 .	We combine the theory of ion-dominated pulsar winds with hydrodynamic simulations of pulsar bow shocks to show that a bright elongated X-ray and radio feature extending 10 '' behind the pulsar represents the surface of the wind termination shock .
4	On the other hand , if K & gt ; 1 and p & gt ; 1 , then the underlying subspaces can not be recovered or even nearly recovered by l_p minimization .	We assume i.i.d .	data sampled from a mixture distribution with K components along fixed d-dimensional linear subspaces and an additional outlier component .	For p & gt ; 0 , we study the simultaneous recovery of the K fixed subspaces by minimizing the l_p-averaged distances of the sampled data points from any K subspaces .	Under some conditions , we show that if $ 0 & lt ; p\leq1 $ , then all underlying subspaces can be precisely recovered by l_p minimization with overwhelming probability .
2	We compute continuum states with the correct asymptotic behavior through the R-matrix method .	Breakup cross sections are determined for the Borromean nucleus 22C by using a four-body eikonal model , including Coulomb corrections .	Bound and continuum states are constructed within a 20C + n + n three-body model in hyperspherical coordinates .	For the n+ n potential , we use the Minnesota interaction .	As there is no precise experimental information on 21C , we define different parameter sets for the 20C + n potentials .
3	These two datasets were homogeneously reduced and analyzed .	We present the first chemical analysis of stars on the double subgiant branch ( SGB ) of the globular cluster NGC 1851 .	We obtained 48 Magellan IMACS spectra of subgiants and fainter stars covering the spectral region between 3650-6750\AA , to derive C and N abundances from the spectral features at 4300\AA ( G-band ) and at ~ 3883\AA ( CN ) .	We added to our sample ~ 45 unvevolved stars previously observed with FORS2 at the VLT .	We derived abundances of C and N for a total of 64 stars and found considerable star-to-star variations in both [ C/H ] and [ N/H ] at all luminosities extending to the red giant branch ( RGB ) base ( V~18.9 ) .
1	Not only do pulsar searches continue to improve statistical estimates of , for example , pulsar birthrates , lifetimes and the Galactic distribution , but they continue to turn up interesting and , in some cases , unique individual pulsars .	There are many reasons why it is important to increase the number of known pulsars .	In the early days of pulsar astronomy , the Molonglo radio telescope led the world as a pulsar detection instrument .	However , the Parkes radio telescope , with its frequency versatility and greater tracking ablility , combined with sensitive receivers and powerful computer detection algorithms , is now the world 's most successful telescope at finding pulsars .	The Parkes multibeam survey , begun in 1997 , by itself will come close to doubling the number of known pulsars .
2	The time-dependence of the underlying cross-correlations is monitored using a time window of 60 trading days .	Effects connected with the world globalization affect also the financial markets .	On a way towards quantifying the related characteristics we study the financial empirical correlation matrix of the 60 companies which both the Deutsche Aktienindex ( DAX ) and the Dow Jones ( DJ ) industrial average comprised during the years 1990-1999 .	Our study shows that if the time-zone delays are properly accounted for the two distant markets largely merge into one .	This effect is particularly visible during the last few years .
1	Many basic problems are decidable and admit practical algorithms in the case of unions of conjunctive queries , but become difficult or even undecidable when queries are allowed to contain negation .	A well-established and fundamental insight in database theory is that negation ( also known as complementation ) tends to make queries difficult to process and difficult to reason about .	Inspired by recent results in finite model theory , we consider a restricted form of negation , guarded negation .	We introduce a fragment of SQL , called GN-SQL , as well as a fragment of Datalog with stratified negation , called GN-Datalog , that allow only guarded negation , and we show that these query languages are computationally well behaved , in terms of testing query containment , query evaluation , open-world query answering , and boundedness .	GN-SQL and GN-Datalog subsume a number of well known query languages and constraint languages , such as unions of conjunctive queries , monadic Datalog , and frontier-guarded tgds .
1	Under fairly general conditions , the dual expressions decompose into tree terms , corresponding to the agent 's risk preferences , trading costs and portfolio constraints , respectively .	This paper studies convex duality in optimal investment and contingent claim valuation in markets where traded assets may be subject to nonlinear trading costs and portfolio constraints .	The dual representations are shown to be valid when the market model satisfies an appropriate generalization of the no-arbitrage condition and the agent 's utility function satisfies an appropriate generalization of asymptotic elasticity conditions .	When applied to classical liquid market models or models with bid-ask spreads , we recover well-known pricing formulas in terms of martingale measures and consistent price systems .	Building on the general theory of convex stochastic optimization , we also derive optimality conditions in terms of an extended notion of a `` shadow price '' .
0	A finite element method using B-splines is presented and compared with a conventional finite element method of Lagrangian type .	The efficiency of both methods has been investigated at the example of a coupled non-linear system of Dirac eigenvalue equations and inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equations which describe a nuclear system in the framework of relativistic mean field theory .	Although , FEM has been applied with great success in nuclear RMF recently , a well known problem is the appearance of spurious solutions in the spectra of the Dirac equation .	The question , whether B-splines lead to a reduction of spurious solutions is analyzed .	Numerical expenses , precision and behavior of convergence are compared for both methods in view of their use in large scale computation on FEM grids with more dimensions .
0	Nuclear reactors provide intense sources of electron antineutrinos , characterized by few-MeV energy E and unoscillated spectral shape Phi ( E ) .	High-statistics observations of reactor neutrino oscillations over medium-baseline distances L ~ O ( 50 ) km would provide unprecedented opportunities to probe both the long-wavelength mass-mixing parameters ( delta m^2 and theta_12 ) and the short-wavelength ones ( Delta m^2 and theta_13 ) , together with the subtle interference effects associated with the neutrino mass hierarchy ( either normal or inverted ) .	In a given experimental setting - here taken as in the JUNO project for definiteness - the achievable hierarchy sensitivity and parameter accuracy depend not only on the accumulated statistics but also on systematic uncertainties , which include ( but are not limited to ) the mass-mixing priors and the normalizations of signals and backgrounds .	We examine , in addition , the effect of introducing smooth deformations of the detector energy scale , E - & gt ; E ' ( E ) , and of the reactor flux shape , Phi ( E ) - & gt ; Phi ' ( E ) , within reasonable error bands inspired by state-of-the-art estimates .	It turns out that energy-scale and flux-shape systematics can noticeably affect the performance of a JUNO-like experiment , both on the hierarchy discrimination and on precision oscillation physics .
0	In this paper the semi-classical approach to the solution of non-linear evolution equation is developed .	We found the solution in the entire kinematic region to the non-linear evolution equation that governs the dynamics in the high parton density QCD .	The large impact parameter ( $ b_t $ ) behavior of the solution is discussed as well as the way how to include the non-perturbative QCD corrections in this region of $ b_t $ .	The geometrical scaling behavior and other properties of the solution in the saturation ( Color Glass Condensate ) kinematic domain are analyzed .	We obtain the asymptotic behavior for the physical observables and found the unitarity bounds for them .
1	To show the lens feasibility , the assembling of a Laue lens petal prototype with 20 m focal length is ongoing .	We will describe the LAUE project , supported by the Italian Space Agency , whose aim is to demonstrate the capability to build a focusing optics in the hard X-/soft gamma-ray domain ( 80 -- 600 keV ) .	Indeed , a feasibility study , within the LAUE project , has demonstrated that a Laue lens made of petals is feasible .	Our goal is a lens in the 80-600 keV energy band .	In addition to a detailed description of the new LARIX facility , in which the lens is being assembled , we will report the results of the project obtained so far .
0	Neural populations encode information about their stimulus in a collective fashion , by joint activity patterns of spiking and silence .	A full account of this mapping from stimulus to neural activity is given by the conditional probability distribution over neural codewords given the sensory input .	To be able to infer a model for this distribution from large-scale neural recordings , we introduce a stimulus-dependent maximum entropy ( SDME ) model -- -a minimal extension of the canonical linear-nonlinear model of a single neuron , to a pairwise-coupled neural population .	The model is able to capture the single-cell response properties as well as the correlations in neural spiking due to shared stimulus and due to effective neuron-to-neuron connections .	Here we show that in a population of 100 retinal ganglion cells in the salamander retina responding to temporal white-noise stimuli , dependencies between cells play an important encoding role .
1	The lens creates eight well-resolved sub-images of a background galaxy , seen in deep imaging with HST .	We construct a high resolution mass map of the z=0.39 cluster 0024+1654 , based on parametric inversion of the associated gravitational lens .	Excluding mass concentrations centered on visible galaxies , more than 98 % of the remaining mass is represented by a smooth concentration of dark matter centered near the brightest cluster galaxies , with a 35 h^ { -1 } kpc soft core .	The asymmetry in the mass distribution is & lt ; 3 % inside 107 ~h^ { -1 } kpc radius .	The dark matter distribution we observe in CL0024 is far more smooth , symmetric , and nonsingular than in typical simulated clusters in either Omega=1 or Omega=0.3 CDM cosmologies .
4	In addition , this method allows to uniquely define physical voids and identify and study the caustic surfaces directly .	A novel method allowing to compute density , velocity and other fields in cosmological N -- body simulations with unprecedentedly high spatial resolution is described .	It is based on the tessellation of the three-dimensional manifold representing cold dark matter in six-dimensional phase space .	The density , velocity and other fields are computed by projecting the tessellation on configuration space .	The application of this technique to cosmological N -- body simulations in LambdaCDM cosmology reveals a far more elaborate cosmic web then dot plots or self -- adaptive SPH .
1	The sensitiveness of the transition to the conjugated external field ( stress ) , together with the latent heat of the transition gives rise to giant mechanocaloric effects .	Shape memory alloys are a class of ferroic materials which undergo a structural ( martensitic ) transition where the associated ferroic property is a lattice distortion ( strain ) .	In non-magnetic shape memory alloys , the lattice distortion is mostly described by a pure shear and the martensitic transition in this family of alloys is strongly affected by uniaxial stress whereas it is basically insensitive to hydrostatic pressure .	As a result , non-magnetic alloys exhibit giant elastocaloric effects but negligible barocaloric effects .	By contrast , in a number of magnetic shape memory alloys , the lattice distortion at the martensitic transition involves a volume change in addition to the shear strain .
3	For instance , if it is assumed that the 4-dimensional effective theory is the minimal supersymmetric standard model with supersymmetry breaking parameters induced mainly by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism , a correct electroweak symmetry breaking can not be achieved for reasonable range of parameters of the model , even when one includes additional contributions to the Higgs mass parameters from the auxiliary component of 4-dimensional conformal compensator .	We examine the Higgs mass parameters and electroweak symmetry breaking in supersymmetric orbifold field theories in which the 4-dimensional Higgs fields originate from higher-dimensional gauge supermultiplets .	It is noted that such gauge-Higgs unification leads to a specific boundary condition on the Higgs mass parameters at the compactification scale , which is independent of the details of supersymmetry breaking mechanism .	With this boundary condition , phenomenologically viable parameter space of the model is severely constrained by the condition of electroweak symmetry breaking for supersymmetry breaking scenarios which can be realized naturally in orbifold field theories .	However if there exists a supersymmetry breaking mediated by brane superfield , sizable portion of the parameter space can give a correct electroweak symmetry breaking .
3	It becomes even negative at low temperature where the transport is ballistic .	We have investigated the magnetoresistance of ferromagnet-semiconductor devices in an InAs two-dimensional electron gas system in which the magnetic field has a sinusoidal profile .	The magnetoresistance of our device is large .	The longitudinal resistance has an additional contribution which is odd in applied magnetic field .	Based on the numerical analysis , we confirmed that our data can be explained in terms of the local Hall effect due to the profile of negative and positive field regions .
4	The continuum limit of the Kazakov -- Migdal model corresponds to the critical point of this statistical system .	We investigate a class of operators with non-vanishing averages in a D-dimensional matrix model recently proposed by Kazakov and Migdal .	Among the operators considered are `` filled Wilson loops '' which are the most reasonable counterparts of Wilson loops in the conventional Wilson formulation of lattice QCD .	The averages of interest are represented as partition functions of certain 2-dimensional statistical systems with nearest neighbor interactions .	The `` string tension '' $ \alpha ' $ , which is the exponent in the area law for the `` filled Wilson loop '' is equal to the free energy density of the corresponding statistical system .
1	Rapid magnetic field pulses induced coherent atom-molecule oscillations in the BEC .	We precisely measured the binding energy of a molecular state near the Feshbach resonance in a $ ^ { 85 } $ Rb Bose-Einstein condensate ( BEC ) .	We measured the oscillation frequency as a function of B-field and fit the data to a coupled-channels model .	Our analysis constrained the Feshbach resonance position [ 155.041 ( 18 ) G ] , width [ 10.71 ( 2 ) G ] , and background scattering length [ -443 ( 3 ) a $ _0 $ ] and yielded new values for $ v_ { DS } $ , $ v_ { DT } $ , and $ C_6 $ .	These results improved our estimate for the stability condition of an attractive BEC .
4	Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure .	Large RNA molecules often carry multiple functional domains whose spatial arrangement is an important determinant of their function .	Pre-mRNA splicing , furthermore , relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns .	Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes .	Albeit a crude measure , the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium therefore provides useful information on the overall shape of the molecule can provide insights into the interplay of its functional domains .
3	It is demonstrated that the shape of the disc-mass distribution has a significant impact on the quantity of the disc-mass and angular momentum losses in star-disc encounters .	Investigations of stellar encounters in cluster environments have demonstrated their potential influence on the mass and angular momentum of protoplanetary discs around young stars .	In this study it is investigated in how far the initial surface density in the disc surrounding a young star influences the outcome of an encounter .	Based on a power-law ansatz for the surface density , $ \Sigma ( r ) \propto r^ { -p } $ , a parameter study of star-disc encounters with different initial disc-mass distributions has been performed using N-body simulations .	Most sensitive are the results where the outer parts of the disc are perturbed by high-mass stars .
4	Here , we take an important step towards the goal of finding a chiral spin liquid in nature by examining a physically motivated model for a Mott insulator on the Kagome lattice with broken time-reversal symmetry .	Topological phases in frustrated quantum spin systems have fascinated researchers for decades .	One of the earliest proposals for such a phase was the chiral spin liquid put forward by Kalmeyer and Laughlin in 1987 as the bosonic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect .	Elusive for many years , recent times have finally seen a number of models that realize this phase .	However , these models are somewhat artificial and unlikely to be found in realistic materials .
1	A combination of fitting results of $ w_ { de } $ from these three spline methods reveal essential properties of real equation of state $ w_ { de } $ .	The model-independent piecewise parametrizations ( 0-spline , linear-spline and cubic-spline ) are used to estimate constraints of equation of state of dark energy ( $ w_ { de } $ ) from current observational data ( including SNIa , BAO and Hubble parameter ) and the simulated future data .	It is shown that $ w_ { de } $ beyond redshift $ z\sim0.5 $ is poorly constrained from current data , and the mock future $ \sim2300 $ supernovae data give poor constraints of $ w_ { de } $ beyond $ z\sim1 $ .	The fitting results also indicate that there might exist a rapid transition of $ w_ { de } $ around $ z\sim0.5 $ .	The difference between three spline methods in reconstructing and constraining $ w_ { de } $ has also been discussed .
3	The observed resonance energies and widths of the negative-parity levels are all in fair agreement with those calculated from both the spin-dipole and electric-dipole strength functions as well as the energy eigenvalues of the complex scaled Hamiltonian .	Both isoscalar and isovector spin-dipole excitations of $ ^4 $ He are studied using realistic nuclear forces in the complex scaling method .	The ground state of $ ^4 $ He and discretized continuum states with $ J^ { \pi } =0^- , 1^- , 2^- $ for A=4 nuclei are described in explicitly correlated Gaussians reinforced with global vectors for angular motion .	Two- and three-body decay channels are specifically treated to take into account final state interactions .	Spin-dipole sum rules , both non energy-weighted and energy-weighted , are discussed in relation to tensor correlations in the ground state of $ ^4 $ He .
1	Shear produces smooth affine deformations in such a solid and also irresversible so-called non-affine particle displacements .	Through 2D granular Couette flow experiments , we probe failure and deformation of disordered solids under shear .	We examine both processes .	We show that the non-affine part is associated with diffusion , and also can be used to define a granular temperature .	Distributions for single particle non-affine displacements , $ \dri $ , satisfy $ P_1 ( \dri ) \propto \exp [ -|\dri/\Delta r|^ { \alpha } ] $ ( $ \alpha \stackrel { & lt ; } { \sim } 2 $ ) .
3	The observed structures were in excellent agreement with quantum scattering calculations .	In molecular collisions , resonances occur at specific energies where the colliding particles temporarily form quasi-bound complexes , resulting in rapid variations in the energy dependence of scattering cross sections .	Experimentally , it has proven challenging to observe such scattering resonances , especially in differential cross sections .	We report the observation of resonance fingerprints in the state-to-state differential cross sections for inelastic NO-He collisions in the 13 to 19 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ energy range with 0.3 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ resolution .	They were analyzed by separating the resonance contributions to the differential cross sections from the background through a partitioning of the multichannel scattering matrix .
1	Here I survey various model independent probes of Majorana neutrino mass origins .	The scale of neutrino mass generation may be too large to explore directly , but useful information may still be extracted from independent experimental channels .	An introduction to the concepts relevant to the analysis is followed by a discussion of the physical ranges of neutrino parameters within the context of standard and non-standard interactions .	Armed with this , I move on to systematically analyze the properties of radiatively generated neutrino masses induced by nonrenormalizable lepton number violating effective operators of mass dimensions five through eleven .	By fitting these to the observed light mass scale , I extract predictions for neutrino mixing as well as neutrinoless double beta decay , rare meson/tau decays and collider phenomenology .
2	We find that non-thermal , high energy electrons and ions can be quickly produced by an action of electrostatic wakefields generated by the ponderomotive force of the precursor waves .	A particle acceleration mechanism by radiation pressure of precursor waves in a relativistic shock is studied .	For a relativistic , perpendicular shock with the upstream bulk Lorentz factor of $ \gamma_1 \gg 1 $ , large amplitude electromagnetic ( light ) waves are known to be excited in the shock front due to the synchrotron maser instability , and those waves can propagate towards upstream as precursor waves .	The particles can be quickly accelerated up to $ \epsilon_ { \rm max } /\gamma_1 m_e c^2 \sim \gamma_1 $ in the upstream coherent wakefield region , and they can be further accelerated during the nonlinear stage of the wakefield evolution .	The maximum attainable energy is estimated by $ \epsilon_ { \rm max } /\gamma_1 m_e c^2 \sim L_ { \rm sys } / ( c/\omega_ { pe } ) $ , where $ L_ { \rm sys } $ and $ c/\omega_ { pe } $ are the size of an astrophysical object and the electron inertial length , respectively .
0	We propose a recipe to construct the DLCQ Hamiltonian of type IIB string theory on the AdS ( and/or plane-wave ) background .	We consider a system of J number of coincident unstable non-BPS D0-branes of IIB theory in the light-cone gauge and on the plane-wave background with a compact null direction , the dynamics of which is described by the world-line U ( J ) gauge theory .	This configuration suffers from tachyonic instabilities .	Having instabilities been cured through the process of open string tachyon condensation , by expanding the theory about true minima of the effective potential and furthermore taking low energy limit to decouple the heavy modes , we end up with a 0+1-dimensional supersymmetric U ( J ) gauge theory , a Matrix Theory .	We conjecture that the Hamiltonian of this Matrix Theory is just the DLCQ Hamiltonian of type IIB string theory on the AdS or equivalently plane-wave background in a sector with J units of light-cone momentum .
2	Moreover , we explicitly compute this density .	For a fixed rational number g , not equal to -1,0 or 1 and integers a and d we consider the set of primes p for which the order of g ( mod p ) is congruent to a ( mod d ) .	For d=4 and d=3 it is shown that , under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis , these sets have a natural density .	For d=4 this generalises earlier work by K. Chinen and L. Murata .	The case d=3 was apparently not considered before .
3	The resonant points are determined by the energy switch effect exhibited by the vanishing of the amplitude difference of the upper and lower oscillations .	Resonant Switch ( RS ) model of twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations ( HF QPOs ) assumes switch of twin oscillations at a resonant point where frequencies of the upper and lower oscillations become commensurable and the twin oscillations change from one pair of the oscillating modes ( corresponding to a specific model of HF QPOs ) to some other pair due to non-linear resonant phenomena .	The RS model is used to determine range of allowed values of spin and mass of the neutron star located at the atoll source 4U 1636-53 where two resonant points are observed at frequency ratios $ nu_ { U } $ : $ nu_ { L } $ = 3:2 , 5:4 .	We consider the standard specific models of the twin oscillations based on the orbital and epicyclic geodetical frequencies .	The predicted ranges of the neutron star parameters are strongly dependent on the twin modes applied in the RS model .
4	Through comparisons between all combinations of models , techniques , and materials , we find that the bond-isotropic $ JK\Gamma $ model consistently predicts the experimental phase of $ \beta $ -Li $ _2 $ IrO $ _3 $ regardless of the method used , while the experimental phase of $ \gamma $ -Li $ _2 $ IrO $ _3 $ can be generated by the soft-spin approach with eigenmode mixing irrespective of the model used .	Two recent theoretical works studied the role of Kitaev interactions in the newly observed incommensurate magnetic order in the hyper-honeycomb ( $ \beta $ -Li $ _2 $ IrO $ _3 $ ) and stripy-honeycomb ( $ \gamma $ -Li $ _2 $ IrO $ _3 $ ) iridates .	Each of these works analyzed a different model ( $ JK\Gamma $ versus coupled zigzag chain model ) using a contrasting method ( classical versus soft-spin analysis ) .	The lack of commonality between these works precludes meaningful comparisons and a proper understanding of these unusual orderings .	In this study , we complete the unfinished picture initiated by these two works by solving both models with both approaches for both 3D honeycomb iridates .
4	These results are consistent with those obtained previously for a continuous-time quantum walk .	The mixing time of a discrete-time quantum walk on the hypercube is considered .	The mean probability distribution of a Markov chain on a hypercube is known to mix to a uniform distribution in time O ( n log n ) .	We show that the mean probability distribution of a discrete-time quantum walk on a hypercube mixes to a ( generally non-uniform ) distribution pi ( x ) in time O ( n ) and the stationary distribution is determined by the initial state of the walk .	An explicit expression for pi ( x ) is derived for the particular case of a symmetric walk .
4	At the Solar Circle , at least 12 % of all open clusters appear to be experiencing some type of interaction with another cluster ; i.e. , are possible binaries .	Observations indicate that the fraction of potential binary star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds is about 10 % .	In contrast , it is widely accepted that the binary cluster frequency in the Galaxy disk is much lower .	Here we investigate the multiplicity of clusters in the Milky Way disk to either confirm or disprove this dearth of binaries .	We quantify the open cluster multiplicity using complete , volume-limited samples from WEBDA and NCOVOCC .
3	These intuitions are excellent ones for understanding our conscious conception of ordered events .	Most of us think we know some basic facts about how time works .	The facts we believe we know are based on a few intuitions about time , which are , in turn , based on our conscious waking experiences .	As far as I can tell , these intuitions about time are something like this : 1 ) There is a physical world in which events occur , 2 ) These events are mirrored by our perceptual re-creation of them in essentially the same order in which they occur in the physical world , 3 ) This re-creation of events occurs in a linear order based on our conscious memory of them ( e.g. , event A is said to occur before event B if at some point we do remember event A but we don not yet remember event B , and at another point we remember both events ) , 4 ) Assuming we have good memories , what we remember has occurred in the past and what we don not remember but we can imagine might : a ) never occur , b ) occur when we are not conscious , or c ) occur in the future .	However , they do not tell us anything about how the non-conscious processes in our brains navigate events in time .
1	Results from LEP and CDF on the width difference $ \dgs $ are presented , the corresponding average is found to be in good agreement with the present theoretical estimation .	The current status of the experimental knowledge of $ \Bs $ meson physics is reviewed .	The $ \Bs $ oscillations have not yet been resolved , despite the progress recently achieved by SLD and ALEPH .	The world combination , including results from the LEP experiments , SLD and CDF , is presented , together with the expected and observed lower limit on the $ \Bs $ oscillation frequency .	A tantalizing hint of an oscillation is observed around $ \dms\sim17 \psin $ , near future results could increase the significance of this hint .
1	First we analyze the distribution of wavefunction intensities and compare them with the predictions derived in the framework of diffusive { \it disordered } samples .	We consider a two-dimensional ( 2D ) generalization of the standard kicked-rotor ( KR ) and show that it is an excellent model for the study of 2D quantum systems with underlying diffusive classical dynamics .	Next , we turn the closed system into an open one by constructing a scattering matrix .	The distribution of the resonance widths $ { \cal P } ( \Gamma ) $ and Wigner delay times $ { \cal P } ( \tau_W ) $ are investigated .	The forms of these distributions are obtained for different symmetry classes and the traces of classical diffusive dynamics are identified .
4	We also provide a quantitative calculation of the efficiency of particle acceleration at cosmic ray modified shocks and we identify the fraction of energy which is advected downstream and that of particles escaping the system from upstream infinity at the maximum momentum .	The dynamical reaction of the particles accelerated at a shock front by the first order Fermi process can be determined within kinetic models that account for both the hydrodynamics of the shocked fluid and the transport of the accelerated particles .	These models predict the appearance of multiple solutions , all physically allowed .	We discuss here the role of injection in selecting the real solution , in the framework of a simple phenomenological recipe , which is a variation of what is sometimes referred to as thermal leakage .	In this context we show that multiple solutions basically disappear and when they are present they are limited to rather peculiar values of the parameters .
1	We analyze their relations with general $ F $ -Sobolev inequalities , thus extending Gross hypercontractivity theory .	We introduce and study a notion of Orlicz hypercontractive semigroups .	We provide criteria for these Sobolev type inequalities and for related properties .	In particular , we implement in the context of probability measures the ideas of Maz'ja 's capacity theory , and present equivalent forms relating the capacity of sets to their measure .	Orlicz hypercontractivity efficiently describes the integrability improving properties of the Heat semigroup associated to the Boltzmann measures $ \mu_\alpha ( dx ) = ( Z_\alpha ) ^ { -1 } e^ { -2|x|^\alpha } dx $ , when $ \alpha\in ( 1,2 ) $ .
0	How to forecast next year 's portfolio-wide credit default rate based on last year 's default observations and the current score distribution ?	A classical approach to this problem consists of fitting a mixture of the conditional score distributions observed last year to the current score distribution .	This is a special ( simple ) case of a finite mixture model where the mixture components are fixed and only the weights of the components are estimated .	The optimum weights provide a forecast of next year 's portfolio-wide default rate .	We point out that the maximum-likelihood ( ML ) approach to fitting the mixture distribution not only gives an optimum but even an exact fit if we allow the mixture components to vary but keep their density ratio fix .
4	If the charge is sufficiently small , the causal structure has a space-like singularity .	In this paper , we investigate the dynamical formation and evolution of 2 + 1-dimensional charged black holes .	We numerically study dynamical collapses of charged matter fields in an anti de Sitter background and note the formation of black holes using the double-null formalism .	Moreover , we include re-normalized energy-momentum tensors assuming the S-wave approximation to determine thermodynamical back-reactions to the internal structures .	If there is no semi-classical effects , the amount of charge determines the causal structures .
2	For $ \phi & gt ; \phi_ { c } $ , there is a crossover frequency , $ \omega^ { * } $ below which the density of states drops towards zero .	We numerically study the vibrations of jammed packings of particles interacting with finite-range , repulsive potentials at zero temperature .	As the packing fraction $ \phi $ is lowered towards the onset of unjamming at $ \phi_ { c } $ , the density of vibrational states approaches a non-zero value in the limit of zero frequency .	This crossover frequency obeys power-law scaling with $ \phi-\phi_ { c } $ .	Characteristic length scales , determined from the dominant wavevector contributing to the eigenmode at $ \omega^ { * } $ , diverge as power-laws at the unjamming transition .
4	The dual superstring theory must have a peculiar property that its only field-theoretic degree of freedom is a massless RR scalar .	We use the recently found matrix description of noncritical superstring theory of Type 0A to compute tachyon scattering amplitudes in a background with a RR flux .	We find that after the string coupling is multiplicatively renormalized , the amplitudes in any genus become polynomial in the RR flux .	We propose that in the limit where both the string coupling and the RR flux go to infinity , the theory has a weakly-coupled description in terms of another superstring theory with a vanishingly small RR flux .	This duality exchanges the inverse string coupling and the 0-brane charge .
0	In this paper , we investigate novel strategies for generating rate-compatible ( RC ) irregular low-density parity-check ( LDPC ) codes with short/moderate block lengths .	We propose three puncturing and two extension schemes , which are designed to determine the puncturing positions that minimize the performance degradation and the extension that maximize the performance .	The first puncturing scheme employs a counting cycle algorithm and a grouping strategy for variable nodes having short cycles of equal length in the Tanner Graph ( TG ) .	The second scheme relies on a metric called Extrinsic Message Degree ( EMD ) and the third scheme is a simulation-based exhaustive search to find the best puncturing pattern among several random ones .	In addition , we devise two layer-structured extension schemes based on a counting cycle algorithm and an EMD metric which are applied to design RC-LDPC codes .
0	Three billion years after the big bang ( at redshift z=2 ) , half of the most massive galaxies were already old , quiescent systems with little to no residual star formation and extremely compact with stellar mass densities at least an order of magnitude larger than in low redshift ellipticals , their descendants .	Little is known about how they formed , but their evolved , dense stellar populations suggest formation within intense , compact starbursts 1-2 Gyr earlier ( at 3 & lt ; z & lt ; 6 ) .	Simulations show that gas-rich major mergers can give rise to such starbursts which produce dense remnants .	Sub-millimeter selected galaxies ( SMGs ) are prime examples of intense , gas-rich , starbursts .	With a new , representative spectroscopic sample of compact quiescent galaxies at z=2 and a statistically well-understood sample of SMGs , we show that z=3-6 SMGs are consistent with being the progenitors of z=2 quiescent galaxies , matching their formation redshifts and their distributions of sizes , stellar masses and internal velocities .
0	We develop the idea for a new string field theory of ours that was proposed earlier in a very rudimentary form in a talk in the Symposium of Tohwa University [ 1 ] .	The main point is to describe the system of strings in the Universe by means of the images of the derivatives of the right and left mover parts of the 26-position vector on the strings w.r.t.tau .	The major progress since the Tohwa-talks [ 1 ] is to imagine a discretization of the variables on which right and left movers respectively depend .	We then observe that , by using only the descritized even-numbered sites , we can set the commutation rules for second quantization without any contradiction .	In fact we can quantize the objects described by these even numbered images .
0	We consider multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) transmit beamforming systems with maximum ratio combining ( MRC ) receivers .	The operating environment is Rayleigh-fading with both transmit and receive spatial correlation .	We present exact expressions for the probability density function ( p.d.f . )	of the output signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , as well as the system outage probability .	The results are based on explicit closed-form expressions which we derive for the p.d.f.and c.d.f .
0	We derive the structural relations between the Mellin transforms of weighted Nielsen integrals emerging in the calculation of massless or massive single -- scale quantities in QED and QCD , such as anomalous dimensions and Wilson coefficients , and other hard scattering cross sections depending on a single scale .	The set of all multiple harmonic sums up to weight five cover the sums needed in the calculation of the 3 -- loop anomalous dimensions .	The relations extend the set resulting from the quasi-shuffle product between harmonic sums studied earlier .	Unlike the shuffle relations , they depend on the value of the quantities considered .	Up to weight { \sf w = 5 } , 242 nested harmonic sums contribute .
4	The first is to re-run a static algorithm after a chosen number of updates to ensure approximation guarantees .	We present the first data structures that maintain near optimal maximum cardinality and maximum weighted matchings on sparse graphs in sublinear time per update .	Our main result is a data structure that maintains a $ ( 1+\epsilon ) $ approximation of maximum matching under edge insertions/deletions in worst case $ O ( \sqrt { m } \epsilon^ { -2 } ) $ time per update .	This improves the 3/2 approximation given in [ Neiman , Solomon , STOC 2013 ] which runs in similar time .	The result is based on two ideas .
3	We present numerical results for total cross sections as well as for experimentally interesting distributions .	We have calculated the electroweak O ( \alpha ) corrections to the processes p p - & gt ; Z \gamma + X - & gt ; \nu_l \bar { \nu } _l \gamma + X , p p - & gt ; Z \gamma + X - & gt ; l \bar { l } \gamma + X , and p p - & gt ; W \gamma + X - & gt ; \nu_l \bar { l } \gamma + X at the LHC , with l=e , \mu and \nu_l=\nu_e , \nu_\mu , \nu_\tau .	The virtual corrections are evaluated in leading-pole approximation , whereas the real corrections are taken into account exactly .	These corrections are implemented into a Monte Carlo generator which includes both phase-space slicing and subtraction to deal with soft and collinear singularities .	Applying typical LHC cuts , the electroweak corrections are of the order of -5 % for the total cross sections and exceed -20 % for observables dominated by high centre-of-mass energies of the partonic processes .
0	In this paper , we compare problems of cluster formation and cluster-head selection between different protocols for data aggregation and transmission .	We focus on two aspects of the problem : ( i ) how to guess number of clusters required to proficiently consume available sources for a sensor network , and ( ii ) how to select number of cluster-heads to cover up sensor networks more proficiently .	A sensor in Wireless Sensor Networks ( WSNs ) can communicate directly only with other sensors that are within a radio range in a cluster .	However , in order to enable communication between sensors not within communication range , they must form new clusters in distributed sensors .	Several clustering algorithms such as LEACH , DEEC , and SEP have been proposed with the objectives of energy minimization , route-path selection , increased connectivity and network longevity .
2	This paper briefly summarizes the most important theoretical results and approaches to cross section calculations in order to place the discussion in historical perspective and offer a concise introduction to the topic .	The values of ion-atom ionization cross sections are frequently needed for many applications that utilize the propagation of fast ions through matter .	When experimental data and theoretical calculations are not available , approximate formulas are frequently used .	Based on experimental data and theoretical predictions , a new fit for ionization cross sections is proposed .	The range of validity and accuracy of several frequently used approximations ( classical trajectory , the Born approximation , and so forth ) are discussed using , as examples , the ionization cross sections of hydrogen and helium atoms by various fully stripped ions .
1	Moderately large cells with 8 formula units ( 56 atoms ) are studied for all dopings and large ones with 27 formula units ( 189 atoms ) for the case of La-doping .	Spin-polarized band calculations for supercells of SrB $ _ { 6 } $ , where a La- , In- or Al- impurity or a vacancy is replacing one Sr , are performed within the local spin density approximation .	The undoped system has a vanishing density-of-states ( DOS ) at the Fermi energy ( E $ _F $ ) , while the additional La-d band makes E $ _F $ to enter the bands above the gap .	An Al ( or In ) impurity has the opposite effect , with a rigid-band like shift of E_F to below the gap .	In the former case , the addition of a d-electron makes a local , impurity-like modification of the electronic structure close to the La atom .
2	The determined cell parameters were : a = 8.5705 ( 3 ) { \AA } , b = 8.5629 ( 3 ) { \AA } , and c = 12.1198 ( 4 ) { \AA } , and cell volume , V = 889.45 ( 5 ) { \AA } 3 with Z = 4 .	New Zn1.5Co1.5B7O13Br boracite crystals were grown by chemical transport reactions in quartz ampoules , at a temperature of 1173 K. The crystal structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction .	The crystals present an orthorhombic structure with space group Pca21 , ( No.29 ) .	Magnetic properties in single crystals of the new boracite , were determined .	The Susceptibility-Temperature ( X -T ) behavior at different magnetic intensities was studied .
3	The second , operative at strong coupling , corresponds to formation of a large black hole in the dual supergravity .	We study the process of bound state formation in a D-brane collision .	We consider two mechanisms for bound state formation .	The first , operative at weak coupling in the worldvolume gauge theory , is pair creation of W-bosons .	These two processes agree qualitatively at intermediate coupling , in accord with the correspondence principle of Horowitz and Polchinski .
2	In addition to problems with a standard Cauchy condition at the terminal time , problems with special non-local boundary conditions are considered .	Backward stochastic partial differential equations of parabolic type in bounded domains are studied in the setting where the coercivity condition is not necessary satisfied and the equation can be degenerate .	Some generalized solutions based on the representation theorem are suggested .	These non-local conditions connect the terminal value of the solution with a functional over the entire past solution .	Uniqueness , solvability and regularity results are obtained .
1	The partonic processes are dominated by the t-channel weak boson fusion ( WBF ) and gluon fusion ( GF ) contributions .	We study Higgs boson plus two high energy jets production at the LHC in the kinematics where the two jets are well separated in rapidity .	We derive the associated QCD resummation formalism for the correlation analysis where the total transverse momentum q_\perp of the Higgs boson and two jets is small .	Because of different color structures , the resummation results lead to distinguished behaviors : the WBF contribution peaks at relative low q_\perp while all GF channel contributions are strongly de-correlated and spread to a much wider q_\perp range .	By applying a kinematic cut on q_\perp , one can effectively increase the WBF signal to the GF background by a significant factor .
2	Equilibrium and Vlasov solver have to be tuned in order to preserve constant states ( equilibrium ) and to provide good conservation property along time ( mass to begin with ) .	Inaccurate description of the equilibrium can yield to spurious effects in gyrokinetic turbulence simulations .	Also , the Vlasov solver and time integration schemes impact the conservation of physical quantities , especially in long-term simulations .	Several illustrative simple test cases are given to show typical spurious effects that one can observes for poor settings .	We explain why Forward Semi-Lagrangian scheme bring us some benefits .
2	Motivated by these experimental results , we propose a novel lepton flavor mixing pattern , which predicts sin^2 theta_23 = 1/2 , sin^2 theta_12 = ( 2+\sqrt { 3 } ) / ( 10+\sqrt { 3 } ) ~ 0.318 and sin^2 theta_13 = ( 2-\sqrt { 3 } ) /12 ~ 0.022 , together with a maximal CP-violating phase delta = 90^\circ .	The Daya Bay Collaboration has recently observed neutrino oscillations in the nu_e-bar - & gt ; nu_e-bar disappearance channel , indicating that sin^2 theta_13 = 0.024 + ( - ) 0.005 ( 1 sigma ) and theta_13 = 0 is already excluded at the 5.2 sigma confidence level .	Now three neutrino mixing angles have been measured to a good degree of accuracy ( theta_12 ~ 34^\circ , theta_23 ~ 45^\circ and theta_13 ~ 9^\circ ) .	The leptonic CP violation characterized by the Jarlskog invariant { \cal J } = \sqrt { 6 } /72 ~ 3.4 % is promising to be measured in the future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .	Furthermore , we point out that a generalized version of mu-tau symmetry may exist in the neutrino sector and can give rise to the aforementioned mixing pattern .
2	Our version of the change of variables formula leads to an explicit computation of the stringy invariant of the quotient variety .	We study the McKay correspondence for representations of the cyclic group of order $ p $ in characteristic $ p $ .	The main tool is the motivic integration generalized to quotient stacks associated to representations .	A consequence is that a crepant resolution of the quotient variety ( if any ) has topological Euler characteristic $ p $ like in the tame case .	Also , we link a crepant resolution with a count of Artin-Schreier extensions of the power series field with respect to weights determined by ramification jumps and the representation .
4	In particular , recent work ( Bahcall et al . )	Monochromatic opacities from the Opacity Project ( OP ) ( Seaton et al . )	have been augmented by hitherto missing inner-shell contributions ( Badnell & amp ; Seaton ) .	OP Rosseland-mean opacities are compared with results from OPAL ( Iglesias & amp ; Rogers ) for the elements H , He , C , O , S and Fe .	Overall , there is good agreement between OP and OPAL Rosseland-mean opacities for the 6-elements , but there are some differences .
2	By introducing an anharmonic perturbation , we observe a gradual transition to the Poisson statistics .	We consider the level statistics of two-dimensional harmonic oscillators with incommensurable frequencies , which are known to have picket-fence type spectra .	We propose a parametric representation for the level-spacing distribution and level-number variance , and study the variation of the parameters with the frequency ratio and the size of the spectra .	We describe the level spectra in transition from harmonic to Poissonian statistics as a superposition of two independent sequences , one for each of the two extreme statistics .	We show that this transition provides a suitable description for the evolution of the spectrum of a disordered chain with increasing long range correlations between the lattice sites .
0	Correlation between channel state and source symbol is under investigation for a joint source-channel coding problem .	We investigate simultaneously the lossless transmission of information and the empirical coordination of channel inputs with the symbols of source and states .	Empirical coordination is achievable if the sequences of source symbols , channel states , channel inputs and channel outputs are jointly typical for a target joint probability distribution .	We characterize the joint distributions that are achievable under lossless decoding constraint .	The performance of the coordination is evaluated by an objective function .
4	In combination with our interpretational context , this technical improvement circumvents valid criticisms that earlier derivations of the Born rule have provoked , especially to the effect that such derivations were mathematically flawed as well as circular .	We clarify the role of the Born rule in the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics by deriving it from Bohr 's doctrine of classical concepts , translated into the following mathematical statement : a quantum system described by a noncommutative C*-algebra of observables is empirically accessible only through associated commutative C*-algebras .	The Born probabilities emerge as the relative frequencies of outcomes in long runs of measurements on a quantum system ; it is not necessary to adopt the frequency interpretation of single-case probabilities ( which will be the subject of a sequel paper ) .	Our derivation of the Born rule uses ideas from a program begun by Finkelstein ( 1965 ) and Hartle ( 1968 ) , intending to remove the Born rule as a separate postulate of quantum mechanics .	Mathematically speaking , our approach refines previous elaborations of this program - notably the one due to Farhi , Goldstone , and Gutmann ( 1989 ) as completed by Van Wesep ( 2006 ) - in replacing infinite tensor products of Hilbert spaces by continuous fields of C*-algebras .
2	However , there is an inherent degree of vagueness present in huge real life data .	Mixed Integer Optimization has been a topic of active research in past decades .	It has been used to solve Statistical problems of classification and regression involving massive data .	This impreciseness is handled by Fuzzy Sets .	In this Paper , Fuzzy Mixed Integer Optimization Method ( FMIOM ) is used to find solution to Regression problem .
2	We first generalize the method of Christensen and Fulling to charged black holes to derive fluxes of energy and charge .	This is an extended version of the previous paper ( hep-th/0701272 ) .	Quantum fields near horizons can be described in terms of an infinite set of two-dimensional conformal fields .	These fluxes can be obtained by employing a conformal field theory technique .	We then apply this technique to obtain the fluxes of higher-spin currents and show that the thermal distribution of Hawking radiation from a charged black hole can be completely reproduced by investigating transformation properties of the higher-spin currents under conformal and gauge transformations .
0	We analyze the qualitative features in the transition spectra of a model superconductor with multiple energy gaps , using a simple extension of the Mattis-Bardeen expression for probes with case I and case II coherence factors .	At temperature T = 0 , the far infrared absorption edge is , as expected , determined by the smallest gap .	However , the large thermal background may mask this edge at finite temperatures and instead the secondary absorption edges found at Delta_i+Delta_j may become most prominent .	At finite T , if certain interband matrix elements are large , there may also be absorption peaks at the gap difference frequencies | Delta_i-Delta_j | .	We discuss the effect of sample quality on the measured spectra and the possible relation of these predictions to the recent infrared absorption measurement on MgB_2 .
4	However , as the matrix dimension increases the associated computational complexity makes its use prohibitive .	In this paper , we consider the problem of recovering an unknown sparse matrix X from the matrix sketch Y = AX B^T .	The dimension of Y is less than that of X , and A and B are known matrices .	This problem can be solved using standard compressive sensing ( CS ) theory after converting it to vector form using the Kronecker operation .	In this case , the measurement matrix assumes a Kronecker product structure .
1	] , we highlight condition ( T ) as a source of new examples of 'ballistic ' diffusions in a random environment when d & gt ; 1 ( 'ballistic ' means that a strong law of large numbers with non-vanishing limiting velocity holds ) .	With the help of the methods developed in our previous article [ Schmitz , to appear in `` Annales de l'I.H.P.Prob. & amp ; Stat .	In particular we are able to treat the case of non-constant diffusion coefficients , a feature that causes problems .	Further we recover the ballistic character of two important classes of diffusions in a random environment by simply checking condition ( T ) .	This not only points out to the broad range of examples where condition ( T ) can be checked , but also fortifies our belief that condition ( T ) is a natural contender for the characterisation of ballistic diffusions in a random environment when d & gt ; 1 .
0	The classical Kepler problem , as well as its quantum mechanical version , the Hydrogen atom , enjoy a well-known hidden symmetry , the conservation of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector , which makes these problems superintegrable .	Is there a relativistic quantum field theory extension that preserves this symmetry ?	In this Letter we show that the answer is positive : in the non-relativistic limit , we identify the dual conformal symmetry of planar $ \mathcal { N } =4 $ super Yang-Mills with the well-known symmetries of the Hydrogen atom .	We point out that the dual conformal symmetry offers a novel way to compute the spectrum of bound states of massive $ W $ bosons in the theory .	We perform nontrivial tests of this setup at weak and strong coupling , and comment on the possible extension to arbitrary values of the coupling .
3	Our aim is to determine the origin of this unique object by accurately determining its distance , metallicity , and age .	BH176 is an old metal-rich star cluster .	It is spatially and kinematically consistent with belonging to the Monoceros Ring .	It is larger in size and more distant from the Galactic plane than typical open clusters , and it does not belong to the Galactic bulge .	The best way to reach this goal is to combine spectroscopic and photometric methods .
2	Here we describe the technical details of our computations , and present the next step in a systematic development of the simulation code .	We recently have presented first physical predictions of a spatially hybrid model that follows the evolution of a negative streamer discharge in full three spatial dimensions ; our spatially hybrid model couples a particle model in the high field region ahead of the streamer with a fluid model in the streamer interior where electron densities are high and fields are low .	Therefore the model is computationally efficient , while it also follows the dynamics of single electrons including their possible run-away .	First , new sets of transport coefficients and reaction rates are obtained from particle swarm simulations in air , nitrogen , oxygen and argon .	These coefficients are implemented in an extended fluid model to make the fluid approximation as consistent as possible with the particle model , and to avoid discontinuities at the interface between fluid and particle regions .
2	133 ( 1998 ) , 1-41 ] for understanding the ( self-dual ) bispectral property of the rational solutions of the KP hierarchy .	We show that the trigonometric solitons of the KP hierarchy enjoy a differential-difference bispectral property , which becomes transparent when translated on two suitable spaces of pairs of matrices satisfying certain rank one conditions .	The result can be seen as a non-self-dual illustration of Wilson 's fundamental idea [ Invent.Math .	It also gives a bispectral interpretation of a ( dynamical ) duality between the hyperbolic Calogero-Moser system and the rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider system , which was first observed by Ruijsenaars [ Comm.Math.Phys .	115 ( 1988 ) , 127-165 ] .
1	Conventional Lagrangian approaches convert the lone rate constraint to a linear rate penalty scaled by a multiplier in the objective , resulting in a simpler unconstrained formulation .	In a typical video rate allocation problem , the objective is to optimally distribute a source rate budget among a set of ( in ) dependently coded data units to minimize the total distortion of all units .	However , the search for the `` optimal '' multiplier , one that results in a distortion-minimizing solution among all Lagrangian solutions that satisfy the original rate constraint , remains an elusive open problem in the general setting .	To address this problem , we propose a computation-efficient search strategy to identify this optimal multiplier numerically .	Specifically , we first formulate a general rate allocation problem where each data unit can be dependently coded at different quantization parameters ( QP ) using a previous unit as predictor , or left uncoded at the encoder and subsequently interpolated at the decoder using neighboring coded units .
3	This enables design of coded caching-and-delivery schemes that equip APs with storage , and place content in them in a way that creates coded-multicast opportunities for combining with macro-cell broadcast to satisfy users even with different demands .	To address the exponentially rising demand for wireless content , use of caching is emerging as a potential solution .	It has been recently established that joint design of content delivery and storage ( coded caching ) can significantly improve performance over conventional caching .	Coded caching is well suited to emerging heterogeneous wireless architectures which consist of a dense deployment of local-coverage wireless access points ( APs ) with high data rates , along with sparsely-distributed , large-coverage macro-cell base stations ( BS ) .	Such coded-caching schemes have been shown to be order-optimal with respect to the BS transmission rate , for a system with single-level content , i.e. , one where all content is uniformly popular .
2	Recently , Roukema ( 2010b ) proves that there does exist a timing-offset-induced error corresponding to about -25.6ms in the WMAP calibrated TOD by studying the fluctuation variance per pixel in the temperature map recovered from the TOD as a function of assumed timing-offset .	The Doppler dipole signal dominates the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) anisotropy maps obtained by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) mission , and plays a key role throughout the data processing .	Previously , we discovered a timing asynchronism of -25.6ms between the timestamps of the spacecraft attitude and radiometer output in the original raw WMAP time-ordered data ( TOD ) , which , if not corrected in following data processing , would generate an artificial quadrupole component ( l=2 ) in recovered CMB maps ( Liu , Xiong & amp ; Li 2010 ) .	Here , we find evidence directly in the WMAP TOD for such an uncorrected timing error , possibly occurred in calculating the Doppler dipole signal during the WMAP team 's TOD data processing .	The amplitude is highly significant and is consistent with previous work .
4	To calculate the likelihood score we need to compare actual forecasts or occurrences of predicted events with the null hypothesis that the mechanism 's 3-D orientation is random .	In our paper published earlier we discussed forecasts of earthquake focal mechanism and ways to test the forecast efficiency .	Several verification methods were proposed , but they were based on ad-hoc , empirical assumptions , thus their performance is questionable .	In this work we apply a conventional likelihood method to measure a skill of forecast .	The advantage of such an approach is that earthquake rate prediction can in principle be adequately combined with focal mechanism forecast , if both are based on the likelihood scores , resulting in a general forecast optimization .
3	Our simulations show that cluster sizes , bound mass fraction and velocity profile are strongly influenced by the details of the gas expulsion .	We have carried out a large set of N-body simulations studying the effect of residual-gas expulsion on the survival rate and final properties of star clusters .	We have varied the star formation efficiency , gas expulsion timescale and strength of the external tidal field , obtaining a three-dimensional grid of models which can be used to predict the evolution of individual star clusters or whole star cluster systems by interpolating between our runs .	The complete data of these simulations is made available on the Internet .	Although star clusters can survive star formation efficiencies as low as 10 % if the tidal field is weak and the gas is removed only slowly , our simulations indicate that most star clusters are destroyed or suffer dramatic loss of stars during the gas removal phase .
3	Here we find that the corresponding spontaneous symmetry breaking lowers the symmetry of such a state from $ SO ( 3 ) \times SO ( 3 ) \times U ( 1 ) $ for $ N_a^2\gg 1 $ large but finite to $ [ U ( 2 ) \times U ( 1 ) ] /Z_2^2 \equiv [ SO ( 3 ) \times U ( 1 ) \times U ( 1 ) ] /Z_2 $ for $ N_a^2\rightarrow\infty $ .	In this paper we consider the simplified form that a recently introduced general operator description of the Hubbard model on the square lattice with $ N_a^2\gg 1 $ sites , effective transfer integral $ t $ , and onsite repulsion $ U $ has in a suitable one- and two-electron subspace .	Such an operator description is that consistent with the model exact global symmetry recently extended to $ SO ( 3 ) \times SO ( 3 ) \times U ( 1 ) $ .	There is a large consensus that in the thermodynamic limit $ N_a^2\rightarrow\infty $ long-range antiferromagnetic order occurs in the spin-density $ m=0 $ ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model on the square lattice .	Moreover , we argue that the spin effective lattice being identical to the original lattice is a necessary condition for the occurrence of ground-state long-range antiferromagnetic order in the limit $ N_a^2\rightarrow\infty $ .
0	Two -- kaon production in proton -- deuteron collisions has been studied at three energies close to threshold using a calibrated magnetic spectrograph to measure the final $ ^3 $ He and a vertex detector to measure the $ K^+K^- $ pair .	Differential and total cross sections are presented for the production of $ \phi $ -- mesons , decaying through $ \phi\to K^+K^- $ , as well as for prompt $ K^+K^- $ production .	The prompt production seems to follow phase space in both its differential distributions and in its energy dependence .	The amplitude for the $ pd\to ^3 $ { He } $ \phi $ reaction varies little for excess energies below 22 MeV and the value is consistent with that obtained from a threshold measurement .	The angular distribution of the $ K^+K^- $ decay pair shows that near threshold the $ \phi $ -- mesons are dominantly produced with polarization $ m=0 $ along the initial proton direction .
1	Charged particles with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.7 are reconstructed using the ATLAS pixel detector .	The centrality dependence of the mean charged-particle multiplicity as a function of pseudorapidity is measured in approximately 1 $ \mu $ b $ ^ { -1 } $ of proton -- lead collisions at a nucleon -- nucleon centre-of-mass energy of $ \sqrt { s_ { _ { \rm { NN } } } } = 5.02 $ TeV using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider .	The $ p $ +Pb collision centrality is characterised by the total transverse energy measured in the Pb-going direction of the forward calorimeter .	The charged-particle pseudorapidity distributions are found to vary strongly with centrality , with an increasing asymmetry between the proton-going and Pb-going directions as the collisions become more central .	Three different estimations of the number of nucleons participating in the $ p $ +Pb collision have been carried out using the Glauber model as well as two Glauber -- Gribov inspired extensions to the Glauber model .
1	We investigate the mechanism responsible for the formation of plateaux in the resistivity/conductivity as a function of the applied magnetic field in the lowest Landau level regime .	We analyze the role of impurities in the fractional quantum Hall effect using a highly controllable system of ultracold atoms .	To this aim , we consider an impurity immersed in a small cloud of an ultracold quantum Bose gas subjected to an artificial magnetic field .	We consider scenarios corresponding to experimentally realistic systems with gauge fields induced either by rotation or by appropriately designed laser fields .	Systems of this kind are adequate to simulate quantum Hall effects in ultracold atom setups .
1	We provide sufficient conditions for this to be the case .	We study the following question : Given a locally compact group when does its Fourier algebra coincide with the subalgebra of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra consisting of functions vanishing at infinity ?	As an application we show that when P is the minimal parabolic subgroup in one of the classical simple Lie groups of real rank one or the exceptional such group , then the Fourier algebra of P coincides with the subalgebra of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra of P consisting of functions vanishing at infinity .	In particular , the regular representation of P decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations although P is not compact .	We also show that P contains a non-compact closed normal subgroup with the relative Howe-Moore property .
4	Only the functions phi ( r ) and a ( r ) are determined analytically , while the functions f ( r ) and V ( phi ( r ) ) are expressed semi-analytically , by integral formulas in terms of a ( r ) .	We construct asymptotically AdS black hole solutions , with a self-interacting bulk scalar field , in the context of 5D general relativity .	As the observable universe is characterized by spatial flatness , we focus to solutions where the horizon of the black hole , and subsequently all 3D hypersurfaces for fixed radial coordinate , have zero spatial curvature .	We examine two cases for the black hole scalar hair : a ) an exponential decaying scalar field profile and b ) an inverse power scalar field profile .	The scalar black hole solutions we present in this paper , are characterized by four functions f ( r ) , a ( r ) , phi ( r ) and V ( phi ( r ) ) .
1	This procedure allows to link the fundamental theory with its cosmological implementation .	We give a prescription to define in Loop Quantum Gravity the electric field operator related to the scale factor of an homogeneous and isotropic cosmological space-time .	In view of the conjugate relation existing between holonomies and fluxes , the edge length and the area of surfaces in the fiducial metric satisfy a duality condition .	As a consequence , the area operator has a discrete spectrum also in Loop Quantum Cosmology .	This feature makes the super-Hamiltonian regularization an open issue of the whole formulation .
0	We present a systematic comparison of heavy neutrino production modes , including , for the first time , the gluon fusion ( GF ) process $ gg\rightarrow N\overset { ( - ) } { \nu_\ell } $ .	Our treatment features a finite top quark mass , Higgs and $ Z $ interference , and matching with up to $ { 1 } $ jet .	We also present at next-to-leading order ( NLO ) in QCD precision both the vector boson fusion ( VBF ) $ W\gamma\rightarrow N\ell^\pm $ and $ N\ell^\pm+nj $ processes .	Our simplified and efficient treatment of both channels is safe from collinear and soft divergences that have plagued recent studies .	We obtain fully differential results using a fully automated Monte Carlo tool chain linking FeynRules , NLOCT , and MadGraph5\_aMC @ NLO .
2	The elementary-particle and cosmological scenarios for these particles are briefly outlined .	We study the decays of ultraheavy ( m_X \geq 10^ { 13 } GeV ) and quasistable ( lifetime \tau_X much larger than the age of the Universe t_0 ) particles as the source of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays ( UHE CR ) .	These particles are assumed to constitute a tiny fraction \xi_X of CDM in the Universe , with \xi_X being the same in the halo of our Galaxy and in the intergalactic space .	The UHE CR fluxes produced at the decays of X- particles are calculated .	The dominant contribution is given by fluxes of photons and nucleons from the halo of our Galaxy and thus they do not exibit the GZK cutoff .
4	However , the number of fragments produced by classical algorithms is difficult to control .	With the multiplication of XML data sources , many XML data warehouse models have been proposed to handle data heterogeneity and complexity in a way relational data warehouses fail to achieve .	However , XML-native database systems currently suffer from limited performances , both in terms of manageable data volume and response time .	Fragmentation helps address both these issues .	Derived horizontal fragmentation is typically used in relational data warehouses and can definitely be adapted to the XML context .
0	Canonical quantization of electromagnetic field is traditionally done using plane waves .	It is possible to formulate the quantization using other complete set of basis functions .	Wavelets are a special kind of functions which are localized in real as well as in Fourier space .	In this paper we show how wavelets can be used as basis functions in canonical quantization .	A countable set of mode functions are obtained .
4	The energetics of SMBH accretion disk models and the electromagnetic energy transfer imply that a SMBH should generate a $ 10^ { 18 } - 10^ { 19 } $ Amp\`eres current close to the black hole and its accretion disk .	A non-negligible fraction of a Supermassive Black Hole 's ( SMBH ) rest mass energy gets transported into extragalactic space by a remarkable process in jets which are incompletely understood .	What are the physical processes which transport this energy ?	It is likely that the energy flows electromagnetically , rather than via a particle beam flux .	The deduced electromagnetic fields may produce particles of energy as high as $ \sim 10^ { 20 } $ eV .
4	The computation rules of D ( or its appropriate subalgebra D ' ) guarantee that in many applications S can be refinely analyzed or even explicitly calculated .	The paper considers pseudo-differential boundary value control systems .	The underlying operators form an algebra D with the help of which we are able to formulate typical boundary value control problems .	The symbolic calculus gives tools to form e.g.compositions , formal adjoints , generalized right or left inverses and compatibility conditions .	By a parametrizability we mean that for a given control system Au=0 one finds an operator S such that Au=0 if and only if u=Sf .
0	For the first time , we show that unipolar fatigue does occur in antiferroelectric capacitors , confirming the predictions of a previous work [ Appl.Phys .	Lett. , 94 , 072901 ( 2009 ) ] .	We also show that unipolar fatigue in antiferroelectrics is less severe than bipolar fatigue if the driving field is of the same magnitude .	This phenomenon has been attributed to the switching-induced charge injection , the main cause for polarization fatigue in ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials .	Other evidences for polarization fatigue caused by the switching-induced charge injection from the nearby electrode rather than the charge injection during stable/quasi-stable leakage current stage are also discussed .
4	We now give a definition of unitary easy quantum groups using colored partitions to tackle the problem of finding quantum subgroups of $ U_n^+ $ .	Easy quantum groups have been studied intensively since the time they were introduced by Banica and Speicher in 2009 .	They arise as a subclass of ( $ C^* $ -algebraic ) compact matrix quantum groups in the sense of Woronowicz .	Due to some Tannaka-Krein type result , they are completely determined by the combinatorics of categories of ( set theoretical ) partitions .	So far , only orthogonal easy quantum groups have been considered in order to understand quantum subgroups of the free orthogonal quantum group $ O_n^+ $ .
3	Our results reveal that , when the time split is optimized , the full-duplex relaying could substantially boost the system throughput compared to the conventional half-duplex relaying architecture for all three transmission modes .	We consider a dual-hop full-duplex relaying system , where the energy constrained relay node is powered by radio frequency signals from the source using the time-switching architecture , both the amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying protocols are studied .	Specifically , we provide an analytical characterization of the achievable throughput of three different communication modes , namely , instantaneous transmission , delay-constrained transmission , and delay tolerant transmission .	In addition , the optimal time split is studied for different transmission modes .	In addition , it is shown that the instantaneous transmission mode attains the highest throughput .
1	The main results of this paper are : ( a ) if $ d \equiv \epsilon $ ( mod 2 ) then $ S^ { 1 , d - 1 } ( \epsilon ) $ has a unique minimal triangulation using $ 2d + 3 $ vertices , and ( b ) if $ d \equiv 1 - \epsilon $ ( mod 2 ) then $ S^ { 1 , d - 1 } ( \epsilon ) $ has minimal triangulations ( not unique ) using $ 2d + 4 $ vertices .	For integers $ d \geq 2 $ and $ \epsilon = 0 $ or 1 , let $ S^ { 1 , d - 1 } ( \epsilon ) $ denote the sphere product $ S^ { 1 } \times S^ { d - 1 } $ if $ \epsilon = 0 $ and the twisted $ S^ { d - 1 } $ bundle over $ S^ { 1 } $ if $ \epsilon = 1 $ .	The second result confirms a recent conjecture of Lutz .	The first result provides the first known infinite family of closed manifolds ( other than spheres ) for which the minimal triangulation is unique .	Actually , we show that while $ S^ { 1 , d - 1 } ( \epsilon ) $ has at most one $ ( 2d + 3 ) $ -vertex triangulation ( one if $ d \equiv \epsilon $ ( mod 2 ) , zero otherwise ) , in sharp contrast , the number of non-isomorphic $ ( 2d + 4 ) $ -vertex triangulations of these $ d $ -manifolds grows exponentially with $ d $ for either choice of $ \epsilon $ .
0	We introduce the spin-charge separation mechanism to the quark-lepton unification models which consider the lepton number as the fourth color .	In certain finite-density systems , quarks and leptons are decomposed into spinons and chargons , which carry the spin and charge degrees of freedom respectively .	Neutrinos can be related to the spinons with respect to the electric-charge and spin separation in the early universe or other circumstances .	Some effective , probably universal couplings between the spinon sector and the chargon sector are derived and a phenomenological description for the chargon condensate is proposed .	It is then demonstrated that the spinon current can induce vorticity in the chargon condensate , and spinon zero modes are trapped in the vortices , forming spinon-vortex bound states .
4	Our results show that a simple effective singlet extension of the SM achieves phenomenological viability with a minimal number of free parameters .	We scrutinise the evidences recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for compatible 750 GeV resonances which appear in the di-photon channels of the two experiments in both the 8 TeV and 13 TeV datasets .	Similar resonances in di-boson , di-lepton , di-jet and $ t\bar t $ final states are instead not detected .	After discussing the properties and the compatibility of the reported signals , we study the implications on the physics beyond the Standard Model with particular emphasis on possible scalar extensions of the theory such as singlet extensions and the two Higgs doublet models .	We also analyse the significance of the new experimental indications within the frameworks of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and of technicolour models .
2	We find that halos with the lowest concentrations are presently more clustered than those of higher concentration , the size of the effect increasing with halo mass ; this agrees with trends found in studies of lower mass halos .	The clustering properties of dark matter halos are a firm prediction of modern theories of structure formation .	We use two large volume , high-resolution N-body simulations to study how the correlation function of massive dark matter halos depends upon their mass and formation history .	The clustering dependence on other characterizations of the full mass accretion history appears weaker than the effect with concentration .	Using the integrated correlation function , marked correlation functions , and a power-law fit to the correlation function , we find evidence that halos which have recently undergone a major merger or a large mass gain have slightly enhanced clustering relative to a randomly chosen population with the same mass distribution .
0	Five-dimensional non-extreme rotating black holes with large NS-NS five-brane and fundamental string charge are shown to be described by a conformal sigma model , which is a marginal integrable deformation of six-dimensional SL ( 2 , R ) x SU ( 2 ) WZW model .	The two WZW levels are equal to the five-brane charge , while the parameters of the two marginal deformations generated by the left and right chiral SU ( 2 ) currents are proportional to the two angular momentum components of the black hole .	The near-horizon description is effectively in terms of a free fundamental string whose tension is rescaled by the five-brane charge .	The microstates are identified with those of left and right moving superconformal string oscillations in the four directions transverse to the five-brane .	Their statistical entropy reproduces precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the rotating black hole .
0	Solitary stars that wander too close to their galactic centres can become tidally disrupted , if the tidal forces due to the supermassive black hole ( SMBH ) residing there overcome the self-gravity of the star .	If the star is only partially disrupted , so that a fraction survives as a self-bound object , this remaining core will experience a net gain in specific orbital energy , which translates into a velocity `` kick '' of up to $ \sim 10^3 $ km/s .	In this paper , we present the result of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( SPH ) simulations of such partial disruptions , and analyse the velocity kick imparted on the surviving core .	We compare $ \gamma $ = 5/3 and $ \gamma $ = 4/3 polytropes disrupted in both a Newtonian potential , and a generalized potential that reproduces most relativistic effects around a Schwarzschild black hole either exactly or to excellent precision .	For the Newtonian case , we confirm the results of previous studies that the kick velocity of the surviving core is virtually independent of the ratio of the black hole to stellar mass , and is a function of the impact parameter $ \beta $ alone , reaching at most the escape velocity of the original star .
0	We demonstrate that an undoped two-dimensional carbon plane ( graphene ) whose bulk is in the integer quantum Hall regime supports a non-chiral Luttinger liquid at an armchair edge .	This behavior arises due to the unusual dispersion of the non-interacting edges states , causing a crossing of bands with different valley and spin indices at the edge .	We demonstrate that this stabilizes a domain wall structure with a spontaneously ordered phase degree of freedom .	This coherent domain wall supports gapless charged excitations , and has a power law tunneling $ I-V $ with a non-integral exponent .	In proximity to a bulk lead , the edge may undergo a quantum phase transition between the Luttinger liquid phase and a metallic state when the edge confinement is sufficiently strong relative to the interaction energy scale .
1	We also re-examine the assumptions underlying such experiments .	We have examined the atomic theory behind recent constraints on the violation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle derived from experiments that look for x rays emitted from conductors while a large current is present .	We use the results of these studies to assess pilot measurements to develop an improved test of the Principle .	We present an improved limit of $ ( 1/2 ) \beta^2 & lt ; 2.6\times10^ { -39 } $ on the Pauli Exclusion Principle .	This limit is the best to date for interactions between a system of fermions and a fermion that has not previously interacted with that given system .
4	The trade off between S/N and spectral resolution in measuring stellar magnetic fields justify an attempt , here presented , to perform these measurements at the 4.5 m William Herschel Telescope .	Despite the influence of magnetic fields on the structure and evolution of stars is largely demonstrated from the theoretical point of view , their observational evidence in non-degenerated stars is still rather scanty and mainly circumscribed to bright objects ( V & lt ; 10 ) .	Stellar magnetic fields are commonly measured on the basis of circular spectropolarimetry at high/middle resolution across the profile of metal lines .	The present sensitivity of telescopes and spectrographs makes this still an almost prohibitive method for faint stars .	In principle , stellar magnetic fields can be also measured on the basis of low resolution spectropolarimetry , with very important results obtained at the 8 m ESO telescopes with FORS1 .
0	The Gross-Pitaevskii ( GP ) equation is a long-wavelength approach widely used to describe the dilute Bose-Einstein condensates ( BEC ) .	However , in many physical situations , such as higher densities , this approximation unlikely suffices hence one might need models which would account for long-range correlations and multi-body interactions .	We show that the Bose liquid described by the logarithmic wave equation has a number of drastic differences from the GP one .	It possesses the self-sustainability property : while the free GP condensate tends to spill all over the available volume the logarithmic one tends to form a Gaussian-type droplet - even in the absence of an external trapping potential .	The quasi-particle modes of the logarithmic BEC are shown to acquire a finite size despite the bare particles being assumed point-like , i.e. , the spatial extent emerges here as a result of quantum many-body correlations .
4	The agreement indicates that this method can be used for treatment plan in heavy ion radiotherapy .	Carbon ion is the mostly common used particle in heavy ion radiotherapy .	In this paper , carbon ion dose in tumor treatment for human eye was simulated with FLUKA code , 80 MeV/u carbon beam was irradiated into the human eye from two directions , The first is from the lateral-forward direction which was a typical therapeutic condition , maximum dose was deposited in the tumor volume .	The second one was that beam irradiated into eyes from the forward direction which may cause certain medical accident .	The calculated results are compared with other reports .
2	We therefore consider alternative star formation histories in which RSGs contain intermediate-aged stars even at late epochs .	We present population synthesis models designed to represent the star formation histories of L* red sequence galaxies ( RSGs ) .	Earlier work has shown that single-burst stellar populations ( SSPs ) are unable to match Balmer line strengths simultaneously at high and low redshift .	The models are compared to Balmer Hdelta absorption strengths , U-B color data , and the number density of red sequence galaxies from z=1 to z=0 .	We find that quenched models ( which consist of constant star formation histories truncated at regularly-spaced intervals ) average to an RSG population that matches the data well , showing slow evolution in color and Balmer line strength and a rise in number density by a factor of a few after z=1 .
4	On the basis of the results achieved through simulations on the communication system capabilities , we propose a simple but effective receiver scheme , and we outline the future research directions .	In this paper we propose a solution for transmitting digital information within the cardiocirculatory system .	In particular , we make use of a channel delivering burst of molecules , emitted by mobile transmitters , which diffuse in the blood towards fixed receivers , that are attached to the vessel walls .	This communication scheme has been inspired by the real signaling between platelets and endothelial cells , the behavior of which has been investigated experimentally .	We thus believe that our proposal can be successfully deployed in living bodies .
3	Once the entire shower has been tabulated , the resulting list of particles is concatenated and divided into separate list files where each possesses a similar projected computation time .	A simple method for the parallelization of extensive air shower simulations is described .	A shower is simulated at fixed steps in altitude .	At each step , daughter particles below a specified energy threshold are siphoned off and tabulated for further simulation .	These lists are then placed on a computation cluster where the simulation can be completed in a piecemeal fashion as computing resources become available .
4	A phenomenological model containing both cyclotron damping and turbulent cascade is constructed to explain the suppression of proton heating at low alpha-proton differential flow speeds .	Protons in the solar corona and heliosphere exhibit anisotropic velocity distributions , violation of magnetic moment conservation , and a general lack of thermal equilibrium with the other particle species .	There is no agreement about the identity of the physical processes that energize non-Maxwellian protons in the solar wind , but a traditional favorite has been the dissipation of ion cyclotron resonant Alfven waves .	This paper presents kinetic models of how ion cyclotron waves heat protons on their journey from the corona to interplanetary space .	It also derives a wide range of new solutions for the relevant dispersion relations , marginal stability boundaries , and nonresonant velocity-space diffusion rates .
4	For parallel ( anti-parallel ) magnetization to anti-parallel ( parallel ) magnetization switching process , the spin transfer torque tends to decrease ( increase ) the error rate when the $ { \tau } _ { pulse } $ is shorter than the half precession period , and increase ( decrease ) the error rate when $ { \tau } _ { pulse } $ is longer than the half-period .	We report theoretical investigation of the switching probability of electric field-induced precessional magnetization switching by solving the Fokker-Planck equation numerically with finite difference method .	The switching probability is determined by the net magnetic field induced by the deviation of precession angle from its equilibrium position after precession process .	The error rate has the lowest value under an appropriate applied external field for the voltage pulse duration $ { \tau } _ { pulse } $ a little longer than the half precession period .	The calculated results show that ultra-low error rate down to the order of $ 10^ { -12 } $ can be achieved for thermal stability factor { \Delta } = 50 and low damping factor material should be used for free layer to improve the switching probability .
1	Coordinated resource allocation is the key to efficient performance , but the demand on backhaul signaling and computational resources grows rapidly with number of cells , terminals , and subcarriers .	The throughput of multicell systems is inherently limited by interference and the available communication resources .	To handle this , we propose a novel multicell framework with dynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small set of base stations .	Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring terminals only , thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework scalable .	This framework can describe anything from interference channels to ideal joint multicell transmission .
3	Energy gaps , including confinement , may be easily and accurately estimated using band energies and a simple effective mass approximation , yielding excellent agreement with experimental results .	We have calculated band-edge energies for most combinations of zincblende AlN , GaN , InN , GaP , GaAs , InP , InAs , GaSb and InSb in which one material is strained to the other .	Calculations were done for three different geometries , quantum wells , wires , and dots , and mean effective masses were computed in order to estimate confinement energies .	For quantum wells , we have also calculated band-edges for ternary alloys .	By calculating all material combinations we have identified novel and interesting material combinations , such as artificial donors , that have not been experimentally realized .
4	Communication consumes the large portion of WSN energy .	Wireless sensor network consists of large number of tiny sensor nodes which are usually deployed in a harsh environment .	Self configuration and infrastructure less are the two fundamental properties of sensor networks .	Sensor nodes are highly energy constrained devices because they are battery operated devices and due to harsh environment deployment it is impossible to change or recharge their battery .	Energy conservation and prolonging the network life are two major challenges in a sensor network .
0	We perform a stability test of triaxial models in MOdified Newtonian Dynamics ( MOND ) using N-body simulations .	The triaxial models considered here have densities that vary with $ r^ { -1 } $ in the center and $ r^ { -4 } $ at large radii .	The total mass of the model varies from $ 10^8\Msun $ to $ 10^ { 10 } \Msun $ , representing the mass scale of dwarfs to medium-mass elliptical galaxies , respectively , from deep MOND to quasi-Newtonian gravity .	We build triaxial galaxy models using the Schwarzschild technique , and evolve the systems for 200 Keplerian dynamical times ( at the typical length scale of 1.0 kpc ) .	We find that the systems are virial overheating , and in quasi-equilibrium with the relaxation taking approximately 5 Keplerian dynamical times ( 1.0 kpc ) .
1	These properties can be interpreted as due to the physical processes involved in the formation of these structures .	Self-gravitating systems such as elliptical galaxies appear to have a constant specific entropy and obey a scaling law relating their potential energy to their mass .	Dark matter haloes obtained through numerical simulations have also been found to obey a scaling law relating their potential energy to their mass with the same slope as ellipticals .	Since the X-ray gas in clusters is weakly dissipative , we have checked the hypothesis that it might verify similar properties .	We have analyzed ROSAT-PSPC images of 24 clusters , and also found that : 1 ) the S\'ersic law parameters ( intensity , shape and scale ) describing the X-ray gas emission are correlated two by two ; 2 ) the hot gas in all these clusters roughly has the same specific entropy ; 3 ) a scaling law linking the cluster potential energy to the mass of the X-ray gas is observed , with the same slope as for elliptical galaxies and dark matter haloes .
1	Environments poor in heavy elements and dust such as the SMC are thought to be dominated by photodissociation regions .	We report the first detection of [ CI ] ( 3P1-3P0 ) emission at 609 um in a region of the Small Magellanic Cloud ( N27 ) .	This is the lowest metallicity source where submillimeter neutral carbon emission has been detected .	Studying the [ CI ] /CO intensity ratio in several sources spanning more than an order of magnitude in metallicity , Z , we find that the [ CI ] /CO ratio increases for decreasing Z .	The existence of such a trend points to a photodissociation origin for most of neutral carbon in molecular clouds , in agreement with standard PDR models .
3	Transferring the quantum correlations from the light to atoms in order to generate correlated atom beams is another interesting prospect .	We have built a compact light source for bright squeezed twin-beams at 795\ , nm based on four-wave-mixing in atomic $ ^ { 85 } $ Rb vapor .	With a total optical power of 400\ , mW derived from a free running diode laser and a tapered amplifier to pump the four-wave-mixing process , we achieve 2.1\ , dB intensity difference squeezing of the twin beams below the standard quantum limit , without accounting for losses .	Squeezed twin beams generated by the type of source presented here could be used as reference for the precise calibration of photodetectors .	In this work we investigate the dispersion that is generated by the employed four-wave-mixing process with respect to bandwidth and dependence on probe detuning .
4	Seyfert 1 's and Seyfert 2 's are indistinguishable longward of 100 micron , while , as already seen by IRAS , the former have flatter SEDs shortward of 60 micron .	New far-infrared photometry with ISOPHOT , onboard the Infrared Space Observatory , is presented for 58 galaxies with homogeneous published data for another 32 galaxies all belonging to the 12 micron galaxy sample .	In total 29 Seyfert 1 's , 35 Seyfert 2 's and 12 starburst galaxies , about half of the 12 micron active galaxy sample , plus 14 normal galaxies for comparison .	The ISO and the IRAS data are used to define color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions ( SED ) .	Thermal dust emission at two temperatures ( one cold at 15-30K and one warm at 50-70K ) can fit the 60-200 micron SED , with a dust emissivity law proportional to the inverse square of the wavelength .
4	Only a very small fraction of this ionised gas , however , is detected in UV absorption lines with ionisation potentials up to ~200eV ( i.e.SiIV , CIV , NV , OVI ) , which leaves us to postulate that the X-ray excess is due to ultra-highly-ionised , dense gas in the GRB vicinity .	There is considerable discrepancy between the amount of X-ray absorption and that inferred from optical ( rest frame UV ) as measured along gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) sight lines , with the former being typically an order of magnitude higher than what would be expected from the measurement of neutral element species via optical absorption line spectroscopy .	We explore this `` missing gas problem '' by using X-ray and optical measurements in a sample of 29 z=0.7-6.3 GRBs from both spectroscopic data and the afterglow broadband spectral energy distributions .	The low ionisation species detected in the UV are associated with the neutral interstellar medium in the GRB host galaxy , while soft X-ray absorption , which is weakly dependent on the ionisation state of the gas , provides a probe of the total column of gas along the sight line .	After careful consideration of any systematic effects , we find that the neutral gas consists of less than ~10 % of the total gas , and this limit decreases with the more ionised that the X-ray absorbing gas is , which in our spectral fits is assumed to be neutral .
2	Micromotion is minimized by applying static electric offset fields such that both loss and heating are minimized .	We report on a new sensitive method to minimize excess micromotion of an ion in a Paul trap .	The ion is placed in an ultracold cloud of neutral Rb atoms in which ionic micromotion induces atomic losses and heating .	We achieve a compensation precision as high as the best compensation methods to date .	In contrast to these methods , our scheme is applicable even for ions that can not be optically probed .
2	Our central result is a formula for the generating function for the Eulerian quasisymmetric functions , which specializes to a new and surprising $ q $ -analog of a classical formula for the exponential generating function of the Eulerian polynomials .	We introduce a family of quasisymmetric functions called { \em Eulerian quasisymmetric functions } , which have the property of specializing to enumerators for the joint distribution of the permutation statistics , major index and excedance number on permutations of fixed cycle type .	This family is analogous to a family of quasisymmetric functions that Gessel and Reutenauer used to study the joint distribution of major index and descent number on permutations of fixed cycle type .	This $ q $ -analog computes the joint distribution of excedance number and major index , the only of the four important Euler-Mahonian distributions that had not yet been computed .	Our study of the Eulerian quasisymmetric functions also yields results that include the descent statistic and refine results of Gessel and Reutenauer .
4	Should this be the case , there are important implications for supernovae , ultra-high-energy cosmic rays , double beta decay , and dark matter .	A neutrino mass-mixing scheme which explains qualitatively all present evidence for neutrino mass ( the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits , LSND , and hot dark matter ) , and also makes possible heavy-element nucleosynthesis by supernovae , requires at least one light sterile neutrino .	String-inspired models with sub-millimeter extra dimensions provide naturally light sterile neutrinos , as is needed to explain the solar nu_e deficit .	This bulk sterile neutrino provides a better fit to the solar data than conventional models by having vacuum oscillations of the nu_e to its zero mode and MSW oscillations to its first few Kaluza-Klein modes .	While the prediction of the Super-Kamiokande energy spectrum gives a fit probability of 73 % , the superior energy resolution of SNO 's charged-current spectrum will determine whether this neutrino scheme is correct and can demonstrate that an extra dimension of ~60 mu m exists .
1	The node is equipped with a finite energy buffer .	We consider an AWGN channel with a transmitter powered by an energy harvesting source .	Such a system can be modelled as a channel with side information ( about energy in the energy buffer ) causally known at the transmitter .	The receiver may or may not have the side information .	We prove that Markov energy management policies are sufficient to achieve the capacity of the system and provide a single letter characterization for the capacity .
2	We propose to resolve certain ambiguities by clarifying the geometrical picture of gauge transformations on the kappa-Minkowski space-time in the twist approach .	Kappa-Minkowski space-time is an example of noncommutative space-time with potentially interesting phenomenology .	However , the construction of field theories on this space is plagued with ambiguities .	We construct the action for the noncommutative U ( 1 ) gauge fields in a geometric way , as an integral of a maximal form .	The effective action with the first order corrections in the deformation parameter is obtained using the Seiberg-Witten map to relate noncommutative and commutative degrees of freedom .
3	We show that this theory possesses a controlled effective expansion within dimensional regularisation , that is , for any process there are a finite number of Feynman diagrams which will contribute to a given order of accuracy .	The possibility that Lorentz symmetry is violated in gravitational processes is relatively unconstrained by experiment , in stark contrast with the level of accuracy to which Lorentz symmetry has been confirmed in the matter sector .	One model of Lorentz violation in the gravitational sector is Einstein-aether theory , in which Lorentz symmetry is broken by giving a vacuum expectation value to a dynamical vector field .	In this paper we analyse the effective theory for quantised gravitational and aether perturbations .	We find that there is no log-running of the two-derivative phenomenological parameters , justifying the use of experimental constraints for these parameters obtained over many orders of magnitude in energy scale .
2	The algorithm maintains a good balance between photo-realism and photo abstraction , and hence is applicable to applications with artistic concerns or applications where less information loss is crucial .	Vectorization of images is a key concern uniting computer graphics and computer vision communities .	In this paper we are presenting a novel idea for efficient , customizable vectorization of raster images , based on Catmull Rom spline fitting .	The resulting algorithm is fast , parallelizable and can satisfy general soft realtime requirements .	Moreover , the smoothness of the vectorized images aesthetically outperforms outputs of many polygon-based methods
4	Dephasing due to the electron-electron interaction is dependent on the electron density .	Studies of weak localization by scattering from vapor atoms for electrons on a liquid helium surface are reported .	There are three contributions to the dephasing time .	Dephasing by the motion of vapor atoms perpendicular to the surface is studied by varying the holding field to change the characteristic width of the electron layer at the surface .	A change in vapor density alters the quasi-elastic scattering length and the dephasing due to the motion of atoms both perpendicular and parallel to the surface .
4	We illustrate these difficulties for a useful reproducible test case , the two-dimensional one-particle cell model with specially smooth forces .	Time-reversible symplectic methods , which are precisely compatible with Liouville 's phase-volume-conservation theorem , are often recommended for computational simulations of Hamiltonian mechanics .	Lack of energy drift is an apparent advantage of such methods .	But all numerical methods are susceptible to Lyapunov instability , which severely limits the maximum time for which chaotic solutions can be `` accurate '' .	The `` advantages '' of higher-order methods are lost rapidly for typical chaotic Hamiltonians .
4	This issue has been dealt with , to some extent , for illiquid markets by assuming a continuous process , mainly based on the Brownian motion .	One of the shortcomings of the Black and Scholes model on option pricing is the assumption that trading of the underlying asset does not affect the price of that asset .	This assumption can be fulfilled only in perfectly liquid markets .	Since most markets are illquid , this assumption might be too restrictive .	Thus , taking into account the price impact in option pricing is an important issue .
0	In models where there is a global chiral symmetry which spontaneously breaks to its vectorial subgroup , the introduction of an explicit symmetry breaking perturbation will define the true vacuum of the theory .	This true vacuum is found via the minimization of the expectation value of the perturbing hamiltonian between different vacua as prescribed by Dashen .	The procedure of finding the correct vacuum of the theory may result in the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry even if one initially demands CP invariance on the perturbation .	In this work we study in detail models where the perturbation is provided by four-Fermi operators .	We present exact treatment for models with two fermion flavors and study the three flavor case in depth numerically .
2	We compare the performance of this protocol for various values of $ d $ .	We generalize an already proposed protocol for quantum state transfer to spin chains of arbitrary spin .	An arbitrary unknown $ d- $ level state is transferred through a chain with rather good fidelity by the natural dynamics of the chain .	A by-product of our study is a much simpler method for picking up the state at the destination as compared with the one proposed previously .	We also discuss entanglement distribution through such chains and show that the quality of entanglement transition increases with the number of levels $ d $ .
2	Since LIGO 's sensitivity to binary neutron stars is limited to the local Universe , the area on the sky that must be searched could be reduced by weighting positions by mass , luminosity , or star formation in nearby galaxies .	Advanced LIGO discovered gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger in September 2015 and may soon observe signals from neutron-star mergers .	There is considerable interest in searching for their faint and rapidly fading electromagnetic counterparts , though gravitational wave position uncertainties are as coarse as hundreds of square degrees .	Since gravitational-wave observations provide information about luminosity distance , combining the reconstructed volume with positions and redshifts of galaxies could reduce the area even more dramatically .	A key missing ingredient has been a rapid gravitational-wave parameter estimation algorithm that reconstructs the full distribution of sky location and distance .
2	After excluding active galactic nuclei , peculiar systems , and background contamination , only 15 non-peculiar E and E/S0 galaxies from the RSA catalog are detected above the 98 % confidence level , about 12 % of the sample .	Studies of cold material through IRAS 60um and 100um observations indicated that half of ordinary E and E/S0 galaxies were detected above the 3 sigma level , indicating that cold gas is common , although no correlation was found between the optical and far- infrared fluxes .	Most detections were near the instrumental threshold , and given an improved understanding of detection confidence , we reconsider the 60um and 100um detection rate .	An unusually high percentage of these 15 galaxies possess cold gas ( HI , CO ) and optical emission lines ( Halpha ) , supporting the presence of gas cooler than 10E4 K. The 60um to 100um flux ratios imply a median dust temperature for the sample of 30 K , with a range of 23-38 K. These detections define the upper envelope of the optical to far-infrared relationship , F_fir propto F_B^0.24+/-0.08 , showing that optically bright objects are also brighter in the infrared , although with considerable dispersion .	A luminosity correlation is present with L_fir propto L_B^1.65+/-0.28 , but the dust temperature is uncorrelated with luminosity .
3	We show that the collapse of any two classes in $ \ { \ACZm , \TCZ , \NCOne , \L , \NL\ } $ implies the collapse of their relativizations .	Existing definitions of the relativizations of \NCOne , \L\ and \NL\ do not preserve the inclusions $ \NCOne \subseteq \L $ , $ \NL\subseteq \ACOne $ .	We start by giving the first definitions that preserve them .	Here for \L\ and \NL\ we define their relativizations using Wilson 's stack oracle model , but limit the height of the stack to a constant ( instead of $ \log ( n ) $ ) .	Next we exhibit an oracle $ \alpha $ that makes $ \ACk ( \alpha ) $ a proper hierarchy .
3	The iron content is [ Fe/H ] =-0.40\pm0.01 dex ( sigma=0.03 dex ) for NGC 2136 and -0.39\pm0.01 dex ( sigma=0.01 dex ) for NGC 2137 , while the [ alpha/Fe ] ratios are roughly solar in both clusters .	We have used a sample of high-resolution spectra obtained with the multi-fiber facility FLAMES at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory , to derive the kinematical and chemical properties of the two young Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters NGC 2136 and NGC 2137 .	These two clusters represent a typical example of LMC cluster pair suspected to be bound in a binary system : indeed the cluster centers of gravity have an angular separation of less than 1.4 arcmin in the sky .	The spectral analysis of seven giants in NGC 2136 and four in NGC 2137 reveals that the two clusters share very similar systemic radial velocities , namely Vrad=271.5\pm0.4 km/s ( sigma=1.0 km/s ) and Vrad=270.6\pm0.5 km/s ( sigma=0.9 km/s ) for NGC 2136 and NGC 2137 , respectively , and they have also indistinguishable abundance patterns .	These findings suggest that the two clusters are gravitationally bound and that they formed from the fragmentation of the same molecular cloud that was chemically homogeneous .
3	As known , quantum mechanics can establish that particle can also become wave ; it shows that electron can be in duality .	Today , people are looking forward to get an awesome computational power .	This kind of desire can be answered by quantum computing .	By adopting quantum mechanics theory , it can generate a very fast computation result .	Through this theory , even a human teleportation is issued can be really happened in the future .
4	Furthermore , we analyze the high-level features learnt by CNN through visualization of its hidden layers , and some interesting phenomena were observed .	This paper proposes a deep leaning method to address the challenging facial attractiveness prediction problem .	The method constructs a convolutional neural network of facial beauty prediction using a new deep cascaded fine-turning scheme with various face inputting channels , such as the original RGB face image , the detail layer image , and the lighting layer image .	With a carefully designed CNN model of deep structure , large input size and small convolutional kernels , we have achieved a high prediction correlation of 0.88 .	This result convinces us that the problem of facial attractiveness prediction can be solved by deep learning approach , and it also shows the important roles of the facial smoothness , lightness , and color information that were involved in facial beauty perception , which is consistent with the result of recent psychology studies .
2	We find that for low mass discs that cool fast enough to fragment , prograde discs are significantly shorter-lived than similar discs orbiting retrograde with respect to the binary .	We present the results of high-resolution numerical simulations of gas clouds falling onto binary supermassive black holes to form circumbinary accretion discs , with both prograde and retrograde cloud orbits .	We explore a range of clouds masses and cooling rates .	For fragmenting discs of all masses , we also find that prograde discs fragment across a narrower radial region .	If the cooling is slow enough that the disc enters a self-regulating gravitoturbulent regime , we find that alignment between the disc and binary planes occurs on a timescale primarily dictated by the disc thickness .
1	Let $ G $ be a finite group , $ P $ a Sylow $ p $ -subgroup of $ G $ and $ N_G ( P ) $ its normalizer in $ G $ .	Let $ X $ be a smooth projective connected curve of genus $ g\ge 2 $ defined over an algebraically closed field $ k $ of characteristic $ p & gt ; 0 $ .	We show that if there exists an \'etale Galois cover $ Y\to X $ with group $ N_G ( P ) $ , then $ G $ is the Galois group wan \'etale Galois cover $ \mathcal { Y } \to\mathcal { X } $ , where the genus of $ \mathcal { X } $ depends on the order of $ G $ , the number of Sylow $ p $ -subgroups of $ G $ and $ g $ .	Suppose that $ G $ is an extension of a group $ H $ of order prime to $ p $ by a $ p $ -group $ P $ and $ X $ is defined over a finite field $ \mathbb { F } _q $ large enough to contain the $ |H| $ -th roots of unity .	We show that integral idempotent relations in the group ring $ \mathbb { C } [ H ] $ imply similar relations among the corresponding generalized Hasse-Witt invariants .
1	In a previous work , we found that the 2009 and 2012 versions of the unfiltered English data set as well as the 2009 version of the English Fiction data set are all heavily saturated with scientific and medical literature , rendering them unsuitable for rigorous analysis [ Pechenick , Danforth and Dodds , PLoS ONE , 10 , e0137041 , 2015 ] .	The Google Books corpus , derived from millions of books in a range of major languages , would seem to offer many possibilities for research into cultural , social , and linguistic evolution .	By contrast , the 2012 version of English Fiction appeared to be uncompromised , and we use this data set to explore language dynamics for English from 1820 -- 2000 .	We critique an earlier method for measuring birth and death rates of words , and provide a robust , principled approach to examining the volume of word flux across various relative frequency usage thresholds .	We use the contributions to the Jensen-Shannon divergence of words crossing thresholds between consecutive decades to illuminate the major driving factors behind the flux .
0	We study some natural connections on spaces of conformal field theories using an analytical regularization method .	The connections are based on marginal conformal field theory deformations .	We show that the analytical regularization preserves conformal invariance and leads to integrability of the marginal deformations .	The connections are shown to be flat and to generate well-defined finite parallel transport .	These finite parallel transports yield formulations of the deformed theories in the state space of an undeformed theory .
4	The resulting , more accurate theory predicts the total number of fitness function evaluations to reach the global optimum as a function of mutation rate , population size , and the parameters specifying the fitness function .	Epochal dynamics , in which long periods of stasis in an evolving population are punctuated by a sudden burst of change , is a common behavior in both natural and artificial evolutionary processes .	We analyze the population dynamics for a class of fitness functions that exhibit epochal behavior using a mathematical framework developed recently .	In the latter the approximations employed led to a population-size independent theory that allowed us to determine optimal mutation rates .	Here we extend this approach to include the destabilization of epochs due to finite-population fluctuations and show that this dynamical behavior often occurs around the optimal parameter settings for efficient search .
1	In particular , the small-scale dynamo is expected to exponentially amplify any weak magnetic field in the presence of turbulence .	While present standard model of cosmology yields no clear prediction for the initial magnetic field strength , efficient dynamo action may compensate for initially weak seed fields via rapid amplification .	We explore whether this scenario is viable using cosmological magneto-hydrodynamics simulations modeling the formation of the first galaxies , which are expected to form in so-called atomic cooling halos with virial temperatures $ \rm T_ { vir } \geq 10^ { 4 } $ K. As previous calculations have shown that a high Jeans resolution is needed to resolve turbulent structures and dynamo effects , our calculations employ resolutions of up to 128 cells per Jeans length .	The presence of the dynamo can be clearly confirmed for resolutions of at least 64 cells per Jeans length , while saturation occurs at approximate equipartition with turbulent energy .	As a result of the large Reynolds numbers in primordial galaxies , we expect saturation to occur at early stages , implying magnetic field strengths of \sim0.1 $ \mu $ G at densities of 10^4 cm^ { -3 } .
3	We show that the optical depth of the Sun to WIMPs and the gravitational forces from planets both serve to decrease the annihilation rate below these estimates .	We calculate the annihilation rate of weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) in the Sun as a function of their mass and elastic scattering cross section .	One byproduct of the annihilation , muon neutrinos , may be observed by the next generation of neutrino telescopes .	Previous estimates of the annihilation rate assumed that any WIMPs from the Galactic dark halo that are captured in the Sun by elastic scattering off solar nuclei quickly reach thermal equilibrium in the Sun .	While we find that the sensitivity of upcoming km^3-scale neutrino telescopes to ~100 GeV WIMPs is virtually unchanged from previous estimates , the sensitivity of these experiments to ~10 TeV WIMPs may be an order of magnitude less than the standard calculations would suggest .
4	This suggests that a few 1e30 erg/s might be a limiting luminosity value for quiescent black holes .	The Galactic black hole X-ray binary XTE J1650-500 entered a quiescent regime following the decline from the 2001-2002 outburst that led to its discovery .	Here we report on the first detection of its quiescent counterpart in a 36 ks observation taken in 2007 July with the Chandra X-ray Observatory .	The inferred 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed flux is in the range 2.5-5.0x1e-15 erg/s/cm^2 .	Notwithstanding large distance uncertainties , the measured luminosity is comparable to that of the faintest detected black hole X-ray binaries , all having orbital periods close to the expected bifurcation period between j- and n-driven low-mass X-ray binaries .
4	Odd-even effect is observed due to the symmetry of the chain .	Electronic quantum entanglement between the central chain and the two electrodes in an infinite one-dimensional two-probe device system is studied .	The entanglement entropy is calculated employing the nonequilibrium Green 's function method in the tight-binding model based on the relation between the correlation matrix and the von Neumann entropy .	By extending the entropy to nonequilibrium cases , we have studied the scaling behavior when a voltage bias is applied between the two electrodes .	The entropy usually decreases with the bias and may jump up when a quasi-state in the chain aligns in energy with the band edges in the electrodes .
1	The results are presented for jets with transverse energy E_T^jet & gt ; 6 GeV and pseudorapidity |eta^jet| & lt ; 2.4 , in the kinematic region given by the virtuality of the photon Q^2 & lt ; 1 GeV^2 and the inelasticity 0.2 & lt ; y & lt ; 0.85 and in two mass regions defined as 25 & lt ; M_nj & lt ; 50 GeV and M_nj & gt ; 50 GeV , where M_nj is the invariant mass of the n-jet system .	Three- and four-jet final states have been measured in photoproduction at HERA using the ZEUS detector with an integrated luminosity of 121 pb^-1 .	The four-jet photoproduction cross section has been measured for the first time and represents the highest-order process studied at HERA .	Both the three- and four-jet cross sections have been compared with leading-logarithmic parton-shower Monte Carlo models , with and without multi-parton interactions .	The three-jet cross sections have been compared to an order ( alpha alpha_s^2 ) perturbative QCD calculation .
3	We clarify the approximations in the still widely-used zero mass variable flavor scheme ( ZM VFNS ) , mention the inherent flaws in its conventional implementation , and consider the possibility of mending some of these flaws .	We critically review heavy quark mass effects in DIS and their impact on global analyses .	We lay out all elements of a properly defined general mass variable flavor number scheme ( GM VFNS ) that are shared by all modern formulations of the problem .	We then explain the freedom in choosing specific implementations and spell out , in particular , the current formulations of the CTEQ and MSTW groups .	We discuss practical issues concerning the use of parton distributions in various physical applications , in view of the different schemes .
1	We show that unlike previously studied binaries , this is an intrinsic topological insulator with conduction bulk band residing well above the chemical potential .	We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study non-trivial surface state in psuedobinary Bi2Se0.6Te2.3 topological insulator .	Our data indicates that under good vacuum condition there are no significant aging effects for more then two weeks after cleaving .	We also demonstrate that shift of the Kramers point at low temperature is caused by UV assisted absorption of molecular hydrogen .	Our findings pave the way for applications of these materials in devices and present an easy scheme to tune their properties .
1	We find an excess in the yield of J/ $ \psi $ with respect to expectations from hadronic production .	We report on the measurement of J/ $ \psi $ production at very low transverse momentum ( $ p_ { \rm T } & lt ; $ 300 MeV/ $ c $ ) in Pb -- Pb collisions performed with the ALICE detector at the LHC .	Coherent photo-production of J/ $ \psi $ is proposed as a plausible origin of this excess .	We show the nuclear modification factor of very low- $ p_ { \rm T } $ J/ $ \psi $ as a function of centrality .	Then we measure the J/ $ \psi $ coherent photoproduction cross section in peripheral events assuming that it is the mechanism at the origin of the measured excess .
3	The argument adapts the two-scale approach of Grunewald , Villani , Westdickenberg and the second author from the quadratic to the general case .	We consider a noninteracting unbounded spin system with conservation of the mean spin .	We derive a uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequality ( LSI ) provided the single-site potential is a bounded perturbation of a strictly convex function .	The scaling of the LSI constant is optimal in the system size .	Using an asymmetric Brascamp-Lieb-type inequality for covariances , we reduce the task of deriving a uniform LSI to the convexification of the coarse-grained Hamiltonian , which follows from a general local Cram\ ' { e } r theorem .
4	MAXIMA data are used to discriminate between cosmological models and to determine cosmological parameters ; results are presented from the 1998 flight .	This document describes the Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array ( MAXIMA ) , a balloon-borne experiment measuring the temperature anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) on angular scales of 10 arcminutes to 5 degrees .	MAXIMA maps the CMB using 16 bolometric detectors observing in spectral bands centered at 150 GHz , 230 GHz , and 410 GHz , with 10 arcminute resolution at all frequencies .	The combined receiver sensitivity to CMB anisotropy is 40 micro-K* ( sec^0.5 ) .	During two flights with a total of 8.5 hours of CMB observations , 300 square degrees of the sky were mapped .
3	We present a new algorithm that performs these calculations as matrix operations .	Weak lensing ( WL ) clustering is studied using 2D ( angular ) coordinates , while redshift space distortions ( RSD ) and baryon acoustic oscillations ( BAO ) use 3D coordinates , which requires a model dependent conversion of angles and redshifts into comoving distances .	This is the first paper of a series , which explore modelling multi-tracer galaxy clustering ( of WL , BAO and RSD ) , using only angular ( 2D ) cross-correlations in thin redshift bins .	This involves evaluating many thousands cross-correlations , each a multidimensional integral , which is computationally demanding .	Nearby narrow redshift bins are intrinsically correlated , which can be used to recover the full ( radial ) 3D information .
0	We present a new application of affine Lie algebras to massive quantum field theory in 2 dimensions , by investigating the $ q\to 1 $ limit of the q-deformed affine $ \hat { sl ( 2 ) } $ symmetry of the sine-Gordon theory , this limit occuring at the free fermion point .	We describe how radial quantization leads to a quasi-chiral factorization of the space of fields .	The conserved charges which generate the affine Lie algebra split into two independent affine algebras on this factorized space , each with level 1 in the anti-periodic sector .	The space of fields in the anti-periodic sector can be organized using level- $ 1 $ highest weight representations , if one supplements the $ \slh $ algebra with the usual local integrals of motion .	Using the integrals of motion , a momentum space bosonization involving vertex operators is formulated .
1	The resulting coupled differential equations are studied in detail and exemplary RG trajectories are constructed numerically .	The functional renormalization group equation for projectable Ho\v { r } ava-Lifshitz gravity is used to derive the non-perturbative beta functions for the Newton 's constant , cosmological constant and anisotropy parameter .	The beta functions possess a non-Gaussian fixed point and a one-parameter family of Gaussian fixed points .	One of the Gaussian fixed points corresponds to the Einstein-Hilbert action with vanishing cosmological constant and constitutes a saddle point with one IR-attractive direction .	For RG trajectories dragged into this fixed point at low energies diffeomorphism invariance is restored .
3	The measured response and recovery times of the graphene humidity sensors are on the order of several hundred milliseconds .	We demonstrate humidity sensing using a change of electrical resistance of a single- layer chemical vapor deposited ( CVD ) graphene that is placed on top of a SiO2 layer on a Si wafer .	To investigate the selectivity of the sensor towards the most common constituents in air , its signal response was characterized individually for water vapor ( H2O ) , nitrogen ( N2 ) , oxygen ( O2 ) , and argon ( Ar ) .	In order to assess the humidity sensing effect for a range from 1 % relative humidity ( RH ) to 96 % RH , devices were characterized both in a vacuum chamber and in a humidity chamber at atmospheric pressure .	Density functional theory simulations are employed to further investigate the sensitivity of the graphene devices towards water vapor .
4	In so doing , the results substantially depend upon the spin of the particle .	Exact solutions of the Schrodinger and Dirac equations in generalized cylindrical coordinates of the 3-dimensional space of positive constant curvature , spherical model , have been obtained .	It is shown that all basis Schrodinger 's and Dirac 's wave functions are finite , single-valued , and continuous everywhere in spherical space model S_ { 3 } .	The used coordinates ( \rho , \phi , z ) are simply referred to Eiler 's angle variables ( \alpha , \beta , \gamma ) , parameters on the unitary group SU ( 2 ) , which permits to express the constructed wave solutions \Psi ( \rho , phi , z ) in terms of Wigner 's functions $ D_ { mm ' } ^ { j } ( \alpha , \beta , \gamma ) $ .	Specification of the analysis to the case of elliptic , SO ( 3.R ) group space , model has been done .
4	For the air highway placement problem , we use the flexible and efficient fast marching method to solve the Eikonal equation , which produces a sequence of air highways that minimizes the cost of flying from an origin to any destination .	Recently , there has been immense interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) for civilian operations such as package delivery , aerial surveillance , and disaster response .	As a result , UAV traffic management systems are needed to support potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the air space , in order to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met .	Currently , the analysis of large multi-agent systems can not tractably provide these guarantees if the agents ' set of maneuvers are unrestricted .	In this paper , we propose to have platoons of UAVs flying on air highways in order to impose the air space structure that allows for tractable analysis and intuitive monitoring .
4	Next , we focus on the related problem of cardinality-constrained actuator placement for minimum control effort , where the optimal actuator set is selected so that an average input energy metric is minimized .	We address the problem of minimal actuator placement in a linear system subject to an average control energy bound .	First , following the recent work of Olshevsky , we prove that this is NP-hard .	Then , we provide an efficient algorithm which , for a given range of problem parameters , approximates up to a multiplicative factor of O ( logn ) , n being the network size , any optimal actuator set that meets the same energy criteria ; this is the best approximation factor one can achieve in polynomial time , in the worst case .	Moreover , the algorithm uses a perturbed version of the involved control energy metric , which we prove to be supermodular .
3	Magnetic coupling of disk and star leads to rotational braking at the surface of the star .	Stars of spectral classes A and late B are almost entirely radiative .	CP stars are a slowly rotating subgroup of these stars .	It is possible that they possessed long-lived accretion disks in their T Tauri phase .	Microscopic viscosities are extremely small and will not be able to reduce the rotation rate of the core of the star .
1	We find all the spectra well fitted by Comptonization of disc blackbody photons , with very strong evidence for the presence of a nonthermal electron component in the Comptonizing plasma .	We present an exhaustive analysis of five broad-band observations of GRS 1915+105 in two variability states , chi and omega , observed simultaneously by the PCA , HEXTE and OSSE .	Both the energy and the power spectra in the chi state are typical to the very high/intermediate state of black-hole binaries .	The spectrum of the omega state is characterized by a strong blackbody component Comptonized by thermal electrons and a weak nonthermal tail .	We then calculate rms spectra ( fractional variability as functions of energy ) for the PCA data .
2	Broadening of the local e-h transition is also correlated with the inhomogeneity of the NP .	We have used scanning gate microscopy to explore the local conductivity of a current-annealed graphene flake .	A map of the local neutrality point ( NP ) after annealing at low current density exhibits micron-sized inhomogeneities .	Annealing at higher current density reduces the NP inhomogeneity , but we still observe some asymmetry in the e-h conduction .	We attribute this to a hole doped domain close to one of the metal contacts combined with underlying striations in the local NP .
3	The slowest growing modes correspond to predominantly horizontal motions and the fast growing ones to isotropic motions , ( iii ) the physical interpretation of the stability properties in this asymptotic regime is simple .	The linear stability of a shear layer in a highly diffusive stably stratified atmosphere has been investigated .	This study completes and extends previous works by Dudis ( 1974 ) and Jones ( 1977 ) .	We show that : ( i ) an asymptotic regime is reached in the limit of large thermal diffusivity , ( ii ) there exists two different types of unstable modes .	Applications to the dynamics of stellar radiative zone are discussed .
4	To the best of our knowledge this is the first work providing for the automatic verification of program equivalence for ccp	Saraswat 's concurrent constraint programming ( ccp ) is a mature formalism for modeling processes ( or programs ) that interact by telling and asking constraints in a global medium , called the store .	Bisimilarity is a standard behavioural equivalence in concurrency theory , but a well-behaved notion of bisimilarity for ccp has been proposed only recently .	When the state space of a system is finite , the ordinary notion of bisimilarity can be computed via the well-known partition refinement algorithm , but unfortunately , this algorithm does not work for ccp bisimilarity .	In this paper , we propose a variation of the partition refinement algorithm for verifying ccp bisimilarity .
2	Number density arguments rule out a pure radius evolution .	We examine the radius-luminosity ( R-L ) relation for blue galaxies in the Team Keck Redshift Survey ( TKRS ) of GOODS-N. We compare with a volume-limited , Sloan Digital Sky Survey sample and find that the R-L relation has evolved to lower surface brightness since z=1 .	Based on the detection limits of GOODS this can not be explained by incompleteness in low surface-brightness galaxies .	It can be explained by a radius dependent decline in B-band luminosity with time .	Assuming a linear shift in M_B with z , we use a maximum likelihood method to quantify the evolution .
2	We illustrate this strategy on a ground wind speed forecast for several months in 2012 for a region near the Great Lakes in the United States .	We propose a statistical space-time model for predicting atmospheric wind speed based on deterministic numerical weather predictions and historical measurements .	We consider a Gaussian multivariate space-time framework that combines multiple sources of past physical model outputs and measurements along with model predictions in order to produce a probabilistic wind speed forecast within the prediction window .	The results show that the prediction is improved in the mean-squared sense relative to the numerical forecasts as well as in probabilistic scores .	Moreover , the samples are shown to produce realistic wind scenarios based on the sample spectrum .
0	It is well known that contextual and multi-scale representations are important for accurate visual recognition .	In this paper we present the Inside-Outside Net ( ION ) , an object detector that exploits information both inside and outside the region of interest .	Contextual information outside the region of interest is integrated using spatial recurrent neural networks .	Inside , we use skip pooling to extract information at multiple scales and levels of abstraction .	Through extensive experiments we evaluate the design space and provide readers with an overview of what tricks of the trade are important .
4	One goal is the generation of a data structure called Concurrent Program Graph ( CPG ) which describes all possible interleavings and incorporates synchronization while preserving completeness .	The verification of multithreaded software is still a challenge .	This comes mainly from the fact that the number of thread interleavings grows exponentially in the number of threads .	The idea that thread interleavings can be studied with a matrix calculus is a novel approach in this research area .	Our sparse matrix representations of the program are manipulated using a lazy implementation of Kronecker algebra .
0	As energy markets begin clearing at sub-hourly rates , their interaction with load control systems becomes a potentially important consideration .	A simple model for the control of thermal systems using market-based power distribution strategies is proposed , with particular attention to the behavior and dynamics of electric building loads and distribution-level power markets .	Observations of dynamic behavior of simple numerical model are compared to that of an aggregate continuous model .	The analytic solution of the continuous model suggests important deficiencies in each .	The continuous model provides very valuable insights into how one might design such load control system and design the power markets they interact with .
1	During two seasons of 2013-2015 we carried out a spectroscopic and photometric ( BVR ) monitoring of the star .	The wind interaction with the dusty environment of the classical T Tauri star RY Tau has been investigated .	A correlation between the stellar brightness and the radial velocity of the wind determined from the H-alpha and Na D line profiles has been found for the first time .	The irregular stellar brightness variations are shown to be caused by extinction in a dusty disk wind at a distance of about 0.2 AU from the star .	We suppose , that variations of the circumstellar extinction results from cyclic rearrangements of the stellar magnetosphere and coronal mass ejections , which affect the dusty disk wind near the inner boundary of the circumstellar disk .
3	& amp ; Hook f. ) were subjected to five wet-dry cycles and their moisture content and dimensional changes in radial and tangential direction at three increasing levels of relative humidity ( 57.6 , 84.2 and 90.2 % ) were measured before and after the treatment .	The reduction of wood response to variations of ambient humidity , described as kind of ageing , has been studied from both points of view of moisture uptake and dimensional changes .	Clearwood specimens from 3 gymnosperms ( Pinus sylvestris L. , Pinus pinaster Ait. , Pinus insignis Dougl . )	and 4 angiosperms ( Populus spp. , Quercus pyrenaica Willd. , Entandrophragma cylindricum Sprague , Chlorophora excelsa Benth .	For a given increase of relative humidity , a coefficient of hygroscopic ageing was defined as the relative decrease of moisture uptake , and the coefficient of dimensional ageing as the difference of swelling strain before and after ageing .
3	We discover that this new solution preserves twenty supercharges and that , in the light-cone gauge , string theory on this background is exactly solvable .	A certain conformally invariant N=1 supersymmetric SU ( n ) gauge theory has a description as an infra-red fixed point obtained by deforming the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by giving a mass to one of its N=1 chiral multiplets .	We study the Penrose limit of the supergravity dual of the large n limit of this N=1 gauge theory .	The limit gives a pp-wave with R-R five-form flux and both R-R and NS-NS three-form flux .	Correspondingly , this latter is the stringy dual of a particular large charge limit of the large n gauge theory .
1	For cool main-sequence stars , gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellar ages from measured rotation pe- riods and HR Diagram positions .	One of the most difficult properties to derive for stars is their age .	These relations have few calibrators with known ages for old , long rotation period stars .	There is a significant sample of old Kepler objects of inter- est , or KOIs , which have both measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismic measurements from which ages can be accurately derived .	In this work we determine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating KOIs to both compare the rotation properties of stars with and without known planets and enlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars .
2	From a statistical sample of cluster cD galaxies we selected those sources with little information available in the literature and promising for the detection of aged radio emission .	We present a radio morphological study and spectral analysis for a sample of 13 cD galaxies in rich and poor clusters of galaxies . }	Our study is based on new high sensitivity Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ( GMRT ) observations at 1.28 GHz , 610 MHz and 235 MHz , and on archival data .	Beyond the high sensitivity images for all 13 radio galaxies , we present also a detailed spectral analysis for 7 of them .	We found a variety of morphologies and linear sizes , as typical for radio galaxies in the radio power range sampled here ( low to intermediate power radio galaxies ) .
4	Wick-rotating back to Lorentzian signature , we obtain retarded and advanced CFT $ _ { 1 } $ two-point functions that are consistent with the known results .	This note is aimed at presenting a new algebraic approach to momentum-space correlators in conformal field theory .	As an illustration we present a new Lie-algebraic method to compute frequency-space two-point functions for charged scalar operators of CFT $ _ { 1 } $ dual to AdS $ _ { 2 } $ black hole with constant background electric field .	Our method is based on the real-time prescription of AdS/CFT correspondence , Euclideanization of AdS $ _ { 2 } $ black hole and projective unitary representations of the Lie algebra $ \mathfrak { sl } ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) \oplus \mathfrak { sl } ( 2 , \mathbb { R } ) $ .	We derive novel recurrence relations for Euclidean CFT $ _ { 1 } $ two-point functions , which are exactly solvable and completely determine the frequency- and charge-dependences of two-point functions .
0	The aim of this paper is to propose a rigorous and complete design framework for complex system based on system engineering ( SE ) principles .	The SE standard EIA-632 is used to guide the approach .	Within this framework , two aspects are presented .	The first one concerns the integration of safety requirements and management in system engineering process .	The objective is to help designers and engineers in managing safety of complex systems .
4	We explicitly carry out the procedure to third order in the deformation parameter .	We develop a calculable analytic approach to marginal deformations in open string field theory using wedge states with operator insertions .	For marginal operators with regular operator products , we construct analytic solutions to all orders in the deformation parameter .	In particular , we construct an exact time-dependent solution that describes D-brane decay and incorporates all alpha ' corrections .	For marginal operators with singular operator products , we construct solutions by regularizing the singularity and adding counterterms .
4	In the blue wing of He II , we find a large number of events with properties ( size and lifetime ) similar to the well-studied explosive events seen in the ultraviolet spectral range .	The Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer ( EIS ) on board Hinode is the first solar telescope to obtain wide slit spectral images that can be used for detecting Doppler flows in transition region and coronal lines on the Sun and to relate them to their surrounding small scale dynamics .	We select EIS lines covering the temperature range 6x10^4 K to 2x10^6 K that give spectrally pure images of the Sun with the 40 arcsec slit .	In these images Doppler shifts are seen as horizontal brightenings .	Inside the image it is difficult to distinguish shifts from horizontal structures but emission beyond the image edge can be unambiguously identified as a line shift in several lines separated from others on their blue or red side by more than the width of the spectrometer slit ( 40 pixels ) .
4	We apply these results to the study of foliated deformations of Hopf manifolds , a foliated analogue to the notion of deformation in the large .	In this article , we focus on a very special class of foliations with complex leaves whose diffeomorphism type is fixed .	They have a unique compact leaf and the noncompact leaves all accumulate onto it .	We show that the complex structure along the non-compact leaves is fixed by the complex structure of the compact leaf .	Reciprocally , we prove that the complex structure along a non-compact leaf determines the complex structure along the other leaves .
4	The ANP method is used to find the differentiate weights of available networks by considering each criterion and the TOPSIS method is applied to rank the alternatives .	Providing service continuity to the end users with best quality is a very important issue in the next generation wireless communications .	With the evolution of the mobile devices towards a multimode architecture and the coexistence of multitude of radio access technologies ( RAT 's ) , the users are able to benefit simultaneously from these RAT 's .	However , the major issue in heterogeneous wireless communications is how to choose the most suitable access network for mobile 's user which can be used as long as possible for communication .	To achieve this issue , this paper proposes an intelligent network selection strategy which combines two multi attribute decision making ( MADM ) methods such as analytic network process ( ANP ) and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution ( TOPSIS ) method .
4	Our theory predicts that each element of the local basis is constructed by using a combination of only $ \mathcal { O } ( ( \log N ) ^2 ) $ kernels , which makes the construction computationally cheap .	Approximation/interpolation from spaces of positive definite or conditionally positive definite kernels is an increasingly popular tool for the analysis and synthesis of scattered data , and is central to many meshless methods .	For a set of $ N $ scattered sites , the standard basis for such a space utilizes $ N $ \emph { globally } supported kernels ; computing with it is prohibitively expensive for large $ N $ .	Easily computable , well-localized bases , with `` small-footprint '' basis elements - i.e. , elements using only a small number of kernels -- have been unavailable .	Working on $ \sphere $ , with focus on the restricted surface spline kernels ( e.g.the thin-plate splines restricted to the sphere ) , we construct easily computable , spatially well-localized , small-footprint , robust bases for the associated kernel spaces .
4	We calculate the mean free path of these high energy neutrinos annihilating themselves with the relic neutrinos to produce vector and tensor unparticles .	We investigate the impact of unparticle physics on the annihilation of relic neutrinos with the neutrinos identified as primary source of ultra high energy ( UHE ) cosmic ray events , producing a cascade of photons and charged particles .	We compute the contribution of the unparticle exchange to the cross-sections $ \nu \bar\nu\to\gamma \gamma $ and $ \nu \bar\nu\to f \bar f $ scattering .	We estimate the neutrino photon decoupling temperature from the reaction rate of $ \nu \bar\nu\to\gamma \gamma $ .	We find that inclusion of unparticles can in fact account for the flux of UHE cosmic rays and can also result in the lowering of neutrino - photon decoupling temperature below the QCD phase transition for unparticle physics parameters in a certain range .
1	For that purpose , we establish a new approximation result for the computation of symbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to a given switched system .	In this paper , we consider the problem of synthesizing low-complexity controllers for incrementally stable switched systems .	The main advantage over existing results is that it allows us to design naturally quantized switching controllers for safety or reachability specifications ; these can be pre-computed offline and therefore the online execution time is reduced .	Then , we present a technique to reduce the memory needed to store the control law by borrowing ideas from algebraic decision diagrams for compact function representation and by exploiting the non-determinism of the synthesized controllers .	We show the merits of our approach by applying it to a simple model of temperature regulation in a building .
3	Analysing this light curve , we found the physical parameters of the components .	Taking into account results obtained from light-curve analysis and out-of-eclipse analyses , we discuss the nature of GSC 02038-00293 and also its magnetic activity behaviour .	We obtained light curves of the system during observing seasons 2007 , 2008 and 2011 .	We obtained its secondary minimum clearly in I-band observations in 2008 for the first time .	The light-curve analysis indicates that the possible mass ratio of the system is 0.35 .
2	For the first time an existence of high Q-factor trapped mode resonances are revealed in these structures .	Results of research of resonant phenomena in planar periodic structures consisted of dielectric elements are presented .	A problem of plane wave diffraction by a structure which a periodic cell is composed of two dielectric bars with different lengths has been solved .	The main difference of studied structure in contrast to the planar structure with a single dielectric bar in the unit cell is appearing of a great red shift of a trapped mode resonant wavelength .	The red shift is caused by strong coupling of electromagnetic fields in neighbor dielectric bar resonators .
1	We run 2.5D and 3D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the accretion of a fat disk .	In this paper we extend our previous works on spherically symmetric accretion onto black holes and super-spinars to the case in which the fluid has a finite angular momentum initially .	We study how the accretion process changes by changing the values of the parameters of our model .	We show that the value of the fluid angular momentum critically determines turn-on and off the production of powerful equatorial outflows around super-spinars .	For corotating disks , equatorial outflows are efficiently generated , even for relatively low spin parameters or relatively large super-spinar radii .
1	Apparently the more data the more questions how to process all the data in most efficient way .	Every year the PHENIX collaboration deals with increasing volume of data ( now about 1/4 PB/year ) .	In recent past many developments in HEP computing were dedicated to the production environment .	Now we need more tools to help to obtain physics results from the analysis of distributed simulated and experimental data .	Developments in Grid architectures gave many examples how distributed computing facilities can be organized to meet physics analysis needs .
3	This is in fact one of the reasons underlying the greater complexity of the models studied in this paper in comparison with both their rational and BC_N counterparts .	In this paper we study the su ( m ) spin Sutherland ( trigonometric ) model of D_N type and its related spin chain of Haldane-Shastry type obtained by means of Polychronakos 's freezing trick .	As in the rational case recently studied by the authors , we show that these are new models , whose properties can not be simply deduced from those of their well-known BC_N counterparts by taking a suitable limit .	We identify the Weyl-invariant extended configuration space of the spin dynamical model , which turns out to be the N-dimensional generalization of a rhombic dodecahedron .	By constructing a non-orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space of the spin dynamical model on which its Hamiltonian acts triangularly , we compute its spectrum in closed form .
2	For non negative potentials we derive an explicit solution in terms of the Lambert $ W $ -- function which is related to the exponential generating function $ T $ of rooted trees as $ T ( x ) =-W ( -x ) $ .	We construct majorant functions $ \Phi ( t , z ) $ for the Mayer series of pressure satisfying a nonlinear differential equation of first order which can be solved by the method of characteristics .	The domain $ | z| & lt ; ( e\tau ) ^ { -1 } $ of convergence of Mayer series is given by the envelop of characteristic intersections .	For stable potentials the solution is majorized by a non negative potential solution .	There are many choices in this case and we combine this freedom together with a Lagrange multiplier to examine the Yukawa gas in the region of collapse .
3	By artifically stretching and then degrading WFPC2 images to simulate ground based observing it is now possible to directly calibrate the effect of atmospheric seeing .	Measurement of the gravitational distortion of images of distant galaxies is rapidly becoming established as a powerful probe of the dark mass distribution in clusters of galaxies .	With the advent of large mosaics of CCD 's these methods should provide a composite total mass profile for galaxy haloes and also measure the power spectrum of mass fluctuations on supercluster scales .	We describe how HST observations have been used to place the observational measurement of the shear on a quantitative footing .	Similar experiments show that one can remove the effect of artificial image anisotropy arising in the atmosphere or telescope .
1	The monitor operates in the highly radioactive environment in proximity to the T2K target .	An Optical Transition Radiation monitor has been developed for the proton beam-line of the T2K long base-line neutrino oscillation experiment .	It uses optical transition radiation , the light emitted from a thin metallic foil when the charged beam passes through it , to form a 2D image of a 30 GeV proton beam .	One of its key features is an optical system capable of transporting the light over a large distance out of the harsh environment near the target to a lower radiation area where it is possible to operate a camera to capture this light .	The monitor measures the proton beam position and width with a precision of better than 500 { \mu } m , meeting the physics requirements of the T2K experiment .
2	We find that the photodetachment rate is unaffected by a weak terahertz field , but oscillates complicatedly when the terahertz pulse gets strong enough .	The standard closed-orbit theory is extended for the photodetachment of negative ions in a time-dependent electric field .	The time-dependent photodetachment rate is specifically studied in the presence of a single-cycle terahertz pulse , based on exact quantum simulations and semiclassical analysis .	Three types of closed classical orbits are identified for the photoelectron motion in a strong single-cycle terahertz pulse , and their connections with the oscillatory photodetachment rate are established quantitatively by generalizing the standard closed-orbit theory to a time-dependent form .	By comparing the negative hydrogen and fluorine ions , both the in-phase and antiphase oscillations can be observed , depending on a simple geometry of the contributed closed classical orbits .
0	This paper deals with sensors which compute and report linguistic assessments of their values.Such sensors , called symbolic sensors are a natural extension of smart ones when working with control systems which use artificial intelligence based technics .	After having recalled the smart sensor concepts , this paper introduces the symbolic sensor ones .	Links between the physical world and the symbolic one are described .	It is then shown how Zadeh 's approximate reasoning theory provides a smart way to implement symbolic sensors .	Finally , since the symbolic sensor is a general component , a functional adaptation to the measurement context is proposed .
3	These temperatures are of the order of microkelvins and are almost independent of the subsystem size .	We consider the adiabatic demagnetization in the rotating reference frame ( ADRF ) of a system of dipolar coupled nuclear spins $ s=1/2 $ in the external magnetic field .	The demagnetization starts with the offset of the external magnetic field ( in frequency units ) from the Larmor frequency being several times greater than the local dipolar field .	For different subsystem sizes , we have found from numerical simulations the temperatures at which subsystems of a one-dimensional nine-spin chain and a plane nine-spin cluster become entangled .	There is a weak dependence of the temperature on the space dimension of the system .
0	The collapse of thin dust shells in 2+1 dimensional gravity with and without a cosmological constant in analyzed .	A critical value of the shell 's mass as a function of its radius and position is derived .	For $ \Lambda & lt ; 0 $ , a naked singularity or black hole forms depending on whether the shell 's mass is below or just above this value .	The solution space is divided into four different regions by three critical surfaces .	For $ \Lambda & lt ; 0 $ , two surfaces separate regions of black hole solutions and solutions with naked singularities , while the other surface separates regions of open and closed spaces .
1	Nielsen and T. Osborne , Phys.Rev .	The Groverian entanglement measure introduced earlier for pure quantum states [ O. Biham , M.A .	A 65 , 062312 ( 2002 ) ] is generalized to the case of mixed states , in a way that maintains its operational interpretation .	The Groverian measure of a mixed state of n qubits is obtained by a purification procedure into a pure state of 2n qubits , followed by an optimization process based on Uhlmann 's theorem , before the resulting state is fed into Grover 's search algorithm .	The Groverian measure , expressed in terms of the maximal success probability of the algorithm , provides an operational measure of entanglement of both pure and mixed quantum states of multiple qubits .
4	These results enable implementation of distributed quantum networking .	We report on the coherent quantum state transfer from a two-level atomic system to a single photon .	Entanglement between a single photon ( signal ) and a two-component ensemble of cold rubidium atoms is used to project the quantum memory element ( the atomic ensemble ) onto any desired state by measuring the signal in a suitable basis .	The atomic qubit is read out by stimulating directional emission of a single photon ( idler ) from the ( entangled ) collective state of the ensemble .	Faithful atomic memory preparation and read-out are verified by the observed correlations between the signal and the idler photons .
1	Consider an electron density $ n_ { GS } ( { \bf r } ) $ given by a ground state .	Some theorems on derivatives of the Coulomb density functional with respect to the coupling constant $ \lambda $ are given .	A model Fermion system with the reduced coupling constant , $ \lambda & lt ; 1 $ , is defined to reproduce $ n_ { GS } ( { \bf r } ) $ and the ground state energy .	Fixing the charge density , possible phase transitions as level crossings detected in a value of the reduced density functional happen only at discrete points along the $ \lambda $ axis .	If the density is $ v $ -representable also for $ \lambda & lt ; 1 $ , accumulation of phase transition points is forbidden when $ \lambda\rightarrow 1 $ .
3	Next we estimate the branching ratios for transitions to accessible excited nuclear levels .	We briefly review some theoretical issues involved in the direct detection of supersymmetric ( SUSY ) dark matter .	After a brief discussion of the allowed SYSY parameter space we focus on the determination of the traditional neutralino detection rates , in experiments which measure the energy of the recoiling nucleus , such as the coherent and spin induced rates and the dependence of the rate on the motion of the Earth ( modulation effect ) .	Then we examine the novel features appearing in directional experiments , which detect the recoiling nucleus in a given direction .	Finally we estimate the event rates leading to the atom ionization and subsequent detection of the outgoing electrons .
4	Finally , on a connected and complete Riemannian 3-manifold , if $ ( 0 , + , + ) $ occurs globally and the two positive eigenvalues are equal , then the universal cover splits isometrically .	Milnor has shown that three-dimensional Lie groups with left invariant Riemannian metrics furnish examples of 3-manifolds with principal Ricci curvatures of fixed signature\ , -- -\ , \emph { except } for the signatures $ ( - , + , + ) $ , $ ( 0 , + , - ) $ , and $ ( 0 , + , + ) $ .	We examine these three cases on a Riemannian 3-manifold , and prove the following .	If the manifold is closed , then the signature $ ( - , + , + ) $ is not globally possible if it is of the form $ -\mu , f , f $ , with $ \mu $ a positive constant and $ f $ a smooth function that never takes the values $ 0 , -\mu $ ( hence this also applies to the signature $ ( - , - , - ) $ ) .	In the scalar flat and complete case , the signature $ ( 0 , + , - ) $ is not globally possible if the eigenvalues are constants and the zero eigenspace is spanned by a unit length vector field with geodesic flow ; if the manifold is closed and this vector field is also divergence-free , then $ ( 0 , + , - ) $ is not possible even if the nonzero eigenvalues are not constant .
1	Recently , there has been a lot of interest in nanoscale hybrid systems as possible candidates for thermal devices .	As a fundamental requisite for thermotronics , controlling heat flow has been a longstanding quest in solid state physics .	In this context , we study the heat current in the simplest hybrid device of a two level system weakly coupled to two heat baths .	We use the reduced density matrix approach together with a simple Born-Markov approximation to calculate the heat current in the steady state .	We consider different kinds of reservoirs and show that the nature of the reservoir plays a very important role in determining the thermal characteristics of the device .
0	The repulsive Hubbard Hamiltonian is one of the foundational models describing strongly correlated electrons and is believed to capture essential aspects of high temperature superconductivity .	Ultracold fermions in optical lattices allow for the simulation of the Hubbard Hamiltonian with a unique control over kinetic energy , interactions and doping .	A great challenge is to reach the required low entropy to observe antiferromagnetic spin correlations beyond nearest neighbors , for which quantum gas microscopes are ideal .	Here we report on the direct , single-site resolved detection of antiferromagnetic correlations extending up to three sites in spin-1/2 Hubbard chains , which requires an entropy well below s= ln ( 2 ) .	Finally , our simultaneous detection of spin and charge opens the route towards the study of the interplay between magnetic ordering and doping in various dimensions .
0	We consider n identically prepared qubits and study the asymptotic properties of the joint state \rho^ { \otimes n } .	We show that for all individual states \rho situated in a local neighborhood of size 1/\sqrt { n } of a fixed state \rho^0 , the joint state converges to a displaced thermal equilibrium state of a quantum harmonic oscillator .	The precise meaning of the convergence is that there exist physical transformations T_ { n } ( trace preserving quantum channels ) which map the qubits states asymptotically close to their corresponding oscillator state , uniformly over all states in the local neighborhood .	A few consequences of the main result are derived .	We show that the optimal joint measurement in the Bayesian set-up is also optimal within the pointwise approach .
2	XML can be used to precisely describe the association of data types with their graphical handling ( beans ) , and Java provides an especially rich environment for programming the graphics .	In the past , the features of a user interface were limited by those available in the existing graphical widgets it used .	Now , improvements in processor speed have fostered the emergence of interpreted languages , in which the appropriate method to render a given data object can be loaded at runtime .	We present a graphical user interface builder based on Java Beans and XML , in which the graphical screens are described textually ( in files or a database ) in terms of their screen components .	Each component may be a simple text read back , or a complex plot .
2	We obtained a simpler proof of this result which extends to a more general class of graphs $ F $ including all cycles .	For a given graph $ F $ we consider the family of ( finite ) graphs $ G $ with the Ramsey property for $ F $ , that is the set of such graphs $ G $ with the property that every two-colouring of the edges of $ G $ yields a monochromatic copy of $ F $ .	For $ F $ being a triangle Friedgut , R\ '' odl , Ruci\'nski , and Tetali ( 2004 ) established the sharp threshold for the Ramsey property in random graphs .	The proof is based on Friedgut 's criteria ( 1999 ) for sharp thresholds , and on the recently developed container method for independent sets in hypergraphs by Saxton and Thomason , and Balogh , Morris and Samotij .	The proof builds on some recent work of Friedgut et al .
4	For a diffuse vacuum-plasma boundary , the emission from the plasma entrance and exit is asymmetric : increasing and decreasing density ramps enhance and diminish the radiated energy respectively .	An intense , short laser pulse propagating across a plasma boundary ponderomotively drives THz radiation .	Full format PIC simulations and theoretical analysis are conducted to investigate the properties of this radiation .	Simulation results show the THz emission originates in regions of varying density and covers a broad spectrum with maximum frequency close to the maximum plasma frequency .	In the case of a sharp vacuum-plasma boundary , the radiation is generated symmetrically at the plasma entrance and exit , and its properties are independent of plasma density when the density exceeds a characteristic value determined by the product of the plasma frequency and the laser pulse duration .
4	We explain our results based on the increase in intraband scattering in the multiband superconductor YNi2B2C .	We investigate the evolution of superconducting properties by doping non-magnetic impurity in single crystals of YNi2-xPtxB2C ( x=0-0.2 ) .	With increasing Pt doping the critical temperature ( Tc ) monotonically decreases from 15.85K and saturates to a value ~13K for x & gt ; 0.14 .	However , unlike conventional s-wave superconductors , the upper critical field ( HC2 ) along both crystallographic directions a and c decreases with increasing Pt doping .	Specific heat measurements show that the density of states ( N ( EF ) ) at the Fermi level ( EF ) and the Debye temperatures ( Theta_D ) in this series remains constant within the error bars of our measurement .
2	This special class of sources , here named `` binary driven hypernovae '' ( BdHNe ) , presents a composite sequence composed of four different episodes [ ... ] .	Context : The induced gravitational collapse ( IGC ) paradigm addresses the very energetic ( 10^ { 52 } -10^ { 54 } erg ) long gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) associated to supernovae ( SNe ) .	Unlike the traditional `` collapsar '' model , an evolved FeCO core with a companion neutron star ( NS ) in a tight binary system is considered as the progenitor .	Aims : We first compare and contrast the steep decay , the plateau and the power-law decay of the X-ray luminosities of three selected BdHNe [ ... ] .	Second , to explain the different sizes and Lorentz factors of the emitting regions of the four Episodes , [ ... ] .
2	The system is based on multiple spatially-aware mobile devices .	The aim of this thesis was the design and development of an interactive system enhancing collaborative sensemaking .	The system design was based on related work research and preliminary user study .	The spatial awareness is established with a motion tracking system .	The information about position of tablets is received by a server .
0	Traditional heterogeneous parallel algorithms , designed for heterogeneous clusters of workstations , are based on the assumption that the absolute speed of the processors does not depend on the size of the computational task .	This assumption proved inaccurate for modern and perspective highly heterogeneous HPC platforms .	New class of algorithms based on the functional performance model ( FPM ) , representing the speed of the processor by a function of problem size , has been recently proposed .	These algorithms can not be however employed in self-adaptable applications because of very high cost of construction of the functional performance model .	The paper presents a new class of parallel algorithms for highly heterogeneous HPC platforms .
0	Velocity oscillations in sunspot umbrae have been measured simultaneously in two spectral lines : the photospheric Silicon I 10827 A line and the chromospheric Helium I 10830 A multiplet .	From the full Stokes inversion of temporal series of spectropolarimetric observations we retrieved , among other parameters , the line of sight velocity temporal variations at photospheric and chromospheric heights .	Chromospheric velocity oscillations show a three minute period with a clear sawtooth shape typical of propagating shock wave fronts .	Photospheric velocity oscillations have basically a five minute period , although the power spectrum also shows a secondary peak in the three minute band which has proven to be predecessor for its chromospheric counterpart .	The derived phase spectra yield a value of the atmospheric cut-off frequency around 4 mHz and give evidence for the upward propagation of higher frequency oscillation modes .
1	For this purpose the frequency deviations of the stabilization are measured precisely by means of a frequency comb .	We report on a calibration procedure that enhances the precision of an interferometer based frequency stabilization by several orders of magnitude .	This allows to implement several calibration steps that compensate different systematic errors .	The resulting frequency deviation is shown to be less than $ 5.7 $ MHz ( rms $ 1.6 $ MHz ) in the whole wavelength interval $ 750 - 795 $ nm .	Wide tuning of a stabilized laser at this exceptional precision is demonstrated .
0	Code cloning negatively affects industrial software and threatens intellectual property .	This paper presents a novel approach to detecting cloned software by using a bijective matching technique .	The proposed approach focuses on increasing the range of similarity measures and thus enhancing the precision of the detection .	This is achieved by extending a well-known stable-marriage problem ( SMP ) and demonstrating how matches between code fragments of different files can be expressed .	A prototype of the proposed approach is provided using a proper scenario , which shows a noticeable improvement in several features of clone detection such as scalability and accuracy .
4	We apply the formulae derived to Baryon Acoustic Oscillation ( BAO ) and Redshift-Space Distortion ( RSD ) measurements from BOSS in our companion papers .	We present improved methodology for including covariance matrices in the error budget of Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey ( BOSS ) galaxy clustering measurements , revisiting Data Release 9 ( DR9 ) analyses , and describing a method that is used in DR10/11 analyses presented in companion papers .	The precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important , due to the precision that BOSS can now reach : even using as many as 600 mock catalogues to estimate covariance of 2-point clustering measurements can still lead to an increase in the errors of ~20 % , depending on how the cosmological parameters of interest are measured .	In this paper we extend previous work on this contribution to the error budget , deriving formulae for errors measured by integrating over the likelihood , and to the distribution of recovered best-fit parameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix .	Both are situations that previous analyses of BOSS have considered .
0	Principal component analysis ( PCA ) is a key statistical technique for multivariate data analysis .	For large data sets the common approach to PCA computation is based on the standard NIPALS-PCA algorithm , which unfortunately suffers from loss of orthogonality , and therefore its applicability is usually limited to the estimation of the first few components .	Here we present an algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization ( called GS-PCA ) , which eliminates this shortcoming of NIPALS-PCA .	Also , we discuss the GPU ( Graphics Processing Unit ) parallel implementation of both NIPALS-PCA and GS-PCA algorithms .	The numerical results show that the GPU parallel optimized versions , based on CUBLAS ( NVIDIA ) are substantially faster ( up to 12 times ) than the CPU optimized versions based on CBLAS ( GNU Scientific Library ) .
1	In this study , interaction and propagation of particles is treated in a 3-dimensional way including the curvature of charged particles due to the geomagnetic field , which is assumed to be a dipole field .	A 3-dimensional calculation of atmospheric neutrinos flux is presented , and the results are compared with those of a 1-dimensional one .	The purpose of this paper is limited to the comparison of calculation schemes .	The updated flux value with new interaction model and primary flux model will be reported in a separate paper .	Except for nearly horizontal directions , the flux is very similar to the result of 1 dimensional calculations .
1	One can form the corresponding cross-product C*-algebra A .	Every hyperbolic group acts continuously on its Gromov boundary .	We show that there always exists a canonical Poincare duality map from the K-theory of A to the K-homology of A .	We show that this map is an isomorphism when the group in question is the free group on two generators .	There is a direct connection between our constructions and the Baum-Connes Conjecture , and we use the latter to deduce our result .
2	Within such a framework , corrections to the elastic moduli of the membrane are obtained , which arise from charge accumulation in the Debye layers due to capacitive effects and electric currents through the membrane and can lead to an undulation instability of the membrane .	The behavior of a conductive membrane in a static ( DC ) electric field is investigated theoretically .	An effective zero-thickness model is constructed based on a Robin-type boundary condition for the electric potential at the membrane , originally developed for electrochemical systems .	The fluid flow surrounding the membrane is also calculated , which clarifies issues regarding these flows sharing many similarities with flows produced by induced charge electro-osmosis ( ICEO ) .	Non-equilibrium steady states of the membrane and of the fluid can be effectively described by this method .
4	We show the system possesses a side-band transition structure which does not scale with the size of the processor allowing scalable frequency discrimination between qubits .	We propose a new design for a quantum information processor where qubits are encoded into Hyperfine states of ions held in a linear array of individually tailored microtraps and sitting in a spatially varying magnetic field .	The magnetic field gradient introduces spatially dependent qubit transition frequencies and a type of spin-spin interaction between qubits .	Single and multi-qubit manipulation is achieved via resonant microwave pulses as in liquid-NMR quantum computation while the qubit readout and reset is achieved through trapped-ion fluorescence shelving techniques .	By adjusting the microtrap configurations we can tailor , in hardware , the qubit resonance frequencies and coupling strengths .
0	The relationship between the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner ( ADM ) field decomposition and the non-relativistic gravitational ( NRG ) fields attracted considerable interest recently .	This paper compares the two , especially with respect to computing the two-body post-Newtonian ( PN ) effective action within the effective field theory ( EFT ) approach .	Both are space+time decompositions and hence do better than using the standard metric .	However , ADM is essentially a reduction over space whereas NRG is essentially a reduction over time .	We use a variant of ADM which is linearly equivalent to NRG and the two are identical at order 1PN .
3	The backgrounds we get include the backreaction of the flavor branes and generalize the geometries obtained so far to the case in which the fundamental matter is massive .	We construct holographic duals to N=1 SQCD with a quartic superpotential and unquenched massive flavors .	Our backgrounds are generated by D5-branes wrapping two-dimensional submanifolds of an internal space .	The flavor degrees of freedom are introduced by means of D5-branes extended along two-dimensional calibrated surfaces , and act as sources of the different supergravity fields .	The supergravity solutions we find are regular everywhere and depend on a radial function which can be determined from the distribution of flavor branes used as sources .
2	We first derive a resolution criteria , based on considerations of Bondi-Hoyle flows , that must be met in order to properly resolve the formation of accretion disks around the secondary .	We study the formation , evolution and physical properties of accretion disks formed via wind capture in binary systems .	Using the AMR code AstroBEAR , we have carried out high resolution 3D simulations that follow a stellar mass secondary in the co-rotating frame as it orbits a wind producing AGB primary .	We then compare simulations of binaries with three different orbital radii ( 10 , 15 , 20 AU ) .	Disks are formed in all three cases , however the size of the disk and , most importantly , its accretion rate decreases with orbital radii .
3	The cost of a sequence of sweeps is the sum of the lengths of the sweep vectors .	Given a convex region in the plane , and a sweep-line as a tool , what is best way to reduce the region to a single point by a sequence of sweeps ?	The problem of sweeping points by orthogonal sweeps was first studied in [ 2 ] .	Here we consider the following \emph { slanted } variant of sweeping recently introduced in [ 1 ] : In a single sweep , the sweep-line is placed at a start position somewhere in the plane , then moved continuously according to a sweep vector $ \vec v $ ( not necessarily orthogonal to the sweep-line ) to another parallel end position , and then lifted from the plane .	The ( optimal ) sweeping cost of a region is the infimum of the costs over all finite sweeping sequences for that region .
3	We consider noise that is white in time and either in $ H^1 $ or $ H^2 $ in space and give convergence proofs in the mean square $ L^ { 2 } $ norm for a diffusion reaction equation and in mean square $ H^ { 1 } $ norm in the presence of an advection term .	We consider the numerical approximation of general semilinear parabolic stochastic partial differential equations ( SPDEs ) driven by additive space-time noise .	In contrast to the standard time stepping methods which uses basic increments of the noise and the approximation of the exponential function by a rational fraction , we introduce a new scheme , designed for finite elements , finite volumes or finite differences space discretization , similar to the schemes in \cite { Jentzen3 , Jentzen4 } for spectral methods and \cite { GTambue } for finite element methods .	We use the projection operator , the smoothing effect of the positive definite self-adjoint operator and linear functionals of the noise in Fourier space to obtain higher order approximations .	For the exponential integrator we rely on computing the exponential of a non-diagonal matrix .
2	We first use Gibbs ensemble Monte Caro simulations to determine the phase behavior of particles interacting via a square-well potential in two dimensions for various values of the interaction range .	We report a numerical simulation for the phase diagram of a simple two dimensional model , similar to one proposed by Noro and Frenkel [ J. Chem.Phys .	\textbf { 114 } , 2477 ( 2001 ) ] for membrane proteins , but one that includes the role of the solvent .	A phenomenological model for the solute-solvent interactions is then studied to understand how the fluid-fluid coexistence curve is modified by solute-solvent interactions .	It is shown that such a model can yield systems with liquid-liquid phase separation curves that have both upper and lower critical points , as well as closed loop phase diagrams , as is the case with the corresponding three dimensional model .
4	The obtained range in sub-mm/mm spectral index , namely 1.5-3.2 , indicates that for disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster ( projected distance from the cluster center between about 0.4 pc and 1.5 pc ) grain growth to mm sizes occurs in the same manner as disks in regions where only low-mass stars form .	We present the sub-mm/mm SED for a sample of eight young circumstellar disks in the outer regions of the Orion Nebula Cluster .	New observations were carried out at 2.9 mm with the CARMA array and for one disk , 216-0939 , at 3.3 and 6.8 mm with ATCA .	By combining these new millimeter data with literature measurements at sub-millimeter wavelengths we investigate grain growth and measure the dust mass in protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster .	These data provide evidence for dust grain growth to at least millimeter-sizes for the first time in a high-mass star forming region .
4	We show that there are several possibilities to define the autocorrelation function and that they all asymptotically show exponential decay , however with different time constants .	We discuss the relaxation kinetics of a one-dimensional dimer adsorption model as recently proposed for the binding of biological dimers like kinesin on microtubules .	The non-equilibrium dynamics shows several regimes : irreversible adsorption on short time scales , an intermediate plateau followed by a power-law regime and finally exponential relaxation towards equilibrium .	In all four regimes we give analytical solutions .	The algebraic decay and the scaling behaviour can be explained by mapping onto a simple reaction-diffusion model .
0	The Tycho-2 Catalogue , released in February 2000 , is based on the ESA Hipparcos space mission data and various ground-based catalogs for proper motions .	An external comparison of the Tycho-2 astrometry is presented here using the first U.S .	Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog ( UCAC1 ) .	The UCAC1 data were obtained from observations performed at CTIO between February 1998 and November 1999 , using the 206 mm aperture 5-element lens astrograph and a 4k x 4k CCD .	Only small systematic differences in position between Tycho-2 and UCAC1 up to 15 milliarcseconds ( mas ) are found , mainly as a function of magnitude .
4	However , information on post-novae is scarce , even to the extent that the identification of the post-nova is ambiguous in most cases .	The eruption of a ( classical ) nova is widely accepted to be a recurrent event in the lifetime of a cataclysmic binary star .	In-between eruptions the system should therefore behave as a `` normal '' cataclysmic variable ( CV ) , i.e.according to its characteristic properties like the mass-transfer rate or the strength of the magnetic field of the white dwarf .	How important are these characteristics for the nova eruption itself , i.e.which type of systems preferably undergo a nova eruption ?	This question could in principle be addressed by comparing the post-nova systems with the general CV population .
0	We discuss methods currently in use for determining the significance of peaks in the periodograms of time series .	We discuss some general methods for constructing significance tests , false alarm probability functions , and the role played in these by independent random variables and by empirical and theoretical cumulative distribution functions .	We also discuss the concept of `` independent frequencies '' in periodogram analysis .	We propose a practical method for estimating the significance of periodogram peaks , applicable to all time series irrespective of the spacing of the data .	This method , based on Monte Carlo simulations , produces significance tests that are tailor-made for any given astronomical time series .
3	In practice , the selection of the affinity matrix exhibits a tremendous impact on the unsupervised learning .	Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering approaches with the capability to handle some challenging clustering problems .	Most spectral clustering methods provide a nonlinear map from the data manifold to a subspace .	Only a little work focuses on the explicit linear map which can be viewed as the unsupervised distance metric learning .	While much success of affinity learning has been achieved in recent years , some issues such as noise reduction remain to be addressed .
0	Although inverse limits with factor spaces indexed by the positive integers are most commonly studied , Ingram and Mahavier have defined inverse limits with set-valued functions broadly enough for any directed index set to be used .	In this paper , we investigate generalized inverse limits whose factor spaces are indexed by totally ordered sets .	Using information about the projections of such inverse limits onto finitely many coordinates , we generalize various well-known theorems on connectedness in inverse limits .	Moreover , numerous theorems and examples are given addressing the special case of an inverse limit with a single idempotent surjective u.s.c .	bonding function .
1	However , little work has been done in the robust coding of encrypted images .	The robust coding of natural images and the effective compression of encrypted images have been studied individually in recent years .	The existing results in these two individual research areas can not be combined directly for the robust coding of encrypted images .	This is because the robust coding of natural images relies on the elimination of spatial correlations using sparse transforms such as discrete wavelet transform ( DWT ) , which is ineffective to encrypted images due to the weak correlation between encrypted pixels .	Moreover , the compression of encrypted images always generates code streams with different significance .
4	We show that the infinite-dimensional family of Hamiltonian flows can also be understood in terms of Thiemann 's `` complexifier '' method ( which generalizes the construction of adapted complex structures ) .	For the cotangent bundle $ T^ { * } K $ of a compact Lie group $ K $ , we study the complex-time evolution of the vertical tangent bundle and the associated geometric quantization Hilbert space $ L^ { 2 } ( K ) $ under an infinite-dimensional family of Hamiltonian flows .	For each such flow , we construct a generalized coherent state transform ( CST ) , which is a unitary isomorphism between $ L^ { 2 } ( K ) $ and a certain weighted $ L^ { 2 } $ -space of holomorphic functions .	For a particular set of choices , we show that this isomorphism is naturally decomposed as a product of a Heisenberg-type evolution ( for complex time $ -\tau $ ) within $ L^ { 2 } ( K ) $ , followed by a polarization -- changing geometric quantization evolution ( for complex time $ +\tau $ ) .	In this case , our construction yields the usual generalized Segal -- Bargmann transform of Hall .
4	The 2-10\ , keV luminosity may reach $ \sim $ 10 times the quiescent X-ray flux of Sgr A* .	The recent discovery of the G2 cloud of dense , ionized gas on a trajectory toward Sgr A* , the black hole at the dynamical center of the Galaxy , offers a unique opportunity to observe an accretion event onto a massive black hole as well as to probe its immediate environment .	Simulations and models predict increased X-ray and radio variability resulting from increased accretion driven by drag on an atmosphere of hot , X-ray emitting gas surrounding Sgr A* .	Here , we present X-ray and radio light curves of the emission resulting from the potential encounter of the G2 cloud with a relativistic jet from Sgr A* .	This interaction would violently shock a portion of the G2 cloud to temperatures $ \sim 10^8 $ \ , K resulting in bright X-ray emission from the dense , shocked gas as it adiabatically expands .
4	In the linear response regime , and under some assumptions , we first describe the general transport properties of the system .	We introduce a model for charge and heat transport based on the Landauer-Buttiker scattering approach .	The system consists of a chain of $ N $ quantum dots , each of them being coupled to a particle reservoir .	Additionally , the left and right ends of the chain are coupled to two particle reservoirs .	All these reservoirs are independent and can be described by any of the standard physical distributions : Maxwell-Boltzmann , Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein .
0	We review the application of the consistent ( or decoherent ) histories formulation of quantum theory to canonical loop quantum cosmology .	Conventional quantum theory relies crucially on `` measurements '' to convert unrealized quantum potentialities into physical outcomes that can be assigned probabilities .	In the early universe and other physical contexts in which there are no observers or measuring apparatus ( or indeed , in any closed quantum system ) , what criteria determine which alternative outcomes may be realized and what their probabilities are ?	In the consistent histories formulation it is the vanishing of interference between the branch wave functions describing alternative histories -- as determined by the system 's decoherence functional -- that determines which alternatives may be assigned probabilities .	We describe the consistent histories formulation and how it may be applied to canonical loop quantum cosmology , describing in detail the application to homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models with scalar matter .
4	Under these conditions , the contact line may suffer a variety of chemo-capillary instabilities ( fingering , traveling and oscillatory ) , similar to those of dissipative structures in nonlinear non-equilibrium systems .	Equilibrium and motion of a contact line are viewed as analogs of phase equilibrium and motion of an interphase boundary .	This point of view makes evident the tendency to minimization of the length of the contact line at equilibrium .	The concept of line tension is , however , of limited applicability , in view of a qualitatively different relaxation response of the contact line , compared to a two-dimensional curve .	Both the analogy and qualitative distinction extend to a non-equilibrium situation arising due to coupling with reversible substrate modification .
0	Given a ring $ A $ and an $ A $ -coring $ \cC $ we study when the forgetful functor from the category of right $ \cC $ -comodules to the category of right $ A $ -modules and its right adjoint $ -\otimes_A\cC $ are separable .	We then proceed to study when the induction functor $ -\otimes_A\cC $ is also the left adjoint of the forgetful functor .	This question is closely related to the problem when $ A\to { } _A { \rm Hom } ( \cC , A ) $ is a Frobenius extension .	We introduce the notion of a Galois coring and analyse when the tensor functor over the subring of $ A $ fixed under the coaction of $ \cC $ is an equivalence .	We also comment on possible dualisation of the notion of a coring .
0	In this paper we investigate the relation between the multiplicities of split abelian chief factors of finite-dimensional Lie algebras and first degree cohomology .	In particular , we obtain a characterization of modular solvable Lie algebras in terms of the vanishing of first degree cohomology or in terms of the multiplicities of split abelian chief factors .	The analogues of these results are well known in the modular representation theory of finite groups .	An important tool in the proof of these results is a refinement of a non-vanishing theorem of Seligman for the first degree cohomology of non-solvable finite-dimensional Lie algebras in prime characteristic .	As applications we derive several results in the representation theory of restricted Lie algebras related to the principal block and the projective cover of the trivial irreducible module of a finite-dimensional restricted Lie algebra .
3	In addition , we investigate selection biases arising from the faintness and from the masking effect which prevents us from identifying a DLA galaxy hidden or contaminated by a point spread function of a background quasar .	We investigate Damped Ly-alpha absorbing galaxies ( DLA galaxies ) at low redshifts z & lt ; 1 in the hierarchical structure formation scenario to clarify the nature of DLA galaxies because observational data of such galaxies mainly at low redshifts are currently available .	We find that our model well reproduces distributions of fundamental properties of DLA galaxies such as luminosities , column densities , impact parameters obtained by optical and near-infrared imagings .	Our results suggest that DLA systems primarily consist of low luminosity galaxies with small impact parameters ( typical radius about 3 kpc , surface brightness from 22 to 27 mag arcsec^ { -2 } ) similar to low surface brightness ( LSB ) galaxies .	We find that the latter affects the distributions of DLA properties more seriously rather than the former , and that the observational data are well reproduced only when taking into account the masking effect .
0	This paper investigates a variant of the Hamiltonian Cycle ( HC ) problem , named the Parity Hamiltonian Cycle ( PHC ) problem : The problem is to find a closed walk visiting each vertex odd number of times , instead of exactly once .	We show that the PHC problem is in P even when a closed walk is allowed to use an edge at most z=4 times , by considering a T-join , which is a generalization of matching .	On the other hand , the PHC problem is NP-complete when z=3 .	In the case of z=3 however , the problem is in P when an input graph is four-edge connected , but it still remains NP-complete even when it is two-edge connected .	Thus , we are concerned with the hard case in detail , and give a simple necessary and sufficient condition that a two-edge connected C & gt ; =5-free ( or P6-free ) graph has a PHC .
0	The Santa Barbara cluster comparison project ( Frenk et al .	Frenk+1999 ) revealed that there is a systematic difference between entropy profiles of clusters of galaxies obtained by Eulerian mesh and Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( SPH ) codes : Mesh codes gave a core with a constant entropy whereas SPH codes did not .	One possible reason for this difference is that mesh codes are not Galilean invariant .	Another possible reason is the problem of the SPH method , which might give too much `` protection '' to cold clumps because of the unphysical surface tension induced at contact discontinuities .	In this paper , we apply the density independent formulation of SPH ( DISPH ) , which can handle contact discontinuities accurately , to simulations of a cluster of galaxies , and compare the results with those with the standard SPH .
4	As a first application we considered only three and four gluon vertices calculating the pure gluonic one-loop amplitudes for arbitrary external helicity or polarization states .	We develop an algorithm of polynomial complexity for evaluating one-loop amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external particles .	The algorithm is implemented in the Rocket program .	Starting from particle vertices given by Feynman rules , tree amplitudes are constructed using recursive relations .	The tree amplitudes are then used to build one-loop amplitudes using an integer dimension on-shell cut method .
4	In the present paper , we analyse the L 1 error of this approximation procedure , by splitting it into the discretisation error of the initial data and the non-entropicity error induced by the evolution of the particle system .	Brenier and Grenier [ SIAM J. Numer .	Anal. , 1998 ] proved that sticky particle dynamics with a large number of particles allow to approximate the entropy solution to scalar one-dimensional conservation laws with monotonic initial data .	In [ arXiv:1501.01498 ] , we introduced a multitype version of this dynamics and proved that the associated empirical cumulative distribution functions converge to the viscosity solution , in the sense of Bianchini and Bres-san [ Ann.of Math .	( 2 ) , 2005 ] , of one-dimensional diagonal hyperbolic systems with monotonic initial data of arbitrary finite variation .
2	The MAGIC-I telescope started to follow-up GCN alerts in the beginning of 2005 .	MAGIC is currently the most suitable instrument to perform observations of the prompt an early afterglow emission from Gamma Ray Bursts ( GRBs ) at energies above 25 GeV .	The instrument is designed to have the lowest possible energy threshold and fastest reaction time to GRB Coordinates Network ( GCN ) alerts .	Since then , more than 50 GRB candidates were observed .	Just now MAGIC-II , the second telescope has started to operate .
1	Some of them are known for decades , some are more recent .	The paper contains a discussion on a number of open problems in queueing theory .	They relate to stability and to rare events .	There is an idea to prepare a special issue of QUESTA on open problems , and this text may be considered as a prospective contribution to that .	The choice of open problems reflects the author 's own interests , and should not be taken as suggesting that these are the only , or even most important problems !
3	Experimental result and numerical analysis showed that the new phase unwrapping algorithm could successfully subtract contribution of the system 's background without error .	X-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer has been used widely to conduct phase contrast imaging with a conventional low-brilliance x-ray source .	Typically , in this technique , background correction has to be performed in order to obtain the pure signal of the sample under inspection .	In this study , we reported on a research on the background correction strategies within this technique , especially we introduced a new phase unwrapping solution for one conventional background correction method , the key point of this new solution is changing the initial phase of each pixel by a cyclic shift operation on the raw images collected in phase stepping scan .	Moreover , a potential advantage of this phase unwrapping strategy is that its effective phase measuring range could be tuned flexibly in some degree for example to be ( -pi+3 , pi+3 ] , thus it would find usage in certain case because measuring range of the currently widely used background correction method is fixed to be ( -pi , pi ] .
0	I address the following issues : All bulk velocity measurements ( but one ) are consistent with our standard gravitational instability theory .	New accurate data and reconstruction methods allow high-resolution dynamical analysis nearby , revealing Virgo , Ursa Major and Fornax as attractors .	Large peculiar-velocity surveys enable robust reconstruction of the dynamical fields on the Great-Attractor scale .	A decomposition of the velocity field into its local and tidal components indicates the presence of big perturbations further away .	Cluster velocities start exploring very large scales , revealing Coma , Shapely and other mass enhancements , and constraining a possible local Hubble bubble .
4	The most stringent constraint comes from the Lyman- { \alpha } forest and seems to disfavor all but one of the main production mechanisms proposed in the literature , which is the production via decay of heavy scalar singlets .	The recent observation of an X-ray line at an energy of 3.5 keV mainly from galaxy clusters has initiated a discussion about whether we may have seen a possible dark matter signal .	If confirmed , this signal could stem from a decaying sterile neutrino of a mass of 7.1 keV .	Such a particle could make up all the dark matter , but it is not clear how it was produced in the early Universe .	In this letter we show that it is possible to discriminate between different production mechanisms with present-day astronomical data .
3	While both channels detect nearly equal SEP fluxes , their contributions to the count rate is sensibly negligible in the zero order channel but must be accounted for and removed from the first channel count rate .	The solar irradiance in the Extreme Ultraviolet ( EUV ) spectral bands has been observed with a 15 sec cadence by the SOHO Solar EUV Monitor ( SEM ) since 1995 .	During remarkably intense solar flares the SEM EUV measurements are saturated in the central ( zero ) order channel ( 0.1 -- 50.0 nm ) by the flare soft X-ray and EUV flux .	The first order EUV channel ( 26 -- 34 nm ) is not saturated by the flare flux because of its limited bandwidth , but it is sensitive to the arrival of Solar Energetic Particles ( SEP ) .	SEP contribution to the measured SEM signals usually follows the EUV peak for the gradual solar flare events .
0	The electrical current through an arbitrary junction connecting quantum wires of spinless interacting fermions is calculated in fermionic representation .	The wires are adiabatically attached to two reservoirs at chemical potentials differing by the applied voltage bias .	The relevant scale-dependent contributions in perturbation theory in the interaction up to infinite order are evaluated and summed up .	The result allows one to construct renormalization group equations for the conductance as a function of voltage ( or temperature , wire length ) .	There are two fixed points at which the conductance follows a power law in terms of a scaling variable $ \Lambda $ , which equals the bias voltage $ V $ , if $ V $ is the largest energy scale compared to temperature $ T $ and inverse wire length $ L^ { -1 } $ , and interpolates between these quantities in the crossover regimes .
2	In this work , we consider the problem of jointly labeling the object affordances and human activities from RGB-D videos .	Human activities comprise several sub-activities performed in a sequence and involve interactions with various objects .	This makes reasoning about the object affordances a central task for activity recognition .	We frame the problem as a Markov Random Field where the nodes represent objects and sub-activities , and the edges represent the relationships between object affordances , their relations with sub-activities , and their evolution over time .	We formulate the learning problem using a structural SVM approach , where labeling over various alternate temporal segmentations are considered as latent variables .
3	We resolve this difficulty by the introduction of a simple polar coordinate algorithm representing `` pure '' ( monomial ) products as scalar multiples of orthonormal bases , for which the angular equation is a numerically optimized version of the continuous orthogonalization method of Drury -- Davey \cite { Da , Dr } and the radial equation is evaluable by quadrature .	In Evans function computations of the spectra of asymptotically constant-coefficient linear operators , a basic issue is the efficient and numerically stable computation of subspaces evolving according to the associated eigenvalue ODE .	For small systems , a fast , shooting algorithm may be obtained by representing subspaces as single exterior products \cite { AS , Br.1 , Br.2 , BrZ , BDG } .	For large systems , however , the dimension of the exterior-product space quickly becomes prohibitive , growing as $ \binom { n } { k } $ , where $ n $ is the dimension of the system written as a first-order ODE and $ k $ ( typically $ \sim n/2 $ ) is the dimension of the subspace .	Notably , the polar-coordinate method preserves the important property of analyticity with respect to parameters .
2	This leads to the absence of a Chern-Simons term in the effective theory of the CFL .	We study composite fermi liquid ( CFL ) states in the lowest Landau level ( LLL ) limit at a generic filling $ \nu = \frac { 1 } { n } $ .	We begin with the old observation that , in compressible states , the composite fermion in the lowest Landau level should be viewed as a charge-neutral particle carrying vorticity .	We argue here that instead a Berry curvature should be enclosed by the fermi surface of composite fermions , with the total Berry phase fixed by the filling fraction $ \phi_B=-2\pi\nu $ .	We illustrate this point with the CFL of fermions at filling fractions $ \nu=1/2q $ and ( single and two-component ) bosons at $ \nu=1/ ( 2q+1 ) $ .
3	We aim at maximizing the throughput of the individual SUs such that the PU 's queue is maintained stable .	In this paper , we propose a new optimization-based access strategy of multipacket reception ( MPR ) channel for multiple secondary users ( SUs ) accessing the primary user ( PU ) spectrum opportunistically .	We devise an analytical model that realizes the multipacket access strategy of SUs that maximizes the throughput of individual backlogged SUs subject to queue stability of the PU .	All the network receiving nodes have MPR capability .	Moreover , we are interested in providing an energy-efficient cognitive scheme .
2	The corresponding amplitude is represented in terms of Wilson loops running along the trajectories of the constituent quarks and antiquarks .	We perform the analysis of quark-antiquark Reggeon exchange in meson-meson scattering , in the framework of the gauge/gravity correspondence in a confining background .	On the gauge theory side , Reggeon exchange is described as quark-antiquark exchange in the t channel between fast projectiles .	The paths of the exchanged fermions are integrated over , while the `` spectator '' fermions are dealt with in an eikonal approximation .	On the gravity side , we follow a previously proposed approach , and we evaluate the Wilson-loop expectation value by making use of gauge/gravity duality for a generic confining gauge theory .
3	104 , 153203 ( 2010 ) ] , in which two resonances are observed in the presence of transverse anisotropy .	We theoretically investigate the confinement-induced resonance for quasi-one-dimensional quan- tum systems under transversely anisotropic confinement , using a two-body s-wave scattering model in the zero-energy collision limit .	We predict a single resonance for any transverse anisotropy , whose position shows a slight downshift with increasing anisotropy .	We compare our prediction with the recent experimental result by Haller et al . [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	The discrepancy between theory and experiment remains to be resolved .
1	An extended Hubbard model is employed to simulate the SQDC system consisted of { \color { blue } N=2,3,4 , and 5 } quantum dots ( QDs ) .	The thermoelectric properties of a semiconduct quantum dot chain ( SQDC ) connected to metallic electrodes are theoretically investigated in the Coulomb blockade regime .	The charge and heat currents are calculated in the framework of Keldysh Green 's function technique .	We obtained a closed-form Landauer expression for the transmission coefficient of the SQDC system with arbitrary number of QDs by using the method beyond mean-field theory .	The electrical conductance ( $ G_e $ ) , Seebeck coefficient ( S ) , thermal conductance , and figure of merit ( ZT ) are numerically calculated and analyzed in the linear response regime .
0	The Bethe-Salpeter equation restores exact elastic unitarity in the $ s- $ channel by summing up an infinite set of chiral loops .	We use this equation to show how a chiral expansion can be undertaken in the two particle irreducible amplitude and the propagators accomplishing exact elastic unitarity at any step .	Renormalizability of the amplitudes can be achieved by allowing for an infinite set of counter-terms as it is the case in ordinary Chiral Perturbation Theory .	Crossing constraints can be imposed on the parameters to a given order .	Within this framework , we calculate the leading and next-to-leading contributions to the elastic $ \pi \pi $ scattering amplitudes , for all isospin channels , and to the vector and scalar pion form factors in several renormalization schemes .
0	The peer review system as used in several computer science communities has several flaws including long review times , overloaded reviewers , as well as fostering of niche topics .	These flaws decrease quality , lower impact , slowdown the innovation process , and lead to frustration of authors , readers , and reviewers .	In order to fix this , we propose a new peer review system termed paper bricks .	Paper bricks has several advantages over the existing system including shorter publications , better competition for new ideas , as well as an accelerated innovation process .	Furthermore , paper bricks may be implemented with minimal change to the existing peer review systems .
2	A clever programmer will always try to choose the faster instructions for the job .	Processors may find some elementary operations to be faster than the others .	Although an operation may be conceptually as simple as some other operation , the processing speeds of the two can vary .	This paper presents an algorithm to display squares of 1st N natural numbers without using multiplication ( * operator ) .	Instead , the same work can be done using addition ( + operator ) .
1	Methods : A 38-state R-matrix calculation in LS-coupling has been performed .	Aims : To calculate transition rates from ground and excited states in neutral oxygen atoms due to electron collisions for non-LTE modelling of oxygen in late-type stellar atmospheres , thus enabling reliable interpretation of oxygen lines in stellar spectra .	Basis orbitals from the literature ( Thomas et al . )	are adopted , and a large set of configurations are included to obtain good representations of the target wavefunctions .	Rate coefficients are calculated by averaging over a Maxwellian velocity distribution .
1	Dual theories are constructed using the moduli space of M5-brane fibers as target space .	We argue that G_2 manifolds for M-theory admitting string theory Calabi-Yau duals are fibered by coassociative submanifolds .	Mirror symmetry and various string and M-theory dualities involving G_2 manifolds may be incorporated into this framework .	To give some examples , we construct two non-compact manifolds with G_2 structures : one with a K3 fibration , and one with a torus fibration and a metric of G_2 holonomy .	Kaluza-Klein reduction of the latter solution gives abelian BPS monopoles in 3+1 dimensions .
4	The classical golden constructors may not be alone .	We have extended some known results of the approximate golden spirals to generalized m-spirals built with whirling squares for any $ m $ ratio ( $ m & gt ; 1 $ ) .	In particular , we have proved that circumscribed circles around squares intercept the pole .	This implies that poles of any m-spirals lie on a circumscribed circle about the first square .	We show here that these and other fascinating properties are not exclusive of golden rectangles .
1	We look for doublets of events at the highest energies , E & gt ; 6 x 10^19 eV , and identify low energy tails , which are deflected by the Galactic Magnetic Field ( GMF ) .	In this paper , we suggest a new way to identify single bright sources of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays ( UHECR ) on the sky , on top of background .	For the sources which are detected , we can recover their angular positions on the sky within one degree from the real ones in 68 % of cases .	The reconstruction of the deflection power of the regular GMF is strongly affected by the value of the turbulent GMF .	For typical values of 4 microG near the Earth , one can reconstruct the deflection power with 25 % precision in 68 % of cases .
0	We find all possible static embeddings of a 4-brane in any dimension-6 spacetime with 4-dimensional Poincare symmetry and a negative cosmological constant , subject to orbifolding across the brane .	Our new solutions allow intersecting branes at an angle determined by a new dynamical parameter .	A collection of branes intersecting in one 3-brane allows an arbitrary excess angle that can be related to a vacuum density along the intersection .	The 3-brane must be stabilized by additional fine-tuned interactions .	We also note that localization of gravity is tied to the approximate fine tuning of the brane tensions .
4	The gas is expected to be embedded in an extended cosmic web made of sheets and filaments .	The interaction of galaxies with their environment , the Intergalactic Medium ( IGM ) , is an important aspect of galaxy formation .	One of the most fundamental , but unanswered questions in the evolution of galaxies is how gas circulates in and around galaxies and how it enters the galaxies to support star formation .	We have several lines of evidence that the observed evolution of star formation requires gas accretion from the IGM at all times and on all cosmic scales .	This gas remains largely unaccounted for and the outstanding questions are where this gas resides and what the physical mechanisms of accretion are .
1	The Raman G+ and G- bands show unequal temperature profiles .	Spatially-resolved Raman spectra of individual pristine suspended carbon nanotubes are observed under electrical heating .	The preferential heating is more pronounced in short nanotubes ( 2 um ) than in long nanotubes ( 5 um ) .	These results are understood in terms of the decay and thermalization of non-equilibrium phonons , revealing the mechanism of thermal transport in these devices .	The measurements also enable a direct estimate of thermal contact resistances and the spatial variation of thermal conductivity .
4	These nonlinearities are weak on cosmological scales , permitting new physics to operate .	The mystery of dark energy suggests that there is new gravitational physics on long length scales .	Yet light degrees of freedom in gravity are strictly limited by Solar System observations .	We can resolve this apparent contradiction by adding a Galilean-invariant scalar field to gravity .	Called Galileons , these scalars have strong self-interactions near overdensities , like the Solar System , that suppress their dynamical effect .
1	Detailed X-ray diffraction and cross-section transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed a double perovskite crystal structure of the Bi2FeCrO6 epitaxial films very similar to that of BiFeO3 along with a particularly noteworthy Fe3+/Cr3+ cation ordering along the [ 111 ] direction .	Epitaxial thin films of Bi2FeCrO6 have been synthesized by pulsed laser deposition on SrRuO3 on ( 100 ) - and ( 111 ) -oriented SrTiO3 substrates .	The films contain no detectable magnetic iron oxide impurities and have the correct cationic average stoichiometry throughout their thickness .	They however exhibit a slight modulation in the Fe and Cr compositions forming complementary stripe patterns , suggesting minor local excess or depletion of Fe and Cr .	The epitaxial BFCO films exhibit good ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties , in addition to magnetic properties at room temperature , as well as an unexpected crystallographic orientation dependence of their room temperature magnetic properties .
3	We further demonstrate that the LB evolves like an ordinary superbubble expanding into a density stratified medium by comparing analytical 2D Kompaneets solutions to NaI contours , representing the extension of the local cavity .	In this paper we review the modeling of the Local Bubble ( LB ) with special emphasis on the progress we have made since the last major conference `` The Local Bubble and Beyond ( I ) '' held in Garching in 1997 .	Since then new insight was gained into the possible origin of the LB , with a moving group crossing its volume during the last 10 - 15 Myr being most likely responsible for creating a local cavity filled with hot recombining gas .	Numerical high resolution 3D simulations of a supernova driven inhomogeneous interstellar medium show that we can reproduce both the extension of the LB and the OVI column density in absorption measured with FUSE for a LB age of 13.5 - 14.5 Myr .	These results suggest that LB blow-out into the Milky Way halo has occurred roughly 5 Myr ago .
0	We show that boundary states in the generic on-shell background satisfy a universal nonlinear equation of closed string field theory .	It generalizes our previous claim for the flat background .	The origin of the equation is factorization relation of boundary conformal field theory which is always true as an axiom .	The equation necessarily incorporates the information of open string sector through a regularization , which implies the equivalence with Cardy condition .	We also give a more direct proof by oscillator representations for some nontrivial backgrounds ( torus and orbifolds ) .
4	Using Music Information Retrieval ( MIR ) and text-mining tools we analyse the musical properties of ~17,000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties .	In modern societies , cultural change seems ceaseless .	The flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music .	While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop , most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature .	To rectify this we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010 .
2	The output matrix is constrained to preserve left and right null-spaces exactly .	This is the first of two papers to describe a matrix sparsification algorithm that takes a general real or complex matrix as input and produces a sparse output matrix of the same size .	The non-zero entries in the output are chosen to minimize changes to the singular values and singular vectors corresponding to the near null-space of the input .	The sparsity pattern of the output matrix is automatically determined or can be given as input .	If the input matrix belongs to a common matrix subspace , we prove that the computed sparse matrix belongs to the same subspace .
2	Based on a maximum likelihood analysis of committor values computed for configurations obtained by Wang-Landau sampling , we construct a non-linear string reaction coordinate for the coil-to-crystal transition .	We investigate the crystallization mechanism of a single , flexible homopolymer chain with short range attractions .	For a sufficiently narrow attractive well , the system undergoes a first-order like freezing transition from an expanded disordered coil to a compact crystalline state .	In contrast to a linear reaction coordinate , the string reaction coordinate captures the effect of different degrees of freedom controlling different stages of the transition .	Our analysis indicates that a combination of the energy and the global crystallinity parameter Q6 provide the most accurate measure for the progress of the transition .
4	Third , a comparison of the event rates measured in the chlorine experiment ( threshold 0.8 Mev ) and the neutrino-electron scattering experiment ( Kamiokande II , threshold 7.5 MeV ) indicates that the deficiency of electron-type neutrinos at the earth is energy dependent , if the rates and the uncertainties in both experiments have been correctly understood .	There are four important facts about solar neutrinos .	They are listed in order of importance in this abstract and discussed more in the text of the talk .	First , solar neutrinos have been detected in four experiments with approximately the energies and fluxes predicted by the standard solar model , confirming the hypothesis that the energy source for the solar luminosity is the fusion of light elements .	Second , the measured event rates are significantl less than the event rates predicted by the combined standard solar and electroweak models in all four experiments .
2	A power-law representation of core-shifts , based on both observations and theoretical considerations of jet conditions , is incorporated .	Aims : The effect of frequency-dependent AGN core positions ( `` core-shifts '' ) on radio Very Long Baseline Interferometry ( VLBI ) global astrometry measurements is investigated .	Methods : The basic equations relating to VLBI astrometry are reviewed , including the effects of source structure .	Results : It is shown that , in the presence of core-shifts , phase and group-delay astrometry measurements yield different positions .	For a core displacement from the jet base parametrized by Delta x ( lambda ) = k lambda^beta group delays measure a `` reduced '' core-shift of ( 1-beta ) Delta x ( lambda ) .
2	Therefore , we can use one-component inversions to obtain the stratifications of plasma parameters in each pixel .	The realism of current models of the penumbra is assessed by comparing their predictions with the plasma properties of penumbral filaments as retrieved from spectropolarimetric observations .	The spectropolarimeter onboard Hinode allows us to distinguish for the first time the fine structure of the penumbra .	The correlations between the plasma parameters and the continuum intensity are studied .	We find that , in the outer penumbra , the stronger flows and higher values of magnetic field inclination tend to be located in dark filaments .
2	Does this information determine $ q ( x ) $ uniquely ?	Let $ u_t = u_ { xx } - q ( x ) u , 0 \leq x \leq 1 $ , $ t & gt ; 0 $ , $ u ( 0 , t ) = 0 , u ( 1 , t ) = a ( t ) , u ( x,0 ) = 0 $ , where $ a ( t ) $ is a given function vanishing for $ t & gt ; T $ , $ a ( t ) \not\equiv 0 $ , $ \int^T_0 a ( t ) dt & lt ; \infty $ .	Suppose one measures the flux $ u_x ( 0 , t ) : = b_0 ( t ) $ for all $ t & gt ; 0 $ .	Do the measurements of the flux $ u_x ( 1 , t ) : = b ( t ) $ give more information about $ q ( x ) $ than $ b_0 ( t ) $ does ?	The above questions are answered in this paper .
3	We present a new framework for allowing spinal cord injured persons to control powered wheelchairs through signals derived from their residual mobility .	Learning to operate a vehicle is generally accomplished by forming a new cognitive map between the body motions and extrapersonal space .	Here , we consider the challenge of remapping movement-to-space representations in survivors of spinal cord injury , for the control of powered wheelchairs .	Our goal is to facilitate this remapping by developing interfaces between residual body motions and navigational commands that exploit the degrees of freedom that disabled individuals are most capable to coordinate .	The main novelty of this approach lies in substituting the more common joystick controllers of powered wheelchairs with a sensor shirt .
3	In particular , at the terminal time T , the so-called mating pattern Q ( T ) has a multiple hypergeometric distribution .	We propose a new model of permanent monogamous pair formation in zoological populations comprised of k types of females and males , which unifies and generalizes the encounter-mating models of Gimelfarb ( 1988 ) .	In our model , animals randomly encounter members of the opposite sex at their so-called firing times to form temporary pairs which then become permanent if mating happens .	Given the distributions of the firing times and the mating preferences upon encounter , which depend on the sex and the type of the animals , we analyze the contingency table Q ( t ) of permanent pair types at any time t. First , we consider definite mating upon encounter and provide a formula for the distribution of Q ( t ) .	This implies panmixia which means that female and male types are uncorrelated in the expected mating pattern .
0	This paper begins with a simple proof of the existence of squash operators compatible with the Bennett-Brassard 1984 ( BB84 ) protocol which suits single-mode as well as multi-mode threshold detectors .	The proof shows that , when a given detector is symmetric under cyclic group C_4 , and a certain observable associated with it has rank two as a matrix , then there always exists a corresponding squash operator .	Next , we go on to investigate whether the above restriction of `` rank two '' can be eliminated ; i.e. , is cyclic symmetry alone sufficient to guarantee the existence of a squash operator ?	The motivation behind this question is that , if this were true , it would imply that one could realize a device-independent and unconditionally secure quantum key distribution protocol .	However , the answer turns out to be negative , and moreover , one can instead prove a no-go theorem that any symmetry is , by itself , insufficient to guarantee the existence of a squash operator .
4	The aliasing effect of K1 l=3 p=1 tide and SRP ( 4241 ) solar radiation pressure harmonic , with periods longer than 4 years , on the perigee of LAGEOS II yield to a maximum systematic uncertainty on $ \m_ { LT } $ of less than 4 % over different observational periods .	The general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect can be detected by means of a suitable combination of orbital residuals of the laser-ranged LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites .	While this observable is not affected by the orbital perturbation induced by the zonal Earth solid and ocean tides , it is sensitive to those generated by the tesseral and sectorial tides .	The assessment of their influence on the measurement of the parameter mu , with which the gravitomagnetic effect is accounted for , is the goal of this paper .	After simulating the combined residual curve by calculating accurately the mismodeling of the more effective tidal perturbations , it has been found that , while the solid tides affect the recovery of mu at a level always well below 1 % , for the ocean tides and the other long-period signals Delta mu depends strongly on the observational period and the noise level : Delta mu ( tides ) amounts to almost 2 % after 7 years .
3	Other estimates are also obtained which allow us to obtain , in a subsequent paper , a fine characterization of the second critical field .	We consider the Ginzburg-Landau functional defined over a bounded and smooth three dimensional domain .	Supposing that the magnetic field is comparable with the second critical field and that the Ginzburg-Landau parameter is large , we determine a sharp asymptotic estimate of the minimizing energy .	In particular , this shows how bulk superconductivity decreases in average as the applied magnetic field approaches the second critical field from below .	The approach relies on a careful analysis of several limiting energies , which is of independent interest .
2	The springs have equal stiffness but are ruptured randomly when the load reaches a critical value .	We model an interface layer connecting two parts of a solid body by N parallel elastic springs connecting two rigid blocks .	We load the system by a shear force acting on the top side .	For the considered system , we calculate the shear modulus , G , as a function of the order parameter , \phi , describing the state of damage , and also the `` spalled '' material ( burst ) size distribution .	In particular , we evaluate the relation between the damage parameter and the applied force and explore the behaviour in the vicinity of material breakdown .
2	We add both smooth ( Type I/II ) and stochastic migration forces .	The Kepler planet candidates are an interesting testbed for planet formation scenarios .	We present results from N-body simulations of multi-planetary systems that resemble those observed by Kepler .	The observed period ratio distribution is inconsistent with either of those two scenarios on its own .	However , applying both stochastic and smooth migration forces to the planets simultaneously results in a period ratio distribution that is similar to the observed one .
3	The experimental results conform closely to the predictions of quantum theory in such cases , but the most reasonable conclusion to draw is not that locality fails , but rather that the hidden-variable assumption is false .	Experiments motivated by Bell 's theorem have led some physicists to conclude that quantum theory is nonlocal .	However , the theoretical basis for such claims is usually taken to be Bell 's Theorem , which shows only that if certain predictions of quantum theory are correct , and a strong hidden-variable assumption is valid , then a certain locality condition must fail .	This locality condition expresses the idea that what an experimenter freely chooses to measure in one spacetime region can have no effect of any kind in a second region situated spacelike relative to the first .	For this assumption conflicts with the quantum precept that unperformed experiments have no outcomes .
4	The red colours of our systems extend recent work which indicates that merger-triggered AGN in the nearby Universe appear after the peak of the associated starburst , implying that they do not strongly regulate star formation .	Radio AGN in the nearby Universe are more likely to be found in galaxies with early-type morphology , the detection rate in spiral or late-type galaxies ( LTGs ) being around an order of magnitude lower .	We combine the mJy Imaging VLBA Exploration at 20cm ( mJIVE-20 ) survey with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) , to study the relatively rare population of AGN in LTGs that have nuclear radio luminosities similar to that in their early-type counterparts .	The LTG AGN population is preferentially hosted by galaxies that have high stellar masses ( M* & gt ; 10^10.8 MSun ) , red colours and low star-formation rates , with little dependence on the detailed morphology or local environment of the host LTG .	The merger fraction in the LTG AGN is around 4 times higher than that in the general LTG population , indicating that merging is an important trigger for radio AGN in these systems .
2	A significant reinforcement of the intermolecular hydrogen-bond ( H-bond ) , also supported by the observed frequency shifts of the vibration modes , is attributed to the polarization of the donor molecule when bonded to the Ru atoms in the substrate .	Density Functional Theory calculations are used to investigate the role of substrate-induced cooperative effects on the adsorption of water on a partially oxidized transition metal surface , O ( 2x2 ) /Ru ( 0001 ) .	Focussing particularly on the dimer configuration , we analyze the different contributions to its binding energy .	This result is further confirmed by our calculations for a water dimer interacting with a small Ru cluster , which clearly show that the observed effect does not depend critically on fine structural details and/or the presence of co-adsorbates .	Interestingly , the cooperative reinforcement of the H-bond is suppressed when the acceptor molecule , instead of the donor , is bonded to the surface .
4	The continuum emission can be described with a blackbody or a helium white dwarf atmosphere of T_eff ~ 15,000K , in agreement with theoretical cooling models for relatively massive accretors and/or donors .	We present three new candidate AM CVn binaries , plus one confirmed new system , from a spectroscopic survey of color-selected objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .	All four systems were found from their helium emission lines in low-resolution spectra taken on the Hale telescope at Palomar , and the Nordic Optical Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma .	The ultra-compact binary nature of SDSS J090221.35+381941.9 was confirmed using phase-resolved spectroscopy at the Keck-I telescope .	From the characteristic radial velocity `S-wave ' observed in the helium emission lines we measure an orbital period of 48.31 +/- 0.08 min .
0	We report a uniaxial-pressure study on the magnetisation of single crystals of the bilayer perovskite Sr3Ru2O7 , a metamagnet close to a ferromagnetic instability .	We observed that the application of a uniaxial pressure parallel to the c-axis induces ferromagnetic ordering with a Curie temperature of about 80 K and critical pressures of about 4 kbar or higher .	This value for the critical pressure is even higher than the value previously reported ( ~ 1 kbar ) , which might be attributed to the difference of the impurity level .	Below the critical pressure parallel to the c-axis , the metamagnetic field appears to hardly change .	We have also found that uniaxial pressures perpendicular to the c-axis , in contrast , do not induce ferromagnetism , but shift the metamagnetic field to higher fields .
4	Under a convexity hypothesis we show that every zero-dimensional compatible subgroup of G is finitely generated .	We work in the category of locally definable groups in an o-minimal expansion of a field .	Eleftheriou and Peterzil conjectured that every definably generated abelian connected group G in this category is a cover of a definable group .	We prove that this is the case under a natural convexity assumption inspired by the same authors , which in fact gives a necessary and sufficient condition .	The proof is based on the study of the zero-dimensional compatible subgroups of G. Given a locally definable connected group G ( not necessarily definably generated ) , we prove that the n-torsion subgroup of G is finite and that every zero-dimensional compatible subgroup of G has finite rank .
4	The analytical part is made difficult by the absence of a variational structure underlying affine harmonic maps .	We introduce a class of maps from an affine flat into a Riemannian manifold that solve an elliptic system defined by the natural second order elliptic operator of the affine structure and the nonlinear Riemann geometry of the target .	These maps are called affine harmonic .	We show an existence result for affine harmonic maps in a given homotopy class when the target has non positive sectional curvature and some global non triviality condition is met .	An example shows that such a condition is necessary .
4	In studying the Ward identity relating & lt ; J_i^a O^I O^J & gt ; to & lt ; O^I O^J & gt ; for ( non-marginal ) scalar composite operators O^I , we find that there is a subtlety in obtaining the normalization of & lt ; O^I O^J & gt ; from the supergravity action integral .	Conformal techniques are applied to the calculation of integrals on AdS ( d+1 ) space which define correlators of composite operators in the superconformal field theory on the d-dimensional boundary .	The 3-point amplitudes for scalar fields of arbitrary mass and gauge fields in the AdS supergravity are calculated explicitly .	For 3 gauge fields we compare in detail with the known conformal structure of the SU ( 4 ) flavor current correlator & lt ; J_i^a J_j^b J_k^c & gt ; of the N=4 , d=4 SU ( N ) SYM theory .	Results agree with the free field approximation as would be expected from superconformal non-renormalization theorems .
4	Finally , we illustrate our data-driven method in various settings , including examples showing how standard EVT can significantly underestimate quantiles of interest .	We study distributional robustness in the context of Extreme Value Theory ( EVT ) .	As an application , we provide a data-driven method for estimating extreme quantiles in a manner that is robust against incorrect model assumptions underlying the application of the standard Extremal Types Theorem .	Typical studies in distributional robustness involve computing worst case estimates over a model uncertainty region expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy .	We go beyond standard distributional robustness in that we investigate different forms of discrepancies , and prove rigorous results which are helpful for understanding the role of a putative model uncertainty region in the context of extreme quantile estimation .
0	Cellular populations are typically heterogenous collections of cells at different points in their respective cell cycles , each with a cell cycle time that varies from individual to individual .	As a result , true single-cell behavior , particularly that which is cell-cycle -- dependent , is often obscured in population-level ( averaged ) measurements .	We have developed a simple deconvolution method that can be used to remove the effects of asynchronous variability from population-level time-series data .	In this paper , we summarize some recent progress in the development and application of our approach , and provide technical updates that result in increased biological fidelity .	We also explore several preliminary validation results and discuss several ongoing applications that highlight the method 's usefulness for estimating parameters in differential equation models of single-cell gene regulation .
1	Various types of data are analyzed to search for Lorentz violation under the Standard-Model Extension ( SME ) framework , including neutrino oscillation data .	Violation of Lorentz invariance and CPT symmetry is a predicted phenomenon of Planck-scale physics .	MiniBooNE is a short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermilab .	The measured excesses from MiniBooNE can not be reconciled within the neutrino Standard Model ; thus it might be a signal of new physics , such as Lorentz violation .	We have analyzed the sidereal time dependence of MiniBooNE data for signals of the possible breakdown of Lorentz invariance in neutrinos .
4	We also point out that a valence bond solid , and indeed any discrete symmetry breaking state , would be expected to show a constant correction to the entanglement entropy of { \sl opposite } sign to the topological entanglement entropy .	We perform highly accurate density matrix renormalization group ( DMRG ) simulations to investigate the ground state properties of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic square lattice Heisenberg $ J_1 $ - $ J_2 $ model .	Based on studies of numerous long cylinders with circumferences of up to 14 lattice spacings , we obtain strong evidence for a topological quantum spin liquid state in the region $ 0.41\leq J_2/J_1\leq 0.62 $ , separating conventional N\'eel and striped antiferromagnetic states for smaller and larger $ J_2/J_1 $ , respectively .	The quantum spin liquid is characterized numerically by the absence of magnetic or valence bond solid order , and non-zero singlet and triplet energy gaps .	Furthermore , we positively identify its topological nature by measuring a non-zero topological entanglement entropy $ \gamma=0.70\pm 0.02 $ , extremely close to $ \gamma=\ln ( 2 ) \approx 0.69 $ ( expected for a $ Z_2 $ quantum spin liquid ) and a non-trivial finite size dimerization effect depending upon the parity of the circumference of the cylinder .
1	The analysis is based on a large statistics sample of hadronic Z0 decays collected with the OPAL detector at the LEP e+e- collider .	The energy distribution and type of the particle with the highest momentum in quark jets are determined for each of the five quark flavours making only minimal model assumptions .	These results provide a basis for future studies of light flavour production at other centre-of-mass energies .	We use our results to study the hadronisation mechanism in light flavour jets and compare the data to the QCD models JETSET and HERWIG .	Within the JETSET model we also directly determine the suppression of strange quarks to be gamma_s=0.422+-0.049 ( stat .
4	We find that for the aforementioned models , the GSL is satisfied from the early times to the present epoch .	Here , we investigate the growth of matter density perturbations as well as the generalized second law ( GSL ) of thermodynamics in the framework of $ f ( R ) $ -gravity .	We consider a spatially flat FRW universe filled with the pressureless matter and radiation which is enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon with the Hawking temperature .	For some viable $ f ( R ) $ models containing the Starobinsky , Hu-Sawicki , Exponential , Tsujikawa and AB models , we first explore numerically the evolution of some cosmological parameters like the Hubble parameter , the Ricci scalar , the deceleration parameter , the density parameters and the equation of state parameters .	Then , we examine the validity of GSL and obtain the growth factor of structure formation .
3	For single peaks a power law correlation of the height and area with the width is evidenced , however , the mixed nature of fracture gives rise to a crossover between two regimes of different exponents .	We study the statistical features of magnetic noise accompanying the dynamic fracture of steel samples during mixed type fracture , where the overall ductile character of crack propagation is interrupted by a sudden brittle jump .	The structure of the voltage time series is investigated by identifying discrete peaks which correspond to elementary steps of the jerky cracking process .	We show that the height , duration , area , and energy of peaks have power law distributions with exponents falling close to the corresponding values of pure ductile fracture .	The average pulse shape of micro-cracking events has a parabolic form with a right handed asymmetry similarly to quasi-static fracture propagation .
2	Holography lends itself to further develop knowledge with regard to inference optics .	Holography as a subject is neglected largely in current physics lessons and in school books .	Even though this topic might be complex , it is applicable and viable in the world that we live in .	However , misconceptions of students impede the learning process .	Research conducted by our research group shows that problematic perceptions regarding interference optics still exist with physics students at the intermediate level and on occasion are even sustained by illustrations in school books .
2	In Part 1 , we show that , for given system and energy-bath densities of states , s_S ( e ) and s_B ( e ) , thermality does not hold in general , as we illustrate when both increase as powers of energy , but that it does hold in certain approximate senses , in both traditional and modern frameworks , when both grow as exp ( be ) or as exp ( qe^2 ) and we calculate the system entropy in these cases .	It is well-known that a small system weakly coupled to a large energy bath in a total microcanonical ensemble will find itself in an ( approximately ) thermal state and , recently , it has been shown that , if the total state is , instead , a random pure state with energy in a narrow range , then the small system will still be approximately thermal with a high probability ( wrt `Haar measure ' ) .	We ask what conditions are required for something resembling these 'traditional ' and 'modern ' thermality results to still hold when system and energy bath are of comparable size .	In their 'modern ' version , our results rely on new quantities , which we introduce and call the S and B 'modapprox ' density operators , which , we claim , will , with high probability , give a close approximation to the reduced density operator for the system and energy bath when the total state of system plus energy bath is a random pure state with energy in a narrow range .	In Part 2 we clarify the meaning of these modapprox density operators and give arguments for our claim .
4	The octahedral symmetry leads to the four-fold degeneracies in the nucleonic spectra as well but it does preserve the parity .	We present possible manifestations of octahedral and tetrahedral symmetries in nuclei .	These symmetries are associated with the OhD and TdD double point groups .	Both of them have very characteristic finger-prints in terms of the nucleonic level properties - unique in the Fermionic universe .	The tetrahedral symmetry leads to the four-fold degeneracies in the nucleonic spectra ; it does not preserve the parity .
0	The problem of a car following a lead car driven with constant velocity is considered .	To derive the governing equations for the following car dynamics a cost functional that ranks the outcomes of different driving strategies is constructed , which applies to fairly general properties of the driver behavior .	Assuming the driver behavior to be rational , the existence of the Nash equilibrium is proved .	Rational driving is defined by supposing that a driver corrects continuously the car motion to follow the optimal path minimizing the cost functional .	The corresponding car-following dynamics is described quite generally by a boundary value problem based on the obtained extremal equations .
3	This statistical test , commonly called the F ratio , involves calculating the ratio of the external and internal error .	Focusing on B-emission stars , we investigated a set of H $ \alpha $ equivalent widths calculated from observed spectra acquired over a period of about 4 years from 2003 to 2007 .	During this time , changes in equivalent width for our program stars were monitored .	We have found a simple statistical method to quantify these changes in our observations .	We show that the application of this technique can be used to place bounds on the degree of variability of Be stars .
1	To optimize HVAC energy usage , it is important to understand the energy consumption of individual HVAC components at fine granularities .	Heating , Ventilation and Air Conditioning ( HVAC ) systems consume almost half of the total energy use of commercial buildings .	However , buildings typically only have aggregate building level power and thermal meters .	We present HVACMeter , a system which leverages existing sensors in commercial HVAC systems to estimate the energy consumed by individual components of the HVAC system , as well by each thermal zone in buildings .	HVACMeter can be generalized to any HVAC system as it uses the basic understanding of HVAC operation , heat transfer equations , and historical sensor data to estimate energy .
1	The effects of the lattice vibrations on the PDF peak widths are modelled using both a multi-parameter Born von-Karman ( BvK ) force model and a single-parameter Debye model .	The mean-square relative displacements ( MSRD ) of atomic pair motions in crystals are studied as a function of pair distance and temperature using the atomic pair distribution function ( PDF ) .	These results are compared to experimentally determined PDFs .	We find that the near-neighbor atomic motions are strongly correlated , and that the extent of this correlation depends both on the interatomic interactions and crystal structure .	These results suggest that proper account of the lattice vibrational effects on the PDF peak width is important in extracting information on static disorder in a disordered system such as an alloy .
3	In construction of the weights , only an implicit dependence on topologically connected internal coordinates is present .	This article presents a new and efficient alternative to well established algorithms for molecular geometry optimization .	The new approach exploits the approximate decoupling of molecular energetics in a curvilinear internal coordinate system , allowing separation of the 3N-dimensional optimization problem into an O ( N ) set of quasi-independent one-dimensional problems .	Each uncoupled optimization is developed by a weighted least squares fit of energy gradients in the internal coordinate system followed by extrapolation .	This new approach is competitive with the best internal coordinate geometry optimization algorithms in the literature and works well for large biological problems with complicated hydrogen bond networks and ligand binding motifs .
4	For the bounded max-vertex-coloring problem , we show a 17/11-approximation algorithm for bipartite graphs , a PTAS for trees as well as for bipartite graphs when $ b $ is fixed .	In a bounded max-coloring of a vertex/edge weighted graph , each color class is of cardinality at most $ b $ and of weight equal to the weight of the heaviest vertex/edge in this class .	The bounded max-vertex/edge-coloring problems ask for such a coloring minimizing the sum of all color classes ' weights .	In this paper we present complexity results and approximation algorithms for those problems on general graphs , bipartite graphs and trees .	We first show that both problems are polynomial for trees , when the number of colors is fixed , and $ H_b $ approximable for general graphs , when the bound $ b $ is fixed .
1	In a diode laser , the amplitude and the phase of the optical field are coupled by the so-called linewidth enhancement factor , $ \alpha $ .	We probe the physical mechanism behind the known phenomenon of power synchronization of two diode lasers that are mutually coupled via their delayed optical fields .	In this work , we explore the role of optical phases of the electric fields in amplitude ( and hence power ) synchronization through $ \alpha $ in such mutually delay-coupled diode laser systems .	Our numerical results show that the synchronization of optical phases drives the powers of lasers to synchronized death regimes .	We also find that as $ \alpha $ varies for different diode lasers , the system goes through a sequence of in-phase amplitude-death states .
2	The topological properties of coupled chains exhibit nontrivial behaviour as a function of the number of chains beyond the even-odd dichotomy expected from the simple $ \mathbb { Z } _2 $ nature of coupled Majorana states .	Motivated by recent proposals to realize Majorana bound states in chains and arrays of magnetic atoms deposited on top of a superconductor , we study the topological properties of various chain structures , ladders and two-dimensional arrangements exhibiting magnetic helices .	We show that magnetic domain walls where the chirality of a magnetic helix is inverted support two protected Majorana states giving rise to a tunneling conductance peak twice the height of a single Majorana state .	In addition , it is possible that a ladder of two or more coupled chains exhibit Majorana edge states even when decoupled chains are trivial .	We formulate a general criterion for the number of Majorana edge states in multichain ladders and discuss some experimental consequences of our findings .
0	We have implemented the so called GW approximation ( GWA ) based on an all-electron full-potential Projector Augmented Wave ( PAW ) method .	For the screening of the Coulomb interaction W we tested three different plasmon-pole dielectric function models , and showed that the accuracy of the quasiparticle energies is not sensitive to the the details of these models .	We have then applied this new method to compute the quasiparticle band structure of some small , medium and large-band-gap semiconductors : Si , GaAs , AlAs , InP , SiMg $ _2 $ , C and ( insulator ) LiCl .	A special attention was devoted to the convergence of the self-energy with respect to both the { \bf k } -points in the Brillouin zone and to the number of reciprocal space $ \bf G $ -vectors .	The most important result is that although the all-electron GWA improves considerably the quasiparticle band structure of semiconductors , it does not always provide the correct energy band gaps as originally claimed by GWA pseudopotential type of calculations .
2	The key theorem shows that the numerator of the sum of two rational tangles [ P/Q ] and [ R/S ] is unknotted if and only if PS + QR has absolute value equal to 1 .	This paper gives infinitely many examples of unknot diagrams that are hard , in the sense that the diagrams need to be made more complicated by Reidemeister moves before they can be simplified .	In order to construct these diagrams , we prove theorems characterizing when the numerator of the sum of two rational tangles is an unknot .	The paper uses these results in studying processive DNA recombination , finding minimal size unknot diagrams , generalizing to collapses to knots as well as to unknots , and in finding unknots with arbirarily high complexity .	The paper is self-contained , with a review of the theory of rational tangles and a last section on relationships of the theme of the paper with other aspects of topology and number theory .
1	There are , however , many possible mechanisms that can undermine this assumption .	Recent estimates of cosmological parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) anisotropies are based on the assumption that we know the precise amount of energy density in relativistic particles in the universe , $ \omega_ { rel } $ , at all times .	In this paper we investigate the effect that removing this assumption has on the determination of the various cosmological parameters .	We obtain fairly general bounds on the redshift of equality , $ z_ { eq } = \omega_ { m } /\omega_ { rel } =3100_ { -400 } ^ { +600 } $ .	We show that $ \omega_ { rel } $ is nearly degenerate with the amount of energy in matter , $ \omega_m $ , and that its inclusion in CMB parameter estimation also affects the present constraints on other parameters such as the curvature or the scalar spectral index of primordial fluctuations .
2	A development period of almost 10 years has resulted in pixel detector modules which can stand the extreme rate and timing requirements as well as the very harsh radiation environment at the LHC for its full life time and without severe compromises in performance .	To detect tracks of charged particles close to the interaction point in high energy physics experiments of the next generation colliders , hybrid pixel detectors , in which sensor and read-out IC are separate entities , constitute the present state of the art in detector technology .	Three of the LHC detectors as well as the BTeV detector at the Tevatron will use vertex detectors based on this technology .	From these developments a number of different applications have spun off , most notably for biomedical imaging .	Beyond hybrid pixels , a number of trends and possibilities with yet improved performance in some aspects have appeared and presently developed to greater maturity .
0	The detection of a mm/Sub-mm `` bump '' in Sgr A* 's radio spectrum suggests that at least a portion of its overall emission is produced within a compact accretion torus .	This inference is strengthened by observations of strong linear polarization ( at the 10 percent level ) within this bump .	No linear polarization has been detected yet at other wavelengths .	Given that radiation from this source is produced on progressively smaller spatial scales with increasing frequency , the mm/Sub-mm bump apparently arises within a mere handful of Schwarzschild radii of the black hole .	We have found that a small ( 10-Schwarzschild-radii ) magnetized accretion torus can not only account for the spectral bump via thermal synchrotron processes , but that it can also reproduce the corresponding polarimetric results .
1	Specifically , we establish new asymptotic properties of the particular Wright function \ [ { } _1\Psi_1 ( \rho , k ; \rho,0 ; x ) = \sum_ { n=0 } ^\infty\frac { \Gamma ( k+\rho n ) } { \Gamma ( \rho n ) } \ , \frac { x^n } { n !	This analysis paper presents previously unknown properties of some special cases of the Wright function whose consideration is necessitated by our work on probability theory and the theory of stochastic processes .	} \qquad ( |x| & lt ; \infty ) \ ] when the parameter $ \rho\in ( -1,0 ) \cup ( 0 , \infty ) $ and the argument $ x $ is real .	In the probability theory applications , which are focused on studies of the Poisson-Tweedie mixtures , the parameter $ k $ is a non-negative integer .	Several representations involving well-known special functions are given for certain particular values of $ \rho $ .
4	As input , we use calculations of the atom-dimer scattering phase shifts from effective field theory .	Three-body systems with large scattering length display universal phenomena associated with a discrete scaling symmetry .	These phenomena include resonant enhancement of three-body loss rates when an Efimov three-body resonance is at the scattering threshold .	In particular , there can be resonant peaks in the atom-dimer relaxation rate for large positive scattering length .	We improve upon earlier studies and calculate the atom-dimer relaxation rate as a function of temperature using a Bose-Einstein distribution for the thermal average .
3	Inspired by work in quantum information theory , we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of question .	Resources and their use and consumption form a central part of our life .	Many branches of science and engineering are concerned with the question of which given resource objects can be converted into which target resource objects .	For example , information theory studies the conversion of a noisy communication channel instance into an exchange of information .	The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility of combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered commutative monoids .
0	We construct efficient banks of templates suitable for directed searches of almost monochromatic gravitational waves originating from spinning nuetron stars in our Galaxy in data being collected by currently operating interferometric detectors .	We thus assume that the position of the gravitational-wave source in the sky is known , but we do not assume that the wave 's frequency and its derivatives are a priori known .	In the construction we employ simplified model of the signal with constant amplitude and phase which is a polynomial function of time .	All our template banks enable usage of the fast Fourier transform algorithm in the computation of the maximum-likelihood F-statistic for nodes of the grids defining the bank .	We study and employ the dependence of the grid 's construction on the choice of the position of the observational interval with respect to the origin of time axis .
2	It says that any program that is cleverer than a human being , is acknowledged as Artificial Intelligence .	Two different definitions of the Artificial Intelligence concept have been proposed in papers [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] .	The first definition is informal .	The second definition is formal because it avoids reference to the concept of human being .	The readers of papers [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] might be left with the impression that both definitions are equivalent and the definition in [ 2 ] is simply a formal version of that in [ 1 ] .
2	In order to construct a delay-constrained multicast routing tree , average distance heuristic ( ADH ) algorithm is analyzed firstly .	Multicast is the ability of a communication network to accept a single message from an application and to deliver copies of the message to multiple recipients at different location .	With the development of Internet , Multicast is widely applied in all kinds of multimedia real-time application : distributed multimedia systems , collaborative computing , video-conferencing , distance education , etc .	Then a delay-constrained algorithm called DCADH ( delay-constrained average distance heuristic ) is presented .	By using ADH a least cost multicast routing tree can be constructed ; if the path delay ca n't meet the delay upper bound , a shortest delay path which is computed by Dijkstra algorithm will be merged into the existing multicast routing tree to meet the delay upper bound .
2	We prove that for a convex function f the expectation E^ { t ( r ) } ( f ) is a convex function of the parameter r. Along the way we develop correlation inequalities for convex functions .	Take a random variable X with some finite exponential moments .	Define an exponentially weighted expectation by E^t ( f ) = E ( e^ { tX } f ) /E ( e^ { tX } ) for admissible values of the parameter t. Denote the weighted expectation of X itself by r ( t ) = E^t ( X ) , with inverse function t ( r ) .	Motivation for this result comes from equilibrium investigations of some stochastic interacting systems with stationary product distributions .	In particular , convexity of the hydrodynamic flux function follows in some cases .
2	We find that D is mainly sensitive to the trilinear A coupling in the squark sector and to the phase of the coefficient \mu which mixes the two Higgs superfields .	We investigate the violation of time reversal invariance in the decay of the free neutron in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ( MSSM ) .	The coefficient of the triple product of the neutron spin and the momenta of electron and neutrino , the so called D parameter , is computed at one loop order including all diagrams .	The maximal MSSM contribution using parameters still allowed by experiment is however at D \approx 10^ { -7 } , while QED final state interactions give a value of D_ { fsi } = - 2.3 * 10^ { -5 } .	Explicit expressions for all relevant diagrams are given in an Appendix .
4	We also present the measurement of $ v_2 $ for identified $ \pi^ { \pm } $ and ( anti ) protons in central $ d $ $ + $ Au collisions , and observe a mass-ordering pattern similar to that seen in heavy ion collisions .	We present azimuthal angular correlations between charged hadrons and energy deposited in calorimeter towers in central $ d $ $ + $ Au and minimum bias $ p $ $ + $ $ p $ collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { _ { NN } } } =200 $ GeV .	The charged hadron is measured at midrapidity $ |\eta| & lt ; 0.35 $ , and the energy is measured at large rapidity ( $ -3.7 & lt ; \eta & lt ; -3.1 $ , Au-going direction ) .	An enhanced near-side angular correlation across $ |\Delta\eta| & gt ; $ 2.75 is observed in $ d $ $ + $ Au collisions .	Using the event plane method applied to the Au-going energy distribution , we extract the anisotropy strength $ v_2 $ for inclusive charged hadrons at midrapidity up to $ p_T=4.5 $ GeV/ $ c $ .
2	The finite set of system plus environment degrees of freedom are then explicitly followed in time leading to a quasi-exact description .	An approach , called discretized environment method , is introduced to treat exactly non-Markovian effects in open quantum systems .	In this approach , a complex environment described by a spectral function is mapped into a finite set of discretized states with an appropriate coupling to the system of interest .	The present approach is anticipated to be particularly accurate in the low temperature and strongly non-Markovian regime .	The discretized environment method is validated on a two-level system ( qubit ) coupled to a bosonic or fermionic heat bath .
2	The main uncertainty in each limit is the value of the top mass , which is now constrained by the Fermilab results .	Vacuum stability and metastability imply lower limits on the mass of the higgs boson in the Standard Model ( SM ) .	In contrast , we present an improved calculation of an upper limit on the lightest higgs mass in supersymmetric ( susy ) models , by summing to all orders in perturbation theory the leading and next -- to -- leading logarithms with a renormalization group equation technique , and by including finite two-loop QCD corrections.The improvement lowers the Minimal Susy Standard Model ( MSSM ) upper limit by about 10 GeV .	We study the possibility that these bounds do not overlap , and find that ( i ) a mass gap emerges between the SM and the MSSM at $ m_t\sim 175 $ GeV for $ \alpha_s ( M_Z^2 ) =0.118 $ and at $ m_t \sim 180 $ GeV for more generous values $ \sim ( 0.130 ) $ of $ \alpha_s $ ; and between the SM and the Minimal plus Singlet Susy Model [ ( M+1 ) SSM ] if the independent scalar self -- coupling of the latter is perturbatively small or if the $ \tan\beta $ parameter is large ; these gaps widen with increasing $ m_t $ ; ( ii ) the mass gap emerges with $ m_t $ 10 GeV lighter if only vacuum stability and not metastability is imposed ; ( iii ) there is no overlap between the SM and the MSSM bounds at even smaller values of $ m_t $ for the $ \tan\beta $ value ( $ \sim 1 $ -- 2 ) preferred in Supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories .	Thus , a measurement of the first higgs mass will serve to exclude either the MSSM/ ( M+1 ) SSM higgs sectors or the SM higgs sector .
4	Nevertheless , understand in the framework of thermodynamics how myosin motor works in principle is impossible : it is smoothly heated device cyclically producing mechanical work ( second law ) .	Myosin motor is the machine , which performs mechanical work in the course of adenosine triphosphate molecule hydrolysis and myosin head conformations accompanying this process .	For displacement of individual fragments of large molecule relative to each other to arise and work to be performed , force must be born inside protein .	What kind of interaction generates this force ?	Models based on Huxley 1957 theory ascertain relations between chemical reactions rate constants and energies of crossbridge conformations .
2	To our knowledge such a systematic comparison has never been previously reported .	A new finite volume ( FV ) discretisation method for the Lattice Boltzmann ( LB ) equation which combines high accuracy with limited computational cost is presented .	In order to assess the performance of the FV method we carry out a systematic comparison , focused on accuracy and computational performances , with the standard $ streaming $ ( ST ) Lattice Boltzmann equation algorithm .	In particular we aim at clarifying whether and in which conditions the proposed algorithm , and more generally any FV algorithm , can be taken as the method of choice in fluid-dynamics LB simulations .	For this reason the comparative analysis is further extended to the case of realistic flows , in particular thermally driven flows in turbulent conditions .
2	One candidate from this category of waveforms is pulse shaped OFDM , which follows the idea of subcarrier filtering and fully maintain the compatibility of CP-OFDM .	OFDM-based waveforms with filtering functionalities are considered key enablers for a flexible air-interface design for multi-service support in future mobile systems .	By allowing for the flexible configuration of physical layer parameters according to the diverse requirements of a service , these waveforms enable the in-band coexistence of different services .	Exploiting pulse shape as an additional degree of freedom in OFDM systems can be beneficially used to improve the systems robustness against time and frequency distortions and to efficiently facilitate spectrum sharing or fragmented spectrum access .	In this paper , we investigate the OFDM pulse shaping problem and propose new pulse shape design methods .
0	Given a real-valued function $ f $ defined over a manifold $ M $ embedded in $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ , we are interested in recovering structural information about $ f $ from the sole information of its values on a finite sample $ P $ .	Existing methods provide approximation to the persistence diagram of $ f $ when geometric noise and functional noise are bounded .	However , they fail in the presence of aberrant values , also called outliers , both in theory and practice .	We propose a new algorithm that deals with outliers .	We handle aberrant functional values with a method inspired from the k-nearest neighbors regression and the local median filtering , while the geometric outliers are handled using the distance to a measure .
3	It is also established that nuclear spins can dominate spin relaxation for unpolarized triplets even at high magnetic fields , contrary to common belief .	A global quantitative picture of the phonon-induced two-electron spin relaxation in GaAs double quantum dots is presented using highly accurate numerical calculations .	Wide regimes of interdot coupling , magnetic field magnitude and orientation , and detuning are explored in the presence of a nuclear bath .	Most important , the unusually strong magnetic anisotropy of the singlet-triplet relaxation can be controlled by detuning switching the principal anisotropy axes : a protected state becomes unprotected upon detuning , and vice versa .	These findings are central to designing quantum dots geometries for spin-based quantum information processing with minimal environmental impact .
2	Both relativistic and non-relativistic versions are discussed .	We demonstrate that the 1D cylindrical version of the Grad-Shafranov equation is more rich than classical self-similar ones , and more suitable for the astrophysical jets we observe .	In particular , it allows us to describe the central ( and , hence , the most energetic ) part of the flow .	It is shown that taking into account the finite pressure of the external media one can determine the magnetic flux within the central core .	We found as well that for non-relativistic flows which are magnetically dominated near the origin the solution can be constructed only in the presense of the oblique shock near the base of a jet where the additional heating is to take place .
3	Heat can not accumulate on the polar cap region due to the large thermal conductivity on the bare quark surface .	The possibility and the implications of the idea , that pulsars are born as strange stars , are explored .	Strange stars are very likely to have atmospheres with typical mass of $ \sim 5\times 10^ { -15 } M_\odot $ but bare polar caps almost throughout their lifetimes , if they are produced during supernova explosions .	A direct consequence of the bare polar cap is that the binding energies of both positively and negatively charged particles at the bare quark surface are nearly infinity , so that the vacuum polar gap sparking scenario as proposed by Ruderman & amp ; Sutherland should operate above the cap , regardless of the sense of the magnetic pole with respect to the rotational pole .	We test this `` bare polar cap strange star '' ( BPCSS ) idea with the present broad band emission data of pulsars , and propose several possible criteria to distinguish BPCSSs from neutron stars .
0	Time evolution of a `` little bang '' created in heavy ion collisions can be divided into two phases , the pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic .	At what moment the evolution becomes hydrodynamic and is there any universality in the hydrodynamic flow ?	To answer these questions we briefly discuss various versions of hydrodynamics and their applicability conditions .	In particular , we elaborate on the idea of `` universal '' ( all-order resumed ) hydrodynamics and propose a simple new model for it .	The model is motivated by results obtained recently via the AdS/CFT correspondence .
1	All $ ~\alpha_ { s } ~ $ corrections to the leading logarithmic approximation ( LLA ) are included .	A new representation of the next to leading QCD corrections to the nucleon structure functions is given in terms of parton distributions .	In contrast to the similar representations in the literature terms of order $ ~O ( \alpha_ { s } ^ { 2 } ) ~ $ do not attend in our expressions for the nucleon structure functions taken in the next to leading logarithmic approximation .	This result is generelized for any order in $ ~\alpha_ { s } ~ $ beyond the LLA .	Terms of order $ ~O ( \alpha^ { n } _ { s } ) ~ $ which belong only to the approximation in consideration are present in such a representation for the structure functions .
3	$ W $ -generalized elliptic and parabolic equations are also established , along with results on existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of such equations .	Fix strictly increasing right continuous functions with left limits $ W_i : \bb R \to \bb R $ , $ i=1 , ... , d $ , and let $ W ( x ) = \sum_ { i=1 } ^d W_i ( x_i ) $ for $ x\in\bb R^d $ .	We construct the $ W $ -Sobolev spaces , which consist of functions $ f $ having weak generalized gradients $ \nabla_W f = ( \partial_ { W_1 } f , ... , \partial_ { W_d } f ) $ .	Several properties , that are analogous to classical results on Sobolev spaces , are obtained .	Homogenization results of suitable random operators are investigated .
2	Phase portraits and nature of fixed points are studied .	The motion of a bead on a rotating circular hoop is investigated using elementary calculus and simple symmetry arguments .	The peculiar trajectories of the bead at different speeds of rotation of the hoop are presented .	Bifurcation is observed with change in the rotational speed of the hoop .	At a critical speed of rotation of the hoop , there appears an interesting relation between the time period and amplitude of oscillation of the bead .
0	The results of an Halpha photometric survey of 30 dwarf galaxies of various morphologies in the Centaurus A and Sculptor groups are presented .	Of these 30 , emission was detected in 13 : eight are of late-type , two are early-type and three are of mixed-morphology .	The typical flux detection limit of 2e-16 erg s-1 cm-2 , translates into a Star Formation Rate ( SFR ) detection limit of 4e-6 M_sol yr-1 .	In the light of these results , the morphology-density relation is reexamined : It is shown that , despite a number of unaccounted parameters , there are significant correlations between the factors determining the morphological type of a galaxy and its environment .	Dwarf galaxies in high density regions have lower current SFR and lower neutral gas content than their low density counterparts , confirming earlier results from the Local Group and other denser environments .
1	We carry out several investigations to determine whether GW150914 is consistent with a binary black-hole merger in general relativity .	The LIGO detection of GW150914 provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the large velocity , highly nonlinear regime , and to witness the final merger of the binary and the excitation of uniquely relativistic modes of the gravitational field .	We find that the final-remnant 's mass and spin , determined from the inspiral and post-inspiral phases of the signal , are mutually consistent with the binary black-hole solution in general relativity .	The data following the peak of GW150914 are consistent with the least-damped quasi-normal-mode inferred from the mass and spin of the remnant black hole .	By using waveform models that allow for parameterized general-relativity violations during the inspiral and merger phases , we perform quantitative tests on the gravitational-wave phase in the dynamical regime and , bound , for the first time several high-order post-Newtonian coefficients .
4	Necessary and sufficient conditions are developed for the Cuntz-Krieger C*-algebras of row-finite higher-rank graphs to be liminal and to be postliminal .	This dissertation concerns the classification of groupoid and higher-rank graph C*-algebras and has two main components .	Firstly , for a groupoid it is shown that the notions of strength of convergence in the orbit space and measure-theoretic accumulation along the orbits are equivalent ways of realising multiplicity numbers associated to a sequence of induced representations of the groupoid C*-algebra .	Examples of directed graphs are given , showing how to determine the multiplicity numbers associated to various sequences of induced representations of the directed graph C*-algebras .	The second component of this dissertation uses path groupoids to develop various characterisations of the C*-algebras of higher-rank graphs .
3	However , for the PV coupling , only a modest increase in the effective mass is observed .	In this work , dispersion relations of $ \pi^0 $ and $ \pi^ { \pm } $ have been studied in vacuum in the limit of weak external magnetic field using a phenomenological pion-nucleon $ ( \pi N ) $ Lagrangian .	For our purpose , we have calculated the results up to one loop order in self energy diagrams with the pseudoscalar $ ( PS ) $ and pseudovector $ ( PV ) $ pion-nucleon interactions .	By assuming weak external magnetic field it is seen that the effective mass of pion gets explicit magnetic field dependence and it is modified significantly for the case of PS coupling .	These modified dispersion relations due to the presence of the external field can have substantial influence in the phenomenological aspect of the mesons both in the context of neutron stars as well as relativistic heavy ion collisions .
4	With all the technologies available in marketing research , businesses still struggle with how to gather information and make decisions in a short time and real-time about their customers ' needs and purchasing patterns in various geographical areas .	Maintaining competitive advantage is significant in this present day of globalization , knowledge management and enormous economic activities .	An organization 's future developments are influenced by its managements ' decisions .	Businesses today are facing a lot of challenges in terms of competition and they have to be in the lead by strengthening their research and development strategies with the aid of cutting edge technologies .	Hence marketing intelligence is now a key to the success of any business in today 's rapidly changing business environment .
1	The sample contains type-1 and type-2 AGN in the form of quasars and radio galaxies , and spans a large range in both optical and radio luminosity .	We present an analysis of a large sample of AGN environments at z~1 using stacked Spitzer data at 3.6um .	We find , on average , that 2 to 3 massive galaxies containing a substantial evolved stellar population lie within a 200-300 kpc radius of the AGN , constituting a & gt ; 8-sigma excess relative to the field .	Secondly , we find evidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radio luminosity of AGN , but not with black-hole mass .	This is shown first by dividing the AGN into their classical AGN types , where we see more significant over-densities in the fields of the radio-loud AGN .
3	The main theorem in this paper states that if $ p ( x_1 , ... , x_n ) $ is a homogeneous { \bf H-Stable } polynomial of degree $ n $ with nonnegative coefficients ; $ deg_ { p } ( i ) $ is the maximum degree of the variable $ x_i $ , $ C_i = \min ( deg_ { p } ( i ) , i ) $ and $ $ Cap ( p ) = \inf_ { x_i & gt ; 0 , 1 \leq i \leq n } \frac { p ( x_1 , ... , x_n ) } { x_1 ... x_n } $ $ then the following inequality holds $ $ \frac { \partial^n } { \partial x_1 ... \partial x_n } p ( 0 , ... ,0 ) \geq Cap ( p ) \prod_ { 2 \leq i \leq n } ( \frac { C_i -1 } { C_i } ) ^ { C_ { i } -1 } .	Let $ p $ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree $ n $ in $ n $ variables , $ p ( z_1 , ... , z_n ) = p ( Z ) $ , $ Z \in C^ { n } $ .	We call such a polynomial $ p $ { \bf H-Stable } if $ p ( z_1 , ... , z_n ) \neq 0 $ provided the real parts $ Re ( z_i ) & gt ; 0 , 1 \leq i \leq n $ .	This notion from { \it Control Theory } is closely related to the notion of { \it Hyperbolicity } used intensively in the { \it PDE } theory .	$ $ This inequality is a vast ( and unifying ) generalization of the Van der Waerden conjecture on the permanents of doubly stochastic matrices as well as the Schrijver-Valiant conjecture on the number of perfect matchings in $ k $ -regular bipartite graphs .
4	Above 65 MeV Coulomb effects can be observed only in specific observables as for example $ T_ { 21 } $ .	N-d elastic scattering is studied at different energies using one of the modern NN interactions , the Argonne v_ { 18 } which explicitly includes the magnetic moment interaction between two nucleons .	This interaction , which has been often neglected in the description of the few-nucleon continuum , produces sizable modifications in some elastic observables .	Its effects , as well as those produced by the Coulomb potential , are analyzed as a function of energy .	The magnetic moment interaction produces appreciable effects in $ p-d $ scattering at low energies butthey are very small above 10 MeV .
3	The paper gives Lyapunov-type sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of nonlinear networked systems .	This paper studies the stability of sampled and networked control systems with sampling and communication times governed by probabilistic clocks .	The clock models have few restrictions , and can be used to model numerous phenomena such as deterministic sampling , jitter , and transmission times of packet dropping networks .	Moreover , the stability theory can be applied to an arbitrary number of clocks with different distributions , operating asynchronously .	For linear systems , the paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for exponential mean square stability , based on linear matrix inequalities .
2	Depending on the particular time at which the final flash occurs , the entire hydrogen envelope may be burned .	About a quarter of all post-asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) stars are hydrogen-deficient .	Stellar evolutionary models explain the carbon-dominated H-deficient stars by a ( very ) late thermal pulse scenario where the hydrogen-rich envelope is mixed with the helium-rich intershell layer .	In contrast , helium-dominated post-AGB stars and their evolution are yet not understood .	A small group of very hot , helium-dominated stars is formed by O ( He ) -type stars .
3	The size of the Next to Leading Order corrections is extensively discussed .	The decay $ B \to X_s \gamma $ is studied at the Next to Leading Order in QCD in a class of models containing at least two Higgs doublets and with only one charged Higgs boson non-decoupled at low-energy .	The two-loop matching condition is calculated and it is found to agree with existing results .	The complete dependence of the Wilson coefficients on the matching scale is given .	Results for branching ratios , possible CP asymmetries and lower bounds on the charged Higgs mass are presented when the convergence of the perturbative series appears fast enough to yield reliable predictions .
0	We present first ab initio no-core shell model ( NCSM ) calculations using similarity renormalization group ( SRG ) transformed chiral two-nucleon ( NN ) plus three-nucleon ( 3N ) interactions for nuclei throughout the p-shell , particularly 12-C and 16-O .	By introducing an adaptive importance truncation for the NCSM model space and an efficient JT-coupling scheme for the 3N matrix elements , we are able to surpass previous NCSM studies including 3N interactions regarding , both , particle number and model-space size .	We present ground and excited states in 12-C and 16-O for model spaces up to N_max=12 including full 3N interactions , which is sufficient to obtain converged results for soft SRG-transformed interactions .	We analyze the contributions of induced and initial 3N interactions and probe induced 4N terms through the sensitivity of the energies on the SRG flow parameter .	Unlike for light p-shell nuclei , SRG-induced 4N contributions originating from the long-range two-pion terms of the chiral 3N interaction are sizable in 12-C and 16-O .
0	Stochastic treatments of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy require evaluations of functions like & lt ; exp ( i int_0^t Q ( s ) ds ) & gt ; , where t is time , Q ( s ) is the value of a stochastic process at time s , and the angular brackets denote ensemble averaging .	This paper gives an exact evaluation of these functions for the case where Q is a continuous-time random walk process .	The continuous time random walk describes an environment that undergoes slow , step-like changes in time .	It also has a well-defined Gaussian limit , and so allows for non-Gaussian and Gaussian stochastic dynamics to be studied within a single framework .	We apply the results to extract qubit-lattice interaction parameters from dephasing data of P-doped Si semiconductors ( data collected elsewhere ) , and to calculate the two-dimensional spectrum of a three level harmonic oscillator undergoing random frequency modulations .
4	In between there is a phase-separated region .	In a dipolar Fermi gas , the dipole-dipole interaction between fermions can be turned into a dipolar Ising interaction between pseduospins in the presence of an AC electric field .	When trapped in a 2D optical lattice , such a dipolar Fermi gas has a very rich phase diagram at zero temperature , due to the competition between antiferromagnetism and superfluidity .	At half filling , the antiferromagnetic state is the favored ground state .	The superfluid state appears as the ground state at a smaller filling factor .
0	We consider a system of two coupled parabolic PDEs introduced in [ 1 ] to model motility of eukaryotic cells .	We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions in the limit of a small parameter related to the width of the interface in phase field function ( sharp interface limit ) .	We formally derive an equation of motion of the interface , which is mean curvature motion with an additional nonlinear term .	In a 1D model parabolic problem we rigorously justify the sharp interface limit .	To this end , a special form of asymptotic expansion is introduced to reduce analysis to a single nonlinear PDE .
4	It is found that , once fluctuations are incorporated , the chiral restoration transition for pure neutron matter is shifted to high densities , much beyond three times the density of normal nuclear matter .	The chiral nucleon-meson model , previously applied to systems with equal number of neutrons and protons , is extended to asymmetric nuclear matter .	Fluctuations are included in the framework of the functional renormalization group .	The equation of state for pure neutron matter is studied and compared to recent advanced many-body calculations .	The chiral condensate in neutron matter is computed as a function of baryon density .
1	In the simplest inflationary models , the distribution of CMB temperature fluctuations should be Gaussian .	Recent Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) observations indicate that the temperature anisotropies arise from quantum fluctuations in the inflationary scenario .	However , non-Gaussian signatures can be present .	They might have different origins and thus different statistical and morphological characteristics .	In this context and motivated by recent and future CMB experiments , we search for , and discriminate between , different non-Gaussian signatures .
1	Our method is based on evolution equations in time , which can be cast in a form extremely convenient for fast numerical evaluations .	A new computational scheme for the nonlinear cosmological matter power spectrum ( PS ) is presented .	A nonlinear PS is obtained in a time comparable to that needed for a simple 1-loop computation , and the numerical implementation is very simple .	Our results agree with N-body simulations at the percent level in the BAO range of scales , and at the few-percent level up to $ k ~ 1 $ h/Mpc at $ z & gt ; = 0.5 $ , thereby opening the possibility of applying this tool to scales interesting for weak lensing .	We clarify the approximations inherent to this approach as well as its relations to previous ones , such as the Time Renormalization Group , and the multi-point propagator expansion .
0	We study homomorphisms of locally compact quantum groups from the point of view of integrability of the associated action .	For a given homomorphism of quantum groups $ \Pi\colon\mathbb { H } \to\mathbb { G } $ we introduce quantum groups $ \mathbb { H } /\ ! \ker { \Pi } $ and $ \overline { \mathrm { im } \ , \Pi } $ corresponding to the classical quotient by kernel and closure of image .	We show that if the action of $ \mathbb { H } $ on $ \mathbb { G } $ associated to $ \Pi $ is integrable then $ \mathbb { H } /\ ! \ker\Pi\cong\overline { \mathrm { im } \ , \Pi } $ and characterize such $ \Pi $ .	As a particular case we consider an injective continuous homomorphism $ \Pi\colon { H } \to { G } $ between locally compact groups $ H $ and $ G $ .	Then $ \Pi $ yields an integrable action of $ H $ on $ L^\infty\ ; \ ! \ !
2	Hence outside information is detected inside the cloak .	We demonstrate in this letter a unique approach for watching outside while hiding in a carpet cloaking based on transformation optics .	Unlike conventional carpet cloaking , which screens all the incident electromagnetic waves , we break the cloak and allow incident light get into the carpet .	To recover the invisible cloaking , complementary techniques are applied in the broken space .	Consequently , a hiding-inside-and-watching-outside ( HIWO ) carpet cloak is sewed , which works as a perfectly invisible cloaking and allows surveillance of the outside at the same time .
1	The target SMGs were originally discovered in the JCMT/AzTEC 1.1 mm continuum survey at S/N=4-4.5 .	We used the PdBI to map a sample of 15 SMGs in the COSMOS field at the wavelength of 1.3 mm .	This paper presents , for the first time , interferometric millimetre-wavelength observations of these sources .	The angular resolution of our observations , 1.8 '' , allowed us to accurately determine the positions of the target SMGs .	Using a detection threshold of S/N & gt ; 4.5 regardless of multiwavelength counterpart association , and 4 & lt ; S/N & lt ; =4.5 if a multiwavelength counterpart within 1.5 '' is also present , the total number of detections in our survey is 22 .
3	$ T_c $ ) factors completely boundedly through a row ( resp .	We prove several versions of Grothendieck 's Theorem for completely bounded linear maps $ T\colon E \to F^* $ , when E and F are operator spaces .	We prove that if E , F are $ C^* $ -algebras , of which at least one is exact , then every completely bounded $ T\colon E \to F^* $ can be factorized through the direct sum of the row and column Hilbert operator spaces .	Equivalently T can be decomposed as $ T=T_r+T_c $ where $ T_r $ ( resp .	column ) Hilbert operator space .
0	High- $ T_c $ cuprates differ from conventional superconductors in three crucial aspects : the superconducting state descends from a strongly correlated Mott-Hubbard insulator , the order parameter exhibits d-wave symmetry and superconducting fluctuations play an all important role .	We formulate a theory of the pseudogap state in the cuprates by taking the advantage of these unusual features .	The effective low energy theory within the pseudogap phase is shown to be equivalent to the ( anisotropic ) quantum electrodynamics in ( 2+1 ) space-time dimensions ( QED $ _3 $ ) .	The role of Dirac fermions is played by the nodal BdG quasiparticles while the massless gauge field arises through unbinding of quantum vortex-antivortex degrees of freedom .	A detailed derivation of this QED $ _3 $ theory is given and some of its main physical consequences are inferred for the pseudogap state .
2	Under this perspective , a geometric approach is feasible , which prompts intuition and facilitates tuning the error sources .	Within path sampling framework , we show that probability distribution divergences , such as the Chernoff information , can be estimated via thermodynamic integration .	The Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution pertaining to different Hamiltonians is implemented to derive tempered transitions along the path , linking the distributions of interest at the endpoints .	Additionally , there are direct applications in Bayesian model evaluation .	Existing marginal likelihood and Bayes factor estimators are reviewed here along with their stepping-stone sampling analogues .
2	It also features bright GeV gamma-ray emission and extended X-ray radiation .	Globular clusters are old stellar systems which exhibit very-high stellar densities in their cores .	The globular cluster Terzan 5 is characterized by a high stellar encounter rate and hosts the largest detected population of millisecond pulsars .	However , no globular clusters have been detected in very-high-energy gamma rays ( VHE , E & gt ; 100 GeV ) so far .	In order to investigate this possibility Terzan 5 has been observed with the H.E.S.S .
1	Due to the shape of the jet pump , there will exist an asymmetry in the hydrodynamic end effects which will cause a time-averaged pressure drop to occur that can be used to cancel Gedeon streaming in a closed-loop thermoacoustic device .	A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model is used to predict the oscillatory flow through a tapered cylindrical tube section ( jet pump ) placed in a larger outer tube .	The performance of two jet pump geometries with different taper angles is investigated .	A specific time-domain impedance boundary condition is implemented in order to simulate traveling acoustic wave conditions .	It is shown that by scaling the acoustic displacement amplitude to the jet pump dimensions , similar minor losses are observed independent of the jet pump geometry .
0	A fraction of AGN producing VHE gamma-rays are located in galaxy clusters .	The magnetic field present in the intra-cluster medium would lead to conversions of VHE photons into axion-like particles ( ALPs ) , which are a generic prediction of several extensions of the Standard Model .	ALPs produced in this way would traverse cosmological distances unaffected by the extragalactic background light at variance with VHE photons which undergo a substantial absorption .	Eventually , a nontrivial fraction of ALPs would re-convert into VHE photons in the magnetic field of the Milky Way .	This mechanism produces a significant hardening of the VHE spectrum of AGN in galaxy clusters .
4	The package is publicly available as part of the Cmbeasy software at www.cmbeasy.org .	We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation and data analysis package for the cosmological computation package Cmbeasy .	We have taken special care in implementing an adaptive step algorithm for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo in order to improve convergence .	Data analysis routines are provided which allow to test models of the Universe against up-to-date measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background , Supernovae Ia and Large Scale Structure .	The observational data is provided with the software for convenient usage .
0	The spin Hall effect and its inverse play key roles in spintronic devices since they allow conversion of charge currents to and from spin currents .	The conversion efficiency strongly depends on material details , such as the electronic band structure and the nature of impurities .	Here we show an anomaly in the inverse spin Hall effect in weak ferromagnetic NiPd alloys near their Curie temperatures with a shape independent of material details , such as Ni concentrations .	By extending Kondo 's model for the anomalous Hall effect , we explain the observed anomaly as originating from the second-order nonlinear spin fluctuation of Ni moments .	This brings to light an essential symmetry difference between the spin Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect which reflects the first order nonlinear fluctuations of local moments .
2	We find that spin-state-changing collisions are suppressed by Wigner 's threshold laws as long as the asymptotic Zeeman splitting between incident and final states does not exceed the height of the centrifugal barrier in the exit channel .	We investigate the collisional stability of magnetically trapped ultracold molecules , taking into account the influence of magnetic fields .	We compute elastic and spin-state-changing inelastic rate constants for collisions of the prototype molecule $ ^ { 17 } $ O $ _2 $ with a $ ^3 $ He buffer gas as a function of the magnetic field and the translational collision energy .	In addition , we propose a useful one-parameter fitting formula that describes the threshold behavior of the inelastic rates as a function of the field and collision energy .	Results show a semi-quantitative agreement of this formula with the full quantum calculations , and suggest useful applications also to different systems .
1	Whereas the appearing representations at levels 0 and 1 are known on general grounds , higher level representations can currently only be obtained by recursive methods .	The Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra E11 , obtained by doubly overextending the compact E8 , is decomposed into representations of its canonical hyperbolic E10 subalgebra .	We present the results of such an analysis up to height 120 in E11 which comprises representations on the first five levels .	The algorithms used are a combination of Weyl orbit methods and standard methods based on the Peterson and Freudenthal formulae .	In the appendices we give all multiplicities of E10 occuring up to height 340 and for E11 up to height 240 .
3	Transitions into classical-like states can be triggered by a single particle with help of the thermal bath .	A quantum many-body model is presented with features similar to those of certain particle detectors .	The energy spectrum contains a single metastable 'ready'-state and macroscopically-distinct 'pointer ' states .	Measurements do not pose paradoxes or require interventions outside the field theory formalism .	Schroedinger cat states are associated with superpositions of inequivalent vacua , thus relating wavefunction collapse to the dynamics of symmetry breaking in phase transformations .
2	A Drude-like peak centered at zero frequency dominates the optical conductivity below 150 K. At higher temperatures , it shifts to finite frequencies .	Superconducting Pr $ _2 $ CuO $ _x $ , $ x\simeq 4 $ ( PCO ) films with $ T^\prime $ structure and a $ T_c $ of 27 K have been investigated by various optical methods in a wide frequency ( 7 - 55000 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ ) and temperature ( 2 to 300 K ) range .	The optical spectra do not reveal any indication of a normal-state gap formation .	The detailed analysis of the low-frequency conductivity reveals that the Drude peak and a far-infrared ( FIR ) peak centered at about 300 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ persist at all temperatures .	The FIR-peak spectral weight is found to grow at the expense of the Drude spectral weight with increasing temperature .
0	[ ABRIDGED ] The knowledge of the regular component of the Galactic magnetic field gives important information about the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way , as well as constitutes a basic tool to determine cosmic rays trajectories .	It can also provide clear windows where primordial magnetic fields could be detected .	We want to obtain the regular ( large scale ) pattern of the magnetic field distribution of the Milky Way that better fits the polarized synchrotron emission as seen by the 5-year WMAP data at 22 GHz .	We have done a systematic study of a number of Galactic magnetic field models : axisymmetric , bisymmetric , logarithmic spiral arms , concentric circular rings with reversals and bi-toroidal .	We have explored the parameter space defining each of these models using a grid-based approach .
2	a `` in '' -field in a quasi-free representation of the canonic commutation relations ( CCR ) leads to a solution of this Ansatz for the VEVs .	We consider a relativistic Ansatz for the vacuum expectation values ( VEVs ) of a quantum field on a globally hyperbolic space-time which is motivated by certain Euclidean field theories .	The Yang-Feldman asymptotic condition w.r.t .	A GNS-like construction on a non-degenerate inner product space then gives local , covariant quantum fields with indefinite metric on a globally hyperbolic space-time .	The non-trivial scattering behavior of quantum fields is analyzed by construction of the `` out '' -fields and calculation of the scattering matrix .
0	To find more deliberate f ( R , T ) cosmological solutions , we proceed our previous paper further by studying some new aspects of the considered models via investigation of some new cosmological parameters/quantities to attain the most acceptable cosmological results .	Our investigations are performed by applying the dynamical system approach .	We obtain the cosmological parameters/quantities in terms of some defined dimensionless parameters that are used in constructing the dynamical equations of motion .	The investigated parameters/quantities are the evolution of the Hubble parameter and its inverse , the `` weight function '' , the ratio of the matter density to the dark energy density and its time variation , the deceleration , the jerk and the snap parameters , and the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy .	We numerically examine these quantities for two general models $ R+\alpha R^ { -n } +\sqrt { -T } $ and $ R\log { [ \alpha R ] } ^ { q } +\sqrt { -T } $ .
2	A generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation maps the entire family to noninteracting fermions .	We demonstrate the role of interactions in driving the relaxation of an isolated integrable quantum system following a sudden quench .	We consider a family of integrable hard-core lattice anyon models that continuously interpolates between noninteracting spinless fermions and strongly interacting hard-core bosons .	We find that , aside from the singular free-fermion limit , the entire single-particle density matrix and therefore all one-body observables relax to the predictions of the generalized Gibbs ensemble ( GGE ) .	This demonstrates that , in the presence of interactions , correlations between particles in the many-body wave function provide the effective dissipation required to drive relaxation of all one-body observables to the GGE .
4	Under these conditions , the ratio or comparative asymptotics of these polynomials is also discussed .	Type I Hermite -- Pad\'e polynomials for a set of functions $ f_0 , f_1 , ... , f_s $ at infinity , $ Q_ { n,0 } $ , $ Q_ { n,1 } $ , ... , $ Q_ { n , s } $ , is defined by the asymptotic condition $ $ R_n ( z ) : =\bigl ( Q_ { n,0 } f_0+Q_ { n,1 } f_1+Q_ { n,2 } f_2+ ... +Q_ { n , s } f_s\bigr ) ( z ) =\mathcal O ( \frac1 { z^ { s n+s } } ) , \quad z\to\infty , $ $ with the degree of all $ Q_ { n , k } \leq n $ .	We describe an approach for finding the asymptotic zero distribution of these polynomials as $ n\to \infty $ under the assumption that all $ f_j $ 's are semiclassical , i.e.their logarithmic derivatives are rational functions .	In this situation $ R_n $ and $ Q_ { n , k } f_k $ satisfy the same differential equation with polynomials coefficients .	We discuss in more detail the case when $ f_k $ 's are powers of the same function $ f $ ( $ f_k=f^k $ ) ; for illustration , the simplest non trivial situation of $ s=2 $ and $ f $ having two branch points is analyzed in depth .
3	The active region was on the southeast solar limb as seen from SDO/AIA , and on the disk as viewed from STEREO/EUVI-B .	Homologous flares are flares that occur repetitively in the same active region , with similar structure and morphology .	A series of at least eight homologous flares occurred in active region NOAA 11237 over 16 - 17 June 2011 .	A nearby prominence/filament was rooted in the active region , and situated near the bottom of a coronal cavity .	The dual perspective allows us to study in detail behavior of the prominence/filament material entrained in the magnetic field of the repeatedly-erupting system .
3	While , in the perpendicular direction , the motion may be described as diffusion in an effective harmonic potential which is determined from the distribution function of the position of the C60 molecule .	The motion of a C60 molecule over a graphene sheet at finite temperature is investigated both theoretically and computationally .	We show that a graphene sheet generates a van der Waals laterally periodic potential , which directly influences the motion of external objects in its proximity .	The translational motion of a C60 molecule near a graphene sheet is found to be diffusive in the lateral directions .	We also examine the rotational diffusion of C60 and show that its motion over the graphene sheet is not a rolling motion .
0	The data warehouse ( DW ) technology was developed to integrate heterogeneous information sources for analysis purposes .	Information sources are more and more autonomous and they often change their content due to perpetual transactions ( data changes ) and may change their structure due to continual users ' requirements evolving ( schema changes ) .	Handling properly all type of changes is a must .	In fact , the DW which is considered as the core component of the modern decision support systems has to be update according to different type of evolution of information sources to reflect the real world subject to analysis .	The goal of this paper is to propose an overview and a comparative study between different works related to the DW evolution problem .
4	However , some ( explicable ) overestimation of the ratio has been observed .	Transverse energy and charged particle pseudorapidity densities at midrapidity and their ratio , $ dE_ { T } /d\eta\mid_ { mid } / dN_ { ch } /d\eta|_ { mid } $ , are evaluated in a statistical model with longitudinal and transverse flows for the wide range of colliders , from AGS to RHIC at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } =200 $ GeV .	Evaluations are done at freeze-out parameters established independently from fits to observed particle yields and $ p_ { T } $ spectra .	Decays of hadron resonances are treated thoroughly and are included in derivations of $ dE_ { T } /d\eta|_ { mid } $ and $ dN_ { ch } /d\eta|_ { mid } $ .	The predictions of the model agree well with the experimental data .
3	Modding by the action of SL ( 8 , \IR ) conjugations that yield equivalent theories all continuous parameters are eliminated except for an overall coupling constant and we obtain a discrete set of orbits .	In this paper we reconsider , for N=8 supergravity , the problem of gauging the most general electric subgroup .	We show that admissible theories are fully characterized by a single algebraic equation to be satisfied by the embedding of the gauge group G within the electric subalgebra SL ( 8 , \IR ) of E_ { 7 ( 7 ) } .	The complete set of solutions to this equation contains 36 parameters .	This set is in one -- to -- one correspondence with 36 Lie subalgebras of SL ( 8 , \IR ) , corresponding to all possible real forms of the SO ( 8 ) Lie algebra plus a set of contractions thereof .
3	We consider a family of examples $ B_ { i , j } $ , which are toric manifolds over products of simplices , and verify that their natural stably complex structure is induced by an omniorientation .	We extend work of Davis and Januszkiewicz by considering { \it omnioriented } toric manifolds , whose canonical codimension-2 submanifolds are independently oriented .	We show that each omniorientation induces a canonical stably complex structure , which is respected by the torus action and so defines an element of an equivariant cobordism ring .	As an application , we compute the complex bordism groups and cobordism ring of an arbitrary omnioriented toric manifold .	Studying connected sums of products of the $ B_ { i , j } $ allows us to deduce that every complex cobordism class of dimension & gt ; 2 contains a toric manifold , necessarily connected , and so provides a positive answer to the toric analogue of Hirzebruch 's famous question for algebraic varieties .
3	The second design is based on building blocks composed of rigidly linked spheres with short-range anisotropic interactions , which are predicted to self-assemble into Bernal spirals .	Using the framework of potential energy landscape theory , we describe two in silico designs for self-assembling helical colloidal superstructures based upon dipolar dumbbells and Janus-type building blocks , respectively .	Helical superstructures with controllable pitch length are obtained using external magnetic field driven assembly of asymmetric dumbbells involving screened electrostatic as well as magnetic dipolar interactions .	The pitch of the helix is tuned by modulating the Debye screening length over an experimentally accessible range .	These spirals are quite flexible , and longer helices undergo rearrangements via cooperative , hinge-like moves , in agreement with experiment .
4	Our experiments on a database of about 3000 musical track pairs show that the new feature space characterization produces significant improvements over standard baselines .	Given the large number of new musical tracks released each year , automated approaches to plagiarism detection are essential to help us track potential violations of copyright .	Most current approaches to plagiarism detection are based on musical similarity measures , which typically ignore the issue of polyphony in music .	We present a novel feature space for audio derived from compositional modelling techniques , commonly used in signal separation , that provides a mechanism to account for polyphony without incurring an inordinate amount of computational overhead .	We employ this feature representation in conjunction with traditional audio feature representations in a classification framework which uses an ensemble of distance features to characterize pairs of songs as being plagiarized or not .
1	Despite the apparent basis dependence of these quantities we show the existence of some particular basis ( we will call them conformal basis ) whose finite-size scaling function is related to the central charge $ c $ of the underlying conformal field theory of the model .	We study the Shannon and R\'enyi mutual information ( MI ) in the ground state ( GS ) of different critical quantum spin chains .	In particular , we verified that for large index $ n $ , the MI of a subsystem of size $ \ell $ in a periodic chain with $ L $ sites behaves as $ \frac { c } { 4 } \frac { n } { n-1 } \ln\Big { ( } \frac { L } { \pi } \sin ( \frac { \pi \ell } { L } ) \Big { ) } $ , when the ground-state wavefunction is expressed in these special conformal basis .	This is in agreement with recent predictions .	For generic local basis we will show that , although in some cases $ b_n\ln\Big { ( } \frac { L } { \pi } \sin ( \frac { \pi \ell } { L } ) \Big { ) } $ is a good fit to our numerical data , in general there is no direct relation between $ b_n $ and the central charge of the system .
4	For aligning further parts of the pattern with corresponding parts of lexicon entries , more errors are tolerated at each subsequent step .	We present a new efficient method for approximate search in electronic lexica .	Given an input string ( the pattern ) and a similarity threshold , the algorithm retrieves all entries of the lexicon that are sufficiently similar to the pattern .	Search is organized in subsearches that always start with an exact partial match where a substring of the input pattern is aligned with a substring of a lexicon word .	Afterwards this partial match is extended stepwise to larger substrings .
1	Neighbor discovery ( ND ) , that is , determining which devices are within direct radio communication , is a building block of network protocols and applications , and its vulnerability can severely compromise their functionalities .	Wireless communication enables a broad spectrum of applications , ranging from commodity to tactical systems .	A number of proposals to secure ND have been published , but none have analyzed the problem formally .	In this paper , we contribute such an analysis : We build a formal model capturing salient characteristics of wireless systems , most notably obstacles and interference , and we provide a specification of a basic variant of the ND problem .	Then , we derive an impossibility result for a general class of protocols we term `` time-based protocols , '' to which many of the schemes in the literature belong .
4	In this paper , we suggest a novel LP formulation for combinatorial auctions with conflict graph using a non-standard graph parameter , the so-called inductive independence number .	We study combinatorial auctions for the secondary spectrum market .	In this market , short-term licenses shall be given to wireless nodes for communication in their local neighborhood .	In contrast to the primary market , channels can be assigned to multiple bidders , provided that the corresponding devices are well separated such that the interference is sufficiently low .	Interference conflicts are described in terms of a conflict graph in which the nodes represent the bidders and the edges represent conflicts such that the feasible allocations for a channel correspond to the independent sets in the conflict graph .
0	We present our latest results for the Delta I=1/2 rule , obtained on quenched ensembles with beta=6.0 and 6.2 , and a set of N_f=2 configurations with beta=5.7 .	The statistical noise is quite under control .	We observe an enhancement of the Delta I=1/2 amplitude consistent with experiment , although the systematic errors are still large .	We also present a non-perturbative determination of Z_P , Z_S and the strange quark mass .	We briefly discuss our progress in calculating epsilon-prime .
4	This contrasts settings like football where two teams play in each game since there this case is still polynomial time solvable .	During the last twenty years , a lot of research was conducted on the sport elimination problem : Given a sports league and its remaining matches , we have to decide whether a given team can still possibly win the competition , i.e. , place first in the league at the end .	Previously , the computational complexity of this problem was investigated only for games with two participating teams per game .	In this paper we consider Debating Tournaments and Debating Leagues in the British Parliamentary format , where four teams are participating in each game .	We prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given team can win a Debating League , even if at most two matches are remaining for each team .
4	To linear ( spin wave ) order , the degeneracy is found to stay intact .	In Volborthite , spin-1/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\'e lattice , of corner sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $ J $ on two bonds and $ J ' $ on the third bond .	We study the properties of such spin systems , and show that despite the distortion , the lattice retains a great deal of frustration .	Although sub-extensive , the classical ground state degeneracy remains very large , growing exponentially with the system perimeter .	We consider degeneracy lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations .
4	An analogous result for semilocal rings is also given -- interestingly , the semilocal case reduces to the case of matrices .	We give an elementary proof of a Caratheodory-type result on the invertibility of a sum of matrices , due first to Facchini and Barioli .	The proof yields a polynomial identity , expressing the determinant of a large sum of matrices in terms of determinants of smaller sums .	Interpreting these results over an arbitrary commutative ring gives a stabilization result for a filtered family of ideals of determinants .	Generalizing in another direction gives a characterization of local rings .
0	Observational studies have revealed a `` downsizing '' trend in black hole ( BH ) growth : the number densities of luminous AGN peak at higher redshifts than those of faint AGN .	This would seem to imply that massive black holes formed before low mass black holes , in apparent contradiction to hierarchical clustering scenarios .	We investigate whether this observed `` downsizing '' in BH growth is reproduced in a semi-analytic model for the formation and evolution of galaxies and black holes , set within the hierarchical paradigm for structure formation ( Somerville et al.2008 ; S08 ) .	In this model , black holes evolve from light seeds ( \sim100M\odot ) and their growth is merger-driven .	The original S08 model ( baseline model ) reproduces the number density of AGN at intermediate redshifts and luminosities , but underproduces luminous AGN at very high redshift ( z & gt ; 3 ) and overproduces them at low redshift ( z & lt ; 1 ) .
2	These non-standard ingredients deeply modify the mass transfer stages of these binaries .	We study the evolution of close binary systems formed by a normal ( solar composition ) , intermediate mass donor star together with a neutron star .	We consider models including irradiation feedback and evaporation .	While models that neglect irradiation feedback undergo continuous , long standing mass transfer episodes , models including these effect suffer a number cycles of mass transfer and detachment .	During mass transfer the systems should reveal themselves as low-mass X-ray binaries ( LMXBs ) , whereas when detached they behave as a binary radio pulsars .
2	Most of the existing methods on line outage identification fail to consider such error .	The use of phasor angle measurements provided by phasor measurement units ( PMUs ) in fault detection is regarded as a promising method in identifying locations of power line outages .	However , communication errors or system malfunctions may introduce errors to the measurements and thus yield bad data .	This paper develops a framework for identifying multiple power line outages based on the PMUs ' measurements in the presence of bad data .	In particular , we design an algorithm to identify locations of line outage and recover the faulty measurements simultaneously .
1	Combination of UV and optical spectro-photometric data indicates that the bulk of the stellar mass in the early-type population forms at high redshift ( z & gt ; 2 ) , typically over short timescales ( & lt ; 1 Gyr ) .	Our current understanding of the star formation histories of early-type galaxies is reviewed , in the context of recent observational studies of their ultra-violet ( UV ) properties .	Nevertheless , early-types of all luminosities form stars over the lifetime of the Universe , with most luminous ( -23 & lt ; M ( V ) & lt ; -21 ) systems forming 10-15 % of their stellar mass after z = 1 ( with a scatter to higher value ) , while their less luminous ( M ( V ) & gt ; -21 ) counterparts form 30-60 % of their mass in the same redshift range .	The large scatter in the ( rest-frame ) UV colours in the redshift range 0 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.7 indicates widespread low-level star formation in the early-type population over the last 8 billion years .	The mass fraction of young ( & lt ; 1 Gyr old ) stars in luminous early-type galaxies varies between 1 % and 6 % at z~0 and is in the range 5-13 % at z~0.7 .
2	Here , we study the dynamical organization of cooperator clusters in spatial prisoner 's dilemma game to offer the condition for the dominance of cooperation , finding that a phase transition characterized by the emergence of a large spanning cooperator cluster occurs when the initial fraction of cooperators exceeds a certain threshold .	The paradox of cooperation among selfish individuals still puzzles scientific communities .	Although a large amount of evidence has demonstrated that cooperator clusters in spatial games are effective to protect cooperators against the invasion of defectors , we continue to lack the condition for the formation of a giant cooperator cluster that assures the prevalence of cooperation in a system .	Interestingly , the phase transition belongs to different universality classes of percolation determined by the temptation to defect $ b $ .	Specifically , on square lattices , $ 1 & lt ; b & lt ; 4/3 $ leads to a phase transition pertaining to the class of regular site percolation , whereas $ 3/2 & lt ; b & lt ; 2 $ gives rise to a phase transition subject to invasion percolation with trapping .
2	80 , 2504 ( 1998 ) ] have proved rigorously that the commonly accepted leading order term of the ground state energy is correct in the zero-density-limit .	The standard calculations of the ground-state energy of a homogeneous Bose gas rely on approximations which are physically reasonable but difficult to control .	Lieb and Yngvason [ Phys.Rev.Lett .	Here , strong indications are given that also the next to leading term is correct .	It is shown that the first terms obtained in a perturbative treatment provide contributions which are lost in the Bogoliubov approach .
4	Such wrong-Higgs gaugino couplings can be generated in models of gauge-mediated SUSY-breaking in which some of the messenger fields couple to the MSSM Higgs bosons .	In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model ( MSSM ) , if the two Higgs doublets are lighter than some subset of the superpartners of the Standard Model particles , then it is possible to integrate out the heavy states to obtain an effective broken-supersymmetric low-energy Lagrangian .	This Lagrangian can contain dimension-four gauge invariant Higgs interactions that violate supersymmetry ( SUSY ) .	The `` wrong-Higgs '' Yukawa couplings generated by one-loop radiative corrections are a well known example of this phenomenon .	In this paper , we examine gauge invariant gaugino -- higgsino -- Higgs boson interactions that violate supersymmetry .
4	The traditional method that lumps all abundances into a single quantity ( total heavy element to hydrogen ratio , Z/X ) yields a larger uncertainty , 20 % .	We show that uncertainties in the values of the surface heavy element abundances of the Sun are the largest source of the theoretical uncertainty in calculating the p-p , pep , 8B , 13N , 15O , and 17F solar neutrino fluxes .	We evaluate for the first time the sensitivity ( partial derivative ) of each solar neutrino flux with respect to the surface abundance of each element .	We then calculate the uncertainties in each neutrino flux using `conservative ( preferred ) ' and `optimistic ' estimates for the uncertainties in the element abundances .	The total conservative ( optimistic ) composition uncertainty in the predicted 8B neutrino flux is 11.6 % ( 5.0 % ) when sensitivities to individual element abundances are used .
0	The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) , to be installed on the International Space Station , will provide data on cosmic radiations in a large energy range .	The main physics goals in the astroparticle domain are the antimatter and the dark matter searches .	Dark matter should be composed of non baryonic weakly interacting massive particles , a good candidate being the lightest SUSY particle in R-parity conserving models .	As a prototype for the AMS-02 experiment , the AMS-01 particle spectrometer was flown on the Space Shuttle Discovery in near earth orbit for a ten day mission in June 1998 .	The direct identification of positrons in AMS-01 was limited to energies below 3 GeV due to the vast proton background and the characteristics of the subdetectors , but the sensitivity towards higher energies ( up to 40 GeV ) was extended by identifying positrons through the conversion of bremsstrahlung photons .
4	In this work , we apply the latest theoretical developments to guide our research using GOLF velocity time series .	Over the past 15 years , our knowledge of the interior of the Sun has tremendously progressed by the use of helioseismic measurements .	However , to go further in our understanding of the solar core , we need to measure gravity ( g ) modes .	Thanks to the high quality of the Doppler-velocity signal measured by GOLF/SoHO , it has been possible to unveil the signature of the asymptotic properties of the solar g modes , thus obtaining a hint of the rotation rate in the core .	However , the quest for the detection of individual g modes is not yet over .
3	We focus on the phase structure in the chemical potential versus temperature plane .	We explore the phase structure for defect theories in full generality using the gauge/gravity correspondence .	On the gravity side , the systems are constructed by introducing M ( probe ) D ( p+4-2k ) -branes in a background generated by N Dp-branes to obtain a codimension-k intersection .	The dual gauge theory is a U ( N ) Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a ( 1+p-k ) -dimensional defect with both adjoint and fundamental degrees of freedom .	We observe the existence of two universality classes for holographic gauge theories , which are identified by the order of the phase transition in the interior of the chemical potential/temperature plane .
3	However a severe bias may distort the true picture since only a subset of 30 galaxies have been observed , which represent the most luminous radio sources ( P_ ( 151 MHz ) & gt ; 10^27.5 W Hz^-1 sr^-1 ) , whilst the complete sample covers ~4 decades in radio power ( 10^25 - 10^29 W Hz^-1 sr^-1 ) .	A systematic survey measuring the submillimetre continuum luminosity in radio galaxies between redshifts z ~ 0.1 - 5 is currently in progress .	The first results from observations with the bolometer array SCUBA on the JCMT suggest a trend of increasing submillimetre luminosity with redshift out to z ~ 4 .	Assuming the continuum emission at 850um is dominated by thermal radiation from dust heated by young , massive stars , the straightforward interpretation of these data implies that the host galaxies of powerful radio sources , presumably ellipticals or their progenitors , exhibit increased star formation activity with increasing redshift .	This on-going observational programme continues to improve coverage of the radio power-redshift plane in an attempt to remove this potential bias towards higher AGN activity and hence understand more fully the relationship between high-z AGN , their level of starformation , and the evolutionary status of their host galaxies .
1	Under mild acidic conditions , the hydrogen bonding pattern of the DNA basepairs undergoes a change .	Protonation of DNA basepairs is a reversible phenomenon which can be controlled by tuning the pH of the system .	We study the effect of protonation on the electronic properties of the DNA basepairs to probe for possible molecular electronics applications .	We find that , under mild acidic pH conditions , the A : T basepair shows excellent rectification behaviour which is , however , absent in the G : C basepair .	The mechanism of rectification has been discussed using a simple chemical potential model .
0	We propose a novel approach to input design for identification of nonlinear state space models .	The optimal input sequence is obtained by maximizing a scalar cost function of the Fisher information matrix .	Since the Fisher information matrix is unavailable in closed form , it is estimated using particle methods .	In addition , we make use of Gaussian process optimization to find the optimal input and to mitigate the problem of a large computational cost incurred by the particle filter , as the method reduces the number of functional evaluations .	Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the resulting algorithm .
1	For the case of a single fluctuator we evaluate explicitly an exact expression for the phase-memory decay in the echo experiment with a resonant ac excitation .	We study decoherence in a qubit with the distance between the two levels affected by random flips of bistable fluctuators .	The echo signal as a function of time shows a sequence of plateaus .	The position and the height of the plateaus can be used to extract the fluctuator switching rate \gamma and its coupling strength v. At small times the logarithm of the echo signal is proportional to t^3 .	The plateaus disappear when the decoherence is induced by many fluctuators .
0	We present the first special relativistic , axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of black hole-torus systems ( approximating general relativistic gravity ) as remnants of binary-neutron star ( NS-NS ) and neutron star-black hole ( NS-BH ) mergers , in which the viscously driven evolution of the accretion torus is followed with self-consistent energy-dependent neutrino transport and the interaction with the cloud of dynamical ejecta expelled during the NS-NS merging is taken into account .	The modeled torus masses , BH masses and spins , and the ejecta masses , velocities , and spatial distributions are adopted from relativistic merger simulations .	We find that energy deposition by neutrino annihilation can accelerate outflows with initially high Lorentz factors along polar low-density funnels , but only in mergers with extremely low baryon pollution in the polar regions .	NS-BH mergers , where polar mass ejection during the merging phase is absent , provide sufficiently baryon-poor environments to enable neutrino-powered , ultrarelativistic jets with terminal Lorentz factors above 100 and considerable dynamical collimation , favoring short gamma-ray bursts ( sGRBs ) , although their typical energies and durations might be too small to explain the majority of events .	In the case of NS-NS mergers , however , neutrino emission of the accreting and viscously spreading torus is too short and too weak to yield enough energy for the outflows to break out from the surrounding ejecta shell as highly relativistic jets .
2	Can it be used to eliminate communication altogether ?	Entanglement is perhaps the most non-classical manifestation of quantum mechanics .	Among its many interesting applications to information processing , it can be harnessed to reduce the amount of communication required to process a variety of distributed computational tasks .	Even though it can not serve to signal information between remote parties , there are distributed tasks that can be performed without any need for communication , provided the parties share prior entanglement : this is the realm of pseudo-telepathy .	One of the earliest uses of multi-party entanglement was presented by Mermin in 1990 .
3	This greatly simplifies the analysis of semileptonic B decay .	We demonstrate that the B- & gt ; D ( * ) l nu form factors can be accurately predicted given the slope parameter rho^2 of the Isgur-Wise function .	Only weak assumptions , consistent with lattice results , on the wavefunction for the light degrees of freedom are required to establish this result .	We observe that the QCD and 1/m_Q corrections can be systematically represented by an effective Isgur-Wise function of shifted slope .	We also investigate what the available semileptonic data can tell us about lattice QCD and Heavy Quark Effective Theory .
3	Lastly , we lay the foundation for future work placing phenomenological constraints on the parameters of the effective theory .	We present a unified framework for the study of late time cosmic acceleration .	Using methods of effective field theory , we show that existing proposals for late time acceleration can be subsumed in a single framework , rather than many compartmentalized theories .	We construct the most general action consistent with symmetry principles , derive the background and perturbation evolution equations , and demonstrate that for special choices of our parameters we can reproduce results already existing in the literature .	Although in this paper we focus on late time acceleration , our construction also generalizes the effective field theory of inflation to the scalar-tensor and multi-field case for perturbatively constructed backgrounds .
0	Cooperative behavior , where one individual incurs a cost to help another , is a wide spread phenomenon .	Here we study direct reciprocity in the context of the alternating Prisoner 's Dilemma .	We consider all strategies that can be implemented by one and two-state automata .	We calculate the payoff matrix of all pairwise encounters in the presence of noise .	We explore deterministic selection dynamics with and without mutation .
1	We assume a case where one main Base Station ( BS ) needs to serve three users equipments ( UE ) while another BS is causing interference .	Our demo aims at proving the concept of a recent proposed interference management scheme that reduces the inter-cell interference in downlink without complex coordination , known as non-classic interference alignment ( IA ) scheme .	The primary goal is to construct the alignment scheme ; i.e.each UE estimates the main and interfered channel coefficients , calculates the optimal interference free directions dropped by the interfering BS and feeds them back to the main BS which in turn applies a scheduling to select the best free inter-cell interference directions .	Once the scheme is build , we are able to measure the total capacity of the downlink interference channel .	We run the scheme in CorteXlab ; a controlled hardware facility located in Lyon , France with remotely programmable radios and multi-node processing capabilities , and we illustrate the achievable capacity gain for different channel realizations .
4	We find existence of a metastable phase below a critical temperature of the bath .	In this paper , we address the possibility of generalising the standard analysis of thermal contact between a sample system and a heat bath , by including long range interactions between them .	As a concrete example , both system and bath are treated within the long range Ising model .	For this model , we derive the equilibrium probability distribution of the energy of the sample system .	Equilibrium properties of the system magnetisation and stability of the solutions is discussed .
1	This phenomenon was investigated for biaxial HCMs arising from nondissipative isotropic dielectric component materials .	Homogenized composite materials ( HCMs ) can support a singular form of optical propagation , known as Voigt wave propagation , while their component materials do not .	The biaxiality of these HCMs stems from the oriented spheroidal shapes of the particles which make up the component materials .	An extended version of the Bruggeman homogenization formalism was used to investigate the influence of component particle orientation , shape and size , as well as volume fraction of the component materials , upon Voigt wave propagation .	Our numerical studies revealed that the directions in which Voigt waves propagate is highly sensitive to the orientation of the component particles and to the volume fraction of the component materials , but less sensitive to the shape of the component particles and less sensitive still to the size of the component particles .
4	Finally , we provide an example of a system for which the angular momentum of the central Black Hole divided by the square of its mass exceeds one .	Highly accurate numerical solutions to the problem of Black Holes surrounded by uniformly rotating rings in axially symmetric , stationary spacetimes are presented .	The numerical methods developed to handle the problem are discussed in some detail .	Related Newtonian problems are described and numerical results provided , which show that configurations can reach an inner mass-shedding limit as the mass of the central object increases .	Exemplary results for the full relativistic problem for rings of constant density are given and the deformation of the event horizon due to the presence of the ring is demonstrated .
2	However , in the case $ n=2 $ this is false with either of the $ L_2 $ -metric .	We consider isomorphism properties of infinite random geometric graphs defined over a variety of metrics .	In previous work , it was shown that for $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ with the $ L_ { \infty } $ -metric , the infinite random geometric graph is , with probability 1 , unique up to isomorphism .	We generalize this result to a large family of metrics induced by norms .	Within this class of metric spaces , we show that the infinite geometric graph is not unique up to isomorphism if it has the new property which we name truncating : each step-isometry from a dense set to itself is an isometry .
4	Moreover , we extend these results to give a jet-theoretic interpretation of multiplier ideals .	We study loci of arcs on a smooth variety defined by order of contact with a fixed subscheme .	Specifically , we establish a Nash-type correspondence showing that the irreducible components of these loci arise from ( intersections of ) exceptional divisors in a resolution of singularities .	We show also that these loci account for all the valuations determined by irreducible cylinders in the arc space .	Along the way , we recover in an elementary fashion-without using motivic integration-results of the third author relating singularities to arc spaces .
2	At zero temperature the Kondo effect leads to the formation of broad valleys of small conductance corresponding to an odd number of electrons on the dot .	We compute the zero bias conductance of electrons through a single ballistic channel weakly coupled to a side quantum dot with Coulomb interaction .	In contrast to the standard setup which is designed to measure the transport through the dot , the channel conductance reveals Coulomb blockade dips rather then peaks due to the Fano-like backscattering .	By applying a magnetic field in the dot region we find two dips corresponding to a total suppression in the conductance of spins up and down separated by an energy of the order of the Coulomb interaction .	This provides a possibility of a perfect spin filter .
3	Communication among cells is a primary means for cells to interact with each other .	Living systems , particularly multicellular systems , often seem hopelessly complex .	But recent studies have suggested that beneath this complexity , there may be unifying quantitative principles that we are only now starting to unravel .	All cells interact with their environments and with other cells .	The complexity of these multicellular systems , due to the large numbers of cells and the diversity of intracellular and intercellular interactions , makes understanding multicellular systems a daunting task .
0	The nonsymmetric gravitational theory predicts an acceleration law that modifies the Newtonian law of attraction between particles .	For weak fields a fit to the flat rotation curves of galaxies is obtained in terms of the mass ( mass-to-light ratio M/L ) of galaxies .	The fits assume that the galaxies are not dominated by exotic dark matter .	The equations of motion for test particles reduce for weak gravitational fields to the GR equations of motion and the predictions for the solar system and the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 agree with the observations .	The gravitational lensing of clusters of galaxies can be explained without exotic dark matter .
0	We investigate the magnetic field power spectrum in the cool core galaxy cluster A2199 by analyzing the polarized emission of the central radio source 3C338 .	The polarized radiation from the radio emitting plasma is modified by the Faraday rotation as it passes through the magneto-ionic intracluster medium .	We use Very Large Array observations between 1665 and 8415 MHz to produce detailed Faraday rotation measure and fractional polarization images of the radio galaxy .	We simulate Gaussian random three-dimensional magnetic field models with different power-law power spectra and we assume that the field strength decreases radially with the thermal gas density as n_e^ { \eta } .	By comparing the synthetic and the observed images with a Bayesian approach , we constrain the strength and structure of the magnetic field associated with the intracluster medium .
4	An additional boundary condition was imposed by exchange coupling a ferromagnetic Fe layer to one of the interfaces of an FeGe layer .	Magnetic materials without structural inversion symmetry can display the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction , which manifests itself as chiral magnetic ground states .	These chiral states can interact in complex ways with applied fields and boundary conditions provided by finite sample sizes that are of the order of the lengthscale of the chiral states .	Here we study epitaxial thin films of FeGe with a thickness close to the helix pitch of the helimagnetic ground state , which is about 70 nm , by conventional magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectometry .	We show that the helix in an FeGe film reverses under the application of a field by deforming into a helicoidal form , with twists in the helicoid being forced out of the film surfaces on the way to saturation .
2	After an initial photometry run with BUSCA revealed that FBS 0117+396 is photometrically variable both on long and short timescales , we chose it as an auxiliary target during a 6-night multi-color photometry run with Ultracam .	The project Massive Unseen Companions to Hot Faint Underluminous Stars from SDSS ( muchfuss ) aims to discover subdwarf-B stars with massive compact companions such as overmassive white dwarfs ( M & gt ; 1.0 M_sun ) , neutron stars or black holes .	From the 127 subdwarfs with substantial radial-velocity variations discovered in the initial survey , a number of interesting objects have been selected for extensive follow-up .	Spectroscopy was obtained at a number of observatories in order to determine the binary period and obtain a radial-velocity amplitude .	After establishing an orbital period of P = 0.252 d , and removing the signal associated with the irradiated hemisphere of the M-dwarf companion , we were able to detect ten pulsation periods in the Fourier spectrum of the light curve .
0	We propose an extension of General Relativity with two different metrics .	To each metric we define a Levi-Cevita connection and a curvature tensor .	We then consider two types of fields , each of which moves according to one of the metrics and its connection .	To obtain the field equations for the second metric we impose an exchange symmetry on the action .	As a consequence of this ansatz , additional source terms for Einstein 's field equations are generated .
4	The canonical phase diagram has first order and continuous transition lines separated by a tricritical point .	Mean-field models , while they can be cast into an { \it extensive } thermodynamic formalism , are inherently { \it non additive } .	This is the basic feature which leads to { \it ensemble inequivalence } in these models .	In this paper we study the global phase diagram of the infinite range Blume-Emery-Griffiths model both in the { \it canonical } and in the { \it microcanonical } ensembles .	The microcanonical solution is obtained both by direct state counting and by the application of large deviation theory .
2	Recently , several theoretical insights have allowed the formulation of approaches that go beyond PB theory in a systematic way .	Poisson-Boltzmann ( PB ) theory is the classic approach to soft matter electrostatics which has been applied to numerous problems of physical chemistry and biophysics .	Its essential limitations are the neglect of correlation effects and of fluid structure .	In this topical review we provide an update on the developments achieved in self-consistent formulations of correlation-corrected Poisson-Boltzmann theory .	We introduce the corresponding system of coupled nonlinear equations for both continuum electrostatics with a uniform dielectric constant and a structured solvent , a dipolar Coulomb fluid , including nonlocal effects .
3	We offer three different proofs of this fact which may be of independent interests .	We start by introducing a nonlinear involution operator which maps the space of solutions of Sturm-Liouville equations into the space of solutions of the associated equations which turn out to be nonlinear ordinary differential equations .	We study some algebraic and analytical properties of this involution operator as well as some properties of a two-parameter family of operators describing the set of solutions of Sturm-Liouville equations .	Next , we show how a specific composition of these mappings allows to connect , by means of a simple analytical expression , the law of the first passage time of a Brownian motion over a curve to a two-parameter family of curves .	In particular , one is based on the construction of parametric time-space harmonic transforms of the law of some Gauss-Markov processes .
0	An algorithm to generate the locus of a circle using the intersection points of straight lines is proposed .	The pixels on the circle are plotted independent of one another and the operations involved in finding the locus of the circle from the intersection of straight lines are parallelizable .	Integer only arithmetic and algorithmic optimizations are used for speedup .	The proposed algorithm makes use of an envelope to form a parabolic arc which is consequent transformed into a circle .	The use of parabolic arcs for the transformation results in higher pixel errors as the radius of the circle to be drawn increases .
3	An AC electric field sensitivity reaching ~ 140V/cm/\surd Hz has been achieved .	The ability to sensitively detect charges under ambient conditions would be a fascinating new tool benefitting a wide range of researchers across disciplines .	However , most current techniques are limited to low-temperature methods like single-electron transistors ( SET ) , single-electron electrostatic force microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy .	Here we open up a new quantum metrology technique demonstrating precision electric field measurement using a single nitrogen-vacancy defect centre ( NV ) spin in diamond .	This corresponds to the electric field produced by a single elementary charge located at a distance of ~ 150 nm from our spin sensor with averaging for one second .
0	We study interior regularity of solutions of a generalized stationary Stokes problem in the plane .	The main , elliptic part of the problem is given in the form div ( A ( Du ) ) , where D is the symmetric part of the gradient .	The model case is A ( Du ) = ( kappa+|Du| ) ^ { p-2 } Du .	We show optimal BMO and Campanato estimates for A ( Du ) .	Some corollaries for the generalized stationary Navier-Stokes system and for its evolutionary variant are also mentioned .
2	There is no dynamical obstacle for such a choice of global halo shape .	We discuss the tight interconnection between microlensing optical depths , flattening of dark haloes and low-to-intermediate redshift baryonic census .	By analysing plots of the microlensing optical depth as a function of galactic coordinates for different values of axis ratio $ q $ of the galactic MACHO halo , we have shown that observations are best described by a flattened halo with $ q \simeq 0.6 $ .	Both extremely flattened $ q \simeq 0.2 $ and spherical $ q \simeq 1 $ haloes have several difficulties , although not of equal severity .	Consequences of such flattening for the cosmological density fraction contained in MACHOs are considered and comparison with mass in low and intermediate-redshift Ly $ \alpha $ forest and other plausible reservoirs of gas is discussed in context of a unified description of the evolution of baryonic content of the universe .
0	We estimate the changes in lattice parameters due to iron isotope substitution in the iron-based high temperature superconductors using a variational calculation based on the anharmonicity of the Fe-As ( Se ) bond .	For BaFe2As2 and 57Fe to 54 $ Fe substitution we find a c-axis expansion of 1 10^ { -3 } { \AA } and in-plane a-axis contraction of 1 10^ { -5 } { \AA } at 250K in good agreement with experimental values on ( Ba , K ) Fe2As2 for which a negative isotope exponent \alpha=-\frac { d\ln T_c } { d\ln m } & lt ; 0 was found [ P.M. Shirage et al. , Phys.Rev.Lett .	103 , 257003 ( 2009 ) ] .	For FeSe in contrast we find an expansion for both a and c lattice parameters .	We discuss the relevance of these isotope induced changes of lattice parameters to the isotope effect in light of the well established sensitivity to the Fe-As ( Se ) coordination .
3	We present a model which simultaneously generates thermal relic WIMP-like densities for both baryons and dark matter by modifying a large initial baryon asymmetry .	The observed density of dark matter is of the magnitude expected for a thermal relic weakly-interacting massive particle ( WIMP ) .	In addition , the observed baryon density is within an order of magnitude of the dark matter density .	This suggests that the baryon density is physically related to a typical thermal relic WIMP dark matter density .	Production of unstable scalars carrying baryon number at the LHC would be a clear signature of the model .
2	First , we revisit the anomalous \emph { 2D } graphene by using \emph { QFT } method .	Bori\c { c } i-Creutz ( \emph { BC } ) model describing the dynamics of light quarks in lattice \emph { QCD } has been shown to be intimately linked to the four dimensional extension of 2D graphene refereed below to as four dimensional graphene ( \emph { 4D-graphene } ) .	Borrowing ideas from the field theory description of the usual \emph { 2D } graphene , we study in this paper the anomalous quantum Hall effect ( AQHE ) of the \emph { BC } fermions in presence of a constant background field strength $ \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } $ with a special focuss on the case $ \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } =\mathcal { B } \epsilon_ { \mu \nu 34 } +\mathcal { E } \epsilon_ { 12\mu \nu } $ with $ \mathcal { B } $ and $ \mathcal { E } $ two real\ moduli and $ \det \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } =\mathcal { B } ^ { 2 } \mathcal { \times E } ^ { 2 } $ .	Then , we consider the AQHE of \emph { BC } fermions for both regular $ \det \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } \neq 0 $ and singular $ \det F_ { \mu \nu } =0 $ cases .	We show , amongst others , that the exact solutions of the \emph { BC } fermions coupled to constant $ \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } $ have a 5D interpretation ; and the filling factor $ \nu_ { BC } $ of the \emph { BC } \ model coupled to constant $ \mathcal { F } _ { \mu \nu } $ is given by $ 24 % \frac { ( 2N+1 ) ( 2M+1 ) } { 2 } $ with $ N , $ $ M $ positive integers .
0	Bulk flows of galaxies moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background are well established observationally and seen in the most recent LCDM simulations .	With the aid of an idealised Gadget-2 simulation , we show that void asymmetries in the cosmic web can exacerbate local bulk flows of galaxies .	The Cosmicflows-2 survey , which has mapped in detail the 3D structure of the Local Universe , reveals that the Local Group resides in a `` local sheet '' of galaxies that borders a `` local void '' with a diameter of about 40 Mpc .	The void is emptying out at a rate of 16 km/s/Mpc .	In a co-moving frame , the Local Sheet is found to be moving away from the Local Void at ~ 260 km/s .
4	Near these zeros , the conductivity rises linearly with carrier density .	Dispersionless ( flat ) electronic bands are investigated regarding their conductance properties .	Due to `` caging '' of carriers these bands are usually insulating at partial filling , at least on the non-interacting level .	Considering the specific example of a $ \mathcal { T } _3 $ -- lattice we study long-range Coulomb interactions .	A non-trivial dependence of the conductivity on flat band filling is obtained , exhibiting an infinite number of zeros .
1	These backgrounds , which are difficult to veto or shield against , are very important for solar , reactor , dark matter , and other underground experiments , especially as increased sensitivity is pursued .	While cosmic ray muons themselves are relatively easy to veto in underground detectors , their interactions with nuclei create more insidious backgrounds via : ( i ) the decays of long-lived isotopes produced by muon-induced spallation reactions inside the detector , ( ii ) spallation reactions initiated by fast muon-induced neutrons entering from outside the detector , and ( iii ) nuclear recoils initiated by fast muon-induced neutrons entering from outside the detector .	We used fluka to calculate the production rates and spectra of all prominent secondaries produced by cosmic ray muons , in particular focusing on secondary neutrons , due to their importance .	Since the neutron spectrum is steeply falling , the total neutron production rate is sensitive just to the relatively soft neutrons , and not to the fast-neutron component .	We show that the neutron spectrum in the range between 10 and 100 MeV can instead be probed by the ( n , p ) -induced isotope production rates 12C ( n , p ) 12B and 16O ( n , p ) 16N in oil- and water-based detectors .
2	We will construct quantum models on lattice to demonstrate that some quantum orders can give rise to light without breaking any symmetries and without any fine tuning .	The existence of light ( a massless U ( 1 ) gauge boson ) is one of unresolved mysteries in nature .	In this paper , we would like to propose that light is originated from certain quantum orders in our vacuum .	Through our models , we show that the existence of light can simply be a phenomenon of quantum coherence in a system with many degrees of freedom .	Massless gauge fluctuations appears commonly and naturally in strongly correlated systems .
2	We derive a novel variant of the natural gradient method where the parameters of the Gaussian distribution are updated along the natural gradient to improve a newly defined function on the parameter space .	In this paper we investigate the convergence properties of a variant of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy ( CMA-ES ) .	Our study is based on the recent theoretical foundation that the pure rank-mu update CMA-ES performs the natural gradient descent on the parameter space of Gaussian distributions .	We study this algorithm on composites of a monotone function with a convex quadratic function .	We prove that our algorithm adapts the covariance matrix so that it becomes proportional to the inverse of the Hessian of the original objective function .
0	The influence of dark matter ( DM ) on the growth of supermassive black holes ( SMBHs ) in galaxies is studied .	It is shown that gravitational scattering of DM particles on bulge stars leads to diffusion of DM in phase space { m , m_z , I } ( 'm ' denotes the angular momentum and 'I ' is the radial action ) .	Appropriate diffusion coefficients are calculated for different bulge models , and it is argued that the diffusion along 'm ' axis is the most important effect .	It is shown that this process leads to noticeable flow of DM into the black hole ( BH ) , resulting in its power-law growth : M_ { bh } ~ t^ { 9/16 } .	Comparison with observational data shows that , in principle , this effect may explain observed masses of SMBHs .
3	It 's evolution is determined through the bundle ( analogue of the ) Schr\ '' odinger equation .	We propose a new systematic fibre bundle formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .	The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and potentially admits new generalizations in different directions .	In it a pure state of some quantum system is described by a state section ( along paths ) of a ( Hilbert ) fibre bundle .	Now the dynamical variables and the density operator are described via bundle morphisms ( along paths ) .
0	We analyse the redshift space topology and geometry of the nearby Universe by computing the Minkowski functionals of the Updated Zwicky Catalogue ( UZC ) .	The UZC contains the redshifts of almost 20,000 galaxies , is 96 % complete to the limiting magnitude m_Zw=15.5 and includes the Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) Redshift Survey ( CfA2 ) .	From the UZC we can extract volume limited samples reaching a depth of 70 hMpc before sparse sampling dominates .	We quantify the shape of the large-scale galaxy distribution by deriving measures of planarity and filamentarity from the Minkowski functionals .	The nearby Universe shows a large degree of planarity and a small degree of filamentarity .
3	Estimating a 2\ % systematic uncertainty $ ( \sigma _ { syst } = \pm 0.005 ) $ leads to a maximum upper bound to the primordial helium mass fraction : $ Y_P^ { MAX } = Y_P^ { 2\sigma } + \sigma_ { syst } \le 0.243 $ .	We have used recent observations of helium-4 , nitrogen and oxygen from some four dozen , low metallicity , extra-galactic HII regions to define mean $ N $ versus $ O $ , $ ^4He $ versus $ N $ and $ ^4He $ versus $ O $ relations which are extrapolated to zero metallicity to determine the primordial $ ^4He $ mass fraction $ Y_P $ .	The data and various subsets of the data , selected on the basis of nitrogen and oxygen , are all consistent with $ Y_P = 0.232 \pm 0.003 $ .	For the 2 $ \sigma $ ( statistical ) upper bound we find $ Y_P^ { 2\sigma } \le 0.238 $ .	We compare these upper bounds to $ Y_P $ with recent calculations of the predicted yield from big bang nucleosynthesis to derive upper bounds to the nucleon-to-photon ratio $ \eta $ ( $ \eta_ { 10 } \equiv 10^ { 10 } \eta $ ) and the number of equivalent light ( \lsim 10 MeV ) neutrino species .
0	We present new Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) -NIC3 , near-infrared H-band photometry of globular clusters ( GC ) around NGC 4365 and NGC 1399 in combination with archival HST-WCPC2 and ACS optical data .	We find that NGC 4365 has a number of globular clusters with bluer optical colors than expected for their red optical to near-infrared colors and an old age .	The only known way to explain these colors is with a significant population of intermediate-age ( 2-8 Gyr ) clusters in this elliptical galaxy .	In contrast , NGC 1399 reveals no such population .	Our result for NGC 1399 is in agreement with previous spectroscopic work that suggests that its clusters have a large metallicity spread and are nearly all old .
0	This paper presents a first attempt at performing a precise and automatic identification of the linking behaviour in a scientific domain through the analysis of the communication of the related academic institutions on the web .	The proposed approach is based on the paradigm of multiple viewpoint data analysis ( MVDA ) than can be fruitfully exploited to highlight relationships between data , like websites , carrying several kinds of description .	It uses the MultiSOM clustering and mapping method .	The domain that has been chosen for this study is the domain of Computer Science in Germany .	The analysis is conduced on a set of 438 websites of this domain using all together , thematic , geographic and linking information .
4	In this paper , we propose a novel scheme for Location-Aware Cross-Tier Cooperation ( LA-CTC ) between BSs in different tiers for downlink CoMP transmission in two-tier cellular networks .	Multi-tier cellular networks are considered as an effective solution to enhance the coverage and data rate offered by cellular systems .	In a multi-tier network , high power base stations ( BSs ) such as macro BSs are overlaid by lower power small cells such as femtocells and/or picocells .	However , co-channel deployment of multiple tiers of BSs gives rise to the problem of cross-tier interference that significantly impacts the performance of wireless networks .	Multicell cooperation techniques , such as coordinated multipoint ( CoMP ) transmission , have been proposed as a promising solution to mitigate the impact of the cross-tier interference in multi-tier networks .
1	The retraction is powered by a strong molecular motor protein , PilT , producing very high forces that can exceed 150 pN .	The motility of certain gram-negative bacteria is mediated by retraction of type IV pili surface filaments , which are essential for infectivity .	The molecular details of the motor mechanism are still largely unknown , while other features have been identified , such as the ring-shaped protein structure of the PilT motor .	The surprisingly high forces generated by the PilT system motivate a model investigation of the generation of large forces in molecular motors .	We propose a simple model , involving a small ensemble of motor subunits interacting through the deformations on a circular backbone with finite stiffness .
2	We show that our measure is identically equal to the Entanglement of Formation in the case of a bipartite ( two listener ) system occupying a pure state .	We propose a new measure of quantum entanglement .	Our measure is defined in terms of conditional information transmission for a Quantum Bayesian Net .	In the case of mixed states , the relationship between these two measures is not known yet .	We discuss some properties of our measure .
1	It is known that this system has a hidden SL ( 3 , R ) symmetry .	We consider stationary axisymmetric solutions of general relativity that asymptote to five dimensional Minkowski space .	We identify an SO ( 2,1 ) subgroup of this symmetry group that preserves the asymptotic boundary conditions .	We show that the action of this subgroup on a static solution generates a one-parameter family of stationary solutions carrying angular momentum .	We conjecture that by repeated applications of this procedure one can generate all stationary axisymmetric solutions starting from static ones .
1	We give a review of the basic ideas of Idempotent Analysis .	In this paper we consider Idempotent Functional Analysis , an `abstract ' version of Idempotent Analysis developed by V. P. Maslov and his collaborators .	The correspondence between concepts and theorems of the traditional Functional Analysis and its idempotent version is discussed ; this correspondence is similar to N. Bohr 's correspondence principle in quantum theory .	We present an algebraical approach to Idempotent Functional Analysis .	Basic notions and results are formulated in algebraical terms ; the essential point is that the operation of idempotent addition can be defined for arbitrary infinite sets of summands .
0	The Friedberg-Lee model is studied at finite temperature and density .	By using the finite temperature field theory , the effective potential of the Friedberg-Lee model and the bag constant $ B ( T ) $ and $ B ( T , \mu ) $ have been calculated at different temperatures and densities .	It is shown that there is a critical temperature $ T_ { C } \simeq 106.6 \mathrm { MeV } $ when $ \mu=0 \mathrm { MeV } $ and a critical chemical potential $ \mu \simeq 223.1 \mathrm { MeV } $ for fixing the temperature at $ T=50 \mathrm { MeV } $ .	We also calculate the soliton solutions of the Friedberg-Lee model at finite temperature and density .	It turns out that when $ T\leq T_ { C } $ ( or $ \mu \leq \mu_C $ ) , there is a bag constant $ B ( T ) $ ( or $ B ( T , \mu ) $ ) and the soliton solutions are stable .
0	We obtain rotating solutions of regular black holes which are constructed of de Sitter spacetime with the axisymmetric stationary perturbation within the timelike charged thin shell and the Kerr-Newman geometry with sufficiently small rotation outside the shell .	To treat the slowly rotating thin shell , we employ the method developed by de la Cruz and Israel .	The thin shell is assumed to be composed of a dust in the zero-rotation limit and located inside the inner horizon of the black hole solution .	We expand the perturbation in powers of the rotation parameter of the Kerr-Newman metric up to the second order .	It is found that with the present treatment , the stress tensor of the thin shell in general has anisotropic pressure , i.e. , the thin shell can not be composed of a dust if the rotational effects are taken into account .
1	The solution exhibits a critical angular velocity beyond which the configuration energetically prefers to decay by emitting pions .	We construct nontopological string solutions with U ( 1 ) Noether charge in the Skyrme model with a pion mass term , and examine their stability by taking linear perturbations .	This critical point is observed as a cusp in the relation between energy and charge .	We find that the maximum length for the string to be stable is comparable to the size of one skyrmion .	Beyond the length , it is unstable to decay .
2	The mass ratio of the pendulum bobs to their casings is taken as a small parameter .	We study two models of connected pendulum clocks synchronizing their oscillations , a phenomenon originally observed by Huygens .	The oscillation angles are assumed to be small so that the pendulums are modeled by harmonic oscillators , clock escapements are modeled by the van der Pol terms .	Analytic conditions for existence and stability of synchronization regimes , and analytic expressions for their stable amplitudes and period corrections are derived using the Poincare theorem on existence of periodic solutions in autonomous quasi-linear systems .	The anti-phase regime always exists and is stable under variation of the system parameters .
4	For nearly half of them the star-formation rate appears to be approximately constant during the last few Gyrs .	We present the analysis of the integrated spectral energy distribution ( SED ) from the ultraviolet ( UV ) to the far-infrared and H $ \alpha $ of a sample of 29 local systems and individual galaxies with infrared ( IR ) luminosities between 10^11 Lsun and 10^11.8 Lsun .	We have combined new narrow-band H $ \alpha $ + [ NII ] and broad-band g , r optical imaging taken with the Nordic Optical Telescope ( NOT ) , with archival GALEX , 2MASS , Spitzer , and Herschel data .	The SEDs ( photometry and integrated H $ \alpha $ flux ) have been fitted with a modified version of the MAGPHYS code using stellar population synthesis models for the UV-near-IR range and thermal emission models for the IR emission taking into account the energy balance between the absorbed and re-emitted radiation .	From the SED fits we derive the star-formation histories ( SFH ) of these galaxies .
4	In this cryptosystem , Akleylek et al .	Akleylek et al .	[ S. Akleylek , L. Emmungil and U. Nuriyev , A mod ified algorithm for peer-to-peer security , journal of Appl.Comput.Math. , vol .	6 ( 2 ) , pp.258-264 , 2007 .	] , introduced a modified public-key encryption scheme with steganographic approach for security in peer-to-peer ( P2P ) networks .
1	In particular , a low-dimensional global structure was identified in typical space-time distributions of topological charge defined via the overlap Dirac matrix .	Long-range order of a specific kind has recently been found directly in configurations dominating the regularized QCD path integral .	The presence of the order has been concluded from the fact that the structure disappears after random permutation of position coordinates in measured densities .	Here we complete the argument for the reality of this structure ( namely the conjecture that its existence is a consequence of QCD dynamics and not an artifact of the overlap-based definition of lattice topological field ) by showing that the structure ceases to exist after randomizing the space-time coordinates of the underlying gauge field .	This implies that the long-range order present in the overlap-based topological density is indeed a manifestation of QCD vacuum , and that the notion of the fundamental structure ( structure involving relevant features at all scales ) is viable .
4	The experimental errors are still very large , but with improved measurements from Babar , Belle and CDF this will be a useful method to search for new physics .	In the limit of flavor SU ( 3 ) symmetry , the amplitudes for Bd- & gt ; pi^+\pi^- and Bs- & gt ; K^+ K^- are related to one another .	Taking the values of the weak phases beta and gamma from independent measurements , the ratio Rds=BR ( Bs- & gt ; K^+K^- ) /BR ( Bd- & gt ; pi^+ pi^- ) and the two Bd- & gt ; pi^+pi^- CP asymmetries Adir and Amix depend on only two quantities .	By measuring these three observables , one can test for the presence of physics beyond the standard model .	In this paper , using present data , and including theoretical uncertainties due to SU ( 3 ) breaking , we perform such an analysis .
1	This statistical closure employs a Gaussian model for the turbulent scales , with corresponding vanishing third cumulant , and yet it captures an intrinsic damping .	We investigate the turbulence-induced dissipation of the large scales in a statistically homogeneous flow using an `` optimal closure , '' which one of us ( BT ) has recently exposed in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics .	The key to this apparent paradox lies in a clear distinction between true ensemble averages and their proxies , most easily grasped when one works directly with the Liouville equation rather than the cumulant hierarchy .	We focus on a simple problem for which the optimal closure can be fully and exactly worked out : the relaxation arbitrarily far-from-equilibrium of a single energy shell towards Gibbs equilibrium in an inviscid shell model of 3D turbulence .	The predictions of the optimal closure are validated against DNS and contrasted with those derived from EDQNM closure .
0	We prove that a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold that is curvature homogeneous of order 3 , or CH_3 for short , is necessarily locally homogeneous .	We also exhibit and classify four-dimensional Lorentzian , CH_2 manifolds that are not homogeneous .	The resulting metrics belong to the class of null electromagnetic radiation , type N solutions on an anti-de Sitter background .	These findings prove that the four-dimensional Lorentzian Singer number $ k_ { 1,3 } =3 $ , falsifying some recent conjectures by Gilkey .	We also prove that invariant classification for these proper CH_2 solutions requires $ \nabla^ { ( 7 ) } R $ , and that these are the unique metrics requiring the seventh order .
0	The weights $ W_\alpha ( x ) =\exp { ( -|x|^ { \alpha } ) } $ $ ( \alpha & gt ; 1 ) $ form a subclass of Freud weights on the real line .	Primarily from a functional analytic angle , we investigate the subspace of $ L_2 ( \mathbb R , W_\alpha^2 ( x ) \ , dx ) $ consisting of those elements that can be rapidly approximated by polynomials .	This subspace has a natural Fr\'echet topology , in which it is isomorphic to the space of rapidly decreasing sequences .	We show that it consists of smooth functions and obtain concrete results on its topology .	For $ \alpha=2 $ there is a complete and elementary description of this topological vector space in terms of the Schwartz functions .
4	The predicted fluxes and line profiles were compared with the observed ones derived with the IUE , HST , and Hipparcos satellites and with spectra acquired using the FEROS spectrograph at the 2.2m MPG/ESO telescope .	The light variability of hot magnetic chemically peculiar stars is typically caused by the flux redistribution in spots with peculiar abundance .	This raises the question why some stars with surface abundance spots show significant rotational light variability , while others do not .	We study the Bp star HD 64740 to investigate how its remarkable inhomogeneities in the surface distribution of helium and silicon , and the corresponding strong variability of many spectral lines , can result in one of the faintest photometric variabilities among the Bp stars .	We used model atmospheres and synthetic spectra calculated for the silicon and helium abundances from surface abundance maps to predict the ultraviolet and visual light and line variability of HD 64740 .
0	Let $ h $ be a quadratic form with domain $ W_0^ { 1,2 } ( \Ri^d ) $ given by \ [ h ( \varphi ) =\sum^d_ { i , j=1 } ( \partial_i\varphi , c_ { ij } \ , \partial_j\varphi ) \ ] where $ c_ { ij } =c_ { ji } $ are real-valued , locally bounded , measurable functions and $ C= ( c_ { ij } ) \geq 0 $ .	If $ C $ is strongly elliptic , i.e.\ if there exist $ \lambda , \mu & gt ; 0 $ such that $ \lambda\ , I\geq C\geq \mu \ , I & gt ; 0 $ , then $ h $ is closable , the closure determines a positive self-adjoint operator $ H $ on $ L_2 ( \Ri^d ) $ which generates a submarkovian semigroup $ S $ with a positive distributional kernel~ $ K $ and the kernel satisfies Gaussian upper and lower bounds .	Moreover , $ S $ is conservative , i.e.\ $ S_t\one=\one $ for all $ t & gt ; 0 $ .	Our aim is to examine converse statements .	First we establish that $ C $ is strongly elliptic if and only if $ h $ is closable , the semigroup $ S $ is conservative and $ K $ satisfies Gaussian bounds .
3	The resident gas of mass Mb~10^4-10^7 Msun in low spin ( initial dimensionless spin parameter lambda & lt ; = 0.01 ) halos with a velocity dispersion sigmav & lt ; = 11km/s would be compressed by a factor of ~100 in radius and form self -gravitating baryonic systems .	Gas rich sub-galactic halos with mass Mt & lt ; = 10^7.5 Msun , while incapable of forming stars due to lack of adequate coolants , contain a large fraction of baryonic mass at cosmological reionization .	We show that the reionization of the universe at z=10-20 has an interesting physical effect on these halos .	The external radiation field causes a synchronous inward propagation of an ionization front towards each halo , resulting in an inward , convergent shock .	Under the assumption that such compressed gaseous systems fragment to form stars , the final stellar systems will have a size 2-40pc , velocity dispersion 1-10km/s and a total stellar mass of M* 10^3-10^6 Msun .
2	Theoretically , some quantum spin liquids ( QSLs ) -- new topological phases which can occur when quantum fluctuations preclude an ordered state -- are known to exhibit Majorana fermions as quasiparticles arising from fractionalization of spins .	Conventionally ordered magnets possess bosonic elementary excitations , called magnons .	By contrast , no magnetic insulators in more than one dimension are known whose excitations are not bosons but fermions .	Alas , despite much searching , their experimental observation remains elusive .	Here , we show that fermionic excitations are remarkably directly evident in experimental Raman scattering data across a broad energy and temperature range in the two-dimensional material $ \alpha $ -RuCl $ _3 $ .
0	Almost all cosmologists accept nowadays that the redshift of the galaxies is due to the expansion of the Universe ( cosmological redshift ) , plus some Doppler effect of peculiar motions , but can we be sure of this fact by means of some other independent cosmological test ?	Here I will review some recent tests : CMBR temperature versus redshift , time dilation , the Hubble diagram , the Tolman or surface brightness test , the angular size test , the UV surface brightness limit and the Alcock -- Paczy\'nski test .	Some tests favour expansion and others favour a static Universe .	Almost all the cosmological tests are susceptible to the evolution of galaxies and/or other effects .	Tolman or angular size tests need to assume very strong evolution of galaxy sizes to fit the data with the standard cosmology , whereas the Alcock -- Paczynski test , an evaluation of the ratio of observed angular size to radial/redshift size , is independent of it .
4	In particular , the role of strange degrees of freedom in the nucleon is investigated for both the vector and axial -- vector current matrix elements .	The description of baryons as soliton solutions of effective meson theories for three flavor ( up , down , strange ) degrees of freedom is reviewed and the phenomenological implications are illuminated .	In the collective approach the soliton configuration is equipped with baryon quantum numbers by canonical quantization of the coordinates describing the flavor orientation .	The baryon spectrum resulting from exact diagonalization of the collective Hamiltonian is discussed .	The prediction of static properties such as the baryon magnetic moments and the Cabibbo matrix elements for semi -- leptonic hyperon decays are explored with regard to the influence of flavor symmetry breaking .
2	The structure of the game is hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum management game proposed in the literature .	In the first part of this paper , we have studied solely the spectrum sharing aspect of the above problem , and proposed algorithms for the CUs in the single AP network to efficiently share the spectrum .	In this second part of the paper , we build upon our previous understanding of the single AP network , and formulate the joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing problem in a multiple AP network into a non-cooperative game , in which the feasible strategy of a player contains a discrete variable ( the AP/spectrum decision ) and a continuous vector ( the power allocation among multiple channels ) .	We provide characterization of the Nash Equilibrium ( NE ) of this game , and present a set of novel algorithms that allow the CUs to distributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and share the channels with other CUs .	Finally , we study the properties of the proposed algorithms as well as their performance via extensive simulations .
0	In this work we present a generalization of the recently developed Hardy-like logical proof of contextuality and of the so-called KCBS contextuality inequality for any qudit of dimension greater than three .	Our approach uses compatibility graphs that can only be satisfied by qudits .	We find a construction for states and measurements that satisfy these graphs and demonstrate both logical and inequality based contextuality for qudits .	Interestingly , the quantum violation of the inequality is constant as dimension increases .	We also discuss the issue of imprecision in experimental implementations of contextuality tests and a way of addressing this problem using the notion of ontological faithfulness .
4	We prove that Sturmian words , and more generally Arnoux-Rauzy words and some morphic images of them , have the WELLDOC property .	In this paper we study how certain families of aperiodic infinite words can be used to produce aperiodic pseudorandom number generators ( PRNGs ) with good statistical behavior .	We introduce the \emph { well distributed occurrences } ( WELLDOC ) combinatorial property for infinite words , which guarantees absence of the lattice structure defect in related pseudorandom number generators .	An infinite word $ u $ on a $ d $ -ary alphabet has the WELLDOC property if , for each factor $ w $ of $ u $ , positive integer $ m $ , and vector $ \mathbf v\in\mathbb Z_ { m } ^ { d } $ , there is an occurrence of $ w $ such that the Parikh vector of the prefix of $ u $ preceding such occurrence is congruent to $ \mathbf v $ modulo $ m $ .	( The Parikh vector of a finite word $ v $ over an alphabet $ \mathcal A $ has its $ i $ -th component equal to the number of occurrences of the $ i $ -th letter of $ \mathcal A $ in $ v $ . )
0	We study a finite dimensional quadratic graded algebra R defined from a finite ranked poset .	This algebra has been central to the study of the splitting algebra of the poset , A , as introduced by Gelfand , Retakh , Serconek and Wilson .	The algebra A is known to be quadratic when the poset satisfies a combinatorial condition known as uniform , and R is the quadratic dual of an associated graded algebra of A .	We prove that R is Koszul and the poset is uniform if and only if the poset is Cohen-Macaulay .	Koszulity of R implies Koszulity of A .
2	In particular , we prove that the GH and the GGH uniformities previously introduced on the moduli space of isometry classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes are different , but the Cauchy sequences which give rise to well-defined limit spaces coincide .	This is the last article in a series of three initiated by the second author .	We elaborate on the concepts and theorems constructed in the previous articles .	We then examine properties of the strong metric introduced earlier on each spacetime , and answer some questions concerning causality of limit spaces .	Progress is made towards a general definition of causality , and it is proven that the GGH limit of a Cauchy sequence of $ \mathcal { C } ^ { \pm } _ { \alpha } $ , path metric Lorentz spaces is again a $ \mathcal { C } ^ { \pm } _ { \alpha } $ , path metric Lorentz space .
1	Our method and setting differs from many stochastic optimization approaches in two principal ways .	In this paper we consider the use of probabilistic or random models within a classical trust-region framework for optimization of deterministic smooth general nonlinear functions .	Firstly , we assume that the value of the function itself can be computed without noise , in other words , that the function is deterministic .	Secondly , we use random models of higher quality than those produced by usual stochastic gradient methods .	In particular , a first order model based on random approximation of the gradient is required to provide sufficient quality of approximation with probability greater than or equal to 1/2 .
1	After Fourier decomposing the Green function , its two natural contributions are given by poles ( quasinormal modes ) and a largely unexplored branch cut in the complex-frequency plane .	Linear field perturbations of a black hole are described by the Green function of the wave equation that they obey .	We present new analytic methods for calculating the branch cut on a Schwarzschild black hole for arbitrary values of the frequency .	The branch cut yields a power-law tail decay for late times in the response of a black hole to an initial perturbation .	We determine explicitly the first three orders in the power-law and show that the branch cut also yields a new logarithmic behaviour $ T^ { -2\ell-5 } \ln ( T ) $ for late times .
3	We address these problems by combining two ideas : first we approximate the kernel matrix using a cleverly sampled subset of its columns using the Nystr\ '' { o } m method ; secondly , as we wish to avoid using this matrix altogether , we decompose it by SVD to form new `` virtual samples , '' on which any linear dictionary learning can be employed .	In this paper we present a new approach of incorporating kernels into dictionary learning .	The kernel K-SVD algorithm ( KKSVD ) , which has been introduced recently , shows an improvement in classification performance , with relation to its linear counterpart K-SVD .	However , this algorithm requires the storage and handling of a very large kernel matrix , which leads to high computational cost , while also limiting its use to setups with small number of training examples .	Our method , termed `` Linearized Kernel Dictionary Learning '' ( LKDL ) can be seamlessly applied as a pre-processing stage on top of any efficient off-the-shelf dictionary learning scheme , effectively `` kernelizing '' it .
3	The central beam-averaged dust temperatures obtained for B68 and L1689B are 9.3 $ \pm $ 0.5 K and 9.8 $ \pm $ 0.5 K , respectively , which are lower than the temperatures of 11.3 K and 11.6 K obtained from direct SED fitting .	Utilizing multi-wavelength dust emission maps acquired with $ Herschel $ , we reconstruct local volume density and dust temperature profiles for the prestellar cores B68 and L1689B using inverse-Abel transform based technique .	We present intrinsic radial dust temperature profiles of starless cores directly from dust continuum emission maps disentangling the effect of temperature variations along the line of sight which was previously limited to the radiative transfer calculations .	The reconstructed dust temperature profiles show a significant drop in core center , a flat inner part , and a rising outward trend until the background cloud temperature is reached .	The best mass estimates derived by integrating the volume density profiles of B68 and L1689B are 1.6 M_sol and 11 M_sol , respectively .
4	In this way we predict a smooth transition from a deep-inelastic to a fragmentation reaction mechanism .	In this paper we discuss the reaction mechanisms that occur in the overlap zone for semi-peripheral heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .	In particular we focus on the development of neck instabilities , that could determine a possible increase of dynamical fluctuations .	As observed in recent experimental data , at beam energies just above 10 MeV/A the most relevant expected consequence is the possibility to obtain large variances in the projectile-like and target-like observables .	With increasing beam energy we pass to a mid-rapidity fragment production .
1	Currently most systems only classify dataset with a couple of dozens different actions .	The gesture recognition using motion capture data and depth sensors has recently drawn more attention in vision recognition .	Moreover , feature extraction from the data is often computational complex .	In this paper , we propose a novel system to recognize the actions from skeleton data with simple , but effective , features using deep neural networks .	Features are extracted for each frame based on the relative positions of joints ( PO ) , temporal differences ( TD ) , and normalized trajectories of motion ( NT ) .
1	The magneto-rotational instability ( MRI ) requires a minimum ionisation fraction to drive turbulence in a disc .	Angular momentum is transported outwards through an accretion disc by magnetohydrodynamical ( MHD ) turbulence thus allowing material to accrete on to the central object .	The inner parts of the disc around a young stellar object are sufficiently hot to be thermally ionised .	Further out , cosmic rays ionise the surface layers and a dead zone forms at the mid-plane where the disc is too cool for the MRI to operate .	The surface density in the turbulent active layer is often assumed to be constant with radius because the cosmic rays penetrate a constant layer .
3	In addition , an extra dispersionless impurity band of zero energy due to particle-hole symmetry is found .	We investigate the vacancy effects on quasiparticle band structure of graphene near the Dirac point .	It is found that each Dirac nodal point splits into two new nodal points due to the coherent scattering among vacancies .	The splitting energy between the two nodal points is proportional to the square root of vacancy concentration .	Our theory offers an excellent explanation to the recent experiments .
4	The increase of parton densities at small $ x $ as well as new means to disentangle experimentally soft and hard physics are considered .	Coherence phenomena , and the non-universality of parton structure of the effective Pomeron are explained .	New hard phenomena directly calculable in QCD such as diffractive electroproduction of states with $ M^2\ll Q^2 $ as well as new options to measure the light-cone wave functions of various hadrons are considered .	An analogue of Bjorken scaling is predicted for the diffractive electroproduction of $ \rho $ mesons at large momentum transfers and for the production of large rapidity gap events , as observed at HERA .	A phenomenological QCD evolution equation is suggested to calculate the basic characteristics of the large rapidity gap events .
1	The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of $ 2.0\mathrm { \ , fb } ^ { -1 } $ recorded with the LHCb detector .	Measurements are presented of electroweak boson production using data from $ pp $ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $ \sqrt { s } = 8\mathrm { \ , Te\kern -0.1em V } $ .	The bosons are identified in the $ W\rightarrow\mu\nu $ and $ Z\rightarrow\mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } $ decay channels .	The cross-sections are measured for muons in the pseudorapidity range $ 2.0 & lt ; \eta & lt ; 4.5 $ , with transverse momenta $ p_ { \rm T } & gt ; 20 { \mathrm { \ , Ge\kern -0.1em V\ ! / } c } $ and , in the case of the $ Z $ boson , a dimuon mass within $ 60 & lt ; M_ { \mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } } & lt ; 120 { \mathrm { \ , Ge\kern -0.1em V\ ! / } c^ { 2 } } $ .	The results are \begin { align* } \sigma_ { W^ { + } \rightarrow\mu^ { + } \nu } & amp ; = 1093.6 \pm 2.1 \pm 7.2 \pm 10.9 \pm 12.7 { \rm \ , pb } \ , , \sigma_ { W^ { - } \rightarrow\mu^ { - } \bar { \nu } } & amp ; = \phantom { 0 } 818.4 \pm 1.9 \pm 5.0 \pm \phantom { 0 } 7.0 \pm \phantom { 0 } 9.5 { \rm \ , pb } \ , , \sigma_ { Z\rightarrow\mu^ { + } \mu^ { - } } & amp ; = \phantom { 00 } 95.0 \pm 0.3 \pm 0.7 \pm \phantom { 0 } 1.1 \pm \phantom { 0 } 1.1 { \rm \ , pb } \ , , \end { align* } where the first uncertainties are statistical , the second are systematic , the third are due to the knowledge of the LHC beam energy and the fourth are due to the luminosity determination .
3	Each portion of the model requires specification of a parameter that is not known a-priori .	We present and test the coupled wake boundary layer ( CWBL ) model that describes the distribution of the power output in a wind-farm .	The model couples the traditional , industry-standard wake model approach with a `` top-down '' model for the overall wind-farm boundary layer structure .	This wake model captures the effect of turbine positioning , while the `` top-down '' portion of the model adds the interactions between the wind-turbine wakes and the atmospheric boundary layer .	For the wake model , the wake expansion coefficient is required , while the `` top-down '' model requires an effective spanwise turbine spacing within which the model 's momentum balance is relevant .
4	The resulting multiplicity function , of slope alpha= -2.08 +- 0.07 , strongly resembles a power law .	The multiplicity function ( MF ) of groups and clusters of galaxies is determined using galaxy catalogues extracted from a set of Digitized Palomar Sky Survey ( DPOSS ) plates .	The two different types of structures ( of low and high richness ) were identified using two different algorithms : a modified version of the van Albada method for groups , and a peak finding algorithm for larger structures.In a 300 sq.deg .	area up to z & lt ; 0.2 , we find 2944 groups and 179 clusters .	Our MF covers a wide range of richnesses , from 2 to 200 , and the two MF 's derived by the two algorithms match smoothly without the need for additional conditions or normalisations .
2	The relative errors do not exceed about 2 % and 4 % , respectively .	The computed $ \log ( \tau/ { \rm y } ) $ - $ \log ( m/m_\odot ) $ relation for the stellar initial mass range , 0.6-120.0 , and the stellar initial metallicity range , 0.0004-0.0500 , tabulated in an earlier attempt ( Portinari et al .	1998 ) is fitted to a good extent by a four-parameter curve , expressed by a double power-law , for assigned stellar initial metallicity , which can be reduced to a three-parameter curve , expressed by a single power-law , for the whole set of stellar initial metallicities .	The extent to which the interpolation curve , expressed by a single power-law , can be extrapolated towards both high-mass and low-mass stars , is also investigated .	High-mass star lifetimes are understimated by a factor less than 2 up to $ m/m_\odot= 1000 $ and by a fiducial factor less than 4 up to infinite .
3	In particular the testbed will be compatible with both AFTA-like and ATLAST-like aperture shapes , respectively on-axis monolithic , and on-axis segmented telescopes .	We present a new high-contrast imaging testbed designed to provide complete solutions in wavefront sensing , control and starlight suppression with complex aperture telescopes .	The testbed was designed to enable a wide range of studies of the effects of such telescope geometries , with primary mirror segmentation , central obstruction , and spiders .	The associated diffraction features in the point spread function make high-contrast imaging more challenging .	The testbed optical design was developed using a novel approach to define the layout and surface error requirements to minimize amplitude-induced errors at the target contrast level performance .
4	We use the sample of spectroscopically confirmed DRGs to establish the high quality ( scatter in \Delta z/ ( 1+z ) of ~ 0.05 ) of their photometric redshifts in the considered deep fields , as derived with EAZY ( Brammer et al.2008 ) .	We present optical spectroscopic follow-up of a sample of Distant Red Galaxies ( DRGs ) with K & lt ; 22.5 ( Vega ) , selected by J-K & gt ; 2.3 , in the Hubble Deep Field South , the MS 1054-03 field , and the Chandra Deep Field South .	Spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 15 DRGs .	Only 2 out of 15 DRGs are located at z & lt ; 2 , suggesting a high efficiency to select high-redshift sources .	From other spectroscopic surveys in the CDFS targeting intermediate to high redshift populations selected with different criteria , we find spectroscopic redshifts for a further 30 DRGs .
2	We explore to what extent supernova ( SN ) luminosity distance measurements provide evidence for such a transition : we show that , contrary to intuition , the well-known `` turnover '' in the SN distance residuals $ \Delta\mu $ relative to an empty ( Milne ) model does not give firm evidence for such a transition within the redshift range spanned by SN data .	Standard cosmological models based on general relativity ( GR ) with dark energy predict that the Universe underwent a transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion at a moderate redshift $ z_ { acc } \sim 0.7 $ .	Clearly , it is of great interest to directly measure this transition in a model-independent way , without the assumption that GR is the correct theory of gravity .	The observed turnover in that diagram is predominantly due to the negative curvature in the Milne model , { \em not } the deceleration predicted by $ \Lambda $ CDM and relatives .	We show that there are several advantages in plotting distance residuals against a flat , non-accelerating model $ ( w = -1/3 ) $ , and also remapping the $ z- $ axis to $ u = \ln ( 1+z ) $ ; we outline a number of useful and intuitive properties of this presentation .
1	The whole RXTE data acquired in the 2004-2005 outburst were utilized .	We report on changes of the cyclotron resonance energies of the recurrent transient pulsar , X0331+53 ( V0332+53 ) .	The 3-80 keV source luminosity varied between 1.7x10^36 and 3.5x10^38 ers/s , assuming a distance of 7 kpc .	We confirmed that the fundamental cyclotron resonance energy changed from ~22 to ~27 keV in a clear anti-correlation to the source luminosity , and without any hysteresis effects between the rising and declining phases of the outburst .	In contrast , the second harmonic energy changed from ~49 to ~54 keV , implying a weaker fractional change as a function of the luminosity .
2	It is found that an extension of the Wulff construction allows for the calculation of two-dimensional domain shapes when each segment of the perimeter has an energy that depends both on its orientation and its location .	A domain in a Langmuir monolayer can be expected to have a shape that reflects the textural anisotropy of the material it contains .	This paper explores the consequences of XY-like ordering .	This generalized Wulff construction , and newly-derived exact expressions for the order parameter texture in a circular domain , lead to results for the shape of a large domain .	The most striking result is that under general conditions such domains will inevitably develop cusps .
1	Theoretical results include necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of regeneration for central limit theorems for ergodic Markov chains and a regenerative proof of a CLT version for uniformly ergodic Markov chains with $ E_ { \pi } f^2 & lt ; \infty. $ To obtain asymptotic confidence intervals for MCMC estimators , strongly consistent estimators of the asymptotic variance are essential .	In the thesis we take the split chain approach to analyzing Markov chains and use it to establish fixed-width results for estimators obtained via Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures ( MCMC ) .	We relax assumptions required to obtain such estimators .	Moreover , under a drift condition , nonasymptotic fixed-width results for MCMC estimators for a general state space setting ( not necessarily compact ) and not necessarily bounded target function $ f $ are obtained .	The last chapter is devoted to the idea of adaptive Monte Carlo simulation and provides convergence results and law of large numbers for adaptive procedures under path-stability condition for transition kernels .
3	Remarkably , it becomes possible to drive the system into one of the following regime : the state of zero transport , the state of directed transport and most importantly the state of reverse transport ( current reversal ) .	We consider a deterministic chaotic ratchet model for which the driving force is designed to allow the rectification of current as well as the control of chaos of the system .	Besides the amplitude of the symmetric driving force which is often used in this framework as control parameter , a phase has been newly included here .	Exploring this phase , responsible of the asymmetry of the driven force , a number of interesting departures have been revealed .	To have a full control of the system , a current reversal diagram has been computed thereby clearly showing the entire transport spectrum which is expected to be of interest for possible experiments in this model .
4	As the number of electrons is varied several correlated structures are found that are commensurate/incommensurate with the periodic dot system .	A linearly coupled chain of spin-polarized quantum dots is investigated under the condition that the number of electrons is equal to or less than the number of the dots .	The chemical potential of the system , $ \mu_ { N } =E ( N ) -E ( N-1 ) $ , satisfies , $ ( \mu_ { N } +\mu_ { N_ { \ell } +2-N ) } /2 \approx V+2t ( N , N_ { \ell } , V , E ( N ) $ and $ t $ are the number of electrons , the number of dots , and the strength of nearest neighbor electron-electron interactions , the total groundstate energy and the hopping integral between two adjacent dots ) .	This property will be reflected in the spacing between the conductance peaks .	The electron density structures are determined using a quantum Monte Carlo method .
2	In fact , actively controlling the phase of individual photons has been identified as a powerful resource for quantum communication protocols .	While the phase of a coherent light field can be precisely known , the phase of the individual photons that create this field , considered individually , can not .	Phase changes within single-photon wave packets , however , have observable effects .	Here we demonstrate the arbitrary phase control of a single photon .	The phase modulation is applied without affecting the photon 's amplitude profile and is verified via a two-photon quantum interference measurement , which can result in the fermionic spatial behaviour of photon pairs .
0	The origin of gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) prompt emission , bursts of gamma-rays lasting from shorter than one second to thousands of seconds , remains not fully understood after more than 40 years of observations .	The uncertainties lie in several open questions in the GRB physics , including jet composition , energy dissipation mechanism , particle acceleration mechanism , and radiation mechanism .	Recent broad-band observations of prompt emission with Fermi sharpen the debates in these areas , which stimulated intense theoretical investigations invoking very different ideas .	I will review these debates , and argue that the current data suggest the following picture : A quasi-thermal spectral component originating from the photosphere of the relativistic ejecta has been detected in some GRBs .	Even though in some cases ( e.g.GRB 090902B ) this component dominates the spectrum , in most GRBs , this component either forms a sub-dominant `` shoulder '' spectral component in the low energy spectral regime of the more dominant `` Band '' component , or is not detectable at all .
2	Such a strategy can not be used for nanostructures with finite dimensions which are typically much larger than it is possible to simulate directly .	Recent molecular dynamics simulation methods have enabled thermal conductivity of bulk materials to be estimated .	In these simulations , periodic boundary conditions are used to extend the system dimensions to the thermodynamic limit .	To bridge the length scales between the simulated and the actual nanostructures , we perform large-scale molecular dynamics calculations of thermal conductivities at different system dimensions to examine a recently developed conductivity vs. dimension scaling theory for both film and wire configurations .	We demonstrate that by an appropriate application of the scaling law , reliable interpolations can be used to accurately predict thermal conductivity of films and wires as a function of film thickness or wire radius at realistic length scales from molecular dynamics simulations .
2	The times change however and today 's ( aspiring ) computer scientists are less proficient in building automata or composing functions and are much more native to the world of programming languages .	The field of computability and complexity was , where computer science sprung from .	Turing , Church , and Kleene all developed formalisms that demonstrated what they held `` intuitively computable '' .	This article will try to introduce typical concepts of computability theory and complexity in a form more fitted for a modern developer .	It is mostly based on \cite { jones } , but takes input from other sources to provide examples , additional information , etc .
0	We focus on the influence of external sources of information upon financial markets .	In particular , we develop a stochastic agent-based market model characterized by a certain herding behavior as well as allowing traders to be influenced by an external dynamic signal of information .	This signal can be interpreted as a time-varying advertising , public perception or rumor , in favor or against one of two possible trading behaviors , thus breaking the symmetry of the system and acting as a continuously varying exogenous shock .	As an illustration , we use a well-known German Indicator of Economic Sentiment as information input and compare our results with Germany 's leading stock market index , the DAX , in order to calibrate some of the model parameters .	We study the conditions for the ensemble of agents to more accurately follow the information input signal .
1	A broad superconducting ( SC ) region exists in the T-p phase diagram .	Low-temperature ( T ) heat-capacity measurements under hydrostatic pressure of up to p=2.1 GPa have been performed on single-crystalline CeCu2Si2 .	In the low-pressure region antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and in the high-pressure region valence fluctuations had previously been proposed to mediate Cooper pairing .	We could identify these two distinct SC regions .	We found different thermodynamic properties of the SC phase in both regions , supporting the proposal that different mechanisms might be implied in the formation of superconductivity .
3	Our two main theorems establish that despite the computational speed-up , statistical optimality is retained : as long as m is not too large , the partition-based estimator achieves the statistical minimax rate over all estimators using the set of N samples .	We establish optimal convergence rates for a decomposition-based scalable approach to kernel ridge regression .	The method is simple to describe : it randomly partitions a dataset of size N into m subsets of equal size , computes an independent kernel ridge regression estimator for each subset , then averages the local solutions into a global predictor .	This partitioning leads to a substantial reduction in computation time versus the standard approach of performing kernel ridge regression on all N samples .	As concrete examples , our theory guarantees that the number of processors m may grow nearly linearly for finite-rank kernels and Gaussian kernels and polynomially in N for Sobolev spaces , which in turn allows for substantial reductions in computational cost .
1	Above critical field , the ground state antiferromagnetic configuration of Eu $ ^ { 2+ } $ moments transforms into a ferromagnetic structure with moments along the applied field direction .	We have studied a EuFe2As2 single crystal by neutron diffraction under magnetic fields up to 3.5 T and temperatures down to 2 K. A field induced spin reorientation is observed in the presence of a magnetic field along both the a and c axes , respectively .	The magnetic phase diagram for Eu magnetic sublattice in EuFe2As2 is presented .	A considerable strain ( $ \sim $ 0.9 % ) is induced by the magnetic field , caused by the realignment of the twinning structure .	Furthermore , the realignment of the twinning structure is found to be reversible with the rebound of magnetic field , which suggested the existence of magnetic shape-memory effect .
1	In models where the $ B $ quark also carries charge under a new gauge group , new decay channels may dominate .	Heavy vector-like quarks of charge $ -1/3 $ , $ B $ , have been searched for at the LHC through the decays $ B\rightarrow bZ , \ , bh , \ , tW $ .	We focus on the case where the $ B $ is charged under a $ U ( 1 ) ^\prime $ and describe simple models where the dominant decay mode is $ B\rightarrow bZ^\prime\rightarrow b ( b\bar { b } ) $ .	With the inclusion of dark matter such models can explain the excess of gamma rays from the Galactic center .	We develop a search strategy for this decay chain and estimate that with integrated luminosity of 300 fb $ ^ { -1 } $ the LHC will have the potential to discover both the $ B $ and the $ Z ' $ for $ B $ quarks with mass below $ \sim 1.6 $ TeV , for a broad range of $ Z ' $ masses .
2	We show that flat directions satisfying the slow roll conditions exist only if R-symmetry is broken .	Using the universal X superfield that measures in the UV the violation of conformal invariance we build up a model of multifield inflation .	The underlying dynamics is the one controlling the natural flow of this field in the IR to the Goldstino superfield once SUSY is broken .	Naturalness of our model leads to scales of SUSY breaking of the order of 10^ { 11-13 } Gev , a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the initial perturbations and negligible gravitational waves .	We obtain that the inflaton field is lighter than the gravitino by an amount determined by the slow roll parameter eta .
0	The absolute magnitude and perihelion distributions of long-period comets are derived , using data from the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research ( LINEAR ) survey .	The results are surprising in three ways .	Firstly , the flux of comets through the inner solar system is much lower than some previous estimates .	Secondly , the expected rise in comet numbers to larger perihelia is not seen .	Thirdly , the number of comets per unit absolute magnitude does not significantly rise to fainter magnitudes .
0	In this paper we investigate the applicability of standard model checking approaches to verifying properties in probabilistic programming .	As the operational model for a standard probabilistic program is a potentially infinite parametric Markov decision process , no direct adaption of existing techniques is possible .	Therefore , we propose an on-the-fly approach where the operational model is successively created and verified via a step-wise execution of the program .	This approach enables to take key features of many probabilistic programs into account : nondeterminism and conditioning .	We discuss the restrictions and demonstrate the scalability on several benchmarks .
2	However , we recently showed that the phase residuals are energy dependent , and thus phase coherent solutions must be computed referring always to the same energy band .	Since the last phase coherent timing solution of the nearby radio-quiet isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 six new XMM-Newton and three Chandra observations were carried out .	The phase coherent timing solutions from previous authors were performed without restricting to a fixed energy band .	We updated the phase coherent timing solution for RX J0720.4-3125 by including the recent XMM-Newton EPIC-pn , MOS1 , MOS2 and Chandra ACIS data in the energy range 400-1000~eV .	Altogether these observations cover a time span of almost 10~yrs .
1	Gas and dust properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent disk models for the dust and CO emission .	We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations of the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI , SMA and VLA arrays both in continuum and in the 12CO , 13CO and C18O emission lines .	The circumstellar disk is resolved both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun .	The disk inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position angle of 128+-4 deg .	The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7 mm ( beta=1 ) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane .
2	In an effective potential formalism , we find excellent correlation between potential minima and { \em Escherichia coli } promoter recognition sites in the T7 bacteriophage genome .	We investigate the sequence-dependent behaviour of localised excitations in a toy , nonlinear model of DNA base-pair opening originally proposed by Salerno .	Specifically we ask whether `` breather '' solitons could play a role in the facilitated location of promoters by RNA polymerase .	Evidence for a similar relationship between phage promoters and downstream coding regions is found and alternative reasons for links between AT richness and transcriptionally-significant sites are discussed .	Consideration of the soliton energy of translocation provides a novel dynamical picture of sliding : steep potential gradients correspond to deterministic motion , while `` flat '' regions , corresponding to homogeneous AT or GC content , are governed by random , thermal motion .
0	All-optical amplification of the light pulse in a weakly coupled two nonlinear photonic crystal waveguides ( PCWs ) is proposed .	We consider pillar-type PCWs , which consist of the periodically distributed circular rods made from a Kerr-type dielectric material .	Dispersion diagrams of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes are calculated .	The operating frequency is properly chosen to be located at the edge of the dispersion diagram of the modes .	In the linear case no propagation modes are excited at this frequency , however , in case of nonlinear medium when the amplitude of the injected signal is above some threshold value , the solitons are formed and they are propagating inside the coupled nonlinear PCWs .
3	The first is a combination of the annihilation and scattering processes 2A- & gt ; 0 , 2A- & gt ; 2B , 2B- & gt ; 2A , and 2B- & gt ; 0 .	Reaction-diffusion systems which include processes of the form A+A- & gt ; A or A+A- & gt ; 0 are characterised by the appearance of `imaginary ' multiplicative noise terms in an effective Langevin-type description .	However , if `real ' as well as `imaginary ' noise is present , then competition between the two could potentially lead to novel behaviour .	We thus investigate the asymptotic properties of the following two `mixed noise ' reaction-diffusion systems .	We demonstrate ( to all orders in perturbation theory ) that this system belongs to the same universality class as the single species annihilation reaction 2A- & gt ; 0 .
0	Nowadays , engineers have to develop software often without even knowing which hardware it will eventually run on in numerous mobile phones , tablets , desktops , laptops , data centers , supercomputers and cloud services .	Unfortunately , optimizing compilers are not keeping pace with ever increasing complexity of computer systems anymore and may produce severely underperforming executable codes while wasting expensive resources and energy .	We present our practical and collaborative solution to this problem via light-weight wrappers around any software piece when more than one implementation or optimization choice available .	These wrappers are connected with a public Collective Mind autotuning infrastructure and repository of knowledge ( c-mind.org/repo ) to continuously monitor various important characteristics of these pieces ( computational species ) across numerous existing hardware configurations together with randomly selected optimizations .	Similar to natural sciences , we can now continuously track winning solutions ( optimizations for a given hardware ) that minimize all costs of a computation ( execution time , energy spent , code size , failures , memory and storage footprint , optimization time , faults , contentions , inaccuracy and so on ) of a given species on a Pareto frontier along with any unexpected behavior .
4	Such skyrmion chain survives even as the width of nanostripe is much larger than the single skyrmion size .	The emergence of a topologically nontrivial vortex-like magnetic structure , the magnetic skyrmion , has launched new concepts for memory devices .	There , extensive studies have theoretically demonstrated the ability to encode information bits by using a chain of skyrmions in one-dimensional nanostripes .	Here , we report the first experimental observation of the skyrmion chain in FeGe nanostripes by using high resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy .	Under an applied field normal to the nanostripes plane , we observe that the helical ground states with distorted edge spins would evolves into individual skyrmions , which assemble in the form of chain at low field and move collectively into the center of nanostripes at elevated field .
0	In this paper we study the properties of two-qubit gates .	We review the most common parameterizations for the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates and the connections between them .	We then introduce a new discrete local invariant , namely the number of local degrees of freedom that a gate can bind .	The value of this invariant is calculated analytically for all the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates .	We find that almost all two-qubit gates can bind the full six local degrees of freedom and are in this sense more effective than the controlled-NOT gate , which only can bind four local degrees of freedom .
0	One of reasons preventing a wider uptake of model-based testing in the industry is the difficulty which is encountered by developers when trying to think in terms of properties rather than linear specifications .	A disparity has traditionally been perceived between the language spoken by customers who specify the system and the language required to construct models of that system .	The dynamic nature of the specifications for commercial systems further aggravates this problem in that models would need to be rechecked after every specification change .	In this paper , we propose an approach for converting specifications written in the commonly-used quasi-natural language Gherkin into models for use with a model-based testing tool .	We have instantiated this approach using QuickCheck and demonstrate its applicability via a case study on the eHealth system , the national health portal for Maltese residents .
1	In this work we present a comparison of available results normalized to its value in photons/MeV for the 337 nm band at 1013 hPa and 293 K. The conversion of photons/m to photons/MeV requires an accurate determination of the energy deposited by the electrons in the field of view of the experimental set-up .	Experimental results of the absolute air-fluorescence yield are given very often in different units ( photons/MeV or photons/m ) and for different wavelength intervals .	We have calculated the energy deposition for each experiment by means of a detailed Monte Carlo simulation and the results have been compared with those assumed or calculated by the authors .	As a result , corrections to the reported fluorescence yields are proposed .	These corrections improve the compatibility between measurements in such a way that a reliable average value with uncertainty at the level of 5 % is obtained .
3	We further discuss alternative and more general forms of $ G ( k , z ) $ that are possible .	The general problem of representing the Greens function $ G ( k , z ) $ in terms of self energy , in field theories lacking Wick 's theorem , is considered .	A simple construction shows that a Dyson like representation with a self energy $ \Sigma ( k , z ) $ is always possible , provided we start with a spectral representation for $ G ( k , z ) $ for finite sized systems and take the thermodynamic limit .	The self energy itself can then be iteratively expressed in terms of another higher order self energy , capturing the spirit of Mori 's formulation .	In particular , a recent theory by the author of extremely correlated Fermi liquids at density `` $ n $ '' , for Gutzwiller projected non canonical Fermi operators obtains a new form of the Greens function : $ $ G ( k , z ) = \frac { \ { 1- \frac { n } { 2 } \ } + \Psi ( k , z ) } { z - \hat { E } _k - \Phi ( k , z ) } , $ $ with { \em a pair of self energies } $ \Phi ( z ) $ and $ \Psi ( z ) $ .
3	Results are also presented for the light quark mass and the chiral condensate .	We present a determination of the strange quark mass for two flavours ( nf=2 ) of light dynamical quarks using the axial Ward identity .	The calculations are performed on the lattice using O ( a ) improved Wilson fermions and include a fully non-perturbative determination of the renormalisation constant .	In the continuum limit we find in the MSbar scheme at 2GeV , ms = 111 ( 6 ) ( 4 ) ( 6 ) MeV using the force scale r0 = 0.467fm , where the first error is statistical , the second and third are systematic due to the fit and scale uncertainties respectively .	The corresponding results are also given for r0=0.5fm .
0	Modifying the Kerr-Schild transformation used to generate black and white hole spacetimes , new dynamic black and white holes are obtained using a time-dependent Kerr-Schild scalar field .	Physical solutions are found for black holes that shrink with time and for white holes that expand with time .	The black hole spacetimes are physical only in the vicinity of the black hole , with the physical region increasing in radius with time .	The white hole spacetimes are physical throughout .	Unlike the standard Schwarzschild solution the singularities are non-isolated , since the time-dependence introduces a mass-energy distribution .
1	While BH binaries coalescences constitute a natural outcome of the cosmological standard model and galaxy mergers , their dynamical evolution is still poorly understood and therefore their abundances at different stages .	Supermassive black hole ( BH ) binaries would comprise the strongest sources of gravitational waves ( GW ) once they reach & lt ; & lt ; 1 pc separations , for both pulsar timing arrays ( PTAs ) and space based ( SB ) detectors .	We use a dynamical model for the decay of BH binaries coupled with a cosmological simulation and semi-empirical approaches to the occupation of haloes by galaxies and BHs , in order to follow the evolution of the properties distribution of galaxies hosting BH binaries candidates to decay due to GWs emission .	Our models allow us to relax simplifying hypothesis about the binaries occupation in galaxies and their mass , as well as redshift evolution .	Following previously proposed electromagnetic ( EM ) signatures of binaries in the subpc regime , that include spectral features and variability , we model possible distributions of such signatures and also set upper limits to their lifespan .
4	We discuss different configurations of the vortex sheets observed and to be observed in superfluid 3He-A .	The paper by Landau and Lifshitz on vortex sheets in rotating superfluid appeared in 1955 almost at the same time when Feynman published his paper on quantized vortices in superfluid 4He .	For a long time this paper has been considered as an error .	But 40 years later the vortex sheets have been detected in chiral superfluid 3He-A in the rotating cryostat constructed in the Olli Lounasmaa Low Temperature Laboratory ( Otaniemi , Finland ) .	The equation derived by Landau and Lifshits for the distance between the vortex sheets as a function of the angular velocity of rotation has been experimentally confirmed , which is the triumph of the theory .
1	No evidence for the existence of H++/ -- is observed .	A search for single production of doubly-charged Higgs bosons has been performed using 600.7 pb^-1 of e+e- collision data with sqrt ( s ) =189 -- 209GeV collected by the OPAL detector at LEP .	Upper limits on the Yukawa coupling of the H++/ -- to like-signed electron pairs are derived .	Additionally , indirect constraints on the Yukawa coupling from Bhabha scattering , where the H++/ -- would contribute via t-channel exchange , are derived for M ( H++/ -- ) & lt ; 2TeV .	These are the first results for both a single production search and constraints from Bhabha scattering reported from LEP .
4	As a necessary step in the proof , we obtain a non-trivial bound on exponential sums of the form $ \sum_ { m=1 } ^q e ( \frac { am^k } { q } ) $ .	In 1918 , Hardy and Ramanujan published a seminal paper which included an asymptotic formula for the partition function .	In their paper , they also claim without proof an asymptotic equivalence for $ p^k ( n ) $ , the number of partitions of a number $ n $ into $ k $ -th powers .	In this paper , we provide an asymptotic formula for $ p^k ( n ) $ , using the Hardy-Littlewood Circle Method .	We also provide a formula for the difference function $ p^k ( n+1 ) -p^k ( n ) $ .
1	This relation is better seen when using a group-based concept of moving frame introduced by Fels and Olver in [ Acta Appl.Math .	In this paper we present an overview of the connection between completely integrable systems and the background geometry of the flow .	51 ( 1998 ) , 161-213 ; 55 ( 1999 ) , 127-208 ] .	The paper discusses the close connection between different types of geometries and the type of equations they realize .	In particular , we describe the direct relation between symmetric spaces and equations of KdV-type , and the possible geometric origins of this connection .
2	We study the survival probability as a function of initial capitals and express its bivariate transform through two univariate boundary transforms , where one of the initial capitals is fixed at 0 .	We consider a bivariate Cramer-Lundberg-type risk reserve process with the special feature that each insurance company agrees to cover the deficit of the other .	It is assumed that the capital transfers between the companies are instantaneous and incur a certain proportional cost , and that ruin occurs when neither company can cover the deficit of the other .	We identify these boundary transforms in the case when claims arriving at each company form two independent processes .	The expressions are in terms of Wiener-Hopf factors associated to two auxiliary compound Poisson processes .
1	In this paper , we investigate the compatibility of this duality with time-reversal symmetry .	Electric-magnetic duality ( $ S $ -duality ) is a well-known property of pure $ u ( 1 ) $ gauge theory in 3+1 dimensions .	We consider two theories obtained by coupling a Dirac fermion with an `` inverted '' sign of the mass $ m $ to a $ u ( 1 ) $ gauge field .	Time-reversal in the two theories is implemented respectively via the $ T $ and $ CT $ symmetries of the Dirac fermion .	It was recently conjectured ( C. Wang and T. Senthil ( arXiv:1505.03520 ) , and M. Metlitski and A.Vishwanath ( arXiv:1505.05142 ) ) that in the $ |m| \to \infty $ limit these two theories are $ S $ -dual to each other .
3	At high relative inclinations , large-amplitude , periodic eccentricity perturbations can occur .	The most puzzling property of the extrasolar planets discovered by recent radial velocity surveys is their high orbital eccentricities , which are very difficult to explain within our current theoretical paradigm for planet formation .	Current data reveal that at least 25 % of these planets , including some with particularly high eccentricities , are orbiting a component of a binary star system .	The presence of a distant companion can cause significant secular perturbations in the orbit of a planet .	These are known as `` Kozai cycles '' and their amplitude is purely dependent on the relative orbital inclination .
0	We study some arithmetic properties of the mirror maps and the quantum Yukawa coupling for some 1-parameter deformations of Calabi-Yau manifolds .	First we use the Schwarzian differential equation , which we derived previously , to characterize the mirror map in each case .	For algebraic K3 surfaces , we solve the equation in terms of the $ J $ -function .	By deriving explicit modular relations we prove that some K3 mirror maps are algebraic over the genus zero function field $ { \bf Q } ( J ) $ .	This leads to a uniform proof that those mirror maps have integral Fourier coefficients .
1	In this study , we investigate the $ \eta'N $ 2body interaction which is the foundation of the in-medium $ \eta ' $ properties using the linear sigma model as a chiral effective model .	The $ \eta ' $ mass reduction in the nuclear medium is expected from the degeneracy of the pseudoscalar-singlet and octet mesons when chiral symmetry is manifest .	The $ \eta'N $ interaction in the linear sigma model comes from the scalar meson exchange with U $ _A $ ( 1 ) symmetry effect and is found to be fairly strong attraction .	Moreover , the $ \eta N $ transition is included in our calculation , and is important for the imaginary part of the $ \eta ' $ -optical potential .	The transition amplitude of $ \eta'N $ to the $ \eta N $ channel is relatively small compared to that of elastic channel .
1	The system RX J0921+4529 contains two z_s=1.66 quasars separated by 6 .	We report the discovery of a new two-image gravitational lens candidate .	`` 93 with an H band magnitude difference of $ \Delta m=1.39 $ .	The HST NIC2 H band images reveal an H=18.2 spiral galaxy between the quasar images , which is probably a member of a z_l=0.32 X-ray cluster centered on the field .	We detect an extended source near the fainter quasar image but not in the brighter image .
2	By contrast , inter-module connectivity is taken to be incomplete .	We compute spectra of symmetric random matrices defined on graphs exhibiting a modular structure .	Modules are initially introduced as fully connected sub-units of a graph .	Two different types of inter-module connectivity are considered , one where the number of intermodule connections per-node diverges , and one where this number remains finite in the infinite module-size limit .	In the first case , results can be understood as a perturbation of a superposition of semicircular spectral densities one would obtain for uncoupled modules .
2	The phase unwrapping problem is formulated as that of finding the ground state of a locally constrained , finite size , spin-L Ising model under a non-uniform magnetic field .	The use of Mean-Field theory to unwrap principal phase patterns has been recently proposed .	In this paper we generalize the Mean-Field approach to process phase patterns with arbitrary degree of undersampling .	The optimization problem is solved by the Mean-Field Annealing technique .	Synthetic experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .
3	Moreover , Coulomb interaction renders few-particle oscillations sensitive to perturbations in spatial directions other than that of the tunneling , contrary to the single-particle case .	We study the effect of Coulomb interaction on the few-electron dynamics in coupled semiconductor quantum dots by exact diagonalization of the few-body Hamiltonian .	The oscillation of carriers is strongly affected by the number of confined electrons and by the strength of the interdot correlations .	Single-frequency oscillations are found for either uncorrelated or highly correlated states , while multi-frequency oscillations take place in the intermediate regime .	The inclusion of acoustic phonon scattering does not modify the carrier dynamics substantially at short times , but can damp oscillation modes selectively at long times .
3	It is compared to different theoretical predictions .	Heavy quarkonia production is predicted to be sensitive to the formation of the quark gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions via competing mechanisms such as color screening and/or quark recombination .	During 2004 and 2005 RHIC data taking periods , the PHENIX collaboration has measured jpsi decay into lepton pairs both at mid and forward rapidity in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } $ =200 GeV .	We present the jpsi nuclear modification factor and the $ \jpsi $ mean square transverse momentum as a function of the collision centrality for both systems , as well as the rapidity dependence of the jpsi yield for different centrality classes .	All Au+Au and Cu+Cu results shown here are preliminary .
0	Linearization is a well-known concept in complex dynamics .	If $ p $ is a polynomial and $ z_0 $ is a repelling fixed point , then there is an entire function $ L $ which conjugates $ p $ to the linear map $ z\mapsto p ' ( z_0 ) z $ .	This notion of linearization carries over into the quasiregular setting , in the context of repelling fixed points of uniformly quasiregular mappings .	In this article , we investigate how linearizers arising from the same uqr mapping and the same repelling fixed point are related .	In particular , any linearizer arising from a uqr solution to a Schr\ '' oder equation is shown to be automorphic with respect to some quasiconformal group .
4	We show that for the studied systems the simple scaling hypothesis for the velocity distribution function is violated , i.e.that its evolution is not determined only by the time dependence of the thermal velocity .	We consider collisional models for granular particles and analyze the conditions under which the restitution coefficient might be a constant .	We show that these conditions are not consistent with known collision laws .	From the generalization of the Hertz contact law for viscoelastic particles we obtain the coefficient of normal restitution \epsilon as a function of the normal component of the impact velocity v_ { imp } .	Using \epsilon ( v_ { imp } ) we describe the time evolution of temperature and of the velocity distribution function of a granular gas in the homogeneous cooling regime , where the particles collide according to the viscoelastic law .
0	We attempt to recover the mean vertical velocity and vertical velocity dispersion as a function of the Galactic height for a sample drawn from a realistic Galaxy distribution function by following the method presented in Moni Bidin et al . ( 2012 ) .	We find that , for the sample size used , the observational error in the velocities is much smaller than the Poisson noise which has not been accounted for by Moni Bidin et al .	We repeat the analysis on a large number of samples to estimate the contribution of the Poisson noise and to uncover any systematics .	We find that the dispersion is systematically overestimated at low Galactic heights and slightly underestimated at high Galactic heights leading to an underestimate of the gradient of the dispersion with Galactic height .	The causes of the systematics are revealed by repeating the calculation using a method inspired by Girard et al . ( 2006 ) .
1	Word meaning is depicted by lambda terms of second order lambda calculus ( Girard 's system F ) with base types including a type for propositions and many types for sorts of a many sorted logic .	We present a framework , named the Montagovian generative lexicon , for computing the semantics of natural language sentences , expressed in many sorted higher order logic .	This framework is able to integrate a proper treatment of lexical phenomena into a Montagovian compositional semantics , including the restriction of selection which imposes the nature of the arguments of a predicate , and the possible adaptation of a word meaning to some contexts .	Among these adaptations of a word 's sense to the context , ontological inclusions are handled by an extension of system F with coercive subtyping that is introduced in the present paper .	The benefits of this framework for lexical pragmatics are illustrated on meaning transfers and coercions , on possible and impossible copredication over different senses , on deverbal ambiguities , and on `` fictive motion '' .
1	Yet , there is a lack of formal criteria for defining communities and for testing their significance .	Identifying communities ( or clusters ) , namely groups of nodes with comparatively strong internal connectivity , is a fundamental task for deeply understanding the structure and function of a network .	We propose a sharp definition which is based on a significance threshold .	By means of a lumped Markov chain model of a random walker , a quality measure called `` persistence probability '' is associated to a cluster .	Then the cluster is defined as an `` $ \alpha $ -community '' if such a probability is not smaller than $ \alpha $ .
2	Convergence is found to be more rapid for the spin asymmetries , which are in good agreement with experiment , than for the underlying cross sections .	Electron-impact ionization of lithium is studied using the convergent close-coupling ( CCC ) method at 25.4 and 54.4 eV .	Particular attention is paid to the spin-dependence of the ionization cross sections .	Comparison with the recent measured and DS3C-calculated data of Streun et al ( 1999 ) is most intriguing .	Excellent agreement is found with the measured and calculated spin asymmetries , yet the discrepancy between the CCC and DS3C cross sections is very large .
1	With the development of interferometric gravitational wave detectors , we may be in a position to detect the gravitational equivalent of the CMB in this century .	The detection of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ( CMB ) was one of the most important cosmological discoveries of the last century .	The Cosmic Gravitational Background ( CGB ) is likely to be isotropic and stochastic , making it difficult to distinguish from instrument noise .	The contribution from the CGB can be isolated by cross-correlating the signals from two or more independent detectors .	Here we extend previous studies that considered the cross-correlation of two Michelson channels by calculating the optimal signal to noise ratio that can be achieved by combining the full set of interferometry variables that are available with a six link triangular interferometer .
1	In the original version of the inequality these contexts have the temporal nature and they are given by three pairs of instances of time , $ ( t_1 , t_2 ) , ( t_2 , t_3 ) , ( t_3 , t_4 ) , $ where $ t_1 & lt ; t_2 & lt ; t_3. $ We generalize LG conditions of macroscopic realism and noninvasive measurability in the general contextual framework .	We interpret the Leggett-Garg ( LG ) inequality as a kind of contextual probabilistic inequality in which one combines data collected in experiments performed for three different contexts .	Our formulation is done in the purely probabilistic terms : existence of the context independent joint probability distribution $ P $ and the possibility to reconstruct the experimentally found marginal ( two dimensional ) probability distributions from the $ P. $ We derive an analog of the LG inequality , `` contextual LG inequality '' , and use it as a test of `` quantum-likeness '' of statistical data collected in a series of experiments on recognition of ambiguous figures .	In our experimental study the figure under recognition is the Schroeder stair which is shown with rotations for different angles .	Contexts are encoded by dynamics of rotations : clockwise , anticlockwise , and random .
1	Physics-based assumptions are used to derive a convergent iterative formulation of the SI scheme which enables the monitoring and control of the error introduced by the SI operator .	An efficient , iterative semi-implicit ( SI ) numerical method for the time integration of stiff wave systems is presented .	This iteration essentially turns a semi-implicit method into a fully implicit method .	Accuracy , rather than stability , determines the timestep .	The scheme is second-order accurate and shown to be equivalent to a simple preconditioning method .
2	the action of the linear Symplectic group .	Curves in Lagrange Grassmannians naturally appear when one studies intrinsically `` the Jacobi equations for extremals '' , associated with control systems and geometric structures .	In this way one reduces the problem of construction of the curvature-type invariants for these objects to the much more concrete problem of finding of invariants of curves in Lagrange Grassmannians w.r.t .	In the present paper we develop a new approach to differential geometry of so-called rank 1 curves in Lagrange Grassmannian , i.e. , the curves with velocities being rank one linear mappings ( under the standard identification of the tangent space to a point of the Lagrange Grassmannian with an appropriate space of linear mappings ) .	The curves of this class are associated with `` the Jacobi equations for extremals '' , corresponding to control systems with scalar control and to rank 2 vector distributions .
2	However , Graham , R\ '' odl and Ruci\'nski showed , by taking $ G $ to be a suitable expander graph , that necessarily $ r_\Delta & gt ; 2^ { c\Delta } $ for some constant $ c & gt ; 0 $ .	A celebrated result of Chv\'atal , R\ '' odl , Szemer\'edi and Trotter states ( in slightly weakened form ) that , for every natural number $ \Delta $ , there is a constant $ r_\Delta $ such that , for any connected $ n $ -vertex graph $ G $ with maximum degree $ \Delta $ , the Ramsey number $ R ( G , G ) $ is at most $ r_\Delta n $ , provided $ n $ is sufficiently large .	In 1987 , Burr made a strong conjecture implying that one may take $ r_\Delta = \Delta $ .	We show that the use of expanders is essential : if we impose the additional restriction that the bandwidth of $ G $ be at most some function $ \beta ( n ) = o ( n ) $ , then $ R ( G , G ) \le ( 2\chi ( G ) +4 ) n\leq ( 2\Delta+6 ) n $ , i.e. , $ r_\Delta = 2\Delta +6 $ suffices .	On the other hand , we show that Burr 's conjecture itself fails even for $ P_n^k $ , the $ k $ th power of a path $ P_n $ .
2	Guided by these lifetime results , we deduce an alpha-generated set of universal mass quanta , based on the electron ground state , which apply to both leptons and hadrons .	Hadron elementary particle measurements have long revealed an alpha-dependence in the long-lived threshold-state lifetimes , together with an alpha-related mass structure , where alpha ~ 1/137 is the fine structure constant .	A detailed lifetime analysis shows that of the 156 particles with well-determined lifetimes , the 120 shortest lifetimes have a continuum of values , but the 36 longer lifetimes occur in alpha-spaced groups which are sorted into s , c , b quark flavors .	A low-mass `` threshold-state octet '' of particles - muon , proton , tau , pion , eta , eta prime , kaon , phi meson - is reproduced to an average mass accuracy of 0.4 % , with no adjustable parameters except a small hadronic binding energy .	Without the lepton states , the hadron mass pattern is difficult to ascertain .
4	These theoretical results are complemented by an agent-based simulation which indicates that convergence is fast when 0 & lt ; r & lt ; 1 and that the quality ranking dominates the well-known popularity ranking in terms of market efficiency .	This paper considers trial-offer and freemium markets where consumer preferences are modeled by a multinomial logic model with social influence and position bias .	The social signal for a product i is its market share raised to some power r. The paper shows that , when 0 & lt ; r & lt ; 1 and a static position assignment ( e.g. , a quality ranking ) is used , the market converges to a unique equilibrium where the market shares depend only on product quality , not their initial appeals or the early dynamics .	When r & gt ; 1 , the market become unpredictable and goes most likely to a monopoly for some product .	Which product becomes a monopoly depends on the initial conditions of the market .
4	The proposed technique leverages indoor existing Li-Fi lighting and Wi-Fi infrastructure , and results in a cost-effective and user-convenient indoor accurate localization framework .	In recent years , there has been an increasing number of information technologies utilized in buildings to advance the idea of `` smart buildings '' .	Among various potential techniques , the use of Wi-Fi based indoor positioning allows to locate and track smartphone users inside a building , therefore , location-aware intelligent solutions can be applied to control and of building operations .	These location-aware indoor services ( e.g. , path finding , internet of things , location based advertising ) demand real-time accurate indoor localization , which is a key issue to guarantee high quality of service in smart buildings .	This paper presents a new Wi-Fi based indoor localization technique that achieves significantly improvement of indoor positioning accuracy with the help of Li-Fi assisted coefficient calibration .
4	Due to the smallness of the pion mass the region of small recoils is close to the nearby $ B^* ( 5234 ) $ resonance .	We present the form factors of the $ B\to\pi , \rho $ transitions induced by the $ b\to u $ quark currents at all kinematically accessible $ q^2 $ .	Our analysis is based on the spectral representations of the form factors within the constituent quark picture : we fix the soft meson wave functions and the constituent quark masses by fitting $ A_1 ( q^2 ) $ and $ T_2 ( q^2 ) $ to the lattice results at small recoils ( $ 17\lesssim q^2\lesssim 20 GeV^2 $ ) .	We then calculate the $ B\to\pi , \rho $ transition form factors down to $ q^2=0 $ .	For the $ B\to\pi $ case the region $ q^2\lesssim 20 GeV^2 $ however does not cover the whole kinematically accessible range .
0	If a Higgs field is conformally coupled to gravity , then it can give rise to the scale invariant density perturbations .	We make use of this result in a realistic inert Higgs doublet model , where we have a pair of Higgs doublets conformally coupled to the gravity in the early universe .	The perturbation of the inert Higgs is shown to be the scale invariant .	This gives rise to the density perturbation observed through CMB by its couplings to the standard model Higgs and the subsequent decay .	Loop corrections of this conformally coupled system gives rise to electroweak symmetry breaking .
2	We view it as a metric space by endowing its set of vertices with the graph distance .	We discuss scaling limits of large bipartite quadrangulations of positive genus .	For a given $ g $ , we consider , for every $ n \ge 1 $ , a random quadrangulation $ \q_n $ uniformly distributed over the set of all rooted bipartite quadrangulations of genus $ g $ with $ n $ faces .	We show that , as $ n $ tends to infinity , this metric space , with distances rescaled by the factor $ n^ { -1/4 } $ , converges in distribution , at least along some subsequence , toward a limiting random metric space .	This convergence holds in the sense of the Gromov-Hausdorff topology on compact metric spaces .
0	The novel five-Penning trap mass spectrometer PENTATRAP is developed at the Max-Planck-Institut f\ '' ur Kernphysik ( MPIK ) , Heidelberg .	Ions of interest are long-lived highly charged nuclides up to bare uranium .	PENTATRAP aims for an accuracy of a few parts in 10^12 for mass ratios of mass doublets .	A physics program for PENTATRAP includes Q-values measurements of \beta-transitions relevant for neutrino physics , stringent tests of quantum electrodynamics in the regime of extreme electric fields , and a test of special relativity .	Main features of PENTATRAP are an access to a source of highly charged ions , a multi-trap configuration , simultaneous measurements of frequencies , a continuous precise monitoring of magnetic field fluctuations , a fast exchange between different ions , and a highly sensitive cryogenic non-destructive detection system .
2	However , the network of sticky rods undergoes a sol-gel transition as the temperature is raised .	We construct colloidal `` sticky '' rods from the semi-flexible filamentous fd virus and temperature-sensitive polymers poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide ) ( PNIPAM ) .	The phase diagram of fd-PNIPAM system becomes independent of ionic strength at high salt concentration and low temperature , i.e.the rods are sterically stabilized by the polymer .	The viscoelastic moduli of fd and fd-PNIPAM suspensions are compared as a function of temperature , and the effect of ionic strength on the gelling behavior of fd-PNIPAM solution is measured .	For all fluidlike and solidlike samples , the frequency-dependant linear viscoelastic moduli can be scaled onto universal master curves .
1	All the targeted stars are located along the upper main sequence of the cluster between 14.8 $ & lt ; $ V $ & lt ; $ 16.5 .	The old and metal rich open cluster NGC 6253 was observed with the FLAMES multi-object spectrograph during an extensive radial velocity campaign monitoring 317 stars with a median of 15 epochs per object .	Fifty nine stars are confirmed cluster members both by radial velocities and proper motions and do not show evidence of variability .	We detected 45 variable stars among which 25 belong to NGC 6253 .	We were able to derive an orbital solution for 4 cluster members ( and for 2 field stars ) yielding minimum masses in between $ \sim $ 90 M $ \rm_J $ and $ \sim $ 460 M $ \rm_J $ and periods between 3 and 220 days .
0	Migration has various dimensions ; urbanization due to migration is one of them .	In Rajasthan State , district level analysis of urbanization due to migrants shows trend invariably for all districts of the state , though the contribution in urbanization by migrants varies from district to district .	In some districts the share of migrants moving to urban areas is very impressive , in others it is not that much high .	The migrants ' contribution is on the raising over the decades .	In this paper , the district level migration in the Rajasthan State is examined in relation to total urbanization and urbanization due to migration .
4	The models predict a spectrum of secondary anisotropies covering a broad range of angular scales , with fractional temperature fluctuations $ \sim 10^ { -7 } -10^ { -6 } $ on arcminute scales .	We present predictions for the reionization of the intergalactic medium by stars in high-redshift galaxies .	We calculate ionizing luminosities of galaxies , including the effects of absorption by interstellar gas and dust on the escape fraction , in order to calculate the filling factor of ionized hydrogen in the IGM .	For a $ \Lambda { \rm CDM } $ cosmology and a physical calculation of the escape fraction , we find that the hydrogen in the IGM will be reionized at redshift z=6.1 if the IGM has uniform density , but only by z=4.5 if the IGM is clumped .	We combine our model with an N-body simulation of the distribution of dark matter in the universe in order to calculate the secondary temperature anisotropies induced in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) by scattering off free electrons .
2	There are a number of initiatives underway , both within Canada and around the world , to find alternative ways of producing 99Mo or its daughter , 99mTc .	The NRU reactor in Chalk River had been scheduled to stop producing medical isotopes by the end of 2016 but the Government of Canada recently announced that it will remain available to support isotope production until its operating license expires on 31 March , 2018 .	NRU has the capability of producing up to 80 % of the world 's requirements for 99Mo but is presently producing less than 20 % .	We examine the status of the main proposals and conclude that it will be challenging for any of them to meet the required demand by the end of 2016 .	An additional year should be enough time for some of the proposals to complete the development of manufacturing facilities and achieve regulatory approval .
4	A preliminary estimate of the integrated absolute V magnitude ( M_V & lt ; -9.1 ) suggests that B514 is among the brightest globulars of M31 .	We present deep F606W , F814W ACS photometry of the recently discovered globular cluster B514 , the outermost known globular in the M31 galaxy .	The cluster appears quite extended and member stars are unequivocally identified out to ~200 pc from the center .	The Color Magnitude Diagram reveals a steep Red Giant Branch ( RGB ) , and a Horizontal Branch ( HB ) extending blue ward of the instability strip , indicating that B514 is a classical old metal-poor globular cluster .	The RGB locus and the position of the RGB Bump are both consistent with a metallicity [ Fe/H ] ~ -1.8 , in excellent agreement with spectroscopic estimates .
0	Scattering induced mode splitting in active microcavities is demonstrated .	Below the lasing threshold , quality factor enhancement by optical gain allows resolving , in the wavelength-scanning transmission spectrum , the resonance dips of the split modes which otherwise would not be detected in a passive resonator .	In the lasing regime , mode splitting manifests itself as two lasing modes with extremely narrow linewidths .	Mixing of these laser modes in a detector leads to a heterodyne beat signal whose frequency corresponds to the amount of splitting .	Lasing regime not only allows ultrahigh sensitivity for mode-splitting measurements but also provides an easily accessible scheme by eliminating the need for wavelength scanning around resonant modes .
2	We find that the K-N repulsion excludes the Theta+ as a K-N s-wave pentaquark .	We study the very recently discovered $ \Theta^+ $ ( 1540 ) at SPring-8 , at ITEP and at CLAS-Thomas Jefferson Lab .	We apply the same RGM techniques that already explained with success the repulsive hard core of nucleon-nucleon , kaon-nucleon exotic scattering , and the attractive hard core present in pion-nucleon and pion-pion non-exotic scattering .	We explore the Theta+ as heptaquark , equivalent to a N+pi+K borromean boundstate , with positive parity and total isospin I=0 .	We find that the kaon-nucleon repulsion is cancelled by the attraction existing both in the pion-nucleon and pion-kaon channels .
0	We study approximate distributed solutions to the weighted { \it all-pairs-shortest-paths } ( APSP ) problem in the CONGEST model .	We obtain the following results .	$ 1. $ A deterministic $ ( 1+o ( 1 ) ) $ -approximation to APSP in $ \tilde { O } ( n ) $ rounds .	This improves over the best previously known algorithm , by both derandomizing it and by reducing the running time by a $ \Theta ( \log n ) $ factor .	In many cases , routing schemes involve relabeling , i.e. , assigning new names to nodes and require that these names are used in distance and routing queries .
1	We assume that nodes are capable of detecting all points within distance $ r $ of their location and study the problem of determining the first time at which a target particle , which is initially placed at the origin of $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ , is detected by at least one node .	Consider the model where nodes are initially distributed as a Poisson point process with intensity $ \lambda $ over $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ and are moving in continuous time according to independent Brownian motions .	We consider the case where the target particle can move according to any continuous function and can adapt its motion based on the location of the nodes .	We show that there exists a sufficiently large value of $ \lambda $ so that the target will eventually be detected almost surely .	This means that the target can not evade detection even if it has full information about the past , present and future locations of the nodes .
2	The absolute branching ratios for these channels were determined to be 81 ( 4 ) % , 7.1 ( 4 ) % , and 0.08 ( 3 ) % , respectively .	The beta+ decay of very neutron deficient 43Cr has been studied by means of an imaging time projection chamber which allowed recording tracks of charged particles .	Events of beta-delayed emission of one- , two- , and three protons were clearly identified .	The 43Cr is thus established as the second case in which the beta-3p decay occurs .	Although the feeding to the proton-bound states in 43V is expected to be negligible , the large branching ratio of 12 ( 4 ) % for decays without proton emission is found .
2	This includes earlier results for odd symplectic case , where there is a canonical odd Laplacian on half-densities .	We consider odd Laplace operators acting on densities of various weight on an odd Poisson ( = Schouten ) manifold $ M $ .	We prove that the case of densities of weight 1/2 ( half-densities ) is distinguished by the existence of a unique odd Laplace operator depending only on a point of an `` orbit space '' of volume forms .	The space of volume forms on $ M $ is partitioned into orbits by a natural groupoid whose arrows correspond to the solutions of the quantum Batalin -- Vilkovisky equations .	We give a comparison with the situation for Riemannian and even Poisson manifolds .
4	The spectra given at this resolution are normalized to their pseudo-continuum and are intended to serve for abundance studies , spectral classification and tests of stellar atmosphere models .	We present a database of 908 spectra of 709 stars obtained with the ELODIE spectrograph at Observatoire de Haute-Provence .	52 orders of the echelle spectra have been carefully fitted together to provide continuous , high-resolution spectra in the wavelength range 410 nm - 680 nm .	The archive provides a large coverage of the space of atmospheric parameters : Teff from 3700 K to 13600 K , logg from 0.03 to 5.86 and [ Fe/H ] from -2.8 to +0.7 .	At the nominal resolution , R=42000 , the mean signal-to-noise ratio is 150 per pixel .
1	The limiting case in which all single particle states are degenerate , but with different s-wave pairing strengths was only recently solved .	Pairing plays a crucial role in nuclear spectra and attempts to describe it has a long history in nuclear physics .	In this strong coupling limit the nuclear pairing Hamiltonian also exhibits a supersymmetry .	Another solution away from those limits , namely two non-degenerate single particle states with different pairing strengths , was also given .	In this contribution these developments are summarized and difficulties with possible generalizations to more single particle states and d-wave pairing are discussed .
3	The scheme of a magnetic nanorelay based on cantilevered nanotubes filled with magnetic endofullerenes is elaborated .	Structural and energy characteristics of the smallest magnetic endofullerene Fe @ C20 have been calculated using the density functional theory approach .	The ground state of Fe @ C20 is found to be a septet state , and the magnetic moment of Fe @ C20 is estimated to be 8 Bohr magnetons .	Characteristics of an ( 8,8 ) carbon nanotube with a single Fe @ C20 inside are studied in the framework of the semiempirical approach .	The proposed nanorelay is turned on as a result of bending of nanotubes by a magnetic force .
0	The effect of pressure on the zone-center optical phonon modes of antimony in the A7 structure has been investigated by Raman spectroscopy .	The A_g and E_g frequencies exhibit a pronounced softening with increasing pressure , the effect being related to a gradual suppression of the Peierls-like distortion of the A7 phase relative to a cubic primitive lattice .	Also , both Raman modes broaden significantly under pressure .	Spectra taken at low temperature indicate that the broadening is at least partly caused by phonon-phonon interactions .	We also report results of ab initio frozen-phonon calculations of the A_g and E_g mode frequencies .
0	We discuss a novel mechanism to set up a gravity dual of FFLO states in strongly coupled superconductors .	The gravitational theory utilizes two U ( 1 ) gauge fields and a scalar field coupled to a charged AdS black hole .	The first gauge field couples with the scalar sourcing a charge condensate below a critical temperature , and the second gauge field provides a coupling to spin in the boundary theory .	The scalar is neutral under the second gauge field .	By turning on an interaction between the Einstein tensor and the scalar , it is shown that , in the low temperature limit , an inhomogeneous solution possesses a higher critical temperature than the homogeneous case , giving rise to FFLO states .
3	We propose the R package LMest , which is tailored to deal with these types of model .	Latent Markov ( LM ) models represent an important class of models for the analysis of longitudinal data ( Bartolucci et .	al. , 2013 ) , especially when response variables are categorical .	These models have a great potential of application for the analysis of social , medical , and behavioral data as well as in other disciplines .	In particular , we consider a general framework for extended LM models by including individual covariates and by formulating a mixed approach to take into account additional dependence structures in the data .
4	We treat two cases of particular interest : ( i ) a bounded and non-convex loss function and ( ii ) an unbounded convex loss function satisfying a certain Lipschitz type condition .	Regularized empirical risk minimization including support vector machines plays an important role in machine learning theory .	In this paper regularized pairwise learning ( RPL ) methods based on kernels will be investigated .	One example is regularized minimization of the error entropy loss which has recently attracted quite some interest from the viewpoint of consistency and learning rates .	This paper shows that such RPL methods have additionally good statistical robustness properties , if the loss function and the kernel are chosen appropriately .
0	Previously detected in only a few gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) , X-ray flares are now observed in ~50 % of Swift GRBs , though their origins remain unclear .	Most flares are seen early on in the afterglow decay , while some bursts exhibit flares at late times of 10^4 to 10^5 seconds , which may have implications for flare models.We investigate whether a sample of late time ( & gt ; 10^4s ) flares are different from previous samples of early time flares , or whether they are merely examples on the tail of the early flare distribution .	We examine the X-ray light curves of Swift bursts for late flares and compare the flare and underlying temporal power-law properties with those of early flares , and the values of these properties predicted by the blast wave model .	The burst sample shows late flare properties consistent with those of early flares , where the majority of the flares can be explained by either internal or external shock , though in a few cases one origin is favoured over the other .	The underlying power laws are mainly consistent with the normal decay phases of the afterglow .
1	in 2007 for per-flow measurements on high-speed links .	A counter braid ( CB ) is a novel counter architecture introduced by Lu et al .	CBs achieve an asymptotic compression rate ( under optimal decoding ) that matches the entropy lower bound of the flow size distribution .	In this paper , we apply the concept of spatial coupling to CBs to improve their belief propagation ( BP ) threshold , and analyze the performance of the resulting spatially-coupled CBs ( SC-CBs ) .	We introduce an equivalent bipartite graph representation of CBs with identical iteration-by-iteration finite-length and asymptotic performance .
2	We define an adjustment length ( a few base pairs ) : in the adjustment regions near both ends of the paired region , the tension is still mainly on one single strand .	We discuss theoretically the force F between two colloidal particles , each of them carrying one single strand DNA .	The two strands are complementary only on a finite sequence of consecutive base pairs .	But in the central part , the two backbones are equally loaded .	This leads to a rupture force , increasing linearly with length , and saturating for large lengths .
4	We also show that this dimension is not affected by the addition of learnt clauses .	Modern SAT solvers have experienced a remarkable progress on solving industrial instances .	Most of the techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental testing process .	Recently , there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of these formulas in terms of complex networks , with the long-term aim of explaining the success of these SAT solving techniques , and possibly improving them .	We study the fractal dimension of SAT formulas , and show that most industrial families of formulas are self-similar , with a small fractal dimension .
2	We find that for fixed Unruh temperature felt by the string endpoints , the screening length is smaller for the accelerated Wilson loop than for the static one in a thermal background of the same temperature ; hence acceleration provides a `` more efficient '' mechanism for melting of mesons .	We analyse the effect of velocity and acceleration on the temperature felt by particles and strings in backgrounds relevant in holographic models .	First , we compare accelerated strings and strings at finite temperature .	Secondly , we show that the velocity-dependence of the screening length of the colour force , previously obtained from a moving Wilson loop in a finite temperature background , is not specific for the string , but is a consequence of the generic fact that an observer which moves with constant velocity in a black hole background measures a velocity-dependent temperature .	Finally , we analyse accelerated particles and strings in the AdS black hole background , and show that these feel a temperature which increases as a function of time .
0	We investigate conditions for `` simultaneous normalizability '' of a family of reduced schemes , i.e. , the normalization of the total space normalizes , fiber by fiber , each member of the family .	The main result ( under more general conditions ) is that a flat family of reduced equidimensional projective complex varieties X_y with parameter y ranging over a normal space -- algebraic or analytic -- admits a simultaneous normalization if and only if the Hilbert polynomial of the integral closure of the structure sheaf O_ { X_y } is locally independent of y .	When the X_y are curves projectivity is not needed , and the statement reduces to the well known \delta-constant criterion of Teissier .	Proofs are basically algebraic , analytic results being related via standard techniques ( Stein compacta , etc . )	to more abstract algebraic ones .
4	We also study typical examples under a log-linear/quadratic market impact function with Gamma-distributed noise .	This paper is a continuation of Ishitani and Kato ( 2015 ) , in which we derived a continuous-time value function corresponding to an optimal execution problem with uncertain market impact as the limit of a discrete-time value function .	Here , we investigate some properties of the derived value function .	In particular , we show that the function is continuous and has the semigroup property , which is strongly related to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality .	Moreover , we show that noise in market impact causes risk-neutral assessment to underestimate the impact cost .
2	It is found that the transverse helicity amplitude for the gamma* p -- & gt ; P11 ( 1440 ) transition , which is large and negative at Q2=0 , becomes large and positive at Q2 ~ 2 GeV2 , and then drops slowly with Q2 .	The helicity amplitudes of the electroexcitation of the Roper resonance on proton are extracted at 1.7 & lt ; Q2 & lt ; 4.2 GeV2 from recent high precision JLab-CLAS cross sections data and longitudinally polarized beam asymmetry for pi+ electroproduction on protons .	The analysis is made using two approaches , dispersion relations and unitary isobar model , which give consistent results .	Longitudinal helicity amplitude , that was previously found from CLAS data as large and positive at Q2=0.4,0.65 GeV2 , drops with Q2 .	These results rule out the presentation of P11 ( 1440 ) as a 3qG hybrid state , and provide strong evidence in favor of this resonance as a first radial excitation of the 3q ground state .
2	We show that in such a case it is able to give leptons masses at just the tree level .	The R-symmetry formalism is applied for the supersymmetric economical SU ( 3 ) _C X SU ( 3 ) _L X U ( 1 ) _X ( 3-3-1 ) model .	The generalization of the minimal supersymmetric standard model relation among R-parity , spin and matter parity is derived , and discrete symmetries for the proton stability in this model are imposed .	A simple mechanism for the mass generation of the neutrinos is explored .	With the new R-parity , the neutral fermions get mass matrix with two distinct sectors : one light which is identified with neutrino mass matrix , another heavy one which is identified with neutralinos one .
1	Since this mechanism is due to the special scaling of the Lifshitz scalar and persists in the presence of unsuppressed self-couplings , the resulting fluctuation spectrum can deviate from a Gaussian distribution .	A Lifshitz scalar with the dynamical critical exponent z = 3 obtains scale-invariant , super-horizon field fluctuations without the need of an inflationary era .	We study the non-Gaussian nature of the Lifshitz scalar 's intrinsic field fluctuations , and show that primordial curvature perturbations sourced from such field fluctuations can have large non-Gaussianity of order f_NL = O ( 100 ) , which will be detected by upcoming CMB observations .	We compute the bispectrum and trispectrum of the fluctuations , and discuss their configurations in momentum space .	In particular , the bispectrum is found to take various shapes , including the local , equilateral , and orthogonal shapes .
1	For the NS Z ( Atoll ) sources , $ \nu_ { high } $ and $ \nu_ { low } $ are identified as the lower kHz QPO frequency and horizontal branch oscillations ( HBOs ) $ \nh $ ( broad noise components ) ; for the black hole candidates and low-luminosity neutron stars , they are the QPOs and broad noise components at frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz ; for WDs , they are the `` dwarf nova oscillations '' ( DNOs ) and QPOs of cataclysmic variables ( CVs ) .	It is found that there exists an empirical linear relation between the high frequency $ \nhigh $ and low frequency $ \nlow $ of quasi-periodic oscillations ( QPOs ) for black hole candidate ( BHC ) , neutron star ( NS ) and white dwarf ( WD ) in the binary systems , which spans five orders of magnitude in frequency .	To interpret this relation , our model ascribes $ \nu_ { high } $ to the Alfv\'en wave oscillation frequency at a preferred radius and $ \nu_ { low } $ to the same mechanism at another radius .	Then , we can obtain $ \nlow = 0.08 \nhigh $ and the relation between the upper kHz QPO frequency $ \nt $ and HBO to be $ \nh \simeq 56 ( { \rm Hz } ) ( \nt/ { \rm kHz } ) ^ { 2 } $ , which are in accordance with the observed empirical relations .	Furthermore , some implications of model are discussed , including why QPO frequencies of white dwarfs and neutron stars span five orders of magnitude in frequency.\\
4	These observations are in agreement with the experiment of [ 8 ] , where such scalings were also observed and the power of the decay was numerically close to 1/3 .	The quantum phase transition from the Mott insulator state to the superfluid in the Bose-Hubbard model is investigated .	We research one , two and three dimensional lattices in the truncated Wigner approximation .	We compute both kinetic and potential energy and they turn out to have a power law behaviour as a function of the transition rate , with the power equal to 1/3 .	The same applies to the total energy in a system with a harmonic trap , which is usually present in the experimental set-up .
3	However , it is assumed that the local topological degree of the gradient of the Hamiltonian at the stationary point is nonzero .	This paper deals with periodic solutions of the Hamilton equation with many parameters .	Theorems on global bifurcation of solutions with periods $ 2\pi/j , $ $ j\in\mathbb { N } , $ from a stationary point are proved .	The Hessian matrix of the Hamiltonian at the stationary point can be singular .	It is shown that ( global ) bifurcation points of solutions with given periods can be identified with zeros of appropriate continuous functions on the space of parameters .
3	The foliated result is used in our proof of local rigidity for standard actions of higher rank semisimple Lie groups and their lattices in \cite { FM2 } .	Let $ \Gamma $ be a discrete group with property $ ( T ) $ of Kazhdan .	We prove that any Riemannian isometric action of $ \Gamma $ on a compact manifold $ X $ is locally rigid .	We also prove a more general foliated version of this result .	One definition of property $ ( T ) $ is that a group $ \Gamma $ has property $ ( T ) $ if every isometric $ \Gamma $ action on a Hilbert space has a fixed point .
2	Both in the electron- and the hole-doping regimes the photocurrent decays exponentially as a function of the distance between the illumination spot and the nearest contact , in agreement with a two-terminal Schottky-barrier device model .	We perform scanning photocurrent microscopy on WS2 ionic liquid-gated field effect transistors exhibiting high-quality ambipolar transport .	By properly biasing the gate electrode we can invert the sign of the photocurrent showing that the minority photocarriers are either electrons or holes .	This allows us to compare the value and the doping dependence of the diffusion length of the minority electrons and holes on a same sample .	Interestingly , the diffusion length of the minority carriers is several times larger in the hole accumulation regime than in the electron accumulation regime , pointing out an electron-hole asymmetry in WS2 .
3	Generalizing our previous work , we carry out the complete computation of this quantity which takes into account both the nature of the degeneracy of the fermions and the presence of the space time points belonging to the antisymmetric representation .	We study the expectation value of ( the product ) of the one-particle projector ( s ) in the reduced matrix model and matrix quantum mechanics in general .	This quantity is given by the nonabelian Berry phase : we discuss the relevance of this with regard to the spacetime structure .	The case of the USp matrix model is examined from this respect .	We find the singularities as those of the SU ( 2 ) Yang monopole connection as well as the pointlike singularities in 9+1 dimensions coming from its SU ( 8 ) generalization .
2	One solution in particular closely resembles the stripe phase of White and Scalapino .	A mean field calculation of the Hubbard model finds a rich phase diagram .	The antiferromagnetic phase is generally unstable away from half filling , and there are several regions of phase separation .	By comparison to unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations ( for which this phase is metastable ) , it is demonstrated that this phase arises from phase separation .	The interface surface tension is found to change sign below a particular stripe width , at which point the stripes begin to meander , gradually crossing over to diagonal .
3	This contribution extends QDP-JIT , the migration of SciDAC QDP++ to GPU-enabled parallel systems , to help to strong scale the whole Hybrid Monte-Carlo to this regime .	Over the past years GPUs have been successfully applied to the task of inverting the fermion matrix in lattice QCD calculations .	Even strong scaling to capability-level supercomputers , corresponding to O ( 100 ) GPUs or more has been achieved .	However strong scaling a whole gauge field generation algorithm to this regim requires significantly more functionality than just having the matrix inverter utilizing the GPUs and has not yet been accomplished .	Initial results are shown for gauge field generation with Chroma simulating pure Wilson fermions on OLCF TitanDev .
2	Standard models for turbulent fluid flows in meteorological theory can not explain satisfactorily the observed multifractal ( space-time ) structures in atmospheric flows .	Atmospheric flows exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations manifested as the fractal geometry to the global cloud cover pattern concomitant with inverse power-law form for power spectra of temporal fluctuations of all scales ranging from turbulence ( millimeters-seconds ) to climate ( thousands of kilometers-years ) .	Long-range spatiotemporal correlations are ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures of self-organized criticality .	Numerical models for simulation and prediction of atmospheric flows are subject to deterministic chaos and give unrealistic solutions .	Deterministic chaos is a direct consequence of round-off error growth in iterative computations .
0	In this paper we aim to address two questions faced by a long-term investor with a power-type utility at high levels of wealth : one is whether the turnpike property still holds for a general utility that is not necessarily differentiable or strictly concave , the other is whether the error and the convergence rate of the turnpike property can be estimated .	We give positive answers to both questions .	To achieve these results , we first show that there is a classical solution to the HJB equation and give a representation of the solution in terms of the dual function of the solution to the dual HJB equation .	We demonstrate the usefulness of that representation with some nontrivial examples that would be difficult to solve with the trial and error method .	We then combine the dual method and the partial differential equation method to give a direct proof to the turnpike property and to estimate the error and the convergence rate of the optimal policy when the utility function is continuously differentiable and strictly concave .
2	We call this formulation Semi-Supervised Learning with Heterophily ( SSL-H ) .	We propose a novel linear semi-supervised learning formulation that is derived from a solid probabilistic framework : belief propagation .	We show that our formulation generalizes a number of label propagation algorithms described in the literature by allowing them to propagate generalized assumptions about influences between classes of neighboring nodes .	We also show how the affinity matrix can be learned from observed data with a simple convex optimization framework that is inspired by locally linear embedding .	We call this approach Linear Heterophily Estimation ( LHE ) .
0	We study matrix elements of the `` chromomagnetic '' operator on the lattice .	This operator is contained in the strangeness-changing effective Hamiltonian which describes electroweak effects in the Standard Model and beyond .	Having dimension 5 , the chromomagnetic operator is characterized by a rich pattern of mixing with other operators of equal and lower dimensionality , including also non gauge invariant quantities ; it is thus quite a challenge to extract from lattice simulations a clear signal for the hadronic matrix elements of this operator .	We compute all relevant mixing coefficients to one loop in lattice perturbation theory ; this necessitates calculating both 2-point ( quark-antiquark ) and 3-point ( gluon-quark-antiquark ) Green 's functions at nonzero quark masses .	We use the twisted mass lattice formulation , with Symanzik improved gluon action .
0	We present a new regularization method , for d dim ( Euclidean ) quantum field theories in the continuum formalism , based on the domain wall configuration in ( 1+d ) dim space-time .	It is inspired by the recent progress in the chiral fermions on the lattice .	The wall `` height '' is given by 1/M , where M is a regularization mass parameter and appears as a 1+d dim Dirac fermion mass .	The present approach gives a thermodynamic view to the domain wall or the overlap formalism in the lattice field theory .	We will show qualitative correspondence between the present continuum results and those of the lattice .
4	Its sign is anti-correlated with that of the radial mean magnetic field .	In a density-stratified turbulent medium the cross helicity & lt ; u'.B ' & gt ; is considered as a result of the interaction of the velocity fluctuations and a large-scale magnetic field .	By means of a quasilinear theory and by numerical simulations we find the cross helicity and the mean vertical magnetic field anti-correlated .	In the high-conductivity limit the ratio of the helicity and the mean magnetic field equals the ratio of the magnetic eddy diffusivity and the ( known ) density scale height .	The result can be used to predict that the cross helicity at the solar surface exceeds the value of 1 Gauss km/s .
0	The rich mesophase polymorhism and the phase sequence of board-like colloids depends critically on their shape anisometry .	Implementing extensive Monte Carlo simulations , we calculated the full phase diagram of sterically interacting board-like particles , for a range of experimentally accessible molecular dimensions/anisometries of colloids of this shape .	A variety of self organized mesophases including uniaxial and biaxial nematics , smectic , cubatic and columnar phases have been identified .	Our results demonstrate clearly that the molecular anisometry influences critically not only the structure and the symmetry of the mesophases but also , and perhaps more interestingly , the phase sequence among them .	New classes of phase sequences such as nematic-nematic and , for the first time , a direct transition from a discotic and a biaxial nematic to an orthogonal smectic A phase have been identified .
2	Adapting the results of Barron and Sheu [ Ann.Statist .	In this paper we focus on nonparametric estimators in inverse problems for Poisson processes involving the use of wavelet decompositions .	Adopting an adaptive wavelet Galerkin discretization , we find that our method combines the well-known theoretical advantages of wavelet -- vaguelette decompositions for inverse problems in terms of optimally adapting to the unknown smoothness of the solution , together with the remarkably simple closed-form expressions of Galerkin inversion methods .	19 ( 1991 ) 1347 -- 1369 ] to the context of log-intensity functions approximated by wavelet series with the use of the Kullback -- Leibler distance between two point processes , we also present an asymptotic analysis of convergence rates that justifies our approach .	In order to shed some light on the theoretical results obtained and to examine the accuracy of our estimates in finite samples , we illustrate our method by the analysis of some simulated examples .
3	Our results for small systems indicate that pairing is favoured in a certain parameter range .	We investigate ground-state properties of two correlated-hopping electron models , the Hirsch and the Bariev model .	Both models are of recent interest in the context of hole superconductivity .	Applying the Lanczos technique to small clusters , we numerically determine the binding energy , the spin gaps , correlation functions , and other properties for various values of the bond-charge interaction parameter .	However , in contrast to the Bariev model , superconducting correlations are suppressed in the Hirsch model , for a bond-charge repulsion larger than a critical value .
4	We obtain some equivalent conditions for a Sridharan enveloping algebra to be Calabi-Yau , and then partly answer a question proposed by Berger .	The Calabi-Yau property of cocommutative Hopf algebras is discussed by using the homological integral , a recently introduced tool for studying infinite dimensional AS-Gorenstein Hopf algebras .	It is shown that the skew-group algebra of a universal enveloping algebra of a finite dimensional Lie algebra $ \g $ with a finite subgroup $ G $ of automorphisms of $ \g $ is Calabi-Yau if and only if the universal enveloping algebra itself is Calabi-Yau and $ G $ is a subgroup of the special linear group $ SL ( \g ) $ .	The Noetherian cocommutative Calabi-Yau Hopf algebras of dimension not larger than 3 are described .	The Calabi-Yau property of Sridharan enveloping algebras of finite dimensional Lie algebras is also discussed .
1	The dominant long standing interpretation of QPO 's is that they are produced in and are the signature of the thermal accretion disk .	Recent studies have shown that strong correlations are observed between low frequency QPO`s and the spectral power law index for a number of black hole candidate sources ( BHC 's ) , when these sources exhibit quasi-steady hard x-ray emission states .	Paradoxically , strong QPO`s are present even in the cases where the thermal component is negligible .	We present a model which identifies the origin of the QPO 's and relates them directly to the properties of a compact coronal region which is bounded by the adjustment from Keplerian to sub-Keplerian inflow into the BH and which is primarily responsible for the observed power law spectrum .	The model also predicts the relationship between high and low frequency QPO 's and shows how BH 's can be unique identified from observations of the soft states of NS 's and BHC 's .
1	A focused sequent calculus is defined relative to some non-focused sequent calculus ; focalization is the property that every non-focused derivation can be transformed into a focused derivation .	Focusing , introduced by Jean-Marc Andreoli in the context of classical linear logic , defines a normal form for sequent calculus derivations that cuts down on the number of possible derivations by eagerly applying invertible rules and grouping sequences of non-invertible rules .	In this paper , we present a focused sequent calculus for propositional intuitionistic logic and prove the focalization property relative to a standard presentation of propositional intuitionistic logic .	Compared to existing approaches , the proof is quite concise , depending only on the internal soundness and completeness of the focused logic .	In turn , both of these properties can be established ( and mechanically verified ) by structural induction in the style of Pfenning 's structural cut elimination without the need for any tedious and repetitious invertibility lemmas .
0	The character change of a superfluid state due to the variation of the attractive force is investigated in the relativistic framework with a massive fermion .	Two crossovers are found .	One is a crossover from the usual BCS state to the Bose-Einstein condensation ( BEC ) of bound fermion pairs .	The other is from the BEC to the relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation ( RBEC ) of nearly massless bound pairs where antiparticles as well as particles dominate the thermodynamics .	Possible realization of the BEC and RBEC states in the quark matter is also pointed out .
4	Corresponding results are also obtained for the deformed KP hierarchy .	A linear system , which generates a Moyal-deformed two-dimensional soliton equation as integrability condition , can be extended to a three-dimensional linear system , treating the deformation parameter as an additional coordinate .	The supplementary integrability conditions result in a first order differential equation with respect to the deformation parameter , the flow of which commutes with the flow of the deformed soliton equation .	In this way , a deformed soliton hierarchy can be extended to a bigger hierarchy by including the corresponding deformation equations .	We prove the extended hierarchy properties for the deformed AKNS hierarchy , and specialize to the cases of deformed NLS , KdV and mKdV hierarchies .
1	Our approach combines the Bohm hydrodynamical description of quantum mechanics with an information theoretical approach to determine an optimal quantum density function in terms of density approximates to a statistical sample .	We present an `` orbital '' free density functional theory for computing the quantum ground state of atomic clusters and liquids .	The ideas of Bayesian statistical analysis and an expectation-maximization procedure are combined to develop approximations to the quantum density and thus find the approximate quantum force .	The quantum force is then combined with a Lennard-Jones force to simulate clusters of Argon atoms and to obtain the ground state configurations and energies .	As demonstration of the utility and flexibility of the approach , we compute the lowest energy structures for small rare-glass clusters .
4	( 1997 ) ; and two types of Stark-based methods .	We examine the non-linear stability of the Wisdom-Holman ( WH ) mapping applied to the integration of perturbed , highly eccentric two-body orbits .	We find that the method is unstable and introduces artificial chaos into the computed trajectories , unless the step size is chosen small enough to resolve pericenter .	The origin of the instability is analyzed analytically using the Stark problem as a fiducial test case .	We similarly examine the robustness of several alternative methods : a regularized WH map due to Mikkola ( 1997 ) ; the potential-splitting ( PS ) approach of Lee et al .
4	This criterion can be applied in the case of significant role of random factors .	A new approach to provide a fruitful analysis of signal amplitude is proposed .	It is this method that has made it possible to eliminate some observed artificial events from the list of candidates for decays of superheavy nuclei .	Examples of estimates of measured amplitudes of evaporation residues ( EVR ) are presented .	Some attention is paid to a new hard statistical criterion for detecting rare events .
2	These solutions correspond to an interaction Hamiltonian modeled as the sum of a linear scalar confining and a screened one-gluon exchange ( OGE ) interaction .	The widths for $ \pi\pi $ decay of the L=1 charm mesons are calculated by describing the pion coupling to light constituents quarks by the lowest order chiral interaction .	The wavefunctions of the charm mesons are obtained as solutions to the covariant Blankenbecler-Sugar equation .	This interaction induces a two-quark contribution to the amplitude for two-pion decay , which is found to interfere destructively with the single quark amplitude .	For the currently known L=1 $ D $ mesons , the total $ \pi\pi $ decay widths are found to be $ \sim 1 $ MeV for the $ D_1 ( 2420 ) $ and $ \sim 3 $ MeV for the $ D^*_2 ( 2460 ) $ if the axial coupling of the constituent quark is taken to be $ g_A^q=1 $ .
4	These environmental variables are population level quantities .	We formulate models for the spread of infection on networks that are amenable to analysis in the large population limit .	We distinguish three different levels : ( 1 ) binding sites , ( 2 ) individuals , and ( 3 ) the population .	In the tradition of Physiologically Structured Population Models , the formulation starts on the individual level .	Influences from the `outside world ' on an individual are captured by environmental variables .
1	The wide range of phenomena resulting from this energy loss include : glitches , timing noise , jets , bow shocks , bullets and plerions and are be reviewed from an observational perspective .	Young radio pulsars shed vast amounts of rotational energy , sometimes as high as 100,000 times the total energy loss rate from the sun .	Past and proposed surveys for young radio pulsars are summarised along with pulsar birth velocities and associations with supernova remnants .	There are now 4 radio pulsars with measured braking indices .	The resulting constraints on the evolution of young radio pulsars are discussed in light of the presently observed population of pulsars .
1	Here , we allow the particles $ A $ and $ B $ to diffuse with rates $ D_A $ and $ D_B $ , which , in general , may be different .	We study front propagation in the irreversible epidemic model $ A+B\to 2A $ in one dimension .	We find analytic estimates for the front velocity by writing truncated master equation in a frame moving with the rightmost $ A $ particle .	The results obtained are in reasonable agreement with the simulation results and are amenable to systematic improvement .	We also observe a crossover from the linear dependence of front velocity $ V $ on $ D_A $ for smaller values of $ D_A $ to $ V\propto \sqrt { D_A } $ for larger $ D_A $ , but numerically still significantly different from the mean field value .
2	From the perspective of large deviations it is optimal to let the swap rate tend to infinity and it is possible to construct a corresponding simulation scheme , known as infinite swapping .	Parallel tempering , or replica exchange , is a popular method for simulating complex systems .	The idea is to run parallel simulations at different temperatures , and at a given swap rate exchange configurations between the parallel simulations .	In this paper we propose a novel use of large deviations for empirical measures for a more detailed analysis of the infinite swapping limit in the setting of continuous time jump Markov processes .	Using the large deviations rate function and associated stochastic control problems we consider a diagnostic based on temperature assignments , which can be easily computed during a simulation .
2	We then propose a conjecture relating continued fractions approximations and Seshadri-like constants of line bundles over rational surfaces .	We prove a gluing theorem which allows to construct an ample divisor on a rational surface from two given ample divisors on simpler surfaces .	This theorem combined with the Cremona action on the ample cone gives rise to an algorithm for constructing new ample divisors .	By applying our algorithm recursively we verify our conjecture in many cases and obtain new asymptotic estimates on these constants .	Finally , we explain the intuition behind the gluing theorem in terms of symplectic geometry and propose generalizations .
1	We show that small hole polaron formation depends on features in the electronic structure near the valence-band maximum and that , calculationally , these features depend on the methodology chosen for dealing with the correlated nature of the transition-metal d-derived states in these systems .	By combining first principles calculations and experimental XPS measurements , we investigate the electronic structure of potential Li-ion battery cathode materials LiMPO4 ( M=Mn , Fe , Co , Ni ) to uncover the underlying mechanisms that determine small hole polaron formation and migration .	Comparison with experiment reveals that a hybrid functional approach is superior to GGA+U in correctly reproducing the XPS spectra .	Using this approach we find that LiNiPO4 can not support small hole polarons , but that the other three compounds can .	The migration barrier is determined mainly by the strong or weak bonding nature of the states at the top of the valence band , resulting in a substantially higher barrier for LiMnPO4 than for LiCoPO4 or LiFePO4 .
0	We investigate the spatial and spectral properties of broad-area vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers ( VCSEL ) with frequency-selective feedback by a volume Bragg grating ( VBG ) .	We demonstrate wavelength locking similar to the case of edge-emitters but the spatial mode selection is different from the latter .	On-axis spatial solitons obtained at threshold give way to off-axis extended lasing states beyond threshold .	The investigations focus on a self-imaging external cavity .	It is analyzed how deviations from the self-imaging condition affect the pattern formation and a certain robustness of the phenomena is demonstrated .
1	Roughly , this means that the Martin-L\ '' of random sequences are precisely those sequences with high initial segment complexity .	According to the Levin-Schnorr theorem , a sequence $ X\in2^\omega $ is Martin-L\ '' of random with respect to the Lebesgue measure if and only if $ \mathrm { K } ( X\upharpoonright n ) \geq n-O ( 1 ) $ for every $ n $ , where $ \mathrm { K } $ denotes prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity .	It is well-known that the Levin-Schnorr theorem can be extended to proper sequences , that is , sequences that are random with respect to some computable measure on $ 2^\omega $ .	However , in this more general setting the initial segment complexity of sequences that are random with respect to different computable measures can vary widely .	In this paper , we study the various growth rates of proper sequences .
2	Changing the relative strengths of these interactions leads to a rich phase diagram containing gapped and critical phases , and exactly solvable points .	We study a quantum chain of spin-1/2 particles whose world lines form a loop gas .	In addition to the usual interaction that projects a pair of neighboring spins onto quantum-group spin 0 , we introduce a three-site interaction that projects onto spin 3/2 .	For loop weight $ n=2 \cos [ \pi/ ( p+1 ) ] $ , the model corresponds to N=p-3 species of interacting anyons , of which only the Fibonacci case N=1 was studied previously .	Our study applies to real n , and provides further exact results which were unnoticed even for the special case N=1 .
1	This is in stark contrast to the dilute gases of ultracold atoms , which have isotropic and extremely short-range , or `` contact '' , interactions .	Ultracold polar molecules offer the possibility of exploring quantum gases with interparticle interactions that are strong , long-range , and spatially anisotropic .	The large electric dipole moment of polar molecules can be tuned with an external electric field ; this provides unique opportunities such as control of ultracold chemical reactions , quantum information processing , and the realization of novel quantum many-body systems .	In spite of intense experimental efforts aimed at observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules , only recently have sufficiently high densities been achieved .	Here , we report the observation of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum degeneracy .
0	We determine detailed elemental abundances in stars belonging to the so-called Group 1 of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey ( GCS ) and compare the chemical composition with the Galactic thin- and thick-disc stars , with the GCS Group 2 and Group 3 stars , as well as with several kinematic streams of similar metallicities .	The aim is to search for chemical signatures that might give information about the formation history of this kinematic group of stars .	High-resolution spectra were obtained with the Fibre-fed Echelle Spectrograph ( FIES ) spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope , La Palma , and were analysed with a differential model atmosphere method .	Comparison stars were observed and analysed with the same method .	The average value of [ Fe/H ] for the 37 stars of Group 1 is -0.20 +- 0.14 dex .
4	This has some definite and simple implications for $ q $ -determinant-like representations of quantum $ \tau $ -functions .	One possible way to fix partly a `` canonical definition '' of $ \tau $ -functions beyond the conventional KP/Toda framework could be to postulate that evolution operators are { \it always } group elements .	We discuss implications of this postulate for the first non-trivial case : fundamental representations of quantum groups $ SL_q ( N ) $ .	It appears that the most suited ( simple ) for quantum deformation framework is some non-standard formulation of KP/Toda systems .	It turns out that the postulate needs to be slightly modified to take into account that no `` nilpotent subgroups '' exist in $ SL_q ( N ) $ for $ q\neq 1 $ .
4	Future Type Ia supernovae experiments ( like SNAP ) can verify whether this framework is correct .	We construct a semiclassical FLRW cosmological model assuming a running cosmological constant ( CC ) .	It turns out that the CC becomes variable at arbitrarily low energies due to the remnant quantum effects of the heaviest particles , e.g.the Planck scale physics .	These effects are universal in the sense that they lead to a low-energy structure common to a large class of high-energy theories .	Remarkably , the uncertainty concerning the unknown high-energy dynamics is accumulated into a single parameter \nu , such that the model has an essential predictive power .
4	The distillable entanglement by the class of one-way protocols converted from stabilizer codes for a certain class of states is equal to or greater than the achievable rate of stabilizer codes over the channel corresponding to the distilled state , and they can distill asymptotically more entanglement from a very noisy Werner state than the hashing protocol .	We show how to convert a quantum stabilizer code to a one-way or two-way entanglement distillation protocol .	The proposed conversion method is a generalization of those of Shor-Preskill and Nielsen-Chuang .	The recurrence protocol and the quantum privacy amplification protocol are equivalent to the protocols converted from [ [ 2,1 ] ] stabilizer codes .	We also give an example of a two-way protocol converted from a stabilizer better than the recurrence protocol and the quantum privacy amplification protocol .
2	Since the ground-state of each partner potential is node-less , we avoid any `` node '' -problem typically associated with the Monte Carlo technique .	We present here a supersymmetric ( SUSY ) approach for determining excitation energies within the context of a quantum Monte Carlo scheme .	By using the fact that SUSY quantum mechanics gives rises to a series of isospectral Hamiltonians , we show that Monte Carlo ground-state calculations in the SUSY partners can be used to reconstruct accurately both the spectrum and states of an arbitrary Schr\ '' odinger equation .	While we provide an example of using this approach to determine the tunneling states in a double-well potential , the method is applicable to any 1D potential problem .	We conclude by discussing the extension to higher dimensions .
1	From the early spectra it was immediately realized that it was a Type Ia supernova thus making this event the brightest one discovered in the last twenty years .	SN2011fe was detected by the Palomar Transient Factory on August 24th 2011 in M101 few hours after the explosion .	In this paper the observations performed with the instruments on board of INTEGRAL ( SPI , IBIS/ISGRI , JEM-X and OMC ) before and after the maximum of the optical light as well as the interpretation in terms of the existing models of $ \gamma $ -- ray emission from such kind of supernovae are reported .	All INTEGRAL high-energy have only been able to provide upper limits to the expected emission due to the decay of $ ^ { 56 } $ Ni .	These bounds allow to reject explosions involving a massive white dwarf in the sub -- Chandrasekhar scenario .
2	We present the energy spectrum and the bandwidth of the Dirac electrons in the presence of both the modulations .	We have investigated the electrical transport properties of Dirac electrons in a monolayer graphene sheet in the presence of both electric and magnetic modulations .	The effects of the modulations on quantum transport when they are in phase and out of phase are considered .	We determine the $ \sigma_ { yy } $ component of the magnetoconductivity tensor for this system which is shown to exhibit Weiss oscillations.Asymptotic expressions for $ \sigma_ { yy } $ are also calculated to better illustrate the effects of in-phase and out-of-phase modulations.We find that the position of the oscillations in magnetoconductivity depends on the relative strength of the two modulations .	When the two modulations are out-of-phase there is complete suppression of Weiss oscillations for particular relative strength of the modulations .
2	We compute the decrease of polarization degree with increasing intensity for different viewing angles and frequencies , and we show that an outward increasing temperature gradient , as expected in starless cores heated by the external radiation field , enhances the decrease of polarization .	We compute polarization maps for molecular cloud cores modeled as magnetized singular isothermal toroids , under the assumption that the emitting dust grains are aspherical and aligned with the large-scale magnetic field .	We show that , depending on the inclination of the toroid with the line-of-sight , the bending of the magnetic field lines resulting from the need to counteract the inward pull of gravity naturally produces a depolarization effect toward the centre of the map .	We compare our results with recent observations , and we conclude that this geometrical effect , together with other mechanisms of depolarization , may significantly contribute to the decrease of polarization degrees with intensity observed in the majority of molecular cloud cores .	Finally , we consider the dependence of the polarization degree on the dust temperature gradient predicted for externally heated clouds , and we briefly comment on the limits of the Chandrasekhar-Fermi formula to estimate the magnetic field strength in molecular cloud cores .
0	Gravitational waves ( GWs ) are ripples in space-time that are known to exist but have not yet been detected directly .	Once they are , a key feature of any viable theory of gravity will be demonstrated and a new window on the Universe opened .	GW astronomy was named as one of five key discovery areas in the New Worlds , New Horizons Decadal Report .	Pulsar timing probes GW frequencies , and hence source classes , that are inaccessible to any other detection method and can uniquely constrain the nonlinear nature of General Relativity .	Pulsar timing is therefore a critical capability with its own discovery space and potential .
1	This paper introduces a novel prior to study the inference of scale-free networks , which are widely used to model social and biological networks .	Learning the network structure underlying data is an important problem in machine learning .	The prior not only favors a desirable global node degree distribution , but also takes into consideration the relative strength of all the possible edges adjacent to the same node and the estimated degree of each individual node .	To fulfill this , ranking is incorporated into the prior , which makes the problem challenging to solve .	We employ an ADMM ( alternating direction method of multipliers ) framework to solve the Gaussian Graphical model regularized by this prior .
3	The lemma that allows for this painless extension we call the good Bellman function Lemma .	Using Wilson 's Haar basis in $ \R^n $ , which is different than the usual tensor product Haar functions , we define its associated dyadic paraproduct in $ \R^n $ .	We can then extend `` trivially '' Beznosova 's Bellman function proof of the linear bound in $ L^2 ( w ) $ with respect to $ [ w ] _ { A_2 } $ for the 1-dimensional dyadic paraproduct .	Here trivial means that each piece of the argument that had a Bellman function proof has an $ n $ -dimensional counterpart that holds with the same Bellman function .	Furthermore the argument allows to obtain dimensionless bounds in the anisotropic case .
1	We have investigated these effects by applying two consecutive positive high voltage pulses of 200-700 ns duration to a point plane gap in artificial air , pure nitrogen , other nitrogen-oxygen mixtures and pure argon at pressures between 67 and 533 mbar .	Streamer discharges are often operated in a repetitively pulsed mode and are therefore influenced by species left over from the previous discharge , especially free electrons and ions .	The pulses had pulse-to-pulse intervals ( { \Delta } t ) between 200 ns and 40 ms. We imaged both discharges with two ICCD cameras and combined this to a compound image .	We observe for values of { \Delta } t below 0.5-15 { \mu } s ( at 133 mbar , depending on gas mixture ) that during the second pulse the streamers continue the paths of the first-pulse streamers .	We call the maximal time for which this continuation still occurs the continuation time .
1	The primary design concerns include the transmit power allocation and the rate parameters of the wiretap code .	In this paper , we investigate the design of artificial-noise-aided secure multi-antenna transmission in slow fading channels .	We consider two scenarios with different complexity levels : i ) the design parameters are chosen to be fixed for all transmissions , ii ) they are adaptively adjusted based on the instantaneous channel feedback from the intended receiver .	In both scenarios , we provide explicit design solutions for achieving the maximal throughput subject to a secrecy constraint , given by a maximum allowable secrecy outage probability .	We then derive accurate approximations for the maximal throughput in both scenarios in the high signal-to-noise ratio region , and give new insights into the additional power cost for achieving a higher security level , whilst maintaining a specified target throughput .
2	We consider a number of different models ( including the holographic dark energy and dark energy in a fractal universe ) with interacting dark energy ( DE ) and dark matter ( DM ) , have done a thorough analysis of these models .	In this review we consider in detail different theoretical topics associated with interaction in the dark sector .	We study linear and nonlinear interactions which depend on the dark matter and dark energy densities .	The main task of this review was not only to give an idea about the modern set of different models of dark energy , but to show how much can be diverse dynamics of the universe in these models .	We find that the dynamics of a Universe that contains interaction in the dark sector can differ significantly from the Standard Cosmological Model ( SCM ) .
0	We study the local density of states around potential scatterers in d-wave superconductors , and show that quantum interference between impurity states is not negligible for experimentally relevant impurity concentrations .	The two impurity model is used as a paradigm to understand these effects analytically and in interpreting numerical solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations on fully disordered systems .	We focus primarily on the globally particle-hole symmetric model which has been the subject of considerable controversy , and give evidence that a zero-energy delta function exists in the DOS .	The anomalous spectral weight at zero energy is seen to arise from resonant impurity states belonging to a particular sublattice , exactly as in the 2-impurity version of this model .	We discuss the implications of these findings for realistic models of the cuprates .
1	Both economical and environmental factors now require that DBMSs pay close attention to energy consumption .	Database management systems ( DBMSs ) have largely ignored the task of managing the energy consumed during query processing .	In this paper we approach this issue by considering energy consumption as a first-class performance goal for query processing in a DBMS .	We present two concrete techniques that can be used by a DBMS to directly manage the energy consumption .	Both techniques trade energy consumption for performance .
4	Exchange in these two configurations depends differently on system parameters .	We study exchange coupling in Si double quantum dots , which have been proposed as suitable candidates for spin qubits due to their long spin coherence times .	We discuss in detail two alternative schemes which have been proposed for implementing spin qubits in quantum dots .	One scheme uses spin states in a single dot and the interdot exchange coupling controls interactions between unbiased dots .	The other scheme employs the singlet and triplet states of a biased double dot as the two-level system making up the qubit and exchange controls the energy splitting of the levels .
3	We then prove that , when $ \alpha $ is a constant , $ { \rm SKLE } _ { \alpha , b } $ up to some random hitting time and modulo a time change has the same distribution as $ { \rm SLE } _ { \alpha^2 } $ under a suitable Girsanov transformation .	Let $ D= { \mathbb H } \setminus \bigcup_ { j=1 } ^N C_j $ be a standard slit domain , where $ { \mathbb H } $ is the upper half plane and $ C_j,1\le j\le N , $ are mutually disjoint horizontal line segments in $ { \mathbb H } $ .	A stochastic Komatu-Loewner evolution denoted by $ { \rm SKLE } _ { \alpha , b } $ has been introduced in \cite { CF } as a family $ \ { F_t\ } $ of random growing hulls with $ F_t\subset D $ driven by a diffusion process $ \xi ( t ) $ on $ \partial { \mathbb H } $ that is determined by certain continuous homogeneous functions $ \alpha $ and $ b $ defined on the space $ { \cal S } $ of all labelled standard slit domains .	We aim at identifying the distribution of a suitably reparametrized $ { \rm SKLE } _ { \alpha , b } $ with that of the Loewner evolution on $ { \mathbb H } $ driven by the path of a certain continuous semimartingale and thereby relating the former to the distribution of $ { \rm SLE } _ { \alpha^2 } $ when $ \alpha $ is a constant .	We further show that a reparametrized $ { \rm SKLE } _ { \sqrt { 6 } , -b_ { \rm BMD } } $ has the same distribution as $ { \rm SLE } _6 $ , where $ b_ { \rm BMD } $ is the BMD-domain constant indicating the discrepancy of $ D $ from $ { \mathbb H } $ relative to Brownian motion with darning ( BMD in abbreviation ) .
4	This raises the question : do the operators defining our observations form an ordered consistent history ?	Classical mechanics and standard Copenhagen quantum mechanics respect subspace implications .	For example , if a particle is confined in a particular region $ R $ of space , then in these theories we can deduce that it is confined in regions containing $ R $ .	However , subspace implications are generally violated by versions of quantum theory that assign probabilities to histories , such as the consistent histories approach .	I define here a new criterion , ordered consistency , which refines the criterion of consistency and has the property that inferences made by ordered consistent sets do not violate subspace relations .
0	I discuss different formulations of the relativistic few-body problem with an emphasis on how they are related .	I first discuss the implications of some of the differences with non-relativistic quantum mechanics .	Then I point out that the principle of special relativity in quantum mechanics implies that the quantum theory has a Poincar\'e symmetry , which is realized by a unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group .	This representation can always be decomposed into direct integrals of irreducible representations and the different formulations differ only in how these irreducible representations are realized .	I discuss how these representations appear in different formulations of relativistic quantum mechanics and discuss some applications in each of these frameworks .
4	We confirm and extend earlier findings ; in particular , we once again demonstrate that it is only possible to detect the post-Riemannian spacetime geometry by ordinary ( non-microstructured ) test bodies if gravity is nonminimally coupled to matter .	We derive the equations of motion of extended deformable bodies in metric-affine gravity .	The conservation laws which follow from the invariance of the action under the general coordinate transformations are used as a starting point for the discussion of the dynamics of extended deformable test bodies .	By means of a covariant approach , based on Synge 's world function , we obtain the master equation of motion for an arbitrary system of coupled conserved currents .	This unified framework is then applied to metric-affine gravity .
4	Its accuracy performance is investigated thoroughly , and its running time is compared to other commonly available routines in two and three dimensions .	The algorithm AMGKQ for adaptive multivariate Gauss-Kronrod quadrature over hyper-rectangular regions of arbitrary dimensionality is proposed and implemented in Octave/MATLAB .	It can approximate numerically any number of integrals over a common domain simultaneously .	Improper integrals are addressed through singularity weakening coordinate transformations .	Internal singularities are addressed through the use of breakpoints .
1	Atoms in a given internal level are trapped in an optical lattice , and play the role of the impurities .	We introduce a simple set -- up corresponding to the matter-wave analogue of impurity atoms embedded in an infinite photonic crystal and interacting with the radiation field .	Atoms in an untrapped level play the role of the radiation field .	The interaction is mediated by means of lasers that couple those levels .	By tuning the lasers parameters , it is possible to drive the system through different regimes , and observe phenomena like matter wave superradiance , non-Markovian atom emission , and the appearance of bound atomic states .
4	Two loop arguments are interpreted in the context of the effective high energy effective theory based on the Standard Model Lagrangian in the symmetric basis with the appropriate matching conditions to include the soft QED regime .	Recent investigations of electroweak radiative corrections have revealed the importance of higher order contributions in high energy processes , where the size of typical corrections can exceed those associated with QCD considerably .	Beyond one loop , only universal ( angular independent ) corrections are known to all orders except for massless $ e^+ e^- \longrightarrow f { \overline f } $ processes where also angular dependent corrections exist in the literature .	In this paper we present general arguments for the consistent resummation of angular dependent subleading ( SL ) logarithmic corrections to all orders in the regime where all invariants are still large compared to the gauge boson masses .	We discuss soft isospin correlations , fermion mass and gauge boson mass gap effects , the longitudinal and Higgs boson sector as well as mixing contributions including CKM effects for massive quarks .
2	Emission from the H-alpha line shows evidence of a spiral density wave in the nearly edge-on disk .	HD 259440 is a B0pe star that was proposed as the optical counterpart to the gamma-ray source HESS J0632+057 .	Here we present optical spectra of HD 259440 acquired to investigate the stellar parameters , the properties of the Be star disk , and evidence of binarity in this system .	We find a best fit stellar effective temperature of 27500-30000 K and a log surface gravity of 3.75-4.0 , although our fits are somewhat ambiguous due to scattered light from the circumstellar disk .	We derive a mass of 13.2-19.0 M_sun and a radius of 6.0-9.6 R_sun .
3	We re-analyze the sample of 24,124 Kepler stars from Reinhold et al .	The high-precision photometry from the CoRoT and Kepler satellites has led to measurements of surface rotation periods for tens of thousands of stars .	Our main goal is to derive ages of thousands of field stars using consistent rotation period measurements in different gyrochronology relations .	Multiple rotation periods are interpreted as surface differential rotation ( DR ) .	( 2013 ) using different approaches based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram .
4	Despite its importance , little progress has been made in CIR due to the difficulty of capturing and representing contextual information about users .	Search engines are the most commonly used type of tool for finding relevant information on the Internet .	However , today 's search engines are far from perfect .	Typical search queries are short , often one or two words , and can be ambiguous therefore returning inappropriate results .	Contextual information retrieval ( CIR ) is a critical technique for these search engines to facilitate queries and return relevant information .
2	It is found that in some particular parameter ranges such solutions can be obtained in analytical form , however , numerically they are computed as existing in a far wider parametric range .	In the present contribution , we explore a host of different stationary states , namely dark-bright solitons and their lattices , that arise in the context of multi-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates .	The latter , are modeled by systems of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations with general interaction ( nonlinearity ) coefficients $ g_ { ij } $ .	Many features of the solutions under study , such as their analytical form without the trap or the stability/dynamical properties of one dark-bright soliton even in the presence of the trap are obtained analytically and corroborated numerically .	Additional features , such as the stability of soliton lattice homogeneous states or their existence/stability in the presence of the trap , are examined numerically .
4	The gas appears to be cold , and its morphology is somewhat elliptical with clumpy substructure .	The discovery of an HI cloud with peculiar properties at equatorial coordinates ( J2000 ) ra=07h49m , dec=04d30m is presented .	The HI object was detected at 21cm using the 300-m NAIC Arecibo telescope .	Subsequent follow-up high-resolution observations with the NRAO Very Large Array ( VLA ) telescope at L-Band revealed more details about its morphology .	The most intriguing aspect of the object is the clear velocity gradient of 1 km/s , which is present in the data , an indication of either rotation or expansion .
3	This comparison is motivated by differences in results exhibited between multiple Herschel studies of early-type galaxies .	The Herschel Space Observatory has had a tremendous impact on the study of extragalactic dust .	Specifically , early-type galaxies ( ETG ) have been the focus of several studies .	In this paper we combine results from two Herschel studies - a Virgo cluster study HeViCS and a broader , low-redshift H-ATLAS/GAMA study - and contrast the dust and associated properties for similar mass galaxies .	A comparison between consistent modified blackbody derived dust mass is carried out , revealing strong differences between the two samples in both dust mass and dust-to-stellar mass ratio .
4	The ratio of spherically averaged intracluster medium ( ICM ) pressures obtained from SZ and X-ray measurements depends only on the ICM intrinsic shape , projection orientation , and H_0 , which provides another illustration of how cluster geometry can be recovered through a combination of X-ray and SZ measurements .	This is the first of two papers investigating the deprojection and spherical averaging of ellipsoidal galaxy clusters .	We specifically consider applications to hydrostatic X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ( SZ ) studies , though many of the results also apply to isotropic dispersion-supported stellar dynamical systems .	Here we present analytical formulas for galaxy clusters described by a gravitational potential that is a triaxial ellipsoid of constant shape and orientation .	For this model type we show that the mass bias due to spherically averaging X-ray observations is independent of the temperature profile , and for the special case of a scale-free logarithmic potential , there is exactly zero mass bias for any shape , orientation , and temperature profile .
1	Our aim was to examine article and author productivity , the age of references used and impact of the journal .	We analysed 580 articles ( original articles only ) published in Medical Journal of Malaysia between 2004 and 2008 , the resources referenced by the articles and the citations and impact received .	Publication data was obtained from MyAIS database and Google Scholar provided the citation data .	From the 580 articles analyzed , contributors mainly come from the hospitals , universities and clinics .	Contributions from foreign authors are low .
0	We propose a new pattern recognition method that is able to reconstruct the 3D structure of the active part of a fault network using the spatial location of earthquakes .	The method is a generalization of the so-called dynamic clustering method , that originally partitions a set of datapoints into clusters , using a global minimization criterion over the spatial inertia of those clusters .	The new method improves on it by taking into account the full spatial inertia tensor of each cluster , in order to partition the dataset into fault-like , anisotropic clusters .	Given a catalog of seismic events , the output is the optimal set of plane segments that fits the spatial structure of the data .	Each plane segment is fully characterized by its location , size and orientation .
1	We study moreover the expected net polarization of top quarks produced in sbottom-to-chargino and stop-to-neutralino decays in scenarios with small chargino - neutralino mass difference , where these decays may be hard to distinguish .	We perform a comprehensive analysis of the polarization of the top quarks originating from sbottom-pair production at the LHC , followed by sbottom decays to top+chargino .	We show that , in contrast to top quarks produced via the Standard Model processes , the average polarization of top quarks originating from these SUSY decays can obtain any value between +1 and -1 .	We further study the effect of this polarization on the top quark decay kinematics .	On the one hand this may be used to construct measures of this polarization , on the other hand it may be used to enhance the search reach in certain scenarios .
1	During translation , macromolecules called ribosomes `` read '' the mRNA strand in a sequential manner and produce a corresponding protein .	Translation is a crucial step in gene expression .	Translation is known to consume most of the cell 's energy .	Maximizing the protein production rate in mRNA translation , subject to the bounded biomolecullar budget , is thus an important problem in both biology and biotechnology .	We consider this problem using a mathematical model for mRNA translation called the ribosome flow model ( RFM ) .
0	Usando la noci\'on de C-ortocentro se extienden , a planos de Minkowski en general , nociones de la geometr\'ia cl\'asica relacionadas con un tri\'angulo , como por ejemplo : puntos de Euler , tri\'angulo de Euler , puntos de Poncelet .	Se muestran propiedades de estas nociones y sus relaciones con la circunferencia de Feuerbach .	Se estudian sistemas C-ortoc\'entricos formados por puntos presentes en dichas nociones y se establecen relaciones con la ortogonalidad is\'osceles y cordal .	Adem\'as , se prueba que la imagen homot\'etica de un sistema C-ortoc\'entrico es un sistema C-ortoc\'entrico .	-- Using the notion of C-orthocenter , notions of the classic euclidean geometry related with a triangle , as for example : Euler points ; Euler 's triangle ; and Poncelet 's points , are extended to Minkowski planes in general .
2	The problem is closely related to the existence question for periodic orbits on energy levels of a proper Hamiltonian near a Morse-Bott non-degenerate minimum .	The Hamiltonian flow of the standard metric Hamiltonian with respect to the twisted symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle describes the motion of a charged particle on the base .	We prove that under certain natural hypotheses the number of periodic orbits on low energy levels for this flow is at least the sum of Betti numbers of the base .	In this case , when some extra requirements are met , we also give a lower bound for the number of periodic orbits .	Both of these questions are very similar to the Weinstein conjecture but differ from it in that the energy levels may fail to have contact type .
4	Finally , we consider how the ideas can be used to tackle some important variants of the compatibility problem ; in particular , the case of identical particles ( known as N-representability in the case of fermions ) is considered .	The subsystem compatibility problem , which concerns the question of whether a set of subsystem states are compatible with a state of the entire system , has received much study .	Here we attack the problem from a new angle , utilising the ideas of convexity that have been successfully employed against the separability problem .	Analogously to an entanglement witness , we introduce the idea of a compatibility witness , and prove a number of properties about these objects .	We show that the subsystem compatibility problem can be solved numerically and efficiently using semidefinite programming , and that the numerical results from this solution can be used to extract exact analytic results , an idea which we use to disprove a conjecture about the subsystem problem made by Butterley et al . [ Found.Phys.36 83 ( 2006 ) ] .
3	We give simple explanation of the big difference between detected black holes masses and mean black hole mass statistic from observations X-ray Nova systems .	The Advanced LIGO observatory recently reported the first direct detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein ( 1916 ) .	The detection of the event confirmed the main prediction of the pop- ulation synthesis performed with the Scenario Machine and formulated in the title of the paper by Lipunov , Postnov & amp ; Prokhorov ( 1997b ) : `` First LIGO events : binary black holes merging '' .	We dis- cuss the parameters of black holes and event rates predicted different binary scenario evolution .	Proximity of the mass components GW150914 is good agreement with the observed mass ratio distribution in massive binary systems , which usually used in Scenario Machine calculations for massive binaries .
0	From high-resolution spectra a non-LTE analysis of the MgII 4481.2 A feature is implemented for 52 early and medium local B stars on the main sequence ( MS ) .	The influence of the neighbouring line AlIII 4479.9 A is considered .	The magnesium abundance is determined ; it is found that log e ( Mg ) = 7.67 +- 0.21 on average .	It is shown that uncertainties in the microturbulent parameter Vt are the main source of errors in log e ( Mg ) .	When using 36 stars with the most reliable Vt values derived from OII and NII lines , we obtain the mean abundance log e ( Mg ) = 7.59 +- 0.15 .
0	In this work we study a Horava-like five-dimensional model in the context of braneworld theory .	To begin with , the equations of motion of such model are obtained and , within the realm of warped geometry , we show that the model is consistent if and only if $ \lambda $ takes its relativistic value 1 .	Furthermore , since the first derivative of the warp factor is discontinuous over the branes , we show that the elimination of problematic terms involving the square of the warp factor second order derivatives are eliminated by imposing detailed balance condition in the bulk .	Afterwards , the Israel 's junction conditions are computed , allowing the attainment of an effective Lagrangian in the visible brane .	In particular , for a ( 4+1 ) -dimensional Horava-like model defined in the bulk without cosmological constant , we show that the resultant effective Lagrangian in the brane corresponds to a ( 3+1 ) -dimensional Horava-like model with an emergent positive cosmological constant but without detailed balance condition .
2	Examples are given of unconventional pairing in hole- and electron-doped cuprates , organic and heavy fermion superconductors .	This topical review summarizes various features of magnetic penetration depth in unconventional superconductors .	Precise measurements of the penetration depth as a function of temperature , magnetic field and crystal orientation can provide detailed information about the pairing state .	The ability to apply an external magnetic field adds a new dimension to penetration depth measurements .	We discuss how field dependent measurements can be used to study surface Andreev bound states , nonlinear Meissner effects , magnetic impurities , magnetic ordering , proximity effects and vortex motion .
2	We use this name informally for graphs that share some regularity properties that are related to distance in the graph .	Distance-regular graphs are a key concept in Algebraic Combinatorics and have given rise to several generalizations , such as association schemes .	Motivated by spectral and other algebraic characterizations of distance-regular graphs , we study `almost distance-regular graphs ' .	For example , a known characterization of a distance-regular graph is the invariance of the number of walks of given length between vertices at a given distance , while a graph is called walk-regular if the number of closed walks of given length rooted at any given vertex is a constant .	One of the concepts studied here is a generalization of both distance-regularity and walk-regularity called $ m $ -walk-regularity .
3	The conjecture will be proven for the class of convolutional codes where either the code itself or its dual does not have Forney indices bigger than one .	The adjacency matrix associated with a convolutional code collects in a detailed manner information about the weight distribution of the code .	A MacWilliams Identity Conjecture , stating that the adjacency matrix of a code fully determines the adjacency matrix of the dual code , will be formulated , and an explicit formula for the transformation will be stated .	The formula involves the MacWilliams matrix known from complete weight enumerators of block codes .	For the general case the conjecture is backed up by many examples , and a weaker version will be established .
1	This work aims at establishing a link between the line asymmetry evolution over the Cepheids ' pulsation cycles and their projection factor , with the final objective to improve the accuracy of the Baade-Wesselink method for distance determinations .	The ratio of pulsation to radial velocity ( the projection factor ) is currently limiting the accuracy of the interferometric Baade-Wesselink method .	We present HARPS high spectral resolution observations of nine galactic Cepheids having a good period sampling .	We fit spectral line profiles by an asymmetric bi-Gaussian to derive radial velocity , Full-Width at Half-Maximum in the line ( FWHM ) and line asymmetry for all stars .	We then extract correlations curves between radial velocity and asymmetry .
3	They can bid in the day-ahead market , and the powers they deliver to the market are controllable up to their maximum available powers .	The increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources ( RES ) requires more Flexibility Resources ( FR ) , generally thermal units and storages , must be kept in the system to accommodate the uncertainties from RES .	The challenge is how the system can survive when the RES level is very high .	In this paper , RESs are considered as full-role market participants .	Therefore , RESs are effectively dispatchable and can function as FR providers .
0	We study the rotational distortions of the vacuum dipole magnetic field in the context of geometrical models of the radio emission from pulsars .	We find that at low altitudes the rotation deflects the local direction of the magnetic field by at most an angle of the order of r_n^2 , where r_n = r/Rlc , r is the radial distance of the radio emission and Rlc is the light cylinder radius .	To the second order in r_n , this distortion is symmetrical with respect to the plane containing the dipole axis and the rotation axis ( Omega-mu plane ) .	The lowest order distortion which is asymmetrical with respect to the Omega-mu plane is third order in r_n .	We show , however , that the influence of the sweepback on the outer boundary of the open field line region ( open volume ) is a much larger effect , of the order of r_n^1/2 .
3	Let p_m ( n ) be the probability that a random n-permutation has an mth root .	Let m be a fixed positive integer .	It is well-known that a permutation $ \sigma $ may have one , many , or no mth roots .	In this note we provide an explicit expression and a generating function for the number of mth roots of \sigma .	We also include a proof that p_m ( jq ) =p_m ( jq+1 ) = ... =p_m ( jq+ ( q-1 ) ) where j=0,1 , ... and m is a power of prime q .
2	The value of the staggered magnetization at zero temperature is 0.6\mu_B , the maximum value allowed by spin quantum fluctuations .	The present work addresses YBa $ _ { 2 } $ Cu $ _ { 3 } $ O $ _ { y } $ at doping below x=6 % where the compound is a collinear antiferromagnet .	In this region YBa $ _ { 2 } $ Cu $ _ { 3 } $ O $ _ { y } $ is a normal conductor with a finite resistivity at zero temperature .	The staggered magnetization is almost independent of doping .	On the other hand , the Neel temperature decays very quickly from T_N=420K at x=0 to practically zero at x = 0.06 .
1	Models of magnetic braking can also explain the evolution of close binary systems , including cataclysmic variables .	Magnetic braking causes the spin-down of single stars as they evolve on the main sequence .	The well-known period gap in the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variable systems indicates that magnetic braking must be significantly disrupted in secondaries that are fully convective .	However , activity studies show that fully convective stars are some of the most active stars observed in young open clusters .	There is therefore conflicting evidence about what happens to magnetic activity in fully convective stars .
1	The black-hole black-string transition is a prime realization of such a system and its phase diagram has been the subject of considerable study in the last few years .	Black hole uniqueness is known to fail in higher dimensions , and the multiplicity of black hole phases leads to phase transitions physics in General Relativity .	The most surprising results seem to be the appearance of critical dimensions where the qualitative behavior of the system changes , and a novel kind of topology change .	Recently , a full phase diagram was determined numerically , confirming earlier predictions for a merger of the black-hole and black string phases and giving very strong evidence that the end-state of the Gregory-Laflamme instability is a black hole ( in the dimension range 4 & lt ; D & lt ; 14 ) .	Here this progress is reviewed , illustrated with figures , put into a wider context , and the still open questions are listed .
0	This talk reports on results on the deformation quantization ( star products ) and on approximative operator representations for quantizable compact K '' ahler manifolds obtained via Berezin-Toeplitz operators .	After choosing a holomorphic quantum line bundle the Berezin-Toeplitz operator associated to a differentiable function on the manifold is the operator defined by multiplying global holomorphic sections of the line bundle with this function and projecting the differentiable section back to the subspace of holomorphic sections .	The results were obtained in ( respectively based on ) joint work with M. Bordemann and E. Meinrenken .

3	Consequently , the corresponding Ricci tensor is nonzero .	We investigate T-duality of a closed string moving in a weakly curved background of the second order .	A previously discussed weakly curved background consisted of a flat metric and a linearly coordinate dependent Kalb-Ramond field with an infinitesimal strength .	The background here considered differs from the above in a coordinate dependent metric of the second order .	As this background does not posses the global shift symmetry the generalized Buscher T-dualization procedure is not applicable to it .
0	The holographic correspondence between 2d , N=2 quantum field theories and classical 4d , N=2 supergravity coupled to hypermultiplet matter is proposed .	The geometrical constraints on the target space of the 4d , N=2 non-linear sigma-models in N=2 supergravity background are interpreted as the exact renormalization group flow equations in two dimensions .	Our geometrical description of the renormalization flow is manifestly covariant under general reparametrization of the 2d coupling constants .	An explicit exact solution to the 2d renormalization flow , based on its dual holographic description in terms of the Zamolodchikov metric , is considered in the particular case of the four-dimensional NLSM target space described by the SU ( 2 ) -invariant ( Weyl ) anti-self-dual Einstein metrics .	The exact regular ( Tod-Hitchin ) solutions to these metrics are governed by the Painlev'e VI equation , and describe domain walls .
2	The column densities assuming solar abundances are consistent with ~ few x $ 10^ { 22 } cm^ { -2 } $ in excess of the Galactic value , and may point to surrounding cold material associated with GRS 1915+105 .	A Chandra AO1 30ks HETGS observation of the X-ray transient micro-quasar GRS 1915+105 reveals absorption edges and faint line emission over the HETG energy range .	We find from a preliminary analysis evidence for prominent neutral K edges associated with iron , silicon , magnesium , and tentatively sulphur .	Neutral Fe K $ \alpha $ emission , and ionized absorption from Fe XXV and Fe XXVI are resolved .	We limit our discussion to the Chandra results .
2	In particular , starting from a solution to the Dirac equation , one obtains a chain of other solutions to both Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations .	A non-canonical correspondence of the complete sets of solutions to the Dirac and Klein-Gordon free equations in Minkowski space-time is established .	This allows for a novel viewpoint on the relationship of relativistic equations for different spins and on the origin of spinor transformations .	A comparison with the massless case is performed , and examples of non-trivial singular solutions are presented .	A generalization to Riemannian space-time and inclusion of interactions are briefly discussed .
4	The states in this superspace are arranged in a hierarchy of `complexity ' .	We construct a model which illustrates the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity .	In the fuzzball paradigm , the black hole microstates have no interior , and radiate unitarily from their surface through quanta of energy $ E\sim T $ .	But quanta with $ E\gg T $ impinging on the fuzzball create large collective excitations of the fuzzball surface .	The dynamics of such excitations must be studied as an evolution in superspace , the space of all fuzzball solution $ |F_i\rangle $ .
0	We report the results of an observation of the galactic black-hole binary 4U 1543-475 performed by XMM-Newton on 2002 August 18 , about two months after the start of an outburst detected by Rossi-XTE .	Despite the relatively low flux of the source , corresponding to a luminosity Lx ~ 4x10^34 erg/s ( i.e.about 10^ ( -5 ) times the Eddington luminosity ) , we could obtain a good quality spectrum thanks to the high throughput of the XMM-Newton EPIC instrument .	The spectrum is well fit by a power law with photon index 1.9-2 without any evidence for iron emission lines or for thermal emission from an accretion disk .	We could estimate an upper-limit on the disk bolometric luminosity as a function of the colour temperature : it is always lower than ~10^33 erg/s , i.e.less than 10 % of the source total luminosity .	Finally , we evaluated that the disk colour temperature must satisy the condition kTcol & lt ; 0.25 keV in order to obtain an acceptable value for the disk inner radius .
4	The measured $ D_s^ { *+ } $ longitudinal polarization , $ \Gamma_L/\Gamma = ( 50.6 \pm 13.9 \pm 3.6 ) % $ , is consistent with the factorization prediction of 54 % .	This article describes improved measurements by CLEO of the $ B^0 \to D_s^+ D^ { *- } $ and $ B^0 \to D_s^ { *+ } D^ { *- } $ branching fractions , and first evidence for the decay $ B^+ \to D_s^ { ( * ) + } \bar { D } ^ { **0 } $ , where $ \bar { D } ^ { **0 } $ represents the sum of the $ \bar { D } _1 ( 2420 ) ^0 $ , $ \bar { D } _2^* ( 2460 ) ^0 $ , and $ \bar { D } _1 ( j=1/2 ) ^0 $ L=1 charm meson states .	Also reported is the first measurement of the $ D_s^ { *+ } $ polarization in the decay $ B^0 \to D_s^ { *+ } D^ { *- } $ .	A partial reconstruction technique , employing only the fully reconstructed $ D_s^+ $ and slow pion $ \pi_s^- $ from the $ D^ { *- } \to \bar { D } ^0 \pi^-_s $ decay , enhances sensitivity .	The observed branching fractions are $ { \mathcal B } ( B^0 \to D_s^+ D^ { *- } ) = ( 1.10 \pm 0.18 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.28 ) % $ , $ { \mathcal B } ( B^0 \to D_s^ { *+ } D^ { *- } ) = ( 1.82 \pm 0.37 \pm 0.24 \pm 0.46 ) % $ , and $ { \mathcal B } ( B^+ \to D_s^ { ( * ) + } \bar { D } ^ { **0 } ) = ( 2.73 \pm 0.78 \pm 0.48 \pm 0.68 ) % $ , where the first error is statistical , the second systematic , and the third is due to the uncertainty in the $ D_s^+ \to \phi \pi^+ $ branching fraction .

We present the big picture of CLNP packet processing , the details of input , routing , and output processing functions , and the implementation of each function based on ISO 8473-1 .	The functions implemented in this work are PDU header decomposition , header format analysis , header error detection , error reporting , reassembly , source routing , congestion notification , forwarding , composition , segmentation , and transmit to device functions .	Each function is initially implemented and tested as a separated loadable kernel module .
3	We find suggestive , though not unambiguous evidence , that these sources have a common , broadband mechanism for intrinsic variations , in agreement with previous studies of a subset of these source .	We present light curves for 149 sources monitored with the Green Bank Interferometer .	The light curves are at two radio frequencies ( approximately 2.5 and 8.2 GHz ) and range from 3 to 15 yrs in length , covering the interval 1979 -- 1996 , and have a typical sampling of one flux density measurement every 2 days .	We have used these light curves to conduct various variability analysis ( rms flux density variations and autoregressive , integrated , moving average modeling ) of these sources .	We also find that the sources generally display a short-term variability ( ~ 10 d ) that arises from radio-wave scattering in an extended medium .
0	We study flows on the scalar manifold of N=8 gauged supergravity in five dimensions which are dual to certain mass deformations of N=4 super Yang -- Mills theory .	In particular , we consider a perturbation of the gauge theory by a mass term for the adjoint hyper-multiplet , giving rise to an N=2 theory .	The exact solution of the 5-dim gauged supergravity equations of motion is found and the metric is uplifted to a ten-dimensional background of type-IIB supergravity .	Using these geometric data and the AdS/CFT correspondence we analyze the spectra of certain operators as well as Wilson loops on the dual gauge theory side .	The physical flows are parametrized by a single non-positive constant and describe part of the Coulomb branch of the N=2 theory at strong coupling .
2	B 59 , 495 ( 2007 ) or arXiv : cond-mat/0602656 ) on the basis of a controlled strong coupling expansion that the Luttinger theorem is violated in this limit for a particle-hole asymmetric two-band Mott insulator .	In his preprint , arXiv:0711.0952v1 , Behnam Farid argues that the Luttinger theorem is valid not only for a metal but also for a Mott insulator if the chemical potential is calculated by taking the limit of vanishing temperature at fixed particle density .	In contrast , we have found in our recent paper ( Eur.Phys.J .	In an extensive discussion of our result Farid argues that an arbitrarily weak breaking of particle-hole symmetry leads to a destruction of the Mott insulating state at half filling .	In this comment we point out that this is not correct .
0	In VANET high speed is the real characteristics which leads frequent breakdown , interference etc .	In this paper we studied various Ad hoc routing protocols , Reactive , Proactive & amp ; Hybrid , taking into consideration various VANET parameters like speed , altitude etc in real traffic scenario and evaluated them for various battery models for energy conservation..	The AODV and DYMO ( Reactive ) , OLSR ( Proactive ) and ZRP ( hybrid ) protocols are compared for battery models Duracell AA ( MX- 1500 ) , Duracell AAA ( MN-2400 ) , Duracell AAA ( MX-2400 ) , Duracell C-MN ( MN-1400 ) , Panasonic AA standard using Qualnet as a Simulation tool .	Since Energy conservation is main focus area nowadays .	Hence performance of the protocols with various battery models counts and helps to make a right selection .
2	Initially , the basic structure of the hosts is revealed using a modified Clean deconvolution routine optimised for this analysis .	We present the results of a deep K-band imaging study which reveals the host galaxies around a sample of luminous radio-quiet quasars .	The K-band images , obtained at UKIRT , are of sufficient quality to allow accurate modelling of the underlying host galaxy .	2 of the 14 quasars are shown to have host galaxies with violently disturbed morphologies which can not be modelled by smooth elliptical profiles .	For the remainder of our sample , 2D models of the host and nuclear component are fitted to the images using the chi-squared statistic to determine goodness of fit .
4	Self-organization can be used as a concept to guide the design of systems towards higher values of autopoiesis , with the potential of making technology more `` living '' , i.e.adaptive and robust .	Ashby 's law of requisite variety states that a controller must have at least as much variety ( complexity ) as the controlled .	Maturana and Varela proposed autopoiesis ( self-production ) to define living systems .	Living systems also require to fulfill the law of requisite variety .	A measure of autopoiesis has been proposed as the ratio between the complexity of a system and the complexity of its environment .
4	Physical parameters of the setup are chosen to model the close systems of DQ Tau and AK Sco .	We study the evolution and emission of circumbinary disks around close classical T Tauri binary systems .	High resolution numerical hydrodynamical simulations are employed to model a system consisting of a central eccentric binary star within an irradiated accretion disk .	A detailed energy balance including viscous heating , radiative cooling and irradiation from the central star is applied to calculate accurately the emitted spectral energy distribution .	Numerical simulations using two different methods , the previously developed Dual-Grid technique with a finite difference discretization , and the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method are employed to compare the hydrodynamical features and strengthen our conclusions .
3	As a test of our numerical scheme , we are able to reproduce results from earlier , similar work by Igumenshchev and Abramowicz and Stone et al .	We report on a numerical study of viscous fluid accretion onto a black hole .	The flow is axisymmetric and uses a pseudo-Newtonian potential to model relativistic effects near the event horizon .	The numerical method is a variant of the ZEUS code .	We consider models in which mass is injected onto the grid as well as models in which an initial equilibrium torus is accreted .
4	The code has been designed to be used by research scientists who are familiar with C as a parallel-processing computational framework that enables the easy development of parallel-processing image-analysis programs based on embarrassingly-parallel algorithms .	The development of parallel-processing image-analysis codes is generally a challenging task that requires complicated choreography of interprocessor communications .	If , however , the image-analysis algorithm is embarrassingly parallel , then the development of a parallel-processing implementation of that algorithm can be a much easier task to accomplish because , by definition , there is little need for communication between the compute processes .	I describe the design , implementation , and performance of a parallel-processing image-analysis application , called CRBLASTER , which does cosmic-ray rejection of CCD ( charge-coupled device ) images using the embarrassingly-parallel L.A.COSMIC algorithm .	CRBLASTER is written in C using the high-performance computing industry standard Message Passing Interface ( MPI ) library .
4	1998 , Lagache et al.1999 ) .	A Cosmic Far-InfraRed Background ( CFIRB ) has long been predicted that would traces the intial phases of galaxy formation .	It has been first detected by Puget et al .	( 1996 ) using COBE data and has been later confirmed by several recent studies ( Fixsen et al .	1998 , Hauser et al .
1	Analytic continuation is used to determine non-linear susceptibilities , to test the Hadron Resonance Gas ( HRG ) model below the zero density critical temperature , Tc , and to determine the average phase factor of the fermion determinant .	We study QCD thermodynamics in presence of two independent imaginary chemical potentials coupled to two degenerate flavors of staggered quarks .	Deviations from HRG predictions , of the order of a few percent , are clearly visible for temperatures T & gt ; 0.95 Tc .	The determination of non-linear susceptibilities , using different interpolating functions for analytic continuation , gives consistent results and in agreement with Taylor expansion computations , apart from some systematic effects at or right above Tc .	Results for the average phase factor are compared with the predictions of Chiral Perturbation Theory ; below Tc we are able to distinguish the contribution of different hadron states , which is positive ( i.e.tends to mitigate the sign problem ) in the case of baryons .
1	We prove that in a broadband limit the conditions for stable super-resolution are the { \em packing } condition that the spacing among the $ N $ transmitters and $ M $ receivers be more than the coherence length $ \ell_c $ and the consecutive symbols in the data-streams are separated by more than the inverse of the bandwidth $ B^ { -1 } $ and the { \em multiplexing } condition that the number of the degrees of freedom per unit time at the transmitters ( $ \sim NB $ ) be much larger than the number of the degrees of freedom ( $ \sim MC $ ) per unit time in the ensemble of intended messages .	We analyze the time reversal of a multiple-input-multiple-output ( MIMO ) system in a space-frequency-selective multi-path fading channel described by the stochastic Schr\ '' odinger equation with a random potential in the strong-fluctuation regime .	Here $ C $ is the number of symbols per unit time in the data-streams intended for each receiver .	When the two conditions are met , all receivers receive simultaneously streams of statistically stable , sharply focused signals intended for them , free of fading and interference .	This indicates the rough multiplexing gain of $ NB $ in channel capacity , with the maximal gain per unit { \em angular } cross section given by $ BL^d \ell_c^ { -d } $ where $ L $ is the distance from the transmitters to the receivers .
0	In the context of the highly increasing number of features that are available nowadays we design a robust and fast method for feature selection .	The method tries to select the most representative features that are independent from each other , but are strong together .	We propose an algorithm that requires very limited labeled data ( as few as one labeled frame per class ) and can accommodate as many unlabeled samples .	We also present here the supervised approach from which we started .	We compare our two formulations with established methods like AdaBoost , SVM , Lasso , Elastic Net and FoBa and show that our method is much faster and it has constant training time .
4	Finally we comment on the event rates leading to the atom ionization and subsequent detection of the outgoing electrons .	In this paper we review the theoretical issues involved in the direct detection of supersymmetric ( SUSY ) dark matter .	After a brief discussion of the allowed SYSY parameter space we focus on the determination of the traditional neutralino detection rates , in experiments which measure the energy of the recoiling nucleus , such as the coherent and spin induced rates and the dependence of the rate on the motion of the Earth ( modulation effect ) .	Then we examine the novel features appearing in directional experiments , which detect the recoiling nucleus in a given direction .	Next we estimate the branching ratios for transitions to accessible excited nuclear levels .
1	However , transmission trees from one outbreak do not generalize to future outbreaks .	Recent work has attempted to use whole-genome sequence data from pathogens to reconstruct the transmission trees linking infectors and infectees in outbreaks .	Reconstruction of transmission trees is most useful to public health if it leads to generalizable scientific insights about disease transmission .	In a survival analysis framework , estimation of transmission parameters is based on sums or averages over the possible transmission trees .	A phylogeny can increase the precision of these estimates by providing partial information about who infected whom .
2	We then study lattices with a small angle defect where we find that the gaps of the periodic problem fill with spectrum as the defect angle goes to zero .	We discuss two types of defects in two-dimensional lattices , namely ( 1 ) translational dislocations and ( 2 ) defects produced by a rotation of the lattice in a half-space .	For Lipschitz-continuous and $ \Z^2 $ -periodic potentials , we first show that translational dislocations produce spectrum inside the gaps of the periodic problem ; we also give estimates for the ( integrated ) density of the associated surface states .	To introduce our methods , we begin with the study of dislocation problems on the real line and on an infinite strip .	Finally , we consider examples of muffin tin type .
4	We use this model to study further the degree of unpredictability certified by different quantum phenomena , showing that quantum complementarity guarantees a form of relativised unpredictability that is weaker than that guaranteed by Kochen-Specker-type value indefiniteness .	Little effort has been devoted to studying generalised notions or models of ( un ) predictability , yet is an important concept throughout physics and plays a central role in quantum information theory , where key results rely on the supposed inherent unpredictability of measurement outcomes .	In this paper we continue the programme started in [ 1 ] developing a general , non-probabilistic model of ( un ) predictability in physics .	We present a more refined model that is capable of studying different degrees of `` relativised '' unpredictability .	This model is based on the ability for an agent , acting via uniform , effective means , to predict correctly and reproducibly the outcome of an experiment using finite information extracted from the environment .
2	Particularly , this is the first time that the sound velocity is found to first increase and then decrease as the superlattice strength increases even at one dimension .	A Bose gas trapped in a one-dimensional optical superlattice has emerged as a novel superfluid characterized by tunable lattice topologies and tailored band structures .	In this work , we focus on the propagation of sound in such a novel system and have found new features on sound velocity , which arises from the interplay between the two lattices with different periodicity and is not present in the case of a condensate in a monochromatic optical lattice .	Such unusual behavior can be analytically understood in terms of the competition between the decreasing compressibility and the increasing effective mass due to the increasing superlattice strength .	This result suggests a new route to engineer the sound velocity by manipulating the superlattice 's parameters .
4	This kind of multiscale phenomenology , which is well known to physicists since it is relevant in fully developed turbulence and in disordered systems , is recently pointed out for financial series .	The dynamics of prices in financial markets has been studied intensively both experimentally ( data analysis ) and theoretically ( models ) .	Nevertheless , a complete stochastic characterization of volatility is still lacking .	What it is well known is that absolute returns have memory on a long time range , this phenomenon is known as clustering of volatility .	In this paper we show that volatility correlations are power-laws with a non-unique scaling exponent .
4	Stability was determined using linear perturbation theory and , in a few cases , confirmed by numerical integration of the equations of motion .	We consider warped equilibrium configurations for stellar and gaseous disks in the Keplerian force-field of a supermassive black hole , assuming that the self-gravity of the disk provides the only acting torques .	Modeling the disk as a collection of concentric circular rings , and computing the torques in the non-linear regime , we show that stable , strongly warped precessing equilibria are possible .	These solutions exist for a wide range of disk-to-black hole mass ratios $ M_d/M_ { bh } $ , can span large warp angles of up to $ \pm\sim 120\deg $ , have inner and outer boundaries , and extend over a radial range of a factor of typically two to four .	These equilibrium configurations obey a scaling relation such that in good approximation $ \phidot/\Omega\propto M_d/M_ { bh } $ where $ \phidot $ is the ( retrograde ) precession frequency and $ \Omega $ is a characteristic orbital frequency in the disk .
2	When both particles are simultaneously in contact with HE an indirect coupling between them is observed only if the particles are in near resonance .	We consider the classical dynamics of two particles moving in harmonic potential wells and interacting with the same external environment ( HE ) , consisting of N non-interacting chaotic systems .	The parameters are set so that when either particle is separately placed in contact with the environment , a dissipative behavior is observed .	We study the equilibrium properties of the system considering ensemble averages for the case N=1 and single trajectory dynamics for N large .	In both cases , the particles and the environment reach an equilibrium configuration at long times , but only for large N a temperature can be assigned to the system .
0	We present data for the scaling behavior of lattice QCD with two flavors of light Wilson fermions .	This is done by matching $ \pi $ n and $ \rho $ masses at the two lattice sizes of $ 16^3\times32 $ and $ 8^3\times16 $ .	We find that at $ \beta=6/g^2\equiv5.3 $ the matching does not occur over a range extending down to $ \beta=3.5 $ .	For $ \beta=5.5 $ matching may be achieved at $ \beta=4.8-4.9 $ , leading to a $ \Delta \beta =0.6-0.7 $ which is higher than the perturbative 2-loop value of 0.45 .	In both cases we conclude that the simulations are very far from the perturbative scaling region .
3	The instability develops as predicted by linear theory .	We have investigated the development of current-driven ( CD ) kink instability through three-dimensional relativistic MHD simulations .	A static force-free equilibrium helical magnetic configuration is considered in order to study the influence of the initial configuration on the linear and nonlinear evolution of the instability .	We found that the initial configuration is strongly distorted but not disrupted by the kink instability .	In the non-linear regime the kink amplitude continues to increase up to the terminal simulation time , albeit at different rates , for all but one simulation .
3	Outflow velocities of 3-19 km/s , larger than indicated by Halpha profiles , are needed in the upper chromosphere to achieve good agreement between the model spectra and the observations .	Chromospheric model calculations of the Halpha line for selected red giant branch ( RGB ) and asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) stars in the globular clusters M13 , M15 , and M92 are constructed to derive mass loss rates .	The model spectra are compared to the observations obtained with the Hectochelle on the MMT telescope .	These stars show strong Halpha emissions and blue-shifted Halpha cores signaling that mass outflow is present in all stars .	The resulting mass loss rates range from 0.6*10^ { -9 } to 5*10^ { -9 } Msun/yr , which are about an order of magnitude lower than predicted from `` Reimers ' law '' or inferred from the infrared excess of similar stars .
2	To discover new warm debris disk candidates that show large 18 micron excess and estimate the fraction of stars with excess based on the AKARI/IRC Mid-Infrared All-Sky Survey data.Methods .	Context .	Little is known about the properties of the warm ( Tdust & gt ; ~ 150 K ) debris disk material located close to the central star , which has a more direct link to the formation of terrestrial planets than the low temperature debris dust that has been detected to date.Aims .	We have searched for point sources detected in the AKARI/IRC All-Sky Survey , which show a positional match with A-M dwarf stars in the Tycho-2 Spectral Type Catalogue and exhibit excess emission at 18 micron compared to that expected from the Ks magnitude in the 2MASS catalogue.Results .	We find 24 warm debris candidates including 8 new candidates among A-K stars .
2	The hull-detection algorithms investigated here included silhouette/space carving ( SC ) , modified silhouette/space carving ( MSC ) , and space modeling ( SM ) .	Proton computed tomography ( pCT ) is a novel imaging modality developed for patients receiving proton radiation therapy .	The purpose of this work was to investigate hull-detection algorithms used for preconditioning of the large and sparse linear system of equations that needs to be solved for pCT image reconstruction .	Each was compared to the cone-beam version of filtered backprojection ( FBP ) used for hull-detection .	Data for testing these algorithms included simulated data sets of a digital head phantom and an experimental data set of a pediatric head phantom obtained with a pCT scanner prototype at Loma Linda University Medical Center .
4	Our results give a dynamical scaling exponent $ z=1.55\pm0.15 $ , which is consistent with model E-dynamics .	We study dynamic fluctuation effects of $ YBa_2Cu_3O_ { 7-\delta } $ thin films in zero field around $ T_c $ by doing frequency-dependent microwave conductivity measurements at different powers .	The length scales probed in the experiments are varied systematically allowing us to analyze data which are not affected by the finite thickness of the films , and to observe single-parameter scaling .	DC current-voltage characteristics have also been measured to independently probe fluctuations in the same samples .	The combination of DC and microwave measurements allows us to precisely determine critical parameters .
4	For constant diffusivity the proposed scheme gives similar results as the Cauchy-Euler scheme .	We present a more accurate numerical scheme for the calculation of diffusive shock acceleration of cosmic rays using Stochastic Differential Equations .	The accuracy of this scheme is demonstrated using a simple analytical flow profile that contains a shock of finite width and a varying diffusivity of the cosmic rays , where the diffusivity decreases across the shock .	We compare the results for the slope of the momentum distribution with those obtained from a perturbation analysis valid for finite but small shock width .	These calculations show that this scheme , although computationally more expensive , provides a significantly better performance than the Cauchy-Euler type schemes that were proposed earlier in the case where steep gradients in the cosmic ray diffusivity occur .
4	While diamonds without surface adsorbates remain a viable candidate for explaining the far-UV break observed in quasars , hydrogenated nanodiamonds appear to be ruled out , as they would giverise to IR emission bands , which have not been observed so far .	We calculate the dust emission expected at 3.43 and 3.53 microns if meteoritic ( i.e.hydrogenated ) nanodiamonds are responsible for most of the far-UV break observed in quasars .	We integrate the UV flux that hydrogenated nanodiamonds must absorb to reproduce the far-UV break .	Based on laboratory spectra of H-terminated diamond surfaces , we analyse the radiative energy budget and derive theoretically the IR emission profiles expected for possible C-H surface stretch modes of the diamonds .	Using as test case a spectrum of 3C298 provided by the Spitzer Observatory , we do not find evidence of these emission bands .
2	We take into account the effects of that term also in the singular magnetic and electric fields inside the interface which lead to the existence of currents and charges densities through the interface , from the derivation of the Maxwell equations inside both bulks and the interface .	We consider the case of a deformable material interface between two immiscible moving media , both of them being magnetiable .	The time dependence of the metric at the interface introduces a non linear term , proportional to the mean curvature , in the surface dynamical equations of mass momentum and angular momentum .	Also , we give the expression for the entropy production and of the different thermo-dynamical fluxes .	Our results enlarge previous results from other theories where the specific role of the time dependent surface metric was insufficiently stressed .
1	We selectively throw out the small-scale information in the convergence power spectrum that is most sensitive to the unwanted bias , while trying to retain most of the sensitivity to cosmological parameters .	We explore several strategies of eliminating ( or nulling ) the small-scale information in weak lensing convergence power spectrum measurements in order to protect against undesirable effects , for example the effects of baryonic cooling and pressure forces on the distribution of large-scale structures .	The strategies are effective in the difficult but realistic situations when we are able to guess the form of the contaminating effect only approximately .	However , we also find that the simplest scheme of simply not using information from the largest multipoles works about as well as the proposed techniques in most , although not all , realistic cases .	We advocate further exploration of nulling techniques and believe that they will find important applications in the weak lensing data mining .
3	We estimate the likely statistical errors if the standard ruler method were to be applied to such surveys .	Current surveys may be on the verge of measuring the baryonic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum which are clearly seen imprinted on the Cosmic Microwave Background .	It has recently been proposed that these oscillations allow a `standard ruler ' method of probing the equation of state of dark energy .	In this paper we present a new calculation of the number of galaxies future adio telescopes will detect in surveys of the sky in neutral Hydrogen ( HI ) .	We emphasise uncertainties in our calculations , and pinpoint the most important features of future HI surveys if they are to provide new constraints on dark energy via baryonic oscillations .
2	The source of the rising in the global sea level is not closed in global warming and icebergs , but the outer space is the additional important source for this rising .	The perturbation of the Earth caused by variability of mass of Earth as additional reason with gravity of celestial bodies and shape of the Earth .	The Earth eating and collecting matters from space and loss or eject matters to space through its flying in the space around the Sun .	The Earth eats waters from space in unknown mechanism .	The mass of the Earth become greater in November i.e.before transit apoapsis two months , and become latter in February i.e.after transit apoapsis to two months .
2	In this paper we discuss the potential of extracting $ \phi_s $ from the decay modes $ B_s\to J/\psi \eta^ { ( \prime ) } $ and $ B_s\to J/\psi f_0 ( 980 ) $ and how their respective hadronic uncertainties can be controlled .	Measurements of the $ B_s^0 $ -- $ \bar { B } _s^0 $ mixing phase $ \phi_s $ appear to be converging towards the SM prediction , suggesting that contributions from New Physics ( NP ) , if present , are small .	This poses the question of whether smallish NP in $ \phi_s $ can be distinguished from the hadronic uncertainties present in the interfering $ B_s $ decay mode .	In addition , we demonstrate how the branching ratios of the former decays can be used to estimate the $ \eta $ -- $ \eta ' $ mixing angles .	Finally , we point out that effective lifetime measurements of decay modes such as the $ B_s\to J/\psi f_0 ( 980 ) $ can be used to constrain both $ \phi_s $ and the $ B_s $ decay width difference $ \Delta\Gamma_s $ , complementary to the usual time-dependent tagged analysis .
1	The main point under consideration is the nature of the hypothesis set when no prior information is available but data .	This paper reviews the functional aspects of statistical learning theory .	Within this framework we first discuss about the hypothesis set : it is a vectorial space , it is a set of pointwise defined functions , and the evaluation functional on this set is a continuous mapping .	Based on these principles an original theory is developed generalizing the notion of reproduction kernel Hilbert space to non hilbertian sets .	Then it is shown that the hypothesis set of any learning machine has to be a generalized reproducing set .
2	This leads to a plus in performance by increasing the outcomes precision , reducing the processing time , increasing the quality of the finite product , etc .	The unconventional technologies , currently applied at a certain category of materials , difficult to be processed through usual techniques , have undergone during the last 60 years all the stages , since their discovery to their use on a large scale .	They are based on elementary mechanisms which run the processing through classic methods , yet , they use in addition the interconnections of these methods .	This performance can be much increased by using the computer and a software product in assisting the human operator in the processing by an unconventional method such as ; the electric or electro-chemical erosion , the complex electric-electro-chemical erosion , the processing by a laser fascicle and so on .	The present work presents such an application based on a data base combining the previous experimental results , which proposes a method of optimization of the outcomes .

The branching fraction for the decay $ D^+_s\to\tau^ { + } \nu_ { \tau } $ , with $ \tau^ { + } \to e^ { + } \nu_ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { \tau } $ , is measured using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 427 fb^ { -1 } collected at center of mass energies near 10.58 GeV with the \slshape B\kern-0.1em { \smaller A } \kern-0.1em B\kern-0.1em { \smaller A\kern-0.2em R } detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy $ e^ { + } e^ { - } $ collider at SLAC .	Here $ _ { \mathrm { TAG } } $ refers to a fully reconstructed hadronic $ \kern 0.2em\bar { \kern -0.2em D } { } $ decay , $ \kern 0.2em\bar { \kern -0.2em K } { } $ is a $ K^- $ or $ \kern 0.2em\bar { \kern -0.2em K } { } ^0 $ , and $ X $ stands for any number of charged or neutral pions .	The decay $ D^+_s\to K^0_ { \scriptscriptstyle S } K^ { + } $ is isolated also , and from ratio of event yields and known branching fractions , $ { \cal B } ( D^+_s\to\tau^ { + } \nu_ { \tau } ) $ = ( 4.5\pm0.5\pm0.4\pm0.3 % is determined .	The pseudoscalar decay constant is extracted to be $ f_ { D_s } $ = ( 233\pm13\pm10\pm7 ) MeV , where the first uncertainty is statistical , the second is systematic , and the third results from the uncertainties on the external measurements used as input to the calculation .
0	We investigate the spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient and the tunneling magneto thermopower of CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions ( MTJ ) in the presence of thermal gradients across the MTJ .	Thermal gradients are generated by an electric heater on top of the nanopillars .	The thermo power voltage across the MTJ is found to scale linearly with the heating power and reveals similar field dependence as the tunnel magnetoresistance .	The amplitude of the thermal gradient is derived from calibration measurements in combination with finite element simulations of the heat flux .	Based on this , large spin-dependent Seebeck coefficients of the order of ( 240 \pm 110 ) \muV/K are derived .
3	Moreover , the calculated results of the Raman intensity sensitively depend on the Fermi energy for both the first- and the second-order Raman spectra .	Intensity of the first- and the second-order Raman spectra are calculated as a function of the Fermi energy .	We show that the Kohn anomaly effect , i.e. , phonon frequency renormalization , in the first-order Raman spectra originates from the phonon renormalization by the interband electron-hole excitation , whereas in the second-order Raman spectra , a competition between the interband and intraband electron-hole excitations takes place .	By this calculation , we confirm the presence of different dispersive behaviors of the Raman peak frequency as a function of the Fermi energy for the first- and the second-order Raman spectra , as observed in experiments .	These results thus also show the importance of quantum interference effect phenomena .
3	To quantify this distortion , we construct sky maps of the arrival directions of these highest energy cosmic rays for various magnetic field configurations and appeal to statistical tests proposed in the literature .	Detecting and characterizing the anisotropy pattern of the arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays are crucial steps towards the identification of their sources .	We discuss a possible distortion of the cosmic ray flux induced by the anisotropic and inhomogeneous distribution of extragalactic magnetic fields in cases where sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are rare transient phenomena , such as gamma-ray bursts and/or newly born magnetars .	This distortion does not involve an angular deflection but the modulation of the flux related to the probability of seeing the source on an experiment lifetime .	We conclude that this distortion can not affect present experiments but should be considered when performing anisotropy studies with future large-scale experiments that record as many as hundreds of events above 6x10^19 eV .
3	The full isochoric heat capacity and the leading low-T term of the isobaric expansivity in D=2 are independent of g. The onset of Bose-Einstein condensation along the isobar occurs at a nonzero transition temperature in all dimensions .	We present exact and explicit results for the thermodynamic properties ( isochores , isotherms , isobars , response functions , velocity of sound ) of a quantum gas in dimensions D & gt ; =1 and with fractional exclusion statistics 0 & lt ; =g & lt ; =1 connecting bosons ( g=0 ) and fermions ( g=1 ) .	In D=1 the results are equivalent to those of the Calogero-Sutherland model .	Emphasis is given to the crossover between boson-like and fermion-like features , caused by aspects of the statistical interaction that mimic long-range attraction and short-range repulsion .	The T-dependence of the velocity of sound is in simple relation to isochores and isobars .
2	The $ XXZ $ and the single-ion anisotropy models exhibit a quantum phase transition between the $ { \bf q } \ ! =\ ! 0 $ and the $ \sqrt { 3 } \times\ ! \sqrt { 3 } $ states as a function of the anisotropy parameter , offering a rare example of the quantum order-by-disorder fluctuations favoring a ground state which is different from the one selected by thermal fluctuations .	We systematically investigate the ground-state and the spectral properties of antiferromagnets on a kagom\ ' { e } lattice with several common types of the planar anisotropy : $ XXZ $ , single-ion , and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya .	Our main focus is on the role of nonlinear , anharmonic terms , which are responsible for the quantum order-by-disorder effect and for the corresponding selection of the ground-state spin structure in many of these models .	The nonlinear terms are also shown to be crucial for a very strong near-resonant decay phenomenon leading to the quasiparticle breakdown in the kagom\ ' { e } -lattice antiferromagnets whose spectra are featuring flat or weakly dispersive modes .	The effect is shown to persist even in the limit of large spin values and should be common to other frustrated magnets with flat branches of excitations .
1	The theories can thus be ghost free .	We construct a class of Einstein-vector theories where the vector field couples bilinearly to the curvature polynomials of arbitrary order in such a way that only Riemann tensor rather than its derivative enters the equations of motion .	The U ( 1 ) gauge symmetry may emerge in the vacuum and also in some weak-field limit .	We focus on the two-derivative theory and study a variety of applications .	We find that in this theory , the energy-momentum tensor of dark matter provides a position-dependent gauge-violating term to the Maxwell field .
3	Further Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) protocol has been implemented to provide security and data integrity for communications over networks .	Security of any software can be enhanced manifolds if multiple factors for authorization and authentication are used .The main aim of this work was to design and implement an Academy Automation Software for IPS Academy which uses OpenID and Windows CardSpace as Authentication Techniques in addition to Role Based Authentication ( RBA ) System to ensure that only authentic users can access the predefined roles as per their Authorization level .	The Automation covers different computing hardware and software that can be used to digitally create , manipulate , collect , store , and relay Academy information needed for accomplishing basic Operation like admissions and registration , student and faculty interaction , online library , medical and business development .	Raw data storage , electronic transfer , and the management of electronic business information comprise the basic activities of the Academy automation system .	TLS encrypts the segments of network connections at the Transport
1	Due to cancellation , the weak limit is in general supported in a strict subset of the Hausdorff limit .	In this article , we study the relationship between the weak limit of a sequence of integral currents in a metric space and the possible Hausdorff limit of the sequence of supports .	We exhibit sufficient conditions in terms of topology of the supports which ensure that no cancellation occurs and that the support of the weak limit agrees with the Hausdorff limit of the supports .	We use our results to prove countable $ \hm^m $ -rectifiability of the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of sequences of Lipschitz manifolds $ M_n $ all of which are $ \lambda $ -linearly locally contractible up to some scale $ r_0 $ .	In an appendix , written by Raanan Schul and the second author , it is shown that the Gromov-Hausdorff limit need not be countably $ \hm^m $ -rectifiable if the $ M_n $ have a common local geometric contractibility function which is only concave ( and not linear ) .
2	We present a full three dimensional parameter space of solutions , which generically break supersymmetry .	We find and thoroughly study new supergravity domain wall solutions which are holographic realizations of supersymmetry breaking strongly coupled gauge theories .	We set ourselves in an N=2 gauged supergravity with a minimal content in order to reproduce a dual N=1 effective SCFT which has a U ( 1 ) _R symmetry , a chiral operator whose components are responsible for triggering the RG flow , and an additional U ( 1 ) _F symmetry .	Some known solutions are recovered for specific sets of values of the parameters , with the new solutions interpolating between them .	The generic backgrounds being singular , we provide a stability test of their dual theories by showing that there are no tachyonic resonances in the two point correlators .
4	Further , the performance model applications are illustrated by numerical examples .	A workload analysis technique is presented that processes data from operation type traces and creates a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) to represent the workload that generated those traces .	The HMM can be used to create representative traces for performance models , such as simulators , avoiding the need to repeatedly acquire suitable traces .	It can also be used to estimate directly the transition probabilities and rates of a Markov modulated arrival process , for use as input to an analytical performance model of Flash memory .	The HMMs obtained from industrial workloads are validated by comparing their autocorrelation functions and other statistics with those of the corresponding monitored time series .
3	This extended gauge symmetry eliminates the scalar graviton , and forces the coupling constant $ \lambda $ in the kinetic term of the minimal formulation to take its relativistic value , $ \lambda=1 $ .	In the minimal formulation of gravity with Lifshitz-type anisotropic scaling , the gauge symmetries of the system are foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms of spacetime .	Consequently , compared to general relativity , the spectrum contains an extra scalar graviton polarization .	Here we investigate the possibility of extending the gauge group by a local U ( 1 ) symmetry to `` nonrelativistic general covariance . ''	The resulting theory exhibits anisotropic scaling at short distances , and reproduces many features of general relativity at long distances .
0	We examine a recently proposed symmetry/condition by Friedberg and Lee in the framework where three right-handed neutrinos are added to the spectrum of the three-family Minimal Standard Model .	It is found that the right-handed neutrinos are very special , with respect to this symmetry .	In the symmetry limit the neutrinos are massless and that may be a hint about why they are light .	Imposed as a condition and not as a full symmetry , we find that one of the three right-handed neutrinos simply decouples ( has only gravitational interactions ) and that there is a massless interacting neutrino .	The possible relation of the model to the see-saw mechanism is briefly discussed .
0	The assumption of local equilibrium in relativistic heavy ion collisions at energies from 10.7 AGeV ( AGS ) up to 160 AGeV ( SPS ) is checked in the microscopic transport model .	Dynamical calculations performed for a central cell in the reaction are compared to the predictions of the thermal statistical model .	We find that kinetic , thermal and chemical equilibration of the expanding hadronic matter are nearly approached late in central collisions at AGS energy for $ t \geq 10 $ fm/ $ c $ in a central cell .	At these times the equation of state may be approximated by a simple dependence $ P \cong ( 0.12-0.15 ) \epsilon $ .	Increasing deviations of the yields and the energy spectra of hadrons from statistical model values are observed for increasing energy , 40 AGeV and 160 AGeV .
4	We relate certain suitable arrays with parameter $ t $ to others with parameter $ t+1 $ , thereby showing that one of the two infinite families recently presented by Colbourn can be constructed directly from the other .	A set of permutations of $ \ { 1,2 , \dots , v\ } $ is $ ( N , v , t ) $ -suitable if each symbol precedes each subset of $ t-1 $ others in at least one permutation .	The central problems are to determine the smallest $ N $ for which such a set exists for given $ v $ and $ t $ , and to determine the largest $ v $ for which such a set exists for given $ N $ and $ t $ .	These extremal problems were the subject of classical studies by Dushnik in 1950 and Spencer in 1971 .	We give examples of suitable sets of permutations for new parameter triples $ ( N , v , t ) $ .
3	We develop several techniques for determining whether a cluster algebra is locally acyclic .	This paper studies cluster algebras locally , by identifying a special class of localizations which are themselves cluster algebras .	A `locally acyclic cluster algebra ' is a cluster algebra which admits a finite cover ( in a geometric sense ) by acyclic cluster algebras .	Many important results about acyclic cluster algebras extend to local acyclic cluster algebras ( such as finite generation , integrally closure , and equaling their upper cluster algebra ) , as well as results which are new even for acyclic cluster algebras ( such as regularity when the exchange matrix has full rank ) .	We show that cluster algebras of marked surfaces with at least two boundary marked points are locally acyclic , providing a large class of examples of cluster algebras which are locally acyclic but not acyclic .
2	The proposed approaches obtain sparse codes for each pixel in brain magnetic resonance images considering their intensity values and location information .	In this paper , we propose sparse coding-based approaches for segmentation of tumor regions from MR images .	Sparse coding with data-adapted dictionaries has been successfully employed in several image recovery and vision problems .	Since it is trivial to obtain pixel-wise sparse codes , and combining multiple features in the sparse coding setup is not straightforward , we propose to perform sparse coding in a high-dimensional feature space where non-linear similarities can be effectively modeled .	We use the training data from expert-segmented images to obtain kernel dictionaries with the kernel K-lines clustering procedure .
3	T1 corresponds to the opening of the f-d hybridization gap revealed by an abrupt disappearance of terahertz f-band plasmon oscillations .	SmB6 is a promising candidate for topological Kondo insulator .	In this letter , we report ultrafast carrier dynamics of SmB6 .	Two characteristic temperatures : T1=100 K and T2= 20 K are observed .	Between T1 and T2 , a phonon bottleneck effect dominates the photocarrier relaxation processes .
0	The application of methods of computational algebra has recently introduced new tools for the study of Hilbert schemes .	The key idea is to define flat families of ideals endowed with a scheme structure whose defining equations can be determined by algorithmic procedures .	For this reason , several authors developed new methods , based on the combinatorial properties of Borel-fixed ideals , that allow to associate to each ideal $ J $ of this type a scheme $ \mathbf { Mf } _ { J } $ , called $ J $ -marked scheme .	In this paper we provide a solid functorial foundation to marked schemes and show that the algorithmic procedures introduced in previous papers do not depend on the ring of coefficients .	We prove that for all strongly stable ideals $ J $ , the marked schemes $ \mathbf { Mf } _ { J } $ can be embedded in a Hilbert scheme as locally closed subschemes , and that they are open under suitable conditions on $ J $ .
4	Multiple reflections at the edges of the 2DEG indicate a high degree of specularity .	We report measurements of GaAs/AlGaAs undoped field-effect transistors in which two-dimensional electron gases ( 2DEGs ) of exceptional quality and versatility are induced without modulation doping .	Electron mobilities at T=4.2 K and density 3 E11 /cm^2 exceed 4 E6 cm^2/Vs .	At lower temperatures , there is an unusually large drop in scattering , such that the mobility becomes too high to measure in 100 micron samples .	Below T=2.5 K , clear signatures of ballistic travel over path lengths in excess of 160 microns are observed in magnetic focusing experiments .
4	We investigate the 'quantum clock ' and show that the evolution described by it is identical to the classical motion when the energy becomes large .	In order to study the `` problem of time '' , Rovelli proposed a model of a two harmonic oscillator system where one of the oscillators can be thought of as a 'clock ' for the other oscillator .	In this paper we examine a model where the Hamiltonian is a difference between two harmonic oscillators , and we consider one of them which has the minus sign as a 'clock ' .	Klauder 's projection operator approach to generalized coherent states is used to define physical states and operators .	The resolution of unity is derived in terms of a gauge invariant coordinate .
2	In order to reduce the face matching errors , the Dempster-Shafer decision theory is applied to fuse the individual matching scores obtained from each pair of salient facial features .	This paper presents a robust and dynamic face recognition technique based on the extraction and matching of devised probabilistic graphs drawn on SIFT features related to independent face areas .	The face matching strategy is based on matching individual salient facial graph characterized by SIFT features as connected to facial landmarks such as the eyes and the mouth .	The proposed algorithm is evaluated with the ORL and the IITK face databases .	The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed face recognition technique also in case of partially occluded faces .
1	We formulate the field equations , slow-roll and perturbation parameters ( scalar and tensor power spectra as well as their spectral indices ) under slow-roll approximation .	This paper is devoted to study the warm inflation using vector fields in the background of locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I universe model .	We evaluate all these parameters in terms of directional Hubble parameter during intermediate and logamediate inflationary regimes by taking the dissipation factor as a function of scalar field as well as a constant .	In each case , we calculate the observational parameter of interest , i.e. , tensor-scalar ratio in terms of inflation .	The graphical behavior of these parameters shows that the anisotropic model is also compatible with WMAP7 and Planck observational data .
4	The existence of this map implies the existence of many 192-periodic families of elements in the stable homotopy groups of spheres .	Let M ( 1 ) be the mod 2 Moore spectrum.J.F .	Adams proved that M ( 1 ) admits a minimal v_1-self map v_1^4 : Sigma^8 M ( 1 ) - & gt ; M ( 1 ) .	Let M ( 1,4 ) be the cofiber of this self-map .	The purpose of this paper is to prove that M ( 1,4 ) admits a minimal v_2-self map of the form v_2^32 : Sigma^192 M ( 1,4 ) - & gt ; M ( 1,4 ) .
2	The $ ^ { 11 } $ Li nucleus is described as a three-body system , a core plus two neutrons , with a phenomenological neutron-core potential and a density dependent neutron-neutron interaction of zero range .	In this paper we calculate reaction and breakup cross sections for the two- neutron halo nucleus of $ ^ { 11 } $ Li using the optical limit of Glauber theory .	Calculations are presented and compared to experimental data at 0.8 and 0.28 GeV/u on a series of targets .	Three different wave functions are constructed which have different $ ( 2s_ { 1/2 } ) ^2 $ and $ ( 1p_ { 1/2 } ) ^2 $ two-neutron components but correspond to the same binding energy close to the experimental value .	We show that the agreement with all the experimental observables is achieved only if the 11Li wave function contains about 30 % of $ ( 2s_ { 1/2 } ) ^2 $ configuration .
1	The I-V characteristics of such superconductors displays many interesting phenomena .	In the superclean case the spectrum of vortex core excitations in the presence of disorder is not random but consists of two series of equally-spaced levels .	A series of resonances is predicted at frequencies commensurate with the spacing of the vortex excitations .	These resonances reveal an even-odd anomaly .	In the presence of one weak impurity the excitation levels can approach each other and almost cross .
0	The effect of introducing a spatial heterogeneity into an explosive medium is studied computationally by examining the detonation velocity near the limit to propagation in a thin explosive layer .	The explosive system studied is an ideal gas with a single exothermic reaction governed by a pressure-dependent reaction rate ( $ p^n $ ) with a pressure exponent of $ n = 3 $ .	A pressure-dependent reaction rate , rather than the exponential dependence of reaction on temperature of Arrhenius kinetics , is used so that the detonation wave is stable in the homogeneous case and can be modelled with simple , analytical techniques , and thus the effect of introducing heterogeneity can be clearly identified .	The two-dimensional slab of explosive is bounded by a layer of inert gas with the same thermodynamic properties as the explosive .	The heterogeneity is introduced into the explosive via a large-amplitude , two-dimensional sinusoidal ripple in density in the initialization of the simulation , while maintaining a constant pressure .
0	A network of noisy bistable elements with global time-delayed couplings is considered .	A dichotomous mean field model has recently been developed describing the collective dynamics in such systems with uniform time delays near the bifurcation points .	Here the theory is extended and applied to systems with nonuniform time delays .	For strong enough couplings the systems exhibit delay-independent stationary states and delay-dependent oscillatory states .	We find that the regions of oscillatory states in the parameter space are reduced with increasing width of the time delay distribution function ; that is , nonuniformity of the time delays increases the stability of the trivial equilibrium .
2	The thermal radio emission is due to free-free interactions in the ionized stellar wind material .	Detectable radio emission occurs during almost all phases of massive star evolution .	I will concentrate on the thermal and non-thermal continuum emission from early-type stars .	Early ideas that this would lead to an easy and straightforward way of measuring the mass-loss rates were thwarted by the presence of clumping in the stellar wind .	Multi-wavelength observations provide important constraints on this clumping , but do not allow its full determination .
4	Starting from an overview that puts it into its physical context among the other Poincar\'e invariants of the electromagnetic field , we describe the multi-mode quantized character and other physical properties that sets electromagnetic angular momentum apart from the electromagnetic linear momentum .	Wireless communications , radio astronomy and other radio science applications are predominantly implemented with techniques built on top of the electromagnetic linear momentum ( Poynting vector ) physical layer .	As a supplement and/or alternative to this conventional approach , techniques rooted in the electromagnetic angular momentum physical layer have been advocated , and promising results from proof-of-concept radio communication experiments using angular momentum were recently published .	This sparingly exploited physical observable describes the rotational ( spinning and orbiting ) physical properties of the electromagnetic fields and the rotational dynamics of the pertinent charge and current densities .	In order to facilitate the exploitation of angular momentum techniques in real-world implementations , we present a systematic , comprehensive theoretical review of the fundamental physical properties of electromagnetic angular momentum observable .
1	The diversity of explosion mechanisms usually found in one-dimensional simulations is a direct consequence of the impossibility to resolve the flame structure under the assumption of spherical symmetry .	In this paper , we review the present state of theoretical models of thermonuclear supernovae , and compare their predicitions with the constraints derived from observations of Type Ia supernovae .	Spherically symmetric models have been successful in explaining many of the observational features of Type Ia supernovae , but they rely on two kinds of empirical models : one that describes the behaviour of the flame on the scales unresolved by the code , and another that takes account of the evolution of the flame shape .	In contrast , three-dimensional simulations are able to compute the flame shape in a self-consistent way , but they still need a model for the propagation of the flame in the scales unresolved by the code .	Furthermore , in three dimensions the number of degrees of freedom of the initial configuration of the white dwarf at runaway is much larger than in one dimension .
4	We construct the scattering matrix of the bound states of the BDS and the AFS S-matrices .	It has been shown that , in the infinite length limit , the magnons of the gauge theory spin chain can form bound states carrying one finite and one strictly infinite R-charge .	These bound states have been argued to be associated to simple poles of the multi-particle scattering matrix and to world sheet solitons carrying the same charges .	Classically , they can be mapped to the solitons of the complex sine-Gordon theory .	Under relatively general assumptions we derive the condition that simple poles of the two-particle scattering matrix correspond to physical bound states and construct higher bound states `` one magnon at a time '' .
0	Cubic to tetragonal distortion in spinel compounds have been a contentious issue for last two decades .	Different groups have proposed different mechanisms to understand such a distortion in these spinels , which are : ( i ) spin lattice coupling mechanism known as the spin driven Jahn-Teller ( JT ) effect , ( ii ) the strong relativistic spin-orbit coupling , a moderate JT distortion and weak V-V interactions and ( iii ) the JT effect .	Now , in order to know the possible cause for such a distortion , we have avoided these complexities ( various interactions among spin , electronic , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom ) by carrying out spin unpolarized calculations .	The calculated values of bulk moduli for ZnV $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ ( ZnCr $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ ) , MgV $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ ( MgCr $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ ) and CdV $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ ( CdCr $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ ) are found to be $ \sim $ 289 ( $ \sim $ 254 ) , $ \sim $ 244 ( $ \sim $ 243 ) and $ \sim $ 230 ( $ \sim $ 233 ) GPa , respectively .	For vanadates and chromates , the order of calculated values of lattice parameter $ a $ are found to CdV $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ $ & gt ; $ MgV $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ $ & gt ; $ ZnV $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ and CdCr $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ $ & gt ; $ MgCr $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ $ & gt ; $ ZnCr $ _ { 2 } $ O $ _ { 4 } $ , respectively and are consistent with the experimental results .
3	By the Jahn-Teller effect , there occurs serious molecular deformation .	Void induced di-cation coronene C23H12++ is a possible carrier of the astronomically observed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) .	Based on density functional theory , multiple spin state analysis was done for neutral void coronene C23H12 .	Singlet spin state was most stable ( lowest total energy ) .	Point group D6h of pure coronene transformed to C2 symmetry having carbon two pentagons .
2	Vector modes are associated with divergenceless ( vortical ) velocity fields .	Recent observations have pointed out various anomalies in some multipoles ( small $ \ell $ ) of the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) .	In this paper , it is proved that some of these anomalies could be explained in the framework of a modified concordance model , in which , there is an appropriate distribution of vector perturbations with very large spatial scales .	Here , the generation of these modes is not studied in detail ( it can be done `` a posteriori '' ) ; on the contrary , we directly look for the distributions of these vector modes which lead to both alignments of the second and third multipoles and a planar octopole .	A general three-dimensional ( 3D ) superimposition of vector perturbations does not produce any alignment , but we have found rather general 2D superimpositions leading to anomalies similar to the observed ones ; in these 2D cases , the angular velocity has the same direction at any point of an extended region and , moreover , this velocity has the same distribution in all the planes orthogonal to it .
1	Assuming the stars are only slightly relativistic , we derive an approximation to the Kerr metric , which turns out to be a weak field Schwarzschild metric plus a frame dragging term .	We calculate the effects of frame dragging on the Galactic-Center stars .	By numerically integrating the resulting geodesic equations , we compute the effect on keplerian elements and the kinematics .	We find that the kinematic effect at pericenter passage is proportional to ( a ( 1-e^2 ) ) ^ { -2 } .	For known Galactic-center stars it is of order 10 m/s .
0	While information exists on high energy negative particle channeling there has been little study of the challenges of negative particle bending and channeling collimation .	Partly this is because negative dechanneling lengths are relatively much shorter .	Electrons are not particularly useful for investigating negative particle channeling effects because their material interactions are dominated by channeling radiation .	Another important factor is that the current central challenge in channeling collimation is the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) where both beams are positive .	On the other hand in the future the collimation question might reemerge for electron-positron or muon colliders .
2	In formula ( 5.9 ) of the 1993 paper a two-parameter class of Askey-Wilson polynomials was expanded as a finite Fourier series with a product of two 3phi2 's as Fourier coefficients .	This paper provides the details of Remark 5.4 in the author 's paper `` Askey-Wilson polynomials as zonal spherical functions on the SU ( 2 ) quantum group '' , SIAM J.Math.Anal .	24 ( 1993 ) , 795-813 .	The proof given there used the quantum group interpretation .	Here this identity will be generalized to a 3-parameter class of Askey-Wilson polynomials being expanded in terms of continuous q-ultraspherical polynomials with a product of two 2phi2 's as coefficients , and an analytic proof will be given for it .
4	As a result , the maximum energy of accelerated particles strongly depends on the age of supernova remnant .	The instability in the cosmic-ray precursor of a supernova shock moving in interstellar medium is studied .	The level of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in this region determines the maximum energy of particles accelerated by the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism .	The high efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration is accepted , and the consideration is not limited by the case of weak turbulence .	It is assumed that Kolmogorov type nonlinear wave interactions together with the ion-neutral collisions restrict the amplitude of random magnetic field .
2	In this paper we take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an accurate and computationally efficient edge detector .	Edge detection is a critical component of many vision systems , including object detectors and image segmentation algorithms .	Patches of edges exhibit well-known forms of local structure , such as straight lines or T-junctions .	We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests .	Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated .
2	Then a self-organized superfluid containing high-density vortices and phase slips grows upward into an ordinary superfluid .	We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of He4 slightly below the superffluid transition by integrating model F equations in three dimensions .	When heated from above under gravity , a vortex tangle and a sheetlike phase slip are generated near the bottom plate .	The thermal resistance due to these defects produces a constant temperature gradient equal to the gradient of the pressure-dependent transition temperature $ T_ { \lambda } ( p ) $ .	In this self-organized region , the temperature deviation $ T-T_ { \lambda } ( p ) $ consists of a negative constant independent of the height and time-dependent fluctuations .
1	We calculate the higher order correlation functions from the 2 -- particle correlation function by assuming that the source is emitting particles incoherently .	Many -- particle correlations due to Bose-Einstein interference are studied in ultrarelativistic heavy -- ion collisions .	In particular parametrizations of and relations between longitudinal , sidewards , outwards and invariant radii and corresponding momenta are discussed .	The results are especially useful in low statistics measurements of higher order correlation functions .	We evaluate the three -- pion correlation function recently measured by NA44 and predict the 2 -- pion -- 2 -- kaon correlation function .
3	Our objective is to test some of the main trends already identified in the DENT grid , as well as to define better empirical diagnostics to estimate the total gas mass of protoplanetary discs .	The Herschel GASPS Key Program is a survey of the gas phase of protoplanetary discs , targeting 240 objects which cover a large range of ages , spectral types , and disc properties .	To interpret this large quantity of data and initiate self-consistent analyses of the gas and dust properties of protoplanetary discs , we have combined the capabilities of the radiative transfer code MCFOST with the gas thermal balance and chemistry code ProDiMo to compute a grid of 300 000 disc models ( DENT ) .	We present a comparison of the first Herschel/GASPS line and continuum data with the predictions from the DENT grid of models .	Photospheric UV radiation appears to be the dominant gas-heating mechanism for Herbig stars , whereas UV excess and/or X-rays emission dominates for T Tauri stars .
4	Initially , in the mid 90 's there were a couple of results recognizing this connection .	Text indexing , the problem in which one desires to preprocess a ( usually large ) text for future ( shorter ) queries , has been researched ever since the su ? ffix tree was invented in the early 70 's .	With textual data continuing to increase and with changes in the way it is accessed , new data structures and new algorithmic methods are continuously required .	Therefore , text indexing is of utmost importance and is a very active research domain .	Orthogonal range searching , classically associated with the computational geometry community , is one of the tools that has increasingly become important for various text indexing applications .
0	Given a graph $ G $ and a subgraph $ H $ of $ G $ , let $ rb ( G , H ) $ be the minimum number $ r $ for which any edge-coloring of $ G $ with $ r $ colors has a rainbow subgraph $ H $ .	The number $ rb ( G , H ) $ is called the rainbow number of $ H $ with respect to $ G $ .	Denote $ mK_2 $ a matching of size $ m $ and $ B_ { n , k } $ a $ k $ -regular bipartite graph with bipartition $ ( X , Y ) $ such that $ |X|=|Y|=n $ and $ k\leq n $ .	In this paper we give an upper and lower bound for $ rb ( B_ { n , k } , mK_2 ) $ , and show that for given $ k $ and $ m $ , if $ n $ is large enough , $ rb ( B_ { n , k } , mK_2 ) $ can reach the lower bound .	We also determine the rainbow number of matchings in paths and cycles .
0	We study the possible existence of chiral partners in the spin- $ \thalf $ sector of the baryon spectrum .	We consider a quartet scheme where four spin-3/2 baryons , $ P_ { 33 } $ , $ D_ { 33 } $ , $ D_ { 13 } $ and $ P_ { 13 } $ , group into higher-dimensional chiral multiplets $ ( 1 , \half ) \oplus ( \half,1 ) $ with a mirror assignment .	With an effective $ SU ( 2 ) _R\times SU ( 2 ) _L $ Lagrangian , we derive constraints imposed by chiral symmetry together with the mirror assignment on the masses and coupling constants of the quartet .	Using the effective Lagrangian , we try to find a set of baryons suitable for the chiral quartet .	It turns out that two cases reasonably agree with the mass pattern of the quartet : ( $ \Delta ( 1600 ) $ , $ \Delta ( 1940 ) $ , $ N ( 1520 ) $ , $ N ( 1720 ) $ ) and ( $ \Delta ( 1920 ) $ , $ \Delta ( 1940 ) $ , $ N ( 2080 ) $ , $ N ( 1900 ) $ ) .
4	We show that ReCon is accurate , efficient , and identifies a wider range of PII than previous approaches .	It is well known that apps running on mobile devices extensively track and leak users ' personally identifiable information ( PII ) ; however , these users have little visibility into PII leaked through the network traffic generated by their devices , and have poor control over how , when and where that traffic is sent and handled by third parties .	In this paper , we present the design , implementation , and evaluation of ReCon : a cross-platform system that reveals PII leaks and gives users control over them without requiring any special privileges or custom OSes .	ReCon leverages machine learning to reveal potential PII leaks by inspecting network traffic , and provides a visualization tool to empower users with the ability to control these leaks via blocking or substitution of PII .	We evaluate ReCon 's effectiveness with measurements from controlled experiments using leaks from the 100 most popular iOS , Android , and Windows Phone apps , and via an IRB-approved user study with 31 participants .
2	The specific heat , resistivity and expansivity curves are deconvolved to yield approximations of the phonon density of states , the spectral electron-phonon scattering function and the phonon density of states weighted by the frequency-dependent Grueneisen parameter respectively .	The superconductor YB6 has the second highest critical temperature Tc among the boride family MBn .	We report measurements of the specific heat , resistivity , magnetic susceptibility and thermal expansion from 2 to 300 K , using a single crystal with Tc = 7.2 K. The superconducting gap is characteristic of medium-strong coupling .	Lattice vibrations extend to high frequencies & gt ; 100 meV , but a dominant Einstein-like mode at ~8 meV , associated with the vibrations of yttrium ions in oversized boron cages , appears to provide most of the superconducting coupling and gives rise to an unusual temperature behavior of several observable quantities .	A surface critical field Hc3 is also observed .
4	We also prove the boundary Harnack inequality for regional fractional Laplacian on Lipschitz domain .	We consider boundary Harnack inequalities for regional fractional Laplacian which are generators of censored stable-like processes on G taking \kappa ( x , y ) /|x-y|^ { n+\alpha } dxdy , x , y\in G as the jumping measure .	When G is a C^ { 1 , \beta-1 } open set , 1 & lt ; \alpha & lt ; \beta\leq 2 and \kappa\in C^ { 1 } ( \overline { G } \times \overline { G } ) bounded between two positive numbers , we prove a boundary Harnack inequality giving dist ( x , \partial G ) ^ { \alpha-1 } order decay for harmonic functions near the boundary .	For a C^ { 1 , \beta-1 } open set D\subset \overline { D } \subset G , 0 & lt ; \alpha\leq ( 1\vee\alpha ) & lt ; \beta\leq 2 , we prove a boundary Harnack inequality giving dist ( x , \partial D ) ^ { \alpha/2 } order decay for harmonic functions near the boundary .	These inequalities are generalizations of the known results for the homogeneous case on C^ { 1,1 } open sets .
4	We study the quantum behavior of the system under approximations , and obtain ( 1 ) a cosmological constant valued $ ( 2/\pi ) \rho_ { c0 } $ ( $ \rho_ { c0 } $ is the critical density measured at near current epoch ) which is very close to current observations ; ( 2 ) an Einstein-Hilbert term in the quantum effective action ; ( 3 ) the ratio of variance to mean-squared of spacetime interval tends to a universal constant $ 2/\pi $ in the infrared region .	This paper is a generalization of earlier papers [ Nucl.Phys .	B 884 , 344 ( 2014 ) ( arXiv:1312.2759 ) and JHEP 6 , 63 ( 2015 ) ( arXiv:1401.2488 ) ] .	We generalize the idea of quantum clock time to a quantum spacetime reference frame via a physical realization of a reference system by quantum rulers and clocks .	Omitting the internal degrees of freedom ( such as spins ) of the physical rulers and clocks , only considering their metric properties , the spacetime reference frame is described by a bosonic non-linear sigma model .
2	Hence , static analysis of quantum entanglement in quantum programs is necessary .	Quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum computation and communication .	It is necessary for many protocols and computations , but causes unexpected disturbance of computational states .	Several papers studied the problem .	They decided qubits were entangled if multiple qubits unitary gates are applied to them , and some refined this reasoning using information about the state of each separated qubit .
0	Let $ D $ be an integral domain and $ \star $ a semistar operation on $ D $ .	As a generalization of the notion of Noetherian domains to the semistar setting , we say that $ D $ is a $ \star $ -- Noetherian domain if it has the ascending chain condition on the set of its quasi -- $ \star $ -- ideals .	On the other hand , as an extension the notion of Pr\ '' ufer domain ( and of Pr\ '' { u } fer $ v $ -- multiplication domain ) , we say that $ D $ is a Pr\ '' ufer $ \star $ -- multiplication domain ( P $ \star $ MD , for short ) if $ D_M $ is a valuation domain , for each quasi -- $ \star_ { _ { f } } $ -- maximal ideal $ M $ of $ D $ .	Finally , recalling that a Dedekind domain is a Noetherian Pr\ '' { u } fer domain , we define a $ \star $ -- Dedekind domain to be an integral domain which is $ \star $ -- Noetherian and a P $ \star $ MD .	In the present paper , after a preliminary study of $ \star $ -- Noetherian domains , we investigate the $ \star $ -- Dedekind domains .
1	This is true for Gorenstein nonhyperelliptic curves as well .	Max Noether 's Theorem asserts that if $ \ww $ is the dualizing sheaf of a nonsingular nonhyperelliptic projective curve then the natural morphisms $ \text { Sym } ^nH^0 ( \omega ) \to H^0 ( \omega^n ) $ are surjective for all $ n\geq 1 $ .	We prove this remains true for nearly Gorenstein curves and for all integral nonhyperelliptic curves whose non-Gorenstein points are unibranch .	The results are independent and have different proofs .	The first one is extrinsic , the second intrinsic .
4	Also the observed X-ray luminosity is comparable to the X-ray luminosities we obtain from the simulations for a supernova with an initial energy in the ( 1-5 ) E50 erg range .	Numerical simulations of the interaction between supernova ejecta and a stellar wind are presented .	We follow the temporal evolution of the shock fronts that are formed through such an interaction and determine the velocities , temperatures and densities .	We model the X-ray emission from the SNR-stellar wind collision region and we compare it with recent results from X-ray observations carried out with the Chandra satellite of the SMC supernova remnant SNR 0057-7226 which could be interacting with the wind of the Wolf-Rayet system HD 5980 .	The simulations predict the presence of shell-like regions of enhanced X-ray emission which are consistent with the presence of X-ray emitting arcs in the Chandra image .
4	Finally , in the case $ d = 1 $ we describe the set of exceptions in terms of classical Diophantine conditions .	We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the following property of an integer $ d\in\mathbb N $ and a pair $ ( a , A ) \in\mathbb R^2 $ : There exist $ \kappa & gt ; 0 $ and $ Q_0\in\mathbb N $ such that for all $ \mathbf x\in \mathbb R^d $ and $ Q\geq Q_0 $ , there exists $ \mathbf p/q\in\mathbb Q^d $ such that $ 1\leq q\leq Q $ and $ \|\mathbf x - \mathbf p/q\| \leq \kappa q^ { -a } Q^ { -A } $ .	This generalizes Dirichlet 's theorem , which states that this property holds ( with $ \kappa = Q_0 = 1 $ ) when $ a = 1 $ and $ A = 1/d $ .	We also analyze the set of exceptions in those cases where the statement does not hold , showing that they form a comeager set .	This is also true if $ \mathbb R^d $ is replaced by an appropriate `` Diophantine space '' , such as a nonsingular rational quadratic hypersurface which contains rational points .
3	For example , for maximally-correlated duplex networks , all pairs of nodes in the giant component are connected via at least two independent paths and network structure is highly resilient to random failure .	We study the robustness properties of multiplex networks consisting of multiple layers of distinct types of links , focusing on the role of correlations between degrees of a node in different layers .	We use generating function formalism to address various notions of the network robustness relevant to multiplex networks such as the resilience of ordinary- and mutual connectivity under random or targeted node removals as well as the biconnectivity .	We found that correlated coupling can affect the structural robustness of multiplex networks in diverse fashion .	In contrast , anti-correlated duplex networks are on one hand robust against targeted attack on high-degree nodes , but on the other hand they can be vulnerable to random failure .
2	This suggests that the impurity effect is originating in the Zn 4s-orbital , not its 3d-orbitals .	Recent experiments on Zn-substituted 122-type iron-based superconductors ( FeSCs ) at electron- and hole- doped region provide us with a testing ground for understanding the effect of Zn impurities in these systems .	Our first-principle calculations of the electronic structure reveal that the Zn 3d orbitals are far below the Fermi level and chemically inactive , while the Zn 4s-orbital is partially occupied and its wave function overlapping with those 3d-orbitals of neighboring Fe-ions .	Employing a phenomenological two-orbital lattice model for 122-FeSCs and the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations , we study how the Zn-impurities suppress the superconductivity in electron- and hole- doped compounds .	Our obtained results qualitatively agree with the experimental measurements .
4	The difference in filling factor is calculated for various number of $ U , ~\Delta $ .	In a honeycomb lattice the symmetry has been broken by adding an ionic potential and a single-particle gap was generated in the spectrum .	We have employed the iterative perturbation theory ( IPT ) in dynamical mean field approximation method to study the effects of competition between $ U $ and $ \Delta $ on energy gap and renormalized Fermi velocity .	We found , the competition between the single-particle gap parameter and the Hubbard potential closed the energy gap and restored the semi-metal phase , then the gap is opened again in Mott insulator phase .	For a fixed $ \Delta $ by increasing $ U $ , the renormalized Fermi velocity $ \tilde { v_F } $ is decreased , but change in $ \Delta $ , for a fixed $ U $ , has no effects on $ \tilde { v_F } $ .
3	Existence of nontrivial twins requires singularity of W. Systems in thermodynamic equilibrium do not admit subsystem twins .	Twin observables , i.e.opposite subsystem observables A+ and A- that are indistinguishable in measurement in a given mixed or pure state W , are investigated in detail algebraicly and geometrically .	It is shown that there is a far-reaching correspondence between the detectable ( in W ) spectral entities of the two operators .	Twin observables are state-dependently quantum-logically equivalent , and direct subsystem measurement of one of them ipso facto gives rise to the indirect ( i.e.distant ) measurement of the other .	These observables may enable one to simplify the matrix representing W .
3	In other words , the median is the deepest point in the sample space according to that definition .	Identification of the center of a data cloud is one of the basic problems in statistics .	One popular choice for such a center is the median , and several versions of median in finite dimensional spaces have been studied in the literature .	In particular , medians based on different notions of data depth have been extensively studied by many researchers , who defined median as the point , where the depth function attains its maximum value .	In this paper , we investigate the deepest point for probability distributions in infinite dimensional spaces .
0	We propose that luminous transients , including novae and supernovae , can be used to detect the faintest galaxies in the universe .	Beyond a few Mpc , dwarf galaxies with stellar masses $ & lt ; 10^6 M_ { \odot } $ will likely be too faint and/or too low in surface brightness to be directly detected in upcoming large area ground-based photometric surveys .	However , single epoch LSST photometry will be able to detect novae to distances of $ \sim30 $ Mpc and SNe to Gpc-scale distances .	Depending on the form of the stellar mass-halo mass relation and the underlying star formation histories of low mass dwarfs , the expected nova rates will be a few to $ \sim100 $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ and the expected SN rates ( including both type Ia and core-collapse ) will be $ \sim10^2-10^4 $ within the observable ( $ 4\pi $ sr ) volume .	The transient rate associated with intrahalo stars will be comparably large , but these transients will be located close to bright galaxies , in contrast to the dwarfs , which should trace the underlying large scale structure of the cosmic web .
0	We calculate the phase behavior of hard spheres with size polydispersity , using accurate free energy expressions for the fluid and solid phases .	Cloud and shadow curves , which determine the onset of phase coexistence , are found exactly by the moment free energy method , but we also compute the complete phase diagram , taking full account of fractionation effects .	In contrast to earlier , simplified treatments we find no point of equal concentration between fluid and solid or re-entrant melting at higher densities .	Rather , the fluid cloud curve continues to the largest polydispersity that we study ( 14 % ) ; from the equilibrium phase behavior a terminal polydispersity can thus only be defined for the solid , where we find it to be around 7 % .	At sufficiently large polydispersity , fractionation into several solid phases can occur , consistent with previous approximate calculations ; we find in addition that coexistence of several solids with a fluid phase is also possible .
3	Assuming M ( H_2 ) /L'_CO = 0.8 M_Sun/ ( K km^-1 pc^2 ) , we estimate M ( H_2 ) = ( 5.4-9.1 ) x10^9 M_Sun for the two galaxies .	We present IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer 3mm observations of CO ( 1-0 ) emission in two 24um-selected starburst galaxies in the outskirts ( 2-3xR_virial ) of the rich cluster Cl0024+16 ( z=0.395 ) .	The galaxies ' inferred far-infrared luminosities place them in the luminous infrared galaxy class ( LIRGs , L_FIR & gt ; 10^11 L_Sun ) , with star formation rates of ~60 M_Sun/yr .	Strong CO ( 1-0 ) emission is detected in both galaxies , and we use the CO line luminosity to estimate the mass of cold molecular gas , M ( H_2 ) .	We estimate the galaxies ' dynamical masses from their CO line-widths , M_dyn~1-3x10^10 M_Sun , implying large cold gas fractions in the galaxies ' central regions .
4	The reflection and transmission coefficients have a strong resonance that is determined by the parameters of the rf-SQUID ; its strength depends essentially on the incident angle .	We study the transmission and reflection of a plane electromagnetic wave through a two dimensional array of rf-SQUIDs .	The basic equations describing the amplitudes of the magnetic field and current in the split-ring resonators are developed .	These yield in the linear approximation the reflection and transmission coefficients .	The polarization of the reflected wave is independent of the frequency of the incident wave and of its polarization ; it is defined only by the orientation of the split-ring .
4	Studying the complex random matrix that defines the MIMO channel , we characterize the second-order joint cdf of the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) for the best and worst channels .	We investigate the dynamic behavior of the stationary random process defined by a central complex Wishart ( CW ) matrix $ { \bf { W } } ( t ) $ as it varies along a certain dimension $ t $ .	We characterize the second-order joint cdf of the largest eigenvalue , and the second-order joint cdf of the smallest eigenvalue of this matrix .	We show that both cdfs can be expressed in exact closed-form in terms of a finite number of well-known special functions in the context of communication theory .	As a direct application , we investigate the dynamic behavior of the parallel channels associated with multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO ) systems in the presence of Rayleigh fading .
1	Accurately measuring the travel times of these wave packets is crucial for inferring the sub-surface properties in the Sun .	In time-distance helioseismology , the time signals ( Doppler shifts ) at two points on the solar surface , separated by a fixed angular distance are cross-correlated , and this leads to a wave packet signal .	The observed signal is quite noisy , and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and make the cross-correlation more robust , the temporal oscillation signal is phase-speed filtered at the two points in order to select waves that travel a fixed horizontal distance .	Hence a new formula to estimate the travel times is derived , in the presence of a phase speed filter , and it includes both the radial and horizontal component of the oscillation displacement signal .	It generalizes the previously used Gabor wavelet that was derived without a phase speed filter and included only the radial component of the displacement .
3	We find that the correlation length and time can be described by power-law dependences on the reduced Rayleigh number $ { \epsilon } $ .	We present a study of the recently discovered spatially-extended chaotic state known as spiral-defect chaos , which occurs in low-Prandtl-number , large-aspect-ratio Rayleigh-Benard convection .	We employ the modulus squared of the space-time Fourier transform of time series of two-dimensional shadowgraph images to construct the structure factor $ { S } ( { \vec k } , \omega ) $ .	This analysis is used to characterize the average spatial and temporal scales of the chaotic state .	These power laws have as yet no theoretical explanation .
3	While migrations of a single element can easily be expressed with such a Wiener-like process , migrations within the completely tiled space-time ( without introducing extra dimensions ) require curvature .	Wiener processes ( the formalization of Brownian Motion random walk ) provide a basis for a model of discrete , mobile elements ( Dx , Dy , Dz , Dt ) that 'tile ' space-time .	The possible migrations of these elements are shown graphically via computer simulation .	The Wiener process is modified by not taking the process to infinitesimals , and by also allowing the process to be a random walk in time as well as space .	And since the quantum vacuum energy fluctuations imply curvature fluctuations , we use those curvature fluctuations in the model .
0	Fix $ p & gt ; 1 $ , not necessarily integer , with $ p ( d-2 ) & lt ; d $ .	We study the $ p $ -fold self-intersection local time of a simple random walk on the lattice $ \Z^d $ up to time $ t $ .	This is the $ p $ -norm of the vector of the walker 's local times , $ \ell_t $ .	We derive precise logarithmic asymptotics of the expectation of $ \exp\ { \theta_t \|\ell_t\|_p\ } $ for scales $ \theta_t & gt ; 0 $ that are bounded from above , possibly tending to zero .	The speed is identified in terms of mixed powers of $ t $ and $ \theta_t $ , and the precise rate is characterized in terms of a variational formula , which is in close connection to the { \it Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality } .
0	In this note we study Morita contexts and Galois extensions for corings .	For a coring $ \QTR { cal } { C } $ over a ( not necessarily commutative ) ground ring $ A $ we give equivalent conditions for $ \QTR { cal } { M } ^ { \QTR { cal } { C } } $ to satisfy the weak.resp .	the strong structure theorem .	We also characterize the so called \QTR { em } { cleft } $ C $ \QTR { em } { -Galois extensions } over commutative rings .	Our approach is similar to that of Y. Doi and A. Masuoka in their work on ( cleft ) $ H $ -Galois extensions .
3	We show mean effect for galaxies with different redshifts .	We try to explain quasar-galaxy associations by gravitational lensing by globular clusters , located in the halos of foreground galaxies .	We propose observational test for verification of this hypothesis .	We processed SUPERCOSMOS sky survey and found overdensities of star-like sources with zero proper motions in the vicinities of foreground galaxies from CfA3 catalog .	Two effects can explain observational data - these are lensing by globular clusters and lensing by dwarf galaxies .
1	In these models the would-be inflaton is forced to emerge from the initial singularity climbing up a mild exponential potential , until it bounces against a steep exponential potential of `` brane SUSY breaking '' scenarios , and as a result the ensuing descent gives rise to an inflationary epoch that begins when the system is still well off its eventual attractor .	We discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) observables , of a class of pre-inflationary dynamics suggested by string models where SUSY is broken due to the presence of D-branes and orientifolds preserving incompatible portions of it .	If a pre-inflationary climbing phase of this type had occurred within 6-7 e-folds of the horizon exit for the largest observable wavelengths , displacement off the attractor and initial-state effects would conspire to suppress power in the primordial scalar spectrum , enhancing it in the tensor spectrum and typically superposing oscillations on both .	We investigate these imprints on CMB observables over a range of parameters , examine their statistical significance , and provide a semi-analytic rationale for our results .	It is tempting to ascribe at least part of the large-angle anomalies in the CMB to pre-inflationary dynamics of this type .
0	This Letter reports on the detection of two super-Earth planets in the Gl581 system , already known to harbour a hot Neptune .	One of the planets has a mass of 5 M_Earth and resides at the `` warm '' edge of the habitable zone of the star .	It is thus the known exoplanet which most resembles our own Earth .	The other planet has a 7.7 M_Earth mass and orbits at 0.25 AU from the star , close to the `` cold '' edge of the habitable zone .	These two new light planets around an M3 dwarf further confirm the formerly tentative statistical trend for i ) many more very low-mass planets being found around M dwarfs than around solar-type stars and ii ) low-mass planets outnumbering Jovian planets around M dwarfs .
4	In the proof we introduce a new method based on It\=o calculus to estimate Fourier transforms by reformulating the question in the language of It\=o drift-diffusion processes and combine it with the classical work of Kahane on Brownian images .	In a previous article ( Int.Math.Res.Not .	2014 , 2730 -- 2745 ) T. Orponen and the authors proved that the Fourier dimension of the graph of any real-valued function on $ \mathbb { R } $ is bounded above by $ 1 $ .	This partially answered a question of Kahane ( '93 ) by showing that the graph of the Wiener process $ W_t $ ( Brownian motion ) is almost surely not a Salem set .	In this article we complement this result by showing that the Fourier dimension of the graph of $ W_t $ is almost surely $ 1 $ .
3	In this paper we prove that if a certain condition on the average of the Ricci scalar holds , then the Finsler manifold M is compact if the Ricci scalar is bounded above by the same positive number .	The standard Bonnet-Myers theorem says that if the Ricci scalar of a Riemannian manifold is bounded below by a positive number , then the manifold is compact .	Moreover , a bound of its diameter is pointed out .	The theorem was extended to Finsler manifolds .	An upper bound of the diameter is also found .
2	This then implies that the bursts are extremely energetic events , originating from quite small volumes ( due to the millisecond burst durations ) .	Fast radio bursts appear to exhibit large dispersion measures , typically exceeding any expected galactic interstellar contribution , especially along the moderate to high-galactic-latitude directions in which such events have been most often observed .	The dispersions have been therefore interpreted as extragalactic , leading to the inference that the sources of the bursts are at Gpc distances .	To circumvent the energetic difficulties , Loeb , Shvartzvald , & amp ; Maoz ( 2014 ) propose that the bursts are produced by flares near the surfaces of M stars or contact binaries within a local volume of the galaxy .	Most of the dispersion would then occur in the overlying stellar coronae .
3	The results indicate that the global Schmidt law is a manifestation of the overall density distribution of the interstellar medium ( ISM ) .	One of the most puzzling properties of observed galaxies is the universality of the empirical correlation between the star formation rate and average gas surface density on kiloparsec scales ( the Schmidt law ) .	In this study I present results of self-consistent cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxy formation that reproduce the Schmidt law naturally , without assuming it , and provide some clues to this puzzle .	The simulations incorporate the main physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation and have a dynamic range high enough to identify individual star forming regions .	In particular , the density probability distribution function ( PDF ) in the simulated disks is similar to that observed in recent state-of-the-art modeling of the turbulent ISM and has a well-defined generic shape .
4	These results are made possible by the construction of a new { \it massive } N=2 D=9 supergravity theory .	We present a version of ten-dimensional IIA supergravity containing a 9-form potential for which the field equations are equivalent to those of the standard , massless , IIA theory for vanishing 10-form field strength , $ F_ { 10 } $ , and to those of the `massive ' IIA theory for non-vanishing $ F_ { 10 } $ .	We present a multi 8-brane solution of these equations that generalizes the 8-brane of Polchinski and Witten .	We show that this solution is T-dual to a new multi 7-brane solution of $ S^1 $ compactified IIB supergravity , and that the latter is T-dual to the IIA 6-brane .	When combined with the $ Sl ( 2 ; \Z ) $ U-duality of the type IIB superstring , the T-duality between type II 7-branes and 8-branes implies a quantization of the cosmological constant of type IIA superstring theory .
0	It appeared recently that the classical random network model used to represent complex networks does not capture their main properties ( clustering , degree distribution ) .	Since then , various attempts have been made to provide network models having these properties .	We propose here the first model which achieves the following challenges : it produces networks which have the three main wanted properties , it is based on some real-world observations , and it is sufficiently simple to make it possible to prove its main properties .	We first give an overview of the field by presenting the main models introduced until now , then we discuss some remarks on some complex networks which lead us to the definition of our model .	We then show that the model has the expected properties and that it can actually be seen as a general model for complex networks .
4	Finally , exploiting a suitable correspondence between quantum channels and generators of quantum dynamical semigroups , we extend our results to the realm of continuous-time quantum evolutions , providing a characterization of ergodic Lindblad generators and showing that they are dense in the set of all possible generators .	The paper provides a systematic characterization of quantum ergodic and mixing channels in finite dimensions and a discussion of their structural properties .	In particular , we discuss ergodicity in the general case where the fixed point of the channel is not a full-rank ( faithful ) density matrix .	Notably , we show that ergodicity is stable under randomizations , namely that every random mixture of an ergodic channel with a generic channel is still ergodic .	In addition , we prove several conditions under which ergodicity can be promoted to the stronger property of mixing .
3	In addition , efforts are underway to improve compiler tools for automatic parallelization and optimization of affine loop nests for GPUs and for automatic translation of OpenMP parallelized codes to CUDA .	Heterogeneous systems are becoming more common on High Performance Computing ( HPC ) systems .	Even using tools like CUDA and OpenCL it is a non-trivial task to obtain optimal performance on the GPU .	Approaches to simplifying this task include Merge ( a library based framework for heterogeneous multi-core systems ) , Zippy ( a framework for parallel execution of codes on multiple GPUs ) , BSGP ( a new programming language for general purpose computation on the GPU ) and CUDA-lite ( an enhancement to CUDA that transforms code based on annotations ) .	In this paper we present an alternative approach : a new computational framework for the development of massively data parallel scientific codes applications suitable for use on such petascale/exascale hybrid systems built upon the highly scalable Cactus framework .
2	The small Davenport constant $ \mathsf d ( G ) $ is the maximal integer $ \ell $ such that there is a sequence over $ G $ of length $ \ell $ which has no nontrivial , product-one subsequence .	Let $ G $ be a finite group written multiplicatively .	By a sequence over $ G $ , we mean a finite sequence of terms from $ G $ which is unordered , repetition of terms allowed , and we say that it is a product-one sequence if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity element of $ G $ .	The large Davenport constant $ \mathsf D ( G ) $ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence -- -this is a product-one sequence which can not be partitioned into two nontrivial , product-one subsequences .	The goal of this paper is to present several upper bounds for $ \mathsf D ( G ) $ , including the following : $ $ \mathsf D ( G ) \leq { ll } \mathsf d ( G ) +2|G'|-1 , & amp ; where $ G'= [ G , G ] \leq G $ is the commutator subgroup ; \frac34|G| , & amp ; if $ G $ is neither cyclic nor dihedral of order $ 2n $ with $ n $ odd ; \frac { 2 } { p } |G| , & amp ; if $ G $ is noncyclic , where $ p $ is the smallest prime divisor of $ |G| $ ; \frac { p^2+2p-2 } { p^3 } |G| , & amp ; if $ G $ is a non-abelian $ p $ -group .
4	Taking into account the estimation results , it is stated once again that the indications of convergence are greater in industry , and it can be seen that spatial spillover effects , spatial lag ( capturing spatial autocorrelation through a spatially redundant dependent variable ) and spatial error ( capturing spatial autocorrelation through a spatially redundant error term ) , as well as human capital , condition the convergence of productivity in the various economic sectors of Portuguese region in the period under consideration ( Martinho , 2011 ) .	This study analyses , through cross-section estimation methods , the influence of spatial effects and human capital in the conditional productivity convergence ( product per worker ) in the economic sectors of NUTs III of mainland Portugal between 1995 and 2002 .	To analyse the data , Moran 's I statistics is considered , and it is stated that productivity is subject to positive spatial autocorrelation ( productivity develops in a similar manner to productivity in neighbouring regions ) , above all , in agriculture and services .	Industry and the total of all sectors present indications that they are subject to positive spatial autocorrelation in productivity .	On the other hand , it is stated that the indications of convergence , specifically bearing in mind the concept of absolute convergence , are greater in industry .
0	Twenty-five years after the first proposal , the question whether the ground state of a frustrated spin-half system is well described by a spin-liquid Resonating Valence Bond ( RVB ) wave function is still controversial .	A physically transparent representation of a RVB state can be obtained in fermionic representation with a standard BCS-type pairing wave function , working in the subspace with fixed number of electrons and no double occupancies .	In this work , we show that , using this variational wave function with a careful parameterization of the pairing function , it is possible to obtain an extremely accurate { \em ansatz } for the ground state of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbors interactions ( $ J_ { 1 } { - } J_ { 2 } $ model ) in the regime of strong frustration .	Indeed , in the spin-half realization of this model , it is known that the combined effect of frustration and zero-point motion interferes with the mechanism of spontaneously broken symmetry , giving rise to a non-magnetic phase of purely quantum-mechanical nature ( $ J_2/J_1\simeq 0.5 $ ) .	This wave function is proposed to represent the generic spin-half RVB ground state in spin liquids .
1	We follow the framework given in \cite { Ji } to study the problem of combinatorially characterizing an entire map $ P e^ { Q } $ , where $ P $ is a polynomial of degree $ p $ and $ Q $ is a polynomial of degree $ q $ using an { \em iteration scheme defined by Thurston } and a { \em bounded geometry condition } .	In this paper we define a topological class of branched covering maps of the plane called { \em topological exponential maps of type $ ( p , q ) $ } and denoted by $ \TE_ { p , q } $ , where $ p\geq 0 $ and $ q\geq 1 $ .	We first show that an element $ f \in { \TE } _ { p , q } $ with finite post-singular set is combinatorially equivalent to an entire map $ P e^ { Q } $ if and only if it has bounded geometry with compactness .	Thus to complete the characterization , we only need to check that the bounded geometry actually implies compactness .	We show this for some $ f\in \TE_ { p,1 } $ , $ p\geq 1 $ .
0	Hinode observations have revealed intermittent recurrent plasma ejections/jets in the chromosphere .	These are interpreted as a result of non-perfectly anti-parallel magnetic reconnection , i.e.component reconnection , between a twisted magnetic flux tube and the pre-existing coronal/chromospheric magnetic field , though the fundamental physics of component reconnection is unrevealed .	In this paper , we experimentally reproduced the magnetic configuration and investigated the dynamics of plasma ejections , heating and wave generation triggered by component reconnection in the chromosphere .	We set plasma parameters as in the chromosphere ( density 10^14 cm^-3 , temperature 5-10 eV , i.e . ( 5-10 ) x10^4 K , and reconnection magnetic field 200 G ) using argon plasma .	Our experiment shows bi-directional outflows with the speed of 5 km/s at maximum , ion heating in the downstream area over 30 eV and magnetic fluctuations mainly at 5-10 us period .
0	We consider the problem of simultaneous on-demand streaming of stored video to multiple users in a multi-cell wireless network where multiple unicast streaming sessions are run in parallel and share the same frequency band .	Each streaming session is formed by the sequential transmission of video `` chunks , '' such that each chunk arrives into the corresponding user playback buffer within its playback deadline .	We formulate the problem as a Network Utility Maximization ( NUM ) where the objective is to fairly maximize users ' video streaming Quality of Experience ( QoE ) and then derive an iterative control policy using Lyapunov Optimization , which solves the NUM problem up to any level of accuracy and yields an online protocol with control actions at every iteration decomposing into two layers interconnected by the users ' request queues : i ) a video streaming adaptation layer reminiscent of DASH , implemented at each user node ; ii ) a transmission scheduling layer where a max-weight scheduler is implemented at each base station .	The proposed chunk request scheme is a pull strategy where every user opportunistically requests video chunks from the neighboring base stations and dynamically adapts the quality of its requests based on the current size of the request queue .	For the transmission scheduling component , we first describe the general max-weight scheduler and then particularize it to a wireless network where the base stations have multiuser MIMO ( MU-MIMO ) beamforming capabilities .
2	In recent years , we observe heavy-tailed data in many fields .	Empirical likelihood approach is one of non-parametric statistical methods , which is applied to the hypothesis testing or construction of confidence regions for pivotal unknown quantities .	This method has been applied to the case of independent identically distributed random variables and second order stationary processes .	To model such data suitably , we consider symmetric scalar and multivariate $ \alpha $ -stable linear processes generated by infinite variance innovation sequence .	We use a Whittle likelihood type estimating function in the empirical likelihood ratio function and derive the asymptotic distribution of the empirical likelihood ratio statistic for $ \alpha $ -stable linear processes .
4	In addition , a filter-operator technique is presented which allows to extract specific information on the final states at a given excitation energy .	Using the density-matrix renormalization group in combination with the Chebyshev polynomial expansion technique , we study the two-hole excitation spectrum of the one-dimensional Hubbard model in the entire filling range from the completely occupied band ( n=2 ) down to half-filling ( n=1 ) .	For strong interactions , the spectra reveal multiplon physics , i.e. , relevant final states are characterized by two ( doublon ) , three ( triplon ) , four ( quadruplon ) and more holes , potentially forming stable compound objects or resonances with finite lifetime .	These give rise to several satellites in the spectra with largely different spectral weights as well as to different continua .	The complex multiplon phenomenology is analyzed by interpreting not only local and k-resolved two-hole spectra but also three- and four-hole spectra for the Hubbard model and by referring to effective low-energy models .
2	The [ S IV ] 10.52 and [ Ne II ] 12.81 micron emission regions are found to be spatially extended , compared to unresolved continuum and He and C recombination line emission .	Fine-structure mid-infrared emission lines with critical densities in the regime 10^4 to 10^6 cm^-3 can be employed to probe the outflow from Wolf-Rayet stars at radii of \sim 10^15 cm .	Narrow-band mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nearest WR star to the sun , gamma Velorum is analysed for spatially resolved forbidden line emission in the Wolf-Rayet outer wind .	The [ S IV ] and [ { Ne II ] emission line distributions have a high degree of azimuthal symmetry , indicating a spherically symmetric outflow .	A model wind with a modest degree of clumping ( clumping factor f \sim 10 ) provides a better match to the observations than an unclumped model .
0	In this technical report we derive the analytic form of the Hessian matrix for shape matching energy .	Shape matching is a useful technique for meshless deformation , which can be easily combined with multiple techniques in real-time dynamics .	Nevertheless , it has been rarely applied in scenarios where implicit integrators are required , and hence strong viscous damping effect , though popular in simulation systems nowadays , is forbidden for shape matching .	The reason lies in the difficulty to derive the Hessian matrix of the shape matching energy .	Computing the Hessian matrix correctly , and stably , is the key to more broadly application of shape matching in implicitly-integrated systems .
3	In this article , we prove that , for a large class of potentials , the pushforward measure $ \mu_\psi\circ\pi^ { -1 } $ is still Gibbsian for a potential $ \phi : B^ { \mathbb N } \to { \mathbb R } $ having a `bit less ' regularity than $ \psi $ .	Starting from the full -- shift on a finite alphabet $ A $ , mingling some symbols of $ A $ , we obtain a new full shift on a smaller alphabet $ B $ .	This amalgamation defines a factor map from $ ( A^ { \mathbb N } , T_A ) $ to $ ( B^ { \mathbb N } , T_B ) $ , where $ T_A $ and $ T_B $ are the respective shift maps .	According to the thermodynamic formalism , to each regular function ( `potential ' ) $ \psi : A^ { \mathbb N } \to { \mathbb R } $ , we can associate a unique Gibbs measure $ \mu_\psi $ .	In the special case where $ \psi $ is a `2 -- symbol ' potential , the Gibbs measure $ \mu_\psi $ is nothing but a Markov measure and the amalgamation $ \pi $ defines a hidden Markov chain .
0	We present a summary of top quark physics results from Run 1 at CDF using the Run 1 data sample of 106 pb $ ^ { -1 } $ .	In addition to the precursory measurements of the top quark mass and $ \ttbar $ cross section , we have performed a number of other analyses which test the consistency of the $ \ttbar $ data sample with the standard model ( SM ) .	Deviations from SM expectations could provide hints for new physics .	We find that the data are consistent with the SM .	While the Run 1 data are statistically limited , we have shown that the systematic uncertainties are under control and thus have layed the groundwork for higher precision tests of the SM in Run 2 .
3	Particle interactions lead to considerable layering in the mean density profiles , a feature that is absent in the trivial case of noninteracting , freely diffusing particles .	While the theory of diffusion of a single Brownian particle in confined geometries is well-established by now , we discuss here the theoretical framework necessary to generalize the theory of diffusion to dense suspensions of strongly interacting Brownian particles .	Dynamical density functional theory ( DDFT ) for classical Brownian particles represents an ideal tool for this purpose .	After outlining the basic ingredients to DDFT we show that it can be readily applied to flowing suspensions with time-dependent particle sources .	If the particle injection rate varies periodically in time with a suitable frequency , a resonance in the layering of the mean particle density profile is predicted .
4	We develop a parallel implementation of this formulation using the finite-difference discretization .	We present a real-space formulation and higher-order finite-difference implementation of periodic Orbital-free Density Functional Theory ( OF-DFT ) .	Specifically , utilizing a local reformulation of the electrostatic and kernel terms , we develop a generalized framework for performing OF-DFT simulations with different variants of the electronic kinetic energy .	In particular , we propose a self-consistent field ( SCF ) type fixed-point method for calculations involving linear-response kinetic energy functionals .	In this framework , evaluation of both the electronic ground-state as well as forces on the nuclei are amenable to computations that scale linearly with the number of atoms .
0	We introduce a world vision in which data is endowed with memory .	In this data-centric systems paradigm , data items can be enabled to retain all or some of their previous values .	We call this ability `` remembrance '' and posit that it empowers significant leaps in the security , availability , and general operational dimensions of systems .	With the explosion in cheap , fast memories and storage , large-scale remembrance will soon become practical .	Here , we introduce and explore the advantages of such a paradigm and the challenges in making it a reality .
4	These results answer a number of open questions in the area of parameterized complexity .	We present a method for reducing the treewidth of a graph while preserving all of its minimal $ s-t $ separators up to a certain fixed size $ k $ .	This technique allows us to solve $ s-t $ Cut and Multicut problems with various additional restrictions ( e.g. , the vertices being removed from the graph form an independent set or induce a connected graph ) in linear time for every fixed number $ k $ of removed vertices .	Our results have applications for problems that are not directly defined by separators , but the known solution methods depend on some variant of separation .	for example , we can solve similarly restricted generalizations of Bipartization ( delete at most $ k $ vertices from $ G $ to make it bipartite ) in almost linear time for every fixed number $ k $ of removed vertices .
0	The thermodynamic stabilities of various phases of the nitrides of the platinum metal elements are systematically studied using density functional theory .	It is shown that for the nitrides of Rh , Pd , Ir and Pt two new crystal structures , in which the metal ions occupy simple tetragonal lattice sites , have lower formation enthalpies at ambient conditions than any previously proposed structures .	The region of stability with respect to those structures extends to 17 GPa for PtN2 .	Calculations show that the PtN2 simple tetragonal structures at this pressure are thermodynamically stable also with respect to phase separation .	The fact that the local density and generalized gradient approximations predict different values of the absolute formation enthalpies as well different relative stabilities between simple tetragonal and the pyrite or marcasite structures are further discussed .
4	Our evaluation shows that RTEC can support real-time event recognition and is capable of meeting the performance requirements identified in a recent survey of event processing use cases .	Systems for symbolic event recognition accept as input a stream of time-stamped events from sensors and other computational devices , and seek to identify high-level composite events , collections of events that satisfy some pattern .	RTEC is an Event Calculus dialect with novel implementation and 'windowing ' techniques that allow for efficient event recognition , scalable to large data streams .	RTEC can deal with applications where event data arrive with a ( variable ) delay from , and are revised by , the underlying sources .	RTEC can update already recognised events and recognise new events when data arrive with a delay or following data revision .
0	In this contribution an entirely different way compared to conventional approaches for axion , hidden photon and dark matter ( DM ) detection is proposed for discussion .	The idea is to use living plants which are known to be very sensitive to all kind of environmental parameters , as detectors .	A possible observable in such living plants could be the natural bio-photon level , a kind of metabolism related chemoluminescence .	Another observable might be morphological changes or systematic leave movements .	However a big problem for such kind of experiment would be the availability of a known , controllable and calibrated DM source .
1	In this note we present a variation of this scenario , in which stabilization of the electroweak scale in the right place is ensured by the $ Z_2 $ symmetry exchanging the Standard Model ( SM ) with its mirror copy .	The cosmological relaxation mechanism proposed in [ 1 ] allows for a dynamically generated large separation between the weak scale and a theory cutoff , using a sharp change of theory behaviour upon crossing the limit between unbroken and broken symmetry phases .	We sketch the possible ways to produce viable thermal evolution of the Universe and discuss experimental accessibility of the new physics effects .	We show that in this scenario the mirror SM can either have sizeable couplings with the ordinary one , or , conversely , can interact with it with a negligible strength .	The overall cutoff allowed by such a construction can reach $ 10^9 $ GeV .
1	In the static limit we analyze the Landau ( orbital ) and Pauli magnetization , as well as the Lindhard correction which describes Friedel and RKKY oscillations .	We present analytical expressions for the current-current correlation function in graphene for arbitrary frequency , wave vector , doping , and band gap induced by a mass term .	In the nonrelativistic limit we compare our results with the situation of the usual two-dimensional electron gas ( 2DEG ) .	We find that the orbital magnetic susceptibility ( OMS ) in gapped graphene is smeared out on an energy scale given by the inverse mass .	The nonrelativistic limit of the plasmon dispersion and the Lindhard function reproduces the results of the 2DEG .
1	Let $ D_0 ( G ) $ be the version of $ D ( G ) $ where we do not allow quantifier alternations in $ \Phi $ .	Let $ D ( G ) $ be the minimum quantifier depth of a first order sentence $ \Phi $ that defines a graph $ G $ up to isomorphism .	Define $ q_0 ( n ) $ to be the minimum of $ D_0 ( G ) $ over all graphs $ G $ of order $ n $ .	We prove that for all $ n $ we have $ \log^*n-\log^*\log^*n-1\le q_0 ( n ) \le \log^*n+22 $ , where $ \log^*n $ is equal to the minimum number of iterations of the binary logarithm needed to bring $ n $ to 1 or below .	The upper bound is obtained by constructing special graphs with modular decomposition of very small depth .
4	List decoding codes for symmetric disjunctive sum are said to be { \em symmetric disjunctive list-decoding $ s_L $ -codes } ( SLD $ s_L $ -codes ) .	A binary code is said to be a disjunctive list-decoding $ s_L $ -code ( LD $ s_L $ -code ) , $ s \ge 2 $ , $ L \ge 1 $ , if the code is identified by the incidence matrix of a family of finite sets in which the union ( or disjunctive sum ) of any $ s $ sets can cover not more than $ L-1 $ other sets of the family .	In this paper , we consider a similar class of binary codes which are based on a { \em symmetric disjunctive sum } ( SDS ) of binary symbols .	By definition , the symmetric disjunctive sum ( SDS ) takes values from the ternary alphabet $ \ { 0 , 1 , *\ } $ , where the symbol~ $ * $ denotes `` erasure '' .	Namely : SDS is equal to $ 0 $ ( $ 1 $ ) if all its binary symbols are equal to $ 0 $ ( $ 1 $ ) , otherwise SDS is equal to~ $ * $ .
0	Thallium copper chloride is a quantum spin liquid of S = 1/2 Cu^2+ dimers .	Interdimer superexchange interactions give a three-dimensional magnon dispersion and a spin gap significantly smaller than the dimer coupling .	This gap is closed by an applied hydrostatic pressure of approximately 2kbar or by a magnetic field of 5.6T , offering a unique opportunity to explore the both types of quantum phase transition and their associated critical phenomena .	We use a bond-operator formulation to obtain a continuous description of all disordered and ordered phases , and thus of the transitions separating these .	Both pressure- and field-induced transitions may be considered as the Bose-Einstein condensation of triplet magnon excitations , and the respective phases of staggered magnetic order as linear combinations of dimer singlet and triplet modes .
3	The Universal Decay theory first propounded in `` The Origin and Its Meaning '' in 1996 has since been validated by the Pioneer 10 and 11 `` anomalous acceleration '' as well as by the theory 's success in accounting for `` dark matter '' and `` dark energy '' .	There is general agreement that the universe began with an `` explosion '' of matter and energy at a `` singularity '' , the `` Big Bang '' .	This paper analyses the mechanics of that beginning and two alternative theories related to it : - The Hubble-Einstein theory that that beginning created space itself , expanding and carrying the universe 's matter and energy with it , and - The Universal Decay theory that the length , ( L ) , dimensional aspect of all quantities in the universe is exponentially decaying while the material universe is expanding outward within passive , static `` space '' .	The Hubble-Einstein theory has long been accepted by consensus .	The same centrally- directed , distance-independent acceleration of ( 8.74 +/- 1.33 ) x 10^-8 cm/s^2 that is the Pioneer `` anomalous acceleration '' supplies the `` additional gravitation '' that `` dark matter '' is sought to supply .
2	It should be remarked that the original n-pole approximation ( Phys.Rev .	This work investigates a d-p Hubbard model by the n-pole approximation in the hole-doped regime .	In particular , the spectral function $ A ( \omega , \vec { k } ) $ is analyzed varying the filling , the local Coulomb interaction and the $ d-p $ hybridization .	184 ( 1969 ) 451 ) has been improved in order to include adequately the $ \vec { k } $ -dependence of the important correlation function $ & lt ; \vec { S } _j\cdot\vec { S } _i & gt ; $ present in the poles of the Green 's functions .	It has been verified that the topology of the Fermi surface ( defined by $ A ( \omega=0 , \vec { k } ) $ ) is deeply affected by the doping , the strength of the Coulomb interaction and also by the hybridization .
2	We use a simple square-gradient free-energy functional with a quartic local free-energy function as an example and study the time evolution of a single nucleus placed within a metastable environment .	The minimum free-energy path ( MFEP ) is the most probable route of the nucleation process on the multidimensional free-energy surface .	In this study , the phase-field equation is used as a mathematical tool to deduce the minimum free-energy path ( MFEP ) of homogeneous nucleation .	The time integration of the phase-field equation is performed using the numerically efficient cell-dynamics method .	By monitoring the evolution of the size of the nucleus and the free energy of the system simultaneously , we can easily deduce the free-energy barrier as a function of the size of the sub- and the super-critical nucleus along the MFEP .
1	We use PHOENIX and ATLAS model atmospheres to model lightcurves derived from high precision ( S/N ~ 5000 ) HST data of the eclipsing binary SV Cam ( F9V + K4V ) , where the variation of specific intensity across the stellar disc will determine the contact points of the binary system lightcurve .	The variation of the specific intensity across the stellar disc is essential input parameter in surface brightness reconstruction techniques such as Doppler imaging , where the relative intensity contributions of different surface elements are important in detecting starspots .	For the first time we use chi^2 comparison fits to the first derivative profiles to determine the best-fitting model atmosphere .	We show the wavelength dependence of the limb darkening and that the first derivative profile is sensitive to the limb-darkening profile very close to the limb of the primary star .	It is concluded that there is only a marginal difference ( & lt ; 1sigma ) between the chi^2 comparison fits of the two model atmospheres to the HST lightcurve at all wavelengths .
2	The new dynamical equation can be straightforwardly applied in any reference frame as long as which is irrotational with respect to the absolute background of the universe .	The formalism of classical particle dynamics is reinvestigated according to the basic requirement of causal consistency , and a new equation of particle dynamics , which is more general and more in line with classical mechanics experiments than Newton 's second law , is obtained .	More importantly , the inertial frame of reference is no longer required and the inertial force is no longer introduced by hand .	The nature of the inertial force is nothing but the real forces acting on the reference object .	The essence of this reform of classical particle dynamics is just a drawback of traditional formalism in Newtonian mechanics being corrected .
3	Then we discuss the Bardeen-Hill-Lindner ( BHL ) formulation based on the renormalization-group equation and the compositeness condition , which successfully picks up 1/N_c-sub-leading effects disregarded by MTY .	In the light of recent discovery of a very heavy top quark , we reexamine the top quark condensate model proposed by Miransky , Tanabashi and Yamawaki ( MTY ) and by Nambu .	We first review the original MTY formulation based on the ladder Schwinger-Dyson equation and the Pagels-Stokar formula .	It is particularly emphasized that the critical phenomenon gives a simple reason why the top quark can have an extremely large mass compared with other quarks and leptons .	In fact BHL is equivalent to MTY at the 1/N_c-leading order .
3	In contradiction to the simple pinning effect of disorder , this result shows the suppression of the vortex pinning force by introducing more ethylene-disorders .	We investigate the influence of disorders in terminal ethylene groups of BEDT-TTF molecules ( ethylene-disorders ) on the vortex pinning of the organic superconductor $ \kappa $ - ( BEDT-TTF ) $ _2 $ Cu [ N ( CN ) $ _2 $ ] Br .	Magnetization measurements are performed under different cooling-processes .	The second peak in the magnetization hysteresis curve is observed for all samples studied , and the hysteresis width of the magnetization becomes narrower by cooling faster .	The ethylene-disorder domain model is proposed for explaining the observed result .
3	Moreover , in contrast to the latter method .	A variational principle is suggested within Riemannnian geometry , in which an auxiliary metric and the Levi Civita connection are varied independently .	The auxiliary metric plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier and introduces non-minimal coupling of matter to the curvature scalar .	The field equations are 2nd order PDEs and easier to handle than those following from the so-called Palatini method .	no gradients of the matter variables appear .
4	We compare this result with theoretical predictions and previous measurements .	We present a measurement of the correlated $ b\bar { b } $ production cross section .	The data used in this analysis were taken with the upgraded CDF detector ( CDF II ) at the Fermilab Tevatron collider , and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 742 pb $ ^ { -1 } $ .	We utilize muon pairs with invariant mass $ 5 \leq m_ { \mu\mu } \leq 80 \gevcc $ produced by $ b\bar { b } $ double semileptonic decays .	For muons with $ p_T \geq 3 \gevc $ and $ |\eta| \leq 0.7 $ , that are produced by $ b $ and $ \bar { b } $ quarks with $ p_T \geq 2 \gevc $ and $ |y| \leq 1.3 $ , we measure $ \sigma_ { b\to\mu , \bar { b } \to \mu } = 1549 \pm 133 $ pb .
1	These [ Fe/H ] values are based upon an empirically calibrated relationship that uses the Fourier coefficients of the light curve and are accurate to ~0.2 dex .	We present metallicities of 2690 RR0 Lyrae stars observed toward the MACHO Survey fields in the Galactic Bulge .	The majority of the RR0 Lyrae stars in our sample are located in the Galactic Bulge , but 255 RR0 stars are associated with Sagittarius dwarf galaxy .	We find that the RR0 Lyrae stars that belong to the Galactic Bulge have average metallicities [ Fe/H ] = -1.25 , with a broad metallicity range from [ Fe/H ] = -2.26 to -0.15 .	The RR0 stars from Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have lower average metallicity of [ Fe/H ] = -1.55 \pm 0.02 , with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.25 dex , similar to that in the bulge .
0	The observed rapid onset of star formation in molecular clouds requires rapid formation of dense fragments which can collapse individually before being overtaken by global gravitationally-driven flows .	Many previous investigations have suggested that supersonic turbulence produces the necessary fragmentation , without addressing however the source of this turbulence .	Motivated by our previous ( numerical ) work on the flow-driven formation of molecular clouds , we investigate the expected timescales of the dynamical and thermal instabilities leading to the rapid fragmentation of gas swept up by large-scale flows , and compare them with global gravitational collapse timescales .	We identify parameter regimes in gas density , temperature and spatial scale within which a given instability will dominate .	We find that dynamical instabilities disrupt large-scale coherent flows via generation of turbulence , while strong thermal fragmentation amplifies the resulting low-amplitude density perturbations , thus leading to small-scale , high-density fragments as seeds for { \em local } gravity to act upon .
1	Here , the light emission has been observed from the sliding contact between two disks under dry condition .	Triboluminescence ( TL ) is the emission of light produced by rubbing or striking two materials together .	The effects of the sliding speed on the intensity of TL have been experimentally investigated .	The results show that the intensity of the emission light increases significantly with the sliding speed .	A theoretical model is also proposed and an analytical expression is deduced for the intensity of TL in the slide contact .
2	207 , 147 ( 1996 ) ] .	The dynamics of excitons in disordered molecular solids is studied theoretically , taking into account migration between different sites , recombination , and dissociation into free charge carriers in the presence of an electric field .	The theory is applied to interpret the results of electric field-induced photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching experiments on molecularly doped polymers by Deussen et al . [ Chem.Phys .	Using an intermolecular dissociation mechanism , the dependence of the PL quenching on the electric field strength and the dopant concentration , and the time evolution of the transient PL quenching can be well described .	The results constitute additional proof of the distinct exciton dissociation mechanisms in conjugated polymer blends and molecularly doped polymers .
0	We propose a novel experimental setup for the determination of the leptonic CP-violating phase delta using the decay at rest ( DAR ) of mu+ from a single source located at distances of 10 and 30 km from two 20 kton organic liquid scintillator detectors .	The mu+ are created by bombarding a target with a 9 mA beam of 800 MeV protons .	With this proposal delta can be determined with a precision of about 20 ( 15 ) degrees in 6 ( 12 ) years .	In contrast with the DAEdALUS project , only a single source is required and it runs with a duty factor of 100 percent .	Therefore 9 mA is the maximum instanteous current , greatly reducing both the technological challenges and the costs .
3	The results are tested numerically .	The dynamics of the kicked-rotor , that is a paradigm for a mixed system , where the motion in some parts of phase space is chaotic and in other parts is regular is studied statistically .	The evolution ( Frobenius-Perron ) operator of phase space densities in the chaotic component is calculated in presence of noise , and the limit of vanishing noise is taken is taken in the end of calculation .	The relaxation rates ( related to the Ruelle resonances ) to the invariant equilibrium density are calculated analytically within an approximation that improves with increasing stochasticity .	The global picture of relaxation to the equilibrium density in the chaotic component when the system is bounded and of diffusive behavior when it is unbounded is presented .
2	Besides building a framework compatible with alternative theories of gravity and the pursuit of higher order post-Newtonian approximation , it will also be necessary to make the first order post-Newtonian multipole moments of celestial bodies be explicitly expressed in the astronomical relativistic reference systems .	With rapid development of techniques for astronomical observations , the precision of measurements has been significantly increasing .	Theories of astronomical relativistic reference systems , which are the foundation for processing and interpreting these data now and in the future , may require extensions to satisfy the needs of these trends .	This will bring some convenience into modeling the observations and experiments and make it easier to distinguish different contributions in measurements .	As the first step , the global solar system reference system is multipolarly expanded and the post-Newtonian mass and spin moments are shown explicitly in the metric which describes the coordinates of the system .
2	It is often referred as { \it importance sampling } in statistical inference and is also closely related to the problem of { \it covariate shift } in transfer learning as well as to various MCMC methods .	In this paper we address the problem of estimating the ratio $ \frac { q } { p } $ where $ p $ is a density function and $ q $ is another density , or , more generally an arbitrary function .	Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various problems of inference and integration , in particular , when one needs to average a function with respect to one probability distribution , given a sample from another .	It may also be useful for separating the underlying geometry of a space , say a manifold , from the density function defined on it .	Our approach is based on reformulating the problem of estimating $ \frac { q } { p } $ as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator corresponding to a kernel , and thus reducing it to an integral equation , known as the Fredholm problem of the first kind .
3	The quantization of the two conductivities are robust under various perturbations such as the potential disorder , the Zeeman field , and the spin-orbit scatterings .	We study theoretically the two-dimensional topological electric state in a single band semiconductor with strong spin-orbit interactions under harmonic scalar electrostatic potentials .	The electronic states described by the spin Landau levels are insulating in the bulk and host gapless edge states in the presence of time-reversal symmetry .	Such topological states show the properties of the quantized electric conductivity and the quantized spin Hall conductivity characterized by the spin Chern number $ \mathbb { Z } $ .	Existing semiconductor technologies would realize the topological states discussed in the present paper .
0	We analyze the collisional excitation of the 158 micron ( 1900.5 GHz ) fine structure transition of ionized carbon ( C+ ) in terms of line intensities produced by simple cloud models .	The single C+ fine structure transition is a very important coolant of the atomic interstellar medium and of photon dominated regions in which carbon is partially or completely in ionized form .	The [ CII ] line is widely used as a tracer of star formation in the Milky Way and other galaxies .	Excitation of the [ CII ] fine structure transition can be via collisions with hydrogen molecules , atoms , and electrons .	Velocity-resolved observations of [ CII ] have become possible with the HIFI instrument on Herschel and the GREAT instrument on SOFIA .
2	Our solution extends previous work , which with few exceptions has been restricted to a one-dimensional treatment of the radiation field .	In this series of papers we study the structure of the atomic to molecular transition in the giant atomic-molecular complexes that are the repositories of most molecular gas in galaxies , with the ultimate goal of attaining a better understanding of what determines galaxies ' molecular content .	Here we derive an approximate analytic solution for the structure of a photodissociation region ( PDR ) in a cloud of finite size that is bathed in an external dissociating radiation field .	We show that our analytic results compare favorably to exact numerical calculations in the one-dimensional limit .	However , our more general geometry provides a more realistic representation than a semi-infinite slab for atomic-molecular complexes exposed to the interstellar radiation field , particularly in environments such as low-metallicity dwarf galaxies where the curvature and finite size of the atomic envelope can not be neglected .
4	The FBST - Full Bayesian Significance Test - is the cornerstone of a set of statistical tolls conceived to assess the epistemic value of such eigen-solutions , according to their four essential attributes , namely , sharpness , stability , separability and composability .	This book presents our case in defense of a constructivist epistemological framework and the use of compatible statistical theory and inference tools .	The basic metaphor of decision theory is the maximization of a gambler 's expected fortune , according to his own subjective utility , prior beliefs an learned experiences .	This metaphor has proven to be very useful , leading the development of Bayesian statistics since its XX-th century revival , rooted on the work of de Finetti , Savage and others .	The basic metaphor presented in this text , as a foundation for cognitive constructivism , is that of an eigen-solution , and the verification of its objective epistemic status .
0	We investigate the practice of assigning high spin temperatures to damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems ( DLAs ) not detected in HI 21-cm absorption .	In particular , Kanekar & amp ; Chengaulr ( 2003 ) have attributed the mix of 21-cm detections and non-detections in low redshift ( z & lt ; 2.04 ) DLAs to a mix of spin temperatures , while the non-detections at high redshift were attributed to high spin temperatures .	Below z=0.9 , where some of the DLA host galaxy morphologies are known , we find that 21-cm absorption is normally detected towards large radio sources when the absorber is known to be associated with a large intermediate ( spiral ) galaxy .	Furthermore , at these redshifts , only one of the six 21-cm non-detections has an optical identification and these DLAs tend to lie along the sight-lines to the largest background radio continuum sources .	For these and many of the high redshift DLAs occulting large radio continua , we therefore expect covering factors of less than the assumed/estimated value of unity .
1	We give the spectral analysis of a quasi-cyclic product code in terms of the spectral analysis of the row- and the column-code .	This paper considers a linear quasi-cyclic product code of two given quasi-cyclic codes of relatively prime lengths over finite fields .	Moreover , we provide a new lower bound on the minimum Hamming distance of a given quasi-cyclic code and present a new algebraic decoding algorithm.More specifically , we prove an explicit ( unreduced ) basis of an l\_a l\_b-quasi-cyclic product code in terms of the generator matrix in reduced Gr { \ '' o } bner basis with respect to the position-over-term order ( RGB/POT ) form of the l\_a-quasi-cyclic row- and the l\_b-quasi-cyclic column-code , respectively .	This generalizes the work of Burton and Weldon for the generator polynomial of a cyclic product code ( where l\_a =l\_b=1 ) .	Furthermore , we derive the generator matrix in Pre-RGB/POT form of an l\_a l\_b-quasi-cyclic product code for two special cases : ( i ) for l\_a=2 and l\_b=1 , and ( ii ) if the row-code is a 1-level l\_a-quasi-cyclic code ( for arbitrary l\_a ) and l\_b=1.For arbitrary l\_a and l\_b , the Pre-RGB/POT form of the generator matrix of an l\_a l\_b-quasi-cyclic product code is conjectured.The spectral analysis is applied to the generator matrix of the product of an l-quasi-cyclic and a cyclic code , and we propose a new lower bound on the minimum Hamming distance of a given l-quasi-cyclic code .
1	Under the fluid approximation in the linear theory , we first derive full perturbation equations in flat space with a cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ .	We investigate matter density perturbations in models of structure formation with or without causal/acausal source .	We then use Green-function technique to obtain analytic solutions for matter perturbations in a flat $ \Lambda=0 $ model .	Some incorrect solutions in the literature are corrected here .	A simple yet accurate extrapolation scheme is then proposed to obtain solutions in curved or $ \Lambda\neq 0 $ cosmologies .
4	This strictly includes Moore-Russell 's result on the hypercube .	We study continuous-time quantum walks on graphs which generalize the hypercube .	The only known family of graphs whose quantum walk instantaneously mixes to uniform is the Hamming graphs with small arities .	We show that quantum uniform mixing on the hypercube is robust under the addition of perfect matchings but not much else .	Our specific results include : ( 1 ) The graph obtained by augmenting the hypercube with an additive matching is instantaneous uniform mixing whenever the parity of the matching is even , but with a slower mixing time .
2	We study this phenomenon using two different approaches .	Spontaneous stratification of granular mixtures has been reported by Makse et al .	[ Nature 386 , 379 ( 1997 ) ] when a mixture of grains differing in size and shape is poured in a quasi-two-dimensional heap .	First , we introduce a cellular automaton model that illustrates clearly the physical mechanism ; the model displays stratification whenever the large grains are rougher than the small grains , in agreement with the experiments .	Moreover , the dynamics are close to those of the experiments , where the layers are built through a `` kink '' at which the rolling grains are stopped .
0	We study propagation of waves and appearance of caustics in k-essence and galileon theories .	First we show that previously known solutions for travelling waves in k-essence and galileon models correspond to very specific fine-tuned initial conditions .	On the contrary , as we demonstrate by the method of characteristics , generic initial conditions leads to a wave in k-essence which ends up with formation of caustics .	Finally , we find that any wave solution in pure k-essence is also a solution for a galileon theory with the same k-essence term .	Thus in the Horndeski theory with a k-essence term formation of caustics is generic .
0	At this point it is still unclear whether pentaquarks exist .	While they have be seen in some experiments there are many experiments in which they are not found .	On the assumption that pentaquarks exist , several authors have studied the properties of pentaquarks .	One description considered is that of pentaquarks which consist of a diquark coupled to a triquark .	There is a quite extensive literature concerning the properties of diquarks and their importance in the description of the nucleon has been considered by several authors .
4	The CO line profiles of BP Psc are well fit by a model invoking a disk in Keplerian rotation .	BP Psc is a puzzling late-type , emission-line field star with large infrared excess .	The star is encircled and enshrouded by a nearly edge-on , dust circumstellar disk , and displays an extensive jet system similar to those associated with pre-main sequence ( pre-MS ) stars .	We conducted a mm-wave molecular line survey of BP Psc with the 30 m telescope of the Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimetrique ( IRAM ) .	We detected lines of 12CO and 13CO and , possibly , very weak emission from HCO+ and CN ; HCN , H2CO , and SiO are not detected .
3	We study the problem in the online setting , both with and without resource augmentation , and in the offline setting .	In this paper , we revisit the classic problem of run generation .	Run generation is the first phase of external-memory sorting , where the objective is to scan through the data , reorder elements using a small buffer of size M , and output runs ( contiguously sorted chunks of elements ) that are as long as possible .	We develop algorithms for minimizing the total number of runs ( or equivalently , maximizing the average run length ) when the runs are allowed to be sorted or reverse sorted .	( 1 ) We analyze alternating-up-down replacement selection ( runs alternate between sorted and reverse sorted ) , which was studied by Knuth as far back as 1963 .
4	In this letter we reanalyze the data and we find a ratio R=0.903 +-0.01 ( stat .	The RENO experiment recently reported the disappearance of reactor electron antineutrinos consistent with neutrino oscillations , with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations .	The published ratio of observed to expected number of antineutrinos in the far detector is R=0.920 +-0.009 ( stat. ) +-0.014 ( syst . )	and corresponds to sin^2 2theta13 = 0.113 +-0.013 ( stat . )	+-0.019 ( syst ) , using a rate-only analysis .
1	Two approaches are made for comparison .	A next-to-leading log calculation of the reactions $ pp $ and $ p\overline { p } \rightarrow W^\pm\gamma X $ is presented including a tri-boson gauge coupling from non-Standard Model contributions .	The first approach considers the tri-boson $ WW\gamma $ coupling as being uniquely fixed by tree level unitarity at high energies to its Standard Model form and , consequently , suppresses the non-Standard Model contributions with form factors .	The second approach is to ignore such considerations and calculate the contributions to non-Standard Model tri-boson gauge couplings without such suppressions .	It is found that at Tevatron energies , the two approaches do not differ much in quantitative results , while at Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) energies the two approaches give significantly different predictions for production rates .
3	This is an algebro-geometric analogue of Matsushima 's theorem regarding the existence of constant scalar curvature K\ '' ahler metrics .	We study the K-stability of a polarised variety with non-reductive automorphism group .	We associate a canonical filtration of the co-ordinate ring to each variety of this kind , which destabilises the variety in several examples which we compute .	We conjecture this holds in general .	As an application , we give an example of an orbifold del Pezzo surface without a K\ '' ahler-Einstein metric .
4	In addition , we point out that a similar attempt of embedding Christodoulou 's well-known solutions for massless scalar fields fails to capture formation of naked singularities in 4+1 dimensions , due to a diverging Kretschmann scalar in the initial data .	The vacuum Einstein equations in 5+1 dimensions are shown to admit solutions describing naked singularity formation in gravitational collapse from nonsingular asymptotically locally flat initial data .	We present a class of specific examples with spherical extra dimensions .	Thanks to the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction , these spacetimes are constructed by lifting continuously self-similar solutions of the 4-dimensional Einstein-scalar field system with a negative exponential potential .	Their existence provides a new test-bed for weak cosmic censorship in higher-dimensional gravity .
2	It is theoretically obtained that the ratio depends linearly on the local slope angle of the wall surface , and an explicit analogy expression is presented for circular cylinders , although the linear distribution is also found for other nose shapes and even in gas flows with chemical reactions .	In this paper , the relation between skin friction and heat transfer along windward sides of blunt-nosed bodies in hypersonic flows is investigated .	The self-similar boundary layer analysis is accepted to figure out the distribution of the ratio of skin friction to heat transfer coefficients along the wall .	Furthermore , based on the theoretical modelling of the second order shear and heat transfer terms in Burnett equations , a modified analogy is derived in the near continuum regime by considering the rarefied gas effects .	And a bridge function is also constructed to describe the nonlinear analogy in the transition flow regime .
4	The proposed $ SFSFS $ nanostructure is discussed within the context of a superconducting magnetic torque transistor .	Utilizing a full microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes ( BdG ) approach , we study the equilibrium charge and spin currents in ballistic $ SFSFS $ Josephson systems , where $ F $ is a uniformly magnetized ferromagnet and $ S $ is a conventional $ s $ -wave superconductor .	From the spatially varying spin currents , we also calculate the associated equilibrium spin transfer torques .	Through variations in the relative phase differences between the three $ S $ regions , and magnetization orientations of the ferromagnets , our study demonstrates tunability and controllability of the spin and charge supercurrents .	The spin transfer torques are shown to reveal details of the proximity effects that play a crucial role in these types of hybrid systems .
1	Extensive observations reveal fairly tight power laws of $ M_ { \rm BH } $ versus the mean stellar velocity dispersion $ \sigma $ of the host bulge .	Growing evidence indicate supermassive black holes ( SMBHs ) in the mass range of $ M_ { \rm BH } $ $ \sim 10^6-10^ { 10 } M_ { \odot } $ lurking in central bulges of many galaxies .	The dynamic evolution of a bulge and the formation of a central SMBH should be physically linked by various observational clues .	In this contribution , we reproduce the empirical $ M_ { \rm BH } -\sigma $ power laws based on a self-similar general polytropic quasi-static bulge evolution and a sensible criterion of forming a SMBH surrounding the central density singularity of a general singular polytropic sphere ( SPS ) \cite { loujiang2008 } .	Other properties of host bulges and central SMBHs are also examined .
4	For the region centered on $ \omega $ ~Cen ( 37 deg^2 ) , covering about three tidal radii , we also discuss the detected stellar density radial profile and angular distribution , leading to the identification of extratidal cluster stars .	STREGA ( STRucture and Evolution of the GAlaxy ) is a Guaranteed Time survey being performed at the VST ( the ESO VLT Survey Telescope ) to map about 150 square degrees in the Galactic halo , in order to constrain the mechanisms of galactic formation and evolution .	The survey is built as a five-year project , organized in two parts : a core program to explore the surrounding regions of selected stellar systems and a second complementary part to map the southern portion of the Fornax orbit and extend the observations of the core program .	The adopted stellar tracers are mainly variable stars ( RR~Lyraes and Long Period Variables ) and Main Sequence Turn-off stars for which observations in the g , r , i bands are obtained .	We present an overview of the survey and some preliminary results for three observing runs that have been completed .
3	A long-wavelength instability takes place and leads to the formation of two thin current layers .	The response of the solar coronal magnetic field to small-scale photospheric boundary motions including the possible formation of current sheets via the Parker scenario is one of open questions of solar physics .	Here we address the problem via a numerical simulation .	The three-dimensional evolution of a braided magnetic field which is initially close to a force-free state is followed using a resistive MHD code .	Magnetic reconnection occurs across the current sheets with three-dimensional features shown , including an elliptic magnetic field structure about the reconnection site , and results in an untwisting of the global field structure .
3	It is found that the low-lying peak is dominantly explained by the 8^Be+n component .	We study the character of the first excited 1/2^ { + } state of { 9 } ^Be , which is observed as a low-lying sharp peak in the cross section of 9^Be ( { \gamma } , n ) 2 { \alpha } just above the { 8 } ^Be+n threshold .	Using the { \alpha } + { \alpha } +n three-body model , we describe the ground and excited unbound states of { 9 } ^Be above the { \alpha } + { \alpha } +n threshold .	Applying the complex scaling method to the three-body model , we find no 1/2^ { + } resonant solutions , while the low-lying peak in the photodisintegration cross section is reproduced in the present calculation .	Furthermore , using the analytical continuation of the coupling constant of the three-body interaction for the { \alpha } + { \alpha } +n system , we discuss the virtual-state character of the 1/2^ { + } state .
0	One of the aspects currently holding back commercial scale deployment of carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) is an accurate understanding of the thermodynamic behaviour of carbon dioxide and relevant impurities during the pipeline transport stage .	In this article we develop a general framework for deriving pressure-explicit EoS for impure CO2 .	This flexible framework facilitates ongoing development of custom EoS in response to new data and computational applications .	We use our method to generalise a recent EoS for pure CO2 [ Demetriades et al .	Proc IMechE Part E , 227 ( 2013 ) pp .
1	It is not only common practice in Astrophysics , but also wisdom , to try to make as simple models as possible to simulate physical systems .	The dust in galaxies makes radiation transport calculations in them absolutely necessary .	For spiral galaxies , however , this turned out to be catastrophic .	For years , the major question of the opacity of spiral galaxies kept the community divided , because the models were too simple .	A spiral galaxy appears , to first order , to have exponential distributions of stars and dust , which can not be approximated with uniform distributions .
1	The nuclear EDM is screened by atomic electrons .	Parity and time invariance violating ( $ P , T $ -odd ) atomic electric dipole moments ( EDM ) are induced by interaction between atomic electrons and nuclear $ P , T $ -odd moments which are produced by $ P , T $ -odd nuclear forces .	The EDM of a non-relativistic atom with closed electron subshells is induced by the nuclear Schiff moment .	For heavy relativistic atoms EDM is induced by the nuclear local dipole moments which differ by 10-50 % from the Schiff moments calculated previously .	We calculate the local dipole moments for $ { ^ { 199 } { \rm Hg } } $ and $ { ^ { 205 } { \rm Tl } } $ where the most accurate atomic and molecular EDM measurements have been performed .
3	We generalize this to any invertible measure preserving transformation $ T $ on a finite measure space $ X $ , by proving independently , and nearly trivially that for any measurable $ E\subseteq X $ one has $ \int_E n_E d\mu=\mu ( I_E ) $ , where $ I_E $ is the smallest invariant set containing $ E $ .	Let $ X $ be a measure space and $ T : X\to X $ a measurable transformation .	For any measurable $ E\subseteq X $ and $ x\in E $ , the possibly infinite return time is $ n_E ( x ) : =\inf\ { n & gt ; 0 : T^n x\in E\ } $ .	If $ T $ is an ergodic tranformation of the probability space $ X $ , and $ \mu ( E ) & gt ; 0 $ , then a theorem of M. Kac states that $ \int_E n_E d\mu=1 $ .	In particular this also provides a simpler proof of Poincar\ ' { e } 's recurrence theorem .
1	The FUV flux level from the highest state to the lowest state declines by a factor of 28 .	The prototype nova-like variable VY Sculptoris was observed by the IUE during four different optical brightness states of the system .	We have carried out model accretion disk and white dwarf atmosphere fitting to the spectra .	The corresponding accretion rates range from $ \dot { M } = 8 \times 10^ { -9 } $ M $ _ { \sun } $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ at the highest FUV flux level down to $ \dot { M } = 1.9\times 10^ { -10 } $ M $ _ { \sun } $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ at the lowest flux level .	We report tentative evidence for the detection of the underlying white dwarf with $ T_ { \rm eff } = 45,000 $ K in the spectrum with the lowest flux level .
3	The system progressively collects examples by selecting those with greatest utility .	This paper proposes an efficient example selection method for example-based word sense disambiguation systems .	To construct a practical size database , a considerable overhead for manual sense disambiguation is required .	Our method is characterized by the reliance on the notion of the training utility : the degree to which each example is informative for future example selection when used for the training of the system .	The paper reports the effectivity of our method through experiments on about one thousand sentences .
3	We illustrate our ideas by performing model calculations of several LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 surfaces .	We analyze the electrostatic stability of insulating surfaces in the framework of the bulk modern theory of polarization .	We show that heuristic arguments based on a fully ionic limit find formal justification at the microscopic level , even in solids where the bonding has a mixed ionic/covalent character .	Based on these arguments , we propose simple criteria to construct arbitrary non-polar terminations of a given bulk crystal .	We find , in the case of ideal LaAlO3 surfaces , that cleavage along a higher-index ( n10 ) direction is energetically favorable compared to the polar ( 100 ) orientation .
1	In total , 163 of the 323 sources are detected .	We investigate the X-ray properties of the Parkes sample of flat-spectrum radio sources using data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and archival pointed PSPC observations .	For the remaining 160 sources 2 sigma upper limits to the X-ray flux are derived .	We present power-law photon indices for 115 sources , which were either determined with a hardness ratio technique or from direct fits to pointed PSPC data .	For quasars , the soft X-ray photon index is correlated with redshift and with radio spectral index.Webster et al .
4	Due to the proximity of the 18 micron absorption feature to the edge of our covered spectral range , and associated uncertainty about the shape of the quasar continuum normalization near 18 micron , we do not independently fit this feature .	We report the detection of interstellar silicate dust in the z_abs=0.685 absorber along the sightline toward the gravitationally lensed blazar TXS 0218+357 .	Using Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph data we detect the 10 micron silicate absorption feature with a detection significance of 10.7-sigma .	We fit laboratory-derived silicate dust profile templates obtained from literature to the observed 10 micron absorption feature , and find that the best single-mineral fit is obtained using an amorphous olivine template with a measured peak optical depth of tau_10=0.49+/-0.02 , which rises to tau_10~0.67+/-0.04 if the covering factor is taken into account .	We also detected the 18 micron silicate absorption feature in our data with a & gt ; 3-sigma significance .
1	The structure constants f^ { ABCD } can be used to write down a maximally superconformal 3d theory that incorporates the expected degrees of freedom of multiple M2 branes , including the `` center-of-mass '' mode described by free scalar and fermion fields .	We construct the totally antisymmetric structure constants f^ { ABCD } of a 3-algebra with a Lorentzian bi-invariant metric starting from an arbitrary semi-simple Lie algebra .	The gauge field sector reduces to a three dimensional BF term , which underlies the gauge symmetry of the theory .	We comment on the issue of unitarity of the quantum theory , which is problematic , despite the fact that the specific form of the interactions prevent the ghost fields from running in the internal lines of any Feynman diagram .	Giving an expectation value to one of the scalar fields leads to the maximally supersymmetric 3d Yang-Mills Lagrangian with the addition of two U ( 1 ) multiplets , one of them ghost-like , which is decoupled at large g_YM .
3	We define a singleton as a single star which has never suffered close encounters with other stars or spent time within a binary system .	Most stars are formed in a cluster or association , where the number density of stars can be high .	This means that a large fraction of initially-single stars will undergo close encounters with other stars and/or exchange into binaries .	We describe how such close encounters and exchange encounters can affect the properties of a planetary system around a single star .	It may be that planetary systems similar to our own solar system can only survive around singletons .
0	We consider a many-body system of pseudo-spin-1/2 bosons with spin-orbit interactions , which couple the momentum and the internal pseudo-spin degree of freedom created by spatially varying laser fields .	The corresponding single- particle spectrum is generally anisotropic and contains two degenerate minima at finite momenta .	At low temperatures , the many-body system condenses into these minima generating a new type of entangled Bose-Einstein condensate .	We show that in the presence of weak density-density interactions the many-body ground state is characterized by a twofold degeneracy .	The corresponding many-body wave function describes a condensate of `` left- '' and `` right-moving '' bosons .
0	Resistive transition measurements are reported for Magnesium diboride strands with SiC dopants .	The SiC was added as 10 mol of SiC to 90 mol of binary magnesium diboride .	Three different SiC powders were used , the average particle sizes were 200 nm , 30 nm , and 15 nm .	The strands were heat treated for times ranging from 5 to 30 minutes at temperatures from 675 to 900 .	Strands with 200 nm size SiC additions had Hirr and Bc2 which maximized at 25.4 T and 29.7 T after heating at 800C for 30 minutes .
3	A transparency spectrum is obtained when a first order mode shifts across a higher order mode through precise pressure tuning .	Coupled-mode induced transparency is realized in a single microbubble whispering gallery mode resonator .	Using aerostatic tuning , we find that the pressure induced shifting rates are different for different radial order modes .	A finite element simulation considering both the strain and stress effects shows a GHz/bar difference and this is confirmed by experiments .	The resulting lineshapes are fitted with the theory .
4	Moreover , they indicate that the neutron losses are sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field .	It was pointed out recently that oscillation of the neutron $ n $ into mirror neutron $ n ' $ , a sterile twin of the neutron with exactly the same mass , could be a very fast process with the the baryon number violation , even faster than the neutron decay itself .	This process is sensitive to the magnetic fields and it could be observed by comparing the neutron lose rates in the UCN storage chambers for different magnetic backgrounds .	We calculate the probability of $ n-n ' $ oscillation in the case when a mirror magnetic field $ \vec { B } ' $ is non-zero and show that in this case it can be suppressed or resonantly enhanced by applying the ordinary magnetic field $ \vec { B } $ , depending on its strength and on its orientation with respect to $ \vec { B } ' $ .	The recent experimental data , under this hypothesis , still allow the $ n-n ' $ oscillation time order 1 s or even smaller .
2	It is shown that the complete basis includes two types of eigenstates .	We consider a hole-doped semiconductor with a sharp boundary and study the boundary spin accumulation in response to a charge current .	First , we solve exactly a single-particle quantum mechanics problem described by the isotropic Luttinger model in half-space and construct an orthonormal basis for the corresponding Hamiltonian .	The first class of states contains conventional incident and reflected waves , while the other class includes localized surface states .	Second , we consider a many-body system in the presence of a charge current flowing parallel to the boundary .
4	We find that if all neighbours take the average opinion s_m the system reaches complete consensus for any value of the confidence bound \epsilon .	In the consensus model of Sznajd , opinions are integers and a randomly chosen pair of neighbouring agents with the same opinion forces all their neighbours to share that opinion .	We propose a simple extension of the model to continuous opinions , based on the criterion of bounded confidence which is at the basis of other popular consensus models .	Here the opinion s is a real number between 0 and 1 , and a parameter \epsilon is introduced such that two agents are compatible if their opinions differ from each other by less than \epsilon .	If two neighbouring agents are compatible , they take the mean s_m of their opinions and try to impose this value to their neighbours .
4	We discuss more realistic constructions , in which the scalar baryon and its potential arise amongst the color-breaking minima of the MSSM , or in the supersymmetric neutrino seesaw mechanism .	We propose an alternative mechanism of baryogenesis in which a scalar baryon undergoes a percolating first-order phase transition in the early Universe .	The potential barrier that divides the phases contains explicit B and CP violation and the corresponding instanton that mediates decay is therefore asymmetric .	The nucleation and growth of these asymmetric bubbles dynamically generates baryons , which thermalize after percolation ; bubble collision dynamics can also add to the asymmetry yield .	We present an explicit toy model that undergoes bubble baryogenesis , and numerically study the evolution of the baryon asymmetry through bubble nucleation and growth , bubble collisions , and washout .
4	We find that more massive simulated clusters have a larger fraction of stars in the diffuse light than the less massive ones .	We study the properties of the diffuse light in galaxy clusters forming in a large hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the Lambda-CDM cosmology .	The simulation includes a model for radiative cooling , star formation in dense cold gas , and feedback by SN-II explosions .	We select clusters having mass M & gt ; 10^ ( 14 ) h^ ( -1 ) Msun and study the spatial distribution of their star particles .	While most stellar light is concentrated in gravitationally bound galaxies orbiting in the cluster potential , we find evidence for a substantial diffuse component , which may account for the extended halos of light observed around central cD galaxies .
3	In particular , this class of sequences may have non-zero means , be complexed valued and also includes non-analytical noise signals .	We derive the second-order sampling properties of certain autocovariance and autocorrelation estimators for sequences of independent and identically distributed samples .	Specifically , the estimators we consider are the classic lag windowed correlogram , the correlogram with subtracted sample mean , and the fixed-length summation correlogram .	For each correlogram we derive explicit formulas for the bias , covariance , mean square error and consistency for generalised higher-order white noise sequences .	We find that these commonly used correlograms exhibit lag dependent covariance despite the fact that these processes are white and hence by definition do not depend on lag .
3	The software package also covers the automatic image acquisition of the phase-stepping scanning with a flat panel detector .	X-ray phase-contrast imaging can provide greatly improved contrast over conventional absorption-based imaging for weakly absorbing samples , such as biological soft tissues and fibre composites .	In this manuscript , we introduce an easy and fast way to develop a user-friendly software platform dedicated to the new grating-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging setup recently built at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory of the University of Science and Technology of China .	Unified management and control of 21 motorized positioning stages , of an ultra-precision piezoelectric translation stage and of the X-ray tube are achieved with this platform .	Moreover , a data post-processing module for signals retrieval and other custom features are in principle available .
1	Here we show how to search a galaxy ( or 21-cm ) survey for the imprint of primordial scalar , vector , and tensor fields .	Many inflationary theories introduce new scalar , vector , or tensor degrees of freedom that may then affect the generation of primordial density perturbations .	These new fields induce local departures to an otherwise statistically isotropic two-point correlation function , or equivalently , nontrivial four-point correlation functions ( or trispectra , in Fourier space ) , that can be decomposed into scalar , vector , and tensor components .	We write down the optimal estimators for these various components and show how the sensitivity to these modes depends on the galaxy-survey parameters .	New probes of parity-violating early-Universe physics are also presented .
4	Also the bulk kinetic power in relativistic leptons is often smaller than the dissipated luminosity .	We estimate the power of relativistic , extragalactic jets by modelling the spectral energy distribution of a large number of blazars .	We adopt a simple one-zone , homogeneous , leptonic synchrotron and inverse Compton model , taking into account seed photons originating both locally in the jet and externally .	The blazars under study have an often dominant high energy component , which , if interpreted as due to inverse Compton radiation , limits the value of the magnetic field within the emission region .	As a consequence , the corresponding Poynting flux can not be energetically dominant .
0	Context .	One of the most striking discoveries of the INTEGRAL observatory is the existence of a previously unknown population of X-ray sources in the inner arms of the Galaxy .	The investigations of the optical/NIR counterparts of some of them have provided evidence that they are highly absorbed high mass X-ray binaries hosting supergiants.Aims .	We aim to identify the optical/NIR counterpart of one of the newly discovered INTEGRAL sources , IGR J16283-4838 , and determine the nature of this system.Methods .	We present optical and NIR observations of the field of IGR J16283-4838 , and use the astrometry and photometry of the sources within it to identify its counterpart .
4	However , shifting an eigenvalue with multiple multiplicities is a challenge issue and worthy of our investigation .	The eigenvalue shift technique is the most well-known and fundamental tool for matrix computations .	Applications include the search of eigeninformation , the acceleration of numerical algorithms , the study of Google 's PageRank .	The shift strategy arises from the concept investigated by Brauer [ 1 ] for changing the value of an eigenvalue of a matrix to the desired one , while keeping the remaining eigenvalues and the original eigenvectors unchanged .	The idea of shifting distinct eigenvalues can easily be generalized by Brauer 's idea .
1	Using DFT method we determine the local changes in the crystal structure due to Mn ions substitution for Ge and due to the presence in Ge_ { 1-x } Mn_ { x } Te of very high concentration of cation vacancies .	We theoretically analyze the influence of chemical disorder on magnetic anisotropy in Ge_ { 1-x } Mn_ { x } Te semiconductor layers known to exhibit carrier-induced ferromagnetism and ferroelectric distortion of rhombohedral crystal lattice .	We calculate the effect of this structural and chemical disorder on single ion magnetic anisotropy mechanism and show that its contribution is order of magnitude smaller as compared to magnetic anisotropy mechanism originating from the spin polarization induced by Mn ions into neighboring Te and Ge ions .	We also discuss magnetic anisotropy effects due to pairs of Mn ions differently allocated in the lattice .	The spatial averaging over chemical disorder strongly reduces the strength of this magnetic anisotropy mechanism and restores the global rhombohedral symmetry of magnetic system .
4	We derive novel unbiased estimators and efficient confidence bounds for subpopulation weight .	Summaries of massive data sets support approximate query processing over the original data .	A basic aggregate over a set of records is the weight of subpopulations specified as a predicate over records ' attributes .	Bottom-k sketches are a powerful summarization format of weighted items that includes priority sampling and the classic weighted sampling without replacement .	They can be computed efficiently for many representations of the data including distributed databases and data streams .
4	Both results suggest that the oleic acid molecules covalently bonded to the nanoparticle surface yield a strong reduction in the surface spin disorder .	Monodisperse magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles of controlled size within 6 and 20 nm in diameter were synthesized by thermal decomposition of an iron organic precursor in an organic medium .	Particles were coated with oleic acid .	For all samples studied , saturation magnetization Ms reaches the expected value for bulk magnetite , in contrast to results in small particle systems for which Ms is usually much smaller due to surface spin disorder .	The coercive field for the 6 nm particles is also similar to that of bulk magnetite .
1	With p+-type porous silicon formed on highly boron doped ( 100 ) Si single crystal , we can make identical porous layers , either supported by or detached from the substrate .	The experimental results presented in this paper show the influence of the elastic deformation of porous solids on the adsorption process .	The pores are perpendicular to the substrate .	The adsorption isotherms corresponding to these two layers are distinct .	In the region preceding capillary condensation , the adsorbed amount is lower for the membrane than for the supported layer and the hysteresis loop is observed at higher pressure .
1	Specifically , we propose a preliminary data filtering , separated from the frequency stability computation .	In this paper we propose a simple method to reject the high-frequency noise in the evaluation of statistical uncertainty of coherent optical fiber links .	In this way , it is possible to use the Allan deviation as estimator of stability , to get unbiased data , which are representative of the noise process affecting the delivered signal .	Our approach is alternative to the use of the modified Allan deviation , which is largely adopted in this field .	We apply this processing to the experimental data we obtained on a 1284 km coherent optical link for frequency dissemination , which we realized in Italy .
1	Let $ Z [ M ] ^W $ and $ S^* ( M ) ^W $ be the $ W $ -invariant subrings of the integral group ring $ Z [ M ] $ and the symmetric algebra $ S^* ( M ) $ respectively .	Consider a crystallographic root system together with its Weyl group $ W $ acting on the weight lattice $ M $ .	A celebrated theorem of Chevalley says that $ Z [ M ] ^W $ is a polynomial ring over $ Z $ in classes of fundamental representations $ w_1 , ... , w_n $ and $ S^* ( M ) ^ { W } $ over rational numbers is a polynomial ring in basic polynomial invariants $ q_1 , ... , q_n $ , where $ n $ is the rank .	In the present paper we establish and investigate the relationship between $ w_i $ 's and $ q_i $ 's over the integers .	As an application we provide an annihilator of the torsion part of the 3rd and the 4th quotients of the Grothendieck gamma-filtration on the variety of Borel subgroups of the associated linear algebraic group .
1	One important example is given by calibration estimation , that seeks for new weights that are close ( in some sense ) to the basic design weights and that , at the same time , match benchmark constraints on available auxiliary information .	Survey statisticians make use of the available auxiliary information to improve estimates .	Recently , multiple frame surveys have gained much attention and became largely used by statistical agencies and private organizations to decrease sampling costs or to reduce frame undercoverage errors that could occur with the use of only a single sampling frame .	Much attention has been devoted to the introduction of different ways of combining estimates coming from the different frames .	We will extend the calibration paradigm , developed so far for one frame surveys , to the estimation of the total of a variable of interest in dual frame surveys as a general tool to include auxiliary information , also available at different levels .
1	A filtration of the object to be studied is the heart of both subjects persistent homology and spectral sequences .	By general case we mean methods able to process simplicial sets and chain complexes not of finite type .	In this paper we present the complete relation between them , both from theoretical and computational points of view .	One of the main contributions of this paper is the observation that a slight modification of our previous programs computing spectral sequences is enough to compute also persistent homology .	By inheritance from our spectral sequence programs , we obtain for free persistent homology programs applicable to spaces not of finite type ( provided they are spaces with effective homology ) and with Z-coefficients ( significantly generalizing the usual presentation of persistent homology over a field ) .
3	In particular , crystal shape may be a source of additional uniaxial magnetic anisotropy which removes degeneracy of antiferromagnetic vector or artificial 4th order anisotropy in the case of a square cross-section sample .	It is of common knowledge that the direction of easy axis in the finite-size ferromagnetic sample is controlled by its shape .	In the present paper we show that a similar phenomenon should be observed in the compensated antiferromagnets with strong magnetoelastic coupling .	Destressing energy which originates from the long-range magnetoelastic forces is analogous to demagnetization energy in ferromagnetic materials and is responsible for the formation of equilibrium domain structure and anisotropy of macroscopic magnetic properties .	In a special case of antiferromagnetic nanopillars shape-induced anisotropy can be substantially enhanced due to lattice mismatch with the substrate .
2	It is found that the $ ^3 $ H $ / $ $ ^3 $ He ratio is sensitive to the nuclear symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities .	Within the newly updated version of the Ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( UrQMD ) model in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced , the yield ratio between $ ^3 $ H and $ ^3 $ He clusters emitted from central $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca+ $ ^ { 40 } $ Ca , $ ^ { 96 } $ Zr+ $ ^ { 96 } $ Zr , $ ^ { 96 } $ Ru+ $ ^ { 96 } $ Ru , and $ ^ { 197 } $ Au+ $ ^ { 197 } $ Au collisions in the beam energy range from 0.12 to 1 GeV $ / $ nucleon is studied .	The recent FOPI data for the $ ^3 $ H $ / $ $ ^3 $ He ratio are compared with UrQMD calculations using 13 Skyrme interactions ( all exhibiting similar values of iso-scalar incompressibility but very different density dependences of the symmetry energy ) .	Model calculations with moderately soft to linear symmetry energies are in agreement with the experimental FOPI data .	This result is in line with both , the recent constraints on the low-density symmetry energy available in the literature and our previous results for the high-density symmetry energy obtained with the elliptic flow of free nucleons and hydrogen isotopes as a sensitive probe .
1	This pulsar is located in the 8 degree diameter Vela supernova remnant , which contains several regions of non-thermal emission detected in the radio , X-ray and gamma-ray bands .	We report on gamma-ray observations in the off-pulse window of the Vela pulsar PSR B0833-45 , using 11 months of survey data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) .	The gamma-ray emission detected by the LAT lies within one of these regions , the 2*3 degrees area south of the pulsar known as Vela-X .	The LAT flux is signicantly spatially extended with a best-fit radius of 0.88 +/- 0.12 degrees for an assumed radially symmetric uniform disk .	The 200 MeV to 20 GeV LAT spectrum of this source is well described by a power-law with a spectral index of 2.41 +/- 0.09 +/- 0.15 and integral flux above 100 MeV of ( 4.73 +/- 0.63 +/- 1.32 ) * 10^ { -7 } cm^ { -2 } s^ { -1 } .
2	A detailed discussion of warps and other bending waves is also given .	This chapter reviews theoretical work on the stellar dynamics of galaxy disks .	All the known collective global instabilities are identified , and their mechanisms described in terms of local wave mechanics .	The structure of bars in galaxies , and their effect on galaxy evolution , is now reasonably well understood , but there is still no convincing explanation for their origin and frequency .	Spiral patterns have long presented a special challenge , and ideas and recent developments are reviewed .
1	We include latest results from the MINOS long-baseline experiment ( including electron neutrino appearance as well as anti-neutrino data ) , updating all relevant solar ( SK II+III ) , atmospheric ( SK I+II+III ) and reactor ( KamLAND ) data .	We present the results of a global neutrino oscillation data analysis within the three-flavour framework .	Furthermore , we include a recent re-calculation of the anti-neutrino fluxes emitted from nuclear reactors .	These results have important consequences for the analysis of reactor experiments and in particular for the status of the mixing angle $ \theta_ { 13 } $ .	In our recommended default analysis we find from the global fit that the hint for non-zero $ \theta_ { 13 } $ remains weak , at 1.8 $ \sigma $ for both neutrino mass hierarchy schemes .
2	In this paper , we explore the prospects of using the Lyman-alpha forest to constrain w , using semi-analytical techniques to model the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) .	In quintessence models , the dark energy content of the universe is described by a slowly rolling scalar field whose pressure and energy density obey an equation of state of the form p=w $ \rho $ ; w is in general a function of time such that w & lt ; -1/3 , in order to drive the observed acceleration of the Universe today .	The cosmological constant model LCDM corresponds to the limiting case w=-1 .	A different value of w changes both the growth factor and the Hubble parameter as a function of time .	The resulting change in the optical depth distribution affects the optical depth power spectrum , the number of regions of high transmission per unit redshift and the cross-correlation coefficient of spectra of quasar pairs .
3	We also find that the geometry of the Calabi-Yau fourfold restricts the heterotic vector bundle data in a manner related to the stability of these bundles .	We study , as hypersurfaces in toric varieties , elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds for F-theory compactifications dual to E8xE8 heterotic strings compactified to four dimensions on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds with some choice of vector bundle .	We describe how to read off the vector bundle data for the heterotic compactification from the toric data of the fourfold .	This map allows us to construct , for example , Calabi-Yau fourfolds corresponding to three generation models with unbroken GUT groups .	Finally , we study Calabi-Yau fourfolds corresponding to heterotic models with fivebranes wrapping curves in the base of the Calabi-Yau threefolds .
0	It is shown that the Hubble constant can be derived from the standard luminosity function of galaxies as well as from a new luminosity function as deduced from the mass-luminosity relationship for galaxies .	An analytical expression for the Hubble constant can be found from the maximum number of galaxies ( in a given solid angle and flux ) as a function of the redshift .	A second analytical definition of the Hubble constant can be found from the redshift averaged over a given solid angle and flux .	The analysis of two luminosity functions for galaxies brings to four the new definitions of the Hubble constant .	The equation that regulates the Malmquist bias for galaxies is derived and as a consequence it is possible to extract a complete sample .
0	Some techniques for the study of intermittency by means of wavelet transforms , are presented on an example of synthetic turbulent signal .	Several features of the turbulent field , that can not be probed looking at standard structure function scaling , become accessible in this way .	The concept of a directly measurable intermittency scale , distinct from the scale of the fluctuations , is introduced .	A method for optimizing the analyzing wavelets , which exploits this concept , and allows to minimize non-local contributions in scale to wavelet correlations , is described .	The transition from a wavelet to a Fourier transform based description of an intermittent random field , and the possibility of using Fourier correlations to measure intermittency are discussed .
1	Both types of structures contain narrow SrTiO3 quantum wells , which accommodate a confined , high-density electron gas .	The electrical and structural characteristics of SmTiO3/SrTiO3/SmTiO3 and GdTiO3/SrTiO3/GdTiO3 heterostructures are compared .	As shown previously [ Phys.Rev .	B 86 , 201102 ( R ) ( 2012 ) ] SrTiO3 quantum wells embedded in GdTiO3 show a metal-to-insulator transition when their thickness is reduced so that they contain only two SrO layers .	In contrast , quantum wells embedded in SmTiO3 remain metallic down to a single SrO layer thickness .
1	It is shown that the surface is rational over $ \mathbb { Q } $ when $ n\le 5 $ and is of general type for $ n=6 $ .	The surface corresponding to the moduli space of quadratic endomorphisms of $ \mathbb { P } ^1 $ with a marked periodic point of order $ n $ is studied .	An explicit description of the $ n=6 $ surface lets us find several infinite families of quadratic endomorphisms $ f : \mathbb { P } ^1 \to \mathbb { P } ^1 $ defined over $ \mathbb { Q } $ with a rational periodic point of order $ 6 $ .	In one of these families , $ f $ also has a rational fixed point , for a total of at least $ 7 $ periodic and $ 7 $ preperiodic points .	This is in contrast with the polynomial case , where it is conjectured that no polynomial endomorphism defined over $ \mathbb { Q } $ admits rational periodic points of order $ n & gt ; 3 $ .
0	Deterministic transfer of two-dimensional crystals constitutes a crucial step towards the fabrication of heterostructures based on artificial stacking of two-dimensional materials .	Moreover , control on the positioning of two-dimensional crystals facilitates their integration in complex devices , which enables the exploration of novel applications and the discovery of new phenomena in these materials .	Up to date , deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacrificial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent .	Here , we develop an all-dry transfer method that relies on viscoelastic stamps and does not employ any wet chemistry step .	This is found very advantageous to freely suspend these materials as there are no capillary forces involved in the process .
4	The observed variation of \alpha with applied current is a crossover phenomenon .	Current-voltage measurements of type-II superconductors are described by a coarse-grained model of superconducting vortex dynamics .	We find that the power spectra of the voltage fluctuations , and the noise power , are related to the large scale morphology of the plastic flux flow .	At currents corresponding to the peak in differential resistance , the flux flow forms a braided river , the noise power is maximal , and the power spectra has a 1/f^ { \alpha } form with \alpha \approx 1.8 over a wide frequency range .	This agrees with recent experiments on NbSe_2 .
3	When translational symmetry is broken by an external perturbation we find an abrupt increase of the conductance through those channels .	Coherent electronic transport through individual molecules is crucially sensitive to quantum interference .	Using exact diagonalization techniques , we investigate the zero-bias and zero-temperature conductance through $ \pi $ -conjugated annulene molecules ( modeled by the Pariser-Parr-Pople and Hubbard Hamiltonians ) weakly coupled to two leads .	We analyze the conductance for different source-drain configurations , finding an important reduction for certain transmission channels and for particular geometries as a consequence of destructive quantum interference between states with definite momenta .	Previous studies concentrated on the effect at the Fermi energy , where this effect is very small .
0	We investigated the emission of K $ \alpha $ iron line from the massive molecular clouds in the Galactic center ( GC ) .	We assume that at present the total flux of this emission consists of time variable component generated by primary X-ray photons ejected by Sagittarius A $ ^\ast $ ( Sgr A $ ^\ast $ ) in the past and a relatively weak quasi-stationary component excited by impact of protons which were generated by star accretion onto the central black hole .	The level of background emission was estimated from a rise of the 6.4 keV line intensity in the direction of several molecular clouds , that we interpreted as a stage when the X-ray front ejected by Sgr A $ ^\ast $ entered into these clouds .	The 6.4 keV emission before this intensity jump we interpreted as emission generated by subrelativistic cosmic rays there .	The cross-section of K $ \alpha $ vacancies produced by protons differs from that of electrons or X-rays .
4	We prove that $ End^0 ( J ( C ) ) $ is `` as small as possible '' if the Galois group of $ f $ over $ K $ is either the full symmetric group $ S_n $ or the alternating group $ A_n $ .	Suppose that $ K $ is a field of characteristic 0 , $ K_a $ is its algebraic closure , $ p $ is a prime , $ q=p^r $ is a power prime .	Suppose that $ f ( x ) \in K [ x ] $ is a polynomial of degree $ n & gt ; 4 $ without multiple roots .	Let us consider the superelliptic curve $ C : y^q=f ( x ) $ and its jacobian $ J ( C ) $ .	We study the endomorphism algebra $ End^0 ( J ( C ) ) $ of all $ K_a $ -endomorphisms of $ J ( C ) $ .
0	We show that , for a stationary version of Hammersley 's process , with Poisson `` sources '' on the positive x-axis , and Poisson `` sinks '' on the positive y-axis , an isolated second-class particle , located at the origin at time zero , moves asymptotically , with probability 1 , along the characteristic of a conservation equation for Hammersley 's process .	This allows us to show that Hammersley 's process without sinks or sources , as defined by Aldous and Diaconis [ Probab .	Theory Related Fields 10 ( 1995 ) 199-213 ] converges locally in distribution to a Poisson process , a result first proved in Aldous and Diaconis ( 1995 ) by using the ergodic decomposition theorem and a construction of Hammersley 's process as a one-dimensional point process , developing as a function of ( continuous ) time on the whole real line .	As a corollary we get the result that EL ( t , t ) /t converges to 2 , as t\to\infty , where L ( t , t ) is the length of a longest North-East path from ( 0,0 ) to ( t , t ) .	The proofs of these facts need neither the ergodic decomposition theorem nor the subadditive ergodic theorem .
2	This could be originated either by a single point-like source or to a directional excess from an extended Galactic region .	The IceCube evidence for cosmic neutrinos in the high-energy starting events ( HESE ) sample has inspired a large number of hypothesis on their origin , mainly due to the poor precision on the measurement of the direction of showering events .	The fact that most of HESE are downward going suggests a possible Galactic component .	These hypotheses are reviewed and constrained , using the present available upper limits from the ANTARES neutrino telescope .	ANTARES detects $ \nu_\mu $ from sources in the Southern sky with an effective area larger than that providing the IceCube HESE for $ E_\nu & lt ; 60 $ TeV and a factor of about two smaller at 1 PeV .
2	Then we show that the coefficients in the expansion of these toric Schur polynomials , in terms of the regular Schur polynomials , are exactly the 3-point Gromov-Witten invariants ; which are the structure constants of the quantum cohomology ring .	This article presents a formula for products of Schubert classes in the quantum cohomology ring of the Grassmannian .	We introduce a generalization of Schur symmetric polynomials for shapes that are naturally embedded in a torus .	This construction implies that the Gromov-Witten invariants of the Grassmannian are invariant with respect to the action of a twisted product of the groups S_3 , ( Z/nZ ) ^2 , and Z/2Z .	The last group gives a certain strange duality of the quantum cohomologythat inverts the quantum parameter q .
2	However , in any real application the channels for friendly users and passive eavesdroppers are not error free and Wyner 's wiretap model addresses this scenario .	In this paper we consider tandem error control coding and cryptography in the setting of the { \em wiretap channel } due to Wyner .	In a typical communications system a cryptographic application is run at a layer above the physical layer and assumes the channel is error free .	Using this model , we show the security of a common cryptographic primitive , i.e.a keystream generator based on linear feedback shift registers ( LFSR ) , can be strengthened by exploiting properties of the physical layer .	A passive eavesdropper can be made to experience greater difficulty in cracking an LFSR-based cryptographic system insomuch that the computational complexity of discovering the secret key increases by orders of magnitude , or is altogether infeasible .
1	The basic principle is to ignite a plasma using argon , and then to introduce a small additional nitrogen flow to achieve the nitridation of a Nb target .	We have carried out a detailed programme to explore the superconducting characteristics of reactive DC-magnetron sputtered NbN .	Subsequent sputtering leads to the deposition of NbN onto the host substrate .	The characteristics of a sputtered film depend on a number of parameters : argon pressure , nitrogen flow rate and time-evolution profile , substrate material , etc .	Crucially , the hysteresis in the target voltage as a function of the nitrogen flow can be used to provide a highly effective monitor of nitrogen consumption during the reactive process .
2	Because of that we reproduce the general qualitative properties of the velocity maps , but not the fine details .	We perform three-dimensional gas-dynamical simulations and show that the asymmetric morphology of the blue and red-shifted components of the outflow at hundreds of astronomical units ( AU ) from the massive binary system eta Carinae can be accounted for from the collision of the free primary stellar wind with the slowly expanding dense equatorial gas .	Owing to the very complicated structure of the century-old equatorial ejecta , that is not fully spatially resolved by observations , we limit ourselves to modelling the equatorial dense gas by one or two dense spherical clouds .	The fine details of the velocity maps can be matched by simply structuring the dense ejecta in an appropriate way .	The blue and red-shifted components are formed in the post-shock flow of the primary wind , on the two sides of the equatorial plane , respectively .
1	The electron states are described by a two-band Hamiltonian .	We study theoretically the effect of an electric field on the electron states and far-infrared optical properties in narrow-gap lead salt quantum wells .	An application of a strong electric field across the well allows the control of the energy gap between the two-dimensional ( 2D ) states in a wide range .	A sufficiently strong electric field transforms the narrow-gap quantum well to a nearly gapless 2D system , whose electron energy spectrum is described by linear dispersion relations \epsilon_ { \sigma } ( k ) ~\pm ( k-k_ { \sigma } ) , where k_ { \sigma } are the field-dependent 2D momenta corresponding to the minimum energy gaps for the states with spin numbers \sigma .	Due to the field-induced shift of the 2D subband extrema away from k=0 the density of states has inverse-square-root divergencies at the edges .
4	The CIR model can be readily incorporated into probabilistic models for sequence evolution .	We propose a continuous model for evolutionary rate variation across sites and over the tree and derive exact transition probabilities under this model .	Changes in rate are modelled using the CIR process , a diffusion widely used in financial applications .	The model directly extends the standard gamma distributed rates across site model , with one additional parameter governing changes in rate down the tree .	The parameters of the model can be estimated directly from two well-known statistics : the index of dispersion and the gamma shape parameter of the rates across sites model .
2	Here , no assumptions are made and any axisymmetric density distribution is possible .	We describe a practical method for constructing axisymmetric two-integral galaxy models ( with distribution functions of the form f ( E , L_z ) , in which E is the orbital energy , and L_z is the vertical component of the angular momentum ) , based on Schwarzschild 's orbit superposition method .	Other f ( E , L_z ) -methods are mostly based on solving the Jeans equations or on finding the distribution function directly from the density , which often places restrictions on the shape of the galaxy .	The observables are calculated ( semi- ) analytically , so that our method is faster than most previous , fully numerical implementations .	Various aspects are tested extensively , the results of which apply directly to three-integral Schwarzschild methods .
4	This ansatz is also supported by a combined analysis of light and inelastic x-ray scattering spectra .	Brillouin scattering has been used to measure the dynamic structure factor of glycerol as a function of temperature from the high temperature liquid to the glassy state .	Our investigation aims at understanding the number and the nature of the relaxation processes active in this prototype glass forming system in the high frequency region .	The associated character of glycerol is reflected by a rather simple relaxations pattern , while the contributions coming from intra-molecular channels are negligible in the GHz frequency region .	The temperature behavior of the characteristic frequency and lifetime of the longitudinal acoustic modes is analyzed , suggesting that a phenomenological model which only includes the structural ( $ \alpha $ ) process and the unrelaxed viscosity is able to catch the leading contributions to the dynamics of the density fluctuations .
2	Group presentations with maximum sprawl ( i.e. , without this obstruction ) are called statistically hyperbolic .	In this paper , we introduce a geometric statistic called the `` sprawl '' of a group with respect to a generating set , based on the average distance in the word metric between pairs of words of equal length .	The sprawl quantifies a certain obstruction to hyperbolicity .	We first relate sprawl to curvature and show that nonelementary hyperbolic groups are statistically hyperbolic , then give some results for products , for Diestel-Leader graphs and lamplighter groups .	In free abelian groups , the word metrics asymptotically approach norms induced by convex polytopes , causing the study of sprawl to reduce to a problem in convex geometry .
0	The maximum a-posteriori ( MAP ) perturbation framework has emerged as a useful approach for inference and learning in high dimensional complex models .	By maximizing a randomly perturbed potential function , MAP perturbations generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution .	Unfortunately , the computational cost of generating so many high-dimensional random variables can be prohibitive .	More efficient algorithms use sequential sampling strategies based on the expected value of low dimensional MAP perturbations .	This paper develops new measure concentration inequalities that bound the number of samples needed to estimate such expected values .
0	We investigate a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ( FRW ) universe where dark matter exchanges energy with a self-interacting holographic dark energy ( SIHDE ) .	Using the $ \chi^2 $ -- statistical method on the Hubble function , we obtain a critical redshift that seems to be consistent with both BAO and CMB data .	We calculate the theoretical distance modulus for confronting with the observational data of SNe Ia for small redshift $ z\leq 0.1 $ and large redshift $ 0.1 \leq z\leq 1.5 $ .	The model gets accelerate faster than the $ \Lambda $ CDM one and it can be a good candidate to alleviate the coincidence problem .	We also examine the age crisis at high redshift associated with the old quasar APM 08279+5255 .
1	For such fields , we obtain Lagrangians which are invariant under global BRST transformations .	Totally symmetric arbitrary spin massless and massive fields in AdS space are studied .	The Lagrangians are used for computation of partition functions and effective actions .	We demonstrate that BRST invariant bulk action for massless field evaluated on the solution of Dirichlet problem for gauge massless fields and Faddeev-Popov fields leads to BRST invariant effective action for canonical shadow gauge fields and shadow Faddeev-Popov fields , while the BRST invariant bulk action for massive field evaluated on the solution of Dirichlet problem for gauge massive fields and Faddeev-Popov fields leads to BRST invariant effective action for anomalous shadow gauge fields and shadow Faddeev-Popov fields .	The leading logarithmic divergence of the regularized effective action for the canonical shadow field leads to simple BRST invariant action of conformal field .
1	Our results indicate variability that is consistent with the binary period , with the emission being modulated at 26.6 +/- 0.5 days .	This Letter presents the first results from the observations of LSI +61 303 using Large Area Telescope data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope between 2008 August and 2009 March .	This constitutes the first detection of orbital periodicity in high-energy gamma rays ( 20 MeV-100 GeV , HE ) .	The light curve is characterized by a broad peak after periastron , as well as a smaller peak just before apastron .	The spectrum is best represented by a power law with an exponential cutoff , yielding an overall flux above 100 MeV of 0.82 +/- 0.03 ( stat ) +/- 0.07 ( syst ) 10^ { -6 } ph cm^ { -2 } s^ { -1 } , with a cutoff at 6.3 +/- 1.1 ( stat ) +/- 0.4 ( syst ) GeV and photon index Gamma = 2.21 +/- 0.04 ( stat ) +/- 0.06 ( syst ) .
2	The earthquake generation is a fundamental sign that the earth is a living planet .	The new field of complex systems supports the view that a number of systems arising from disciplines as diverse as physics , biology , engineering , and economics may have certain quantitative features that are intriguingly similar .	The earth is a living planet where many complex systems run perfectly without stopping at all .	Recently , analyses have shown that human-brain-type disease appears during the earthquake generation process .	Herein , we show that human-heart-type disease appears during the earthquake preparation of the earthquake process .
2	The Boolean cost estimates for the latter problems have been obtained by Kirrinnis in \cite { kirrinnis-joc-1998 } , except for rational interpolation , which we supply now .	We estimate the Boolean complexity of multiplication of structured matrices by a vector and the solution of nonsingular linear systems of equations with these matrices .	We study four basic most popular classes , that is , Toeplitz , Hankel , Cauchy and Van-der-monde matrices , for which the cited computational problems are equivalent to the task of polynomial multiplication and division and polynomial and rational multipoint evaluation and interpolation .	All known Boolean cost estimates for these problems rely on using Kronecker product .	This implies the $ d $ -fold precision increase for the $ d $ -th degree output , but we avoid such an increase by relying on distinct techniques based on employing FFT .
2	To avoid periodicity issues ( and thus ensuring convergence to equilibrium ) one often considers the continuous-time version of the chain $ ( X_t^ { \mathrm { c } } ) _ { t \ge 0 } $ whose kernel is given by $ H_t : =e^ { -t } \sum_k ( tP ) ^k/k ! $ .	Let $ ( X_t ) _ { t = 0 } ^ { \infty } $ be an irreducible reversible discrete time Markov chain on a finite state space $ \Omega $ .	Denote its transition matrix by $ P $ .	Another possibility is to consider the associated averaged chain $ ( X_t^ { \mathrm { ave } } ) _ { t = 0 } ^ { \infty } $ , whose distribution at time $ t $ is obtained by replacing $ P $ by $ A_t : = ( P^t+P^ { t+1 } ) /2 $ .	A sequence of Markov chains is said to exhibit ( total-variation ) cutoff if the convergence to stationarity in total-variation distance is abrupt .
3	G can be any group .	It is well known that the moduli space of flat connections on a trivial principal bundle MxG , where G is a connected Lie group , is isomorphic to the representation variety Hom ( \pi_1 ( M ) , G ) /G .	For a tiling T , viewed as a marked copy of R^d , we define a new kind of bundle called pattern equivariant bundle over T and consider the set of all such bundles .	This is a topological invariant of the tiling space induced by T , which we call PREP ( T ) , and we show that it is isomorphic to the direct limit lim_ { f_n } Hom ( \pi_1 ( \Gamma_n ) , G ) /G , where \Gamma_n are the approximants to the tiling space and f_n are maps between them .	As an example , we choose G to be the symmetric group S_3 and we calculate this direct limit for the Period Doubling tiling and its double cover , the Thue-Morse tiling , obtaining different results .
0	We have extended and improved the statistical test recently developed by Rauzy for assessing the completeness in apparent magnitude of magnitude-redshift surveys .	Our improved test statistic retains the robust properties -- specifically independence of the spatial distribution of galaxies within a survey -- of the $ T_c $ statistic introduced in Rauzy 's seminal paper , but now accounts for the presence of both a faint and bright apparent magnitude limit .	We demonstrate that a failure to include a bright magnitude limit can significantly affect the performance of Rauzy 's $ T_c $ statistic .	Moreover , we have also introduced a new test statistic , $ T_v $ , defined in terms of the cumulative distance distribution of galaxies within a redshift survey .	These test statistics represent powerful tools for identifying and characterising systematic errors in magnitude-redshift data .
4	This gives birth to an improved algorithm based on the MUSIC method , which we refer to as robust G-MUSIC .	A class of robust estimators of scatter applied to information-plus-impulsive noise samples is studied , where the sample information matrix is assumed of low rank ; this generalizes the study of ( Couillet et al. , 2013b ) to spiked random matrix models .	It is precisely shown that , as opposed to sample covariance matrices which may have asymptotically unbounded ( eigen- ) spectrum due to the sample impulsiveness , the robust estimator of scatter has bounded spectrum and may contain isolated eigenvalues which we fully characterize .	We show that , if found beyond a certain detectability threshold , these eigenvalues allow one to perform statistical inference on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the information matrix .	We use this result to derive new eigenvalue and eigenvector estimation procedures , which we apply in practice to the popular array processing problem of angle of arrival estimation .
1	Suppose that there are essential resources to avoid congestion in the network as well as some extra resources .	We propose a resource distribution strategy to reduce the average travel time in a transportation network given a fixed generation rate .	The strategy distributes the essential resources by the average loads on the vertices and integrates the fluctuations of the instantaneous loads into the distribution of the extra resources .	The fluctuations are calculated with the assumption of unlimited resources , where the calculation is incorporated into the calculation of the average loads without adding to the time complexity .	Simulation results show that the fluctuation-integrated strategy provides shorter average travel time than a previous distribution strategy while keeping similar robustness .
2	We present a numerical framework to interpolate and differentiate in the mesh-free domain , defined by nodes with coordinates that follow no regular pattern .	Many applications and algorithms in the field of gravitational lensing make use of meshes with a finite number of nodes to analyze and manipulate data .	Specific examples in lensing are astronomical CCD images in general , the reconstruction of density distributions from lensing data , lens -- source plane mapping or the characterization and interpolation of a point spread-function .	The framework is based on radial basis functions ( RBFs ) to smoothly represent data around the nodes We demonstrate the performance of Gaussian RBF-based , mesh-free interpolation and differentiation , which reaches the sub-percent level in both cases .	We use our newly developed framework to translate ideas of nonparametric mass reconstruction from lensing onto the mesh-free domain .
0	Large scale far-infrared ( FIR ) observations of the Orion complex at 205 and 138 micron are presented with an aim of studying the distribution of cold ( & lt ; 25 K ) dust .	The maps in these FIR bands extend over approximately 3600 sq .	arcmin and cover regions around OMC-1 , 2 , 3 in Orion A and NGC 2023 and NGC 2024 in Orion B .	Some limited regions have also been mapped at 57 micron .	A total of 15 sources in Orion A and 14 in Orion B ( south ) have been identified from our FIR maps .
0	We analyse the effect of the compression of the dark matter due to the infall of baryons to the galactic center on the gamma-ray flux .	In addition , we also consider the effect of non-universal supersymmetric soft terms .	This analysis shows that neutralino dark matter annihilation can give rise to signals largely reachable by future experiments like GLAST .	This is a remarkable result if we realise that direct detection experiments will only be able to cover a small region of the parameter space .	Actually , in this SUGRA framework we have also been able to fit present excess from EGRET and CANGAROO using different non-universal scenarios , and even fit the data from both experiments with only one scenario .
2	[ Nature 406 , 486 ( 2000 ) ] .	Nernst effect has been measured for an underdoped and an optimally doped $ La_ { 2-x } Sr_xCuO_4 $ single crystal with the magnetic field applied along different directions .	For both samples , when $ H \| $ c , a significant Nernst voltage appears above $ T_c $ and keeps measurable up to a high temperature ( 100 K ) as reported by Xu et al .	However , when $ H \| $ a-b plane the Nernst signal drops below the noise level quickly above $ T_c $ for the underdoped sample .	Moreover , the in-plane Nernst data with field at different angles shows a nice scaling behavior with the c-axis component of the field .
1	The device ( named Energy-encoded Pinhole Camera - EPiC ) is based upon the use of an array of many pinholes coupled to a large area CCD camera operating in the single-photon mode .	A novel X-ray diagnostic of laser-fusion plasmas is described , allowing 2D monochromatic images of hot , dense plasmas to be obtained in any X-ray photon energy range , over a large domain , on a single-shot basis .	The available X-ray spectral domain is only limited by the Quantum Efficiency of scientific-grade X-ray CCD cameras , thus extending from a few keV up to a few tens of keV .	Spectral 2D images of the emitting plasma can be obtained at any X-ray photon energy provided that a sufficient number of photons had been collected at the desired energy .	Results from recent ICF related experiments will be reported in order to detail the new diagnostic .
2	This question appears to have been given relatively little thought , as attention has been focussed predominantly on mechanisms for the rapid dissipation of coronal magnetic energy by way of MHD instabilities and plasma micro instabilities .	Where does solar flare energy come from ?	More specifically , assuming that the ultimate source of flare energy is mechanical energy in the convection zone , how is this translated into energy dissipated or stored in the corona ?	We consider three types of flare theory : the steady state `` photospheric dynamo '' model in which flare power represents coronal dissipation of currents generated simultaneously by sub-photospheric flows ; the `` magnetic energy storage '' model where sub-photospheric flows again induce coronal currents but which in this case are built up over a longer period before being released suddenly ; and `` emerging flux '' models , in which new magnetic flux rising to the photosphere already contains free energy , and does not require subsequent stressing by photospheric motions .	We conclude that photospheric dynamos can power only very minor flares ; that coronal energy storage can in principle meet the requirements of a major flare , although perhaps not the very largest flares , but that difficulties in coupling efficiently to the energy source may limit this mechanism to moderate sized flares ; and that emerging magnetic flux tubes , generated in the solar interior , can carry sufficient free energy to power even the largest flares ever observed .
4	We also compare our reduced equations with reduced ones obtained by another perturbation method .	The renormalization method which is a type of perturbation method is extended to a tool to study weakly nonlinear time-delay systems .	For systems with order-one delay , we show that the renormalization method leads to reduced systems without delay .	For systems with order-one and large-delay , we propose an extended renormalization method which leads to reduced systems with delay .	In some examples , the validities of our perturbative results are confirmed analytically and numerically .
2	We have determined the residual slip velocity between the two fluids , and , for each fluid , the relative balance of inertial , viscous and friction forces along the scales .	To model isotropic homogeneous quantum turbulence in superfluid helium , we have performed Direct Numerical Simulations ( DNS ) of two fluids ( the normal fluid and the superfluid ) coupled by mutual friction .	We have found evidence of strong locking of superfluid and normal fluid along the turbulent cascade , from the large scale structures where only one fluid is forced down to the vorticity structures at small scales .	Our calculations show that the classical relation between energy injection and dissipation scale is not valid in quantum turbulence , but we have been able to derive a temperature -- dependent superfluid analogous relation .	Finally , we discuss our DNS results in terms of the current understanding of quantum turbulence , including the value of the effective kinematic viscosity .
4	We extend this result to higher dimensions recovering a recent result by D\ '' orner -- Geiges -- Zehmisch .	Given two open books with equal pages we show the existence of an exact symplectic cobordism whose negative end equals the disjoint union of the contact manifolds associated to the given open books , and whose positive end induces the contact manifold associated to the open book with the same page and concatenated monodromy .	Using similar methods we show the existence of strong fillings for contact manifolds associated with doubled open books , a certain class of fiber bundles over the circle obtained by performing the binding sum of two open books with equal pages and inverse monodromies .	From this we conclude , following an outline by Wendl , that the complement of the binding of an open book can not contain any local filling obstruction .	Given a contact $ 3 $ -manifold , according to Eliashberg there is a symplectic cobordism to a fibration over the circle with symplectic fibers .
0	We report on a recent paper ( Wei\ss\ \ & amp ; Buchert 1993 ) , where we carry out pencil beam constructions in a high-resolution simulation of the large-scale structure of galaxies .	As an example we present the results for the case of `` Hot-Dark-Matter '' ( HDM ) initial conditions ( with scale-free $ n = 1 $ power index on large scales and $ \Omega = 1 $ ) as a representative of models with sufficient large-scale power .	We use an analytic approximation for particle trajectories of a self-gravitating dust continuum and apply a local dynamical biasing of volume elements to identify luminous matter in the model .	Using this method , we are able to resolve formally a simulation box of 1200h^-1 Mpc ( e.g.for HDM initial conditions ) down to the scale of galactic halos using $ 2160^3 $ particles .	Pencil beam probes are taken for a given epoch using the parameters of observed beams .
4	We provide parametrised bolometric corrections as a function of time for SN 2004et and three other IIP SNe that have extensive optical and NIR data , which can be used as templates for future events .	We present new optical and near infrared ( NIR ) photometry and spectroscopy of the type IIP supernova , SN 2004et .	In combination with already published data , this provides one of the most complete studies of optical and NIR data for any type IIP SN from just after explosion to +500 days .	The contribution of the NIR flux to the bolometric light curve is estimated to increase from 15 % at explosion to around 50 % at the end of the plateau and then declines to 40 % at 300 days .	SN 2004et is one of the most luminous IIP SNe which has been well studied , and with a luminosity of log L = 42.3 erg/s , it is 2 times brighter than SN 1999em .
2	Comparison of relative abundances , [ X/Fe ] , for some 15 elements with those of the extremely metal-poor giants of the Galactic halo shows Boo-1137 is `` normal '' with respect to C and N , the odd-Z elements Na and Al , the Fe-peak elements , and the n-capture elements Sr and Ba , in comparison with the bulk of the halo with [ Fe/H ] & lt ; -3.0 .	We present high-resolution , high-S/N spectra of an extremely metal- poor giant star Boo-1137 in the `` ultra-faint '' dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dSph ) Bootes I ( absolute magnitude Mv ~ -6.3 ) .	With [ Fe/H ] = -3.7 , this the most metal-poor star yet identified in an ultra-faint dSph .	The alpha- elements Mg , Si , Ca , and Ti are all higher by Delta [ X/Fe ] ~ 0.2 than average halo values .	Monte-Carlo analysis indicates Delta [ alpha/Fe ] values this large are expected with probability ~ 0.02 .
1	Thus a measurement of the structure growth , e.g. , redshift-space distortions ( RSD ) , can provide a powerful tool to constrain the interacting dark energy ( IDE ) models .	Dark energy can modify the dynamics of dark matter if there exists a direct interaction between them .	For the widely studied $ Q=3\beta H\rho_ { de } $ model , previous works showed that only a very small coupling ( $ \beta\sim\mathcal { O } ( 10^ { -3 } ) $ ) can survive in current RSD data .	However , all these analyses had to assume $ w & gt ; -1 $ and $ \beta & gt ; 0 $ due to the existence of the large-scale instability in the IDE scenario .	In our recent work [ Phys.Rev .
1	It is first shown that a uniform maximally aligned completely separable eigenstate can exist just for fields $ { h } _s $ parallel to a principal plane and forming four straight lines in field space , with the alignment direction different from that of $ { h } _s $ and determined by the anisotropy .	We determine the conditions for the existence of non-transverse factorizing magnetic fields in general spin arrays with anisotropic XYZ couplings of arbitrary range .	Such state always becomes a non-degenerate ground state ( GS ) for sufficiently strong ( yet finite ) fields along these lines , in both ferromagnetic ( FM ) and antiferromagnetic ( AFM ) type systems .	In AFM chains , this field coexists with the non-transverse factorizing field $ { h } '_s $ associated with a degenerate N\'eel-type separable GS , which is shown to arise at a level crossing in a finite chain .	It is also demonstrated for arbitrary spin that pairwise entanglement reaches full range in the vicinity of both $ { h } _s $ and $ { h } '_s $ , vanishing at $ { h } _s $ but approaching small yet finite side-limits at $ { h } '_s $ , which are analytically determined .
3	These structural variants ( SV ) have been shown to have significant impact on the phenotype , but their study has been held back by the combinatorial complexity of the underlying models .	The study of genomic variation has provided key insights into the functional role of mutations .	Predominantly , studies have focused on single nucleotide variants ( SNV ) , which are relatively easy to detect and can be described with rich mathematical models .	However , it has been observed that genomes are highly plastic , and that whole regions can be moved , removed or duplicated in bulk .	We describe here a general model of structural variation that encompasses both balanced rearrangements and arbitrary copy-numbers variants ( CNV ) .
2	As an example , we consider a foreign exchange market network in which each node represents an exchange rate and each edge represents a time-dependent correlation between the rates .	We study the cluster dynamics of multichannel ( multivariate ) time series by representing their correlations as time-dependent networks and investigating the evolution of network communities .	We employ a node-centric approach that allows us to track the effects of the community evolution on the functional roles of individual nodes without having to track entire communities .	We study the period 2005-2008 , which includes the recent credit and liquidity crisis .	Using dynamical community detection , we find that exchange rates that are strongly attached to their community are persistently grouped with the same set of rates , whereas exchange rates that are important for the transfer of information tend to be positioned on the edges of communities .
1	Interference between the modes in the waveguide forms a wavelength-dependent speckle pattern which can be used as a fingerprint to identify the input wavelength after calibration .	We designed an on-chip spectrometer based on an evanescently-coupled multimode spiral waveguide .	Evanescent coupling between neighboring arms of the spiral enhances the temporal spread of light propagating through the spiral , leading to a dramatic increase in the spectral resolution .	Experimentally , we demonstrated that a 250 { \mu } m radius spiral spectrometer provides a resolution of 0.01 nm at a wavelength of 1520 nm .	Spectra containing 40 independent spectral channels can be recovered simultaneously and the operation bandwidth can be increased further when measuring sparse spectra .
2	Moreover , we show that the abrupt change observed in the pump dependence of the steady-state population is directly connected with the transition to the lasing regime .	The problem of the two-level atom laser is studied analytically .	The steady-state solution is expressed as a continued fraction , and allows for accurate approximation by rational functions .	The condition for a sharp transition to Poissonian statistics is expressed as a scaling limit of vanishing cavity loss and light-matter coupling , $ \kappa \to 0 $ , $ g \to 0 $ , such that $ g^2/\kappa $ stays finite and $ g^2/\kappa & gt ; 2 \gamma $ , where $ \gamma $ is the rate of atomic losses .	The same scaling procedure is also shown to describe a similar change to Poisson distribution in the Scully-Lamb laser model too , suggesting that the low- $ \kappa $ , low- $ g $ asymptotics is of a more general significance for the laser transition .
0	We say that two graphs are similar if their adjacency matrices are similar matrices .	We show that the square grid $ G_n $ of order $ n $ is similar to the disjoint union of two copies of the quartered Aztec diamond $ QAD_ { n-1 } $ of order $ n-1 $ with the path $ P_n^ { ( 2 ) } $ on $ n $ vertices having edge weights equal to~2 .	Our proof is based on an explicit change of basis in the vector space on which the adjacency matrix acts .	The arguments verifying that this change of basis works are combinatorial .	In particular , this allows computing the number of spanning trees of quartered Aztec diamonds .
1	Analyses of gravitational lensing assume that intrinsic galaxy alignments are negligible , but if this assumption does not hold , then the interpretation of image alignments will be in error .	Gravitational lensing causes background galaxy images to become aligned , and the statistical characteristics of the image alignments can then be used to constrain the power spectrum of mass fluctuations .	As gravitational lensing experiments become more ambitious and seek very low-level alignments arising from lensing by large-scale structure , it becomes more important to estimate the level of intrinsic alignment in the galaxy population .	In this article , I review the cluster of independent theoretical studies of this issue , as well as the current observational status .	Theoretically , the calculation of intrinsic alignments is by no means straightforward , but some consensus has emerged from the existing works , despite each making very different assumptions .
0	This work examines the close interplay between cooperation and adaptation for distributed detection schemes over fully decentralized networks .	The combined attributes of cooperation and adaptation are necessary to enable networks of detectors to continually learn from streaming data and to continually track drifts in the state of nature when deciding in favor of one hypothesis or another .	The results in the paper establish a fundamental scaling law for the steady-state probabilities of miss-detection and false-alarm in the slow adaptation regime , when the agents interact with each other according to distributed strategies that employ small constant step-sizes .	The latter are critical to enable continuous adaptation and learning .	The work establishes three key results .
2	Both entropies discriminate among various probability distributions , either statically or in the time domain .	We analyze dynamical properties of the Shannon information entropy of a continuous probability distribution , which is driven by a standard diffusion process .	This entropy choice is confronted with another option , employing the conditional Kullback-Leibler entropy .	An asymptotic approach towards equilibrium is typically monotonic in terms of the Kullback entropy .	The Shannon entropy time rate needs not to be positive and is a sensitive indicator of the power transfer processes ( removal/supply ) due to an active environment .
4	This selection may have resulted from energetic or nutritional demands in Holocene populations , or to life history constraints on brain development .	Background : Human populations during the last 10,000 years have undergone rapid decreases in average brain size as measured by endocranial volume or as estimated from linear measurements of the cranium .	A null hypothesis to explain the evolution of brain size is that reductions result from genetic correlation of brain size with body mass or stature .	Results : The absolute change of endocranial volume in the study samples was significantly greater than would be predicted from observed changes in body mass or stature .	Conclusions : The evolution of smaller brains in many recent human populations must have resulted from selection upon brain size itself or on other features more highly correlated with brain size than are gross body dimensions .
3	The first kink occurs where MHD turbulence transforms into weakly dispersive KAW turbulence ; the second one is between weakly and strongly dispersive KAW sub-ranges .	A weakly dispersive sub-range ( WDR ) of kinetic Alfv\'en turbulence is distinguished and investigated for the first time in the context of MHD/kinetic turbulence transition .	We found perpendicular wavenumber spectra ~ k^ { -3 } and ~ k^ { -4 } formed in WDR by strong and weak turbulence of kinetic Alfv\'en waves ( KAWs ) , respectively .	These steep WDR spectra connect shallower spectra in the MHD and strongly dispersive KAW sub-ranges , which results in a specific double-kink ( 2-k ) pattern often seen in observed turbulent spectra .	Our analysis suggests that the partial turbulence dissipation due to amplitude-dependent super-adiabatic ion heating may occur in the vicinity of the first spectral kink .
1	We show the uniform ( in $ N $ ) exponential contractivity of the dynamics in a non-standard Monge-Kantorovich-Wasserstein : precisely the MKW metric of order 2 on the energy .	We study here a very popular 1D jump model introduced by Kac : it consists of $ N $ velocities encountering random binary collisions at which they randomly exchange energy .	The result is optimal in the sense that for each $ N $ , the contractivity constant is equal to the $ L^2 $ spectral gap of the generator associated to Kac 's dynamic .	As a corollary , we get an uniform but non optimal contractivity in the MKW metric of order $ 4 $ .	We use a simple coupling that works better that the parallel one .
4	Our data confirms an important prediction derived from the mean-field theory : spin-mixing dynamics in spin-1 condensates substantially depends on the sign of the ratio of $ q_ { \rm net } $ and the spin-dependent interaction energy .	We experimentally study spin dynamics in a sodium antiferromagnetic spinor condensate with off-resonant microwave pulses .	In contrast to a magnetic field , a microwave dressing field enables us to explore rich spin dynamics under the influence of a negative net quadratic Zeeman shift $ q_ { \rm net } $ .	We find an experimental signature to determine the sign of $ q_ { \rm net } $ , and observe harmonic spin population oscillations at every $ q_ { \rm net } $ except near each separatrix in phase space where spin oscillation period diverges .	In the negative and positive $ q_ { \rm net } $ regions , we also observe a remarkably different relationship between each separatrix and the magnetization .
4	Our approach offers an intuitive definition of the weakest machine model capable to simulate both Type-2-Machines and BSS machines .	We define Oracle-Type-2-Machine capable of writing infinite oracle queries .	In contrast to finite oracle queries , this extends the realm of oracle-computable functions into the discontinuous realm .	Our definition is conservative ; access to a computable oracle does not increase the computational power .	Other models of real hypercomputation such as Ziegler 's ( finitely ) revising computation or Type-2-Nondeterminism are shown to be special cases of Oracle-Type-2-Machines .
0	The `` meningitis belt '' is a region in sub-Saharan Africa where annual outbreaks of meningitis occur , with large epidemics observed cyclically .	While we know that meningitis is heavily dependent on seasonal trends ( in particular , weather ) , the exact pathways for contracting the disease are not fully understood and warrant further investigation .	This manuscript examines meningitis trends in the context of survival analysis , quantifying underlying seasonal patterns in meningitis rates through the hazard rate for the population of Navrongo , Ghana .	We compare three candidate models : the commonly used Poisson generalized linear model , the Bayesian multi-resolution hazard model , and the Poisson generalized additive model .	We compare the accuracy and robustness of the models through the bias , RMSE , and the standard deviation .
4	As a consequence , we are able to construct infinitely many non-trivial satellite operators P such that there is a satellite operator $ \overline { P } $ for which $ \overline { P } ( P ( K ) ) $ is concordant to K ( topologically as well as smoothly in a potentially exotic $ S^3\times [ 0,1 ] $ ) for all knots K ; we show that these satellite operators are distinct from all connected-sum operators , even up to concordance , and that they induce bijective functions on topological concordance classes of knots , as well as smooth concordance classes of knots modulo the smooth 4 -- dimensional Poincare Conjecture .	Any knot in a solid torus , called a pattern or satellite operator , acts on knots in the 3-sphere via the satellite construction .	We introduce a generalization of satellite operators which form a group ( unlike traditional satellite operators ) , modulo a generalization of concordance .	This group has an action on the set of knots in homology spheres , using which we recover the recent result of Cochran and the authors that satellite operators with strong winding number $ \pm 1 $ give injective functions on topological concordance classes of knots , as well as smooth concordance classes of knots modulo the smooth 4 -- dimensional Poincare Conjecture .	The notion of generalized satellite operators yields a characterization of surjective satellite operators , as well as a sufficient condition for a satellite operator to have an inverse .
3	Its focus then is on their explanatory value : they pursue different strategies to ground the textbook formalism of quantum mechanics , and they develop different explanations of quantum non-locality .	The paper seeks to make progress from stating primitive ontology theories of quantum physics , notably Bohmian mechanics , the GRW matter density theory and the GRW flash theory , to assessing these theories .	Four criteria are set out : ( a ) internal coherence ; ( b ) empirical adequacy ; ( c ) relationship to other theories ; ( d ) explanatory value .	The paper argues that the stock objections against these theories do not withstand scrutiny .	In conclusion , it is argued that Bohmian mechanics offers a better prospect for making quantum non-locality intelligible than the GRW matter density theory and the GRW flash theory .
4	Our method sheds new light on the Hard Lefschetz property of a Sasakian manifold .	In the literature , there are two different versions of Hard Lefschetz theorems for a compact Sasakian manifold .	The first version , due to Kacimi-Alaoui , asserts that the basic cohomology of a compact Sasakian manifold satisfies the transverse Lefschetz property .	The second version , established far more recently by Cappelletti-Montano , De Nicola , and Yudin , holds for the De Rham cohomology of a compact Sasakian manifold .	In the current paper , using the formalism of odd dimensional symplectic geometry , we prove a Hard Lefschetz theorem for a compact $ K $ -contact manifold , which implies immediately that the two existing versions of Hard Lefschetz theorems are mathematically equivalent to each other .

3	We tackle the problem by introducing an orthogonal wave packet basis , the so-called Wilson-Wannier ( WW ) basis , that can be used to interpolate between the momentum space and the real space descriptions .	In this thesis , we study the breakdown of the Fermi liquid state in cuprate superconductors using the renormalization group ( RG ) .	We seek to extend earlier work on the crossover from the Fermi liquid state to the pseudo gap phase based on RG flows in the so-called saddle point regime .	Progress in the derivation of effective models for the conjectured spin liquid state has been hindered , by the difficulties involved in solving the strong coupling low energy Hamiltonian .	We show how to combine the WW basis with the RG , such that the RG is used to eliminate high-energy degrees of freedom , and the remaining strongly correlated system is solved approximately in the WW basis .
0	Gravitational lensing causes the distribution of observed brightnesses of standard candles at a given redshift to be highly non-gaussian .	The distribution is strongly , and asymmetrically , peaked at a value less than the expected value in a homogeneous Robertson-Walker universe .	Therefore , given any small sample of observations in an inhomogeneous universe , the most likely observed luminosity is at flux values less than the Robertson-Walker value .	This paper explores the impact of this systematic error due to lensing upon surveys predicated on measuring standard candle brightnesses .	We re-analyze recent results from the high-z supernova team ( Riess et al .
0	Business Process Management Systems ( BPMS ) log events and traces of activities during the execution of a process .	Anomalies are defined as deviation or departure from the normal or common order .	Anomaly detection in business process logs has several applications such as fraud detection and understanding the causes of process errors .	In this paper , we present a novel approach for anomaly detection in business process logs .	We model the event logs as a sequential data and apply kernel based anomaly detection techniques to identify outliers and discordant observations .
1	While there is still debate about whether explosions are obtained more easily in 3D than in 2D , it is undeniable that there exist qualitative and quantitative differences between the results of 3D and 2D simulations .	Three-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae are granting new insight into the as-yet uncertain mechanism that drives successful explosions .	We present an extensive set of high-resolution one- , two- , and three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations with multispecies neutrino leakage carried out in two different progenitors .	Our simulations confirm the results of Couch ( 2013 ) indicating that 2D explodes more readily than 3D .	We argue that this is due to the inadequacies of 2D to accurately capture important aspects of the three-dimensional dynamics .
0	The macroscopic elastic-plastic response of a metal polycrystal is analyzed here by homogenizing the response of a representative volume element .	With this purpose , the theory developed in Hill ( 1967 ) ( The essential structure of constitutive laws for metal composites and polycrystals.J . Mech.Phys .	Solids , 15 , 79-95 ) is extended so that the structural changes caused by plastic deformation are taken into account .	It is found that the type of evolution assigned to the slip systems of a constituent crystal influences significantly the structure of the constitutive system characterizing the overall response .	In particular , the classical normality structure is obtained only if slip systems are assumed to convect with the crystal lattice .
1	Our statistics comprises over 700 different market/carrier combinations .	We study the distributions of dropped calls rates for different wireless ( cellular ) carriers in different markets .	We find that the dropped calls rates distribution is very close to lognormal .	We derive an equation for the most probable dropped calls rate for particular carrier in particular market , which depends on the number of dropped calls observed , total number of calls and the parameters of the lognormal distribution .	We apply this analysis to blocked and `` no service '' calls as well .
2	Appropriate boundary conditions are imposed at the outlet and upstream nodes of the river network .	An integro-differential equation on a tree graph is used to model the evolution and spatial distribution of a population of organisms in a river network .	Individual organisms become mobile at a constant rate , and disperse according to an advection-diffusion process with coefficients that are constant on the edges of the graph .	The local rates of population growth/decay and that by which the organisms become mobile , are assumed constant in time and space .	Imminent extinction of the population is understood as the situation whereby the zero solution to the integro-differential equation is stable .
2	A likelihood method for the Cerenkov angle reconstruction was applied leading to a velocity determination for protons with a resolution around 0.1 % .	The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) to be installed on the International Space Station ( ISS ) will be equipped with a proximity focusing Ring Imaging Cerenkov detector ( RICH ) .	Reconstruction of the Cerenkov angle and the electric charge with RICH are discussed .	The electric charge reconstruction is based on the counting of the number of photoelectrons and on an overall efficiency estimation on an event-by-event basis .	The isotopic mass separation of helium and beryllium is presented .
1	The example of the KdV equation has been studied in detail , beginning with the infinite conserved quantities and going on to the Lax formalism for the same .	A pedagogical presentation of integrable models with special reference to the Toda lattice hierarchy has been attempted .	We then go on to symplectic manifolds for which we construct the Lax operator .	This formalism is applied to Toda Lattice systems .	The Zakharov Shabat formalism aimed at encompassing all integrable models is also covered after which the zero curvature condition and its fallout are discussed .
2	If pulsar winds contain ions as well as electrons and positrons , the mechanism of Hoshino et al .	We review recent theoretical developments on pulsar winds , their nebulae and relativistic shock acceleration , and show how they illuminate unsolved problems in plerion spectra , in particular the multiple spectral breaks in the Crab and the low-frequency breaks of plerions such as G 21.5-0.9 and 3C 58 .	Recent work on Fermi acceleration theory at relativistic shocks shows that a particle spectral index of 2.2-2.3 , compatible with the X-ray spectra of plerions , results under a wide variety of assumptions .	( 1992 ) , which yields harder spectra , would operate at lower energies and may explain the flat radio spectral indices of plerions .	This scenario implies wind parameters in the Crab compatible with the pulsar wind acceleration model of Lyubarsky & amp ; Kirk ( 2001 ) .
1	Using piecewise linear paths in R^2 ( representing loops on the spatial manifold , i.e.the torus ) and a quantum connection with noncommuting components , we review how holonomies and Wilson loops for two homotopic paths are related by phases in terms of the signed area between them .	In the context of quantum gravity for spacetimes of dimension 2+1 , we describe progress in the construction of a quantum Goldman bracket for intersecting loops on surfaces .	Paths rerouted at intersection points with other paths occur on the r.h.s .	of the Goldman bracket .	To better understand their nature we introduce the concept of integer points inside the parallelogram spanned by two intersecting paths , and show that the rerouted paths must necessarily pass through these integer points .
4	The reanalysis of the combination of the corrected Konkoly data supplemented with Preston & amp ; Spinrad 's ( 1967 ) observations has led to the discovery that the adequate mathematical model of the light curve is , in fact , a quintuplet , instead of a triplet frequency solution .	RV UMa is one of the RRab stars showing regular large amplitude light curve modulation .	Extended photoelectric observations of RV UMa obtained at the Konkoly Observatory were published by Kanyo ( 1976 ) .	The analysis of the data was published by Kovacs ( 1995 ) .	After detecting an error in the reduction procedure of the published Konkoly data , corrected photometric data are presented with additional , previously unpublished measurements .
3	It has further shown that CMWNTs can maintain thermally stable up to 2,000 K. By taking advantage of the primary enhancement mechanism of CMWNTs , a method of producing CMWNTs is therefore proposed tentatively .	The ultra-low intershell shear strength in carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) has been the primary obstacle to applications of CNTs as mechanical reinforcements .	In this paper we propose a new CNT-system composed of comprising of coaxial cylindrical shells of sp2-bonded carbons with condensed intershell spacings .	Our atomistic calculations show that such condensed multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( CMWNTs ) can greatly enhance intershell shear strengths by several orders , and can simultaneously generate higher tensile strengths and moduli respectively than those of ordinary CNTs .	It is believed that CMWNTs featured with those properties can be taken as excellent candidates of super fibers for creating space elevators .
2	We also show that the present results satisfy the Callan-Treiman low-energy theorem as well as the Ademollo-Gatto theorem .	We investigate the kaon semileptonic decay ( K_ { l3 } ) form factors within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum , taking into account the effects of flavor SU ( 3 ) symmetry breaking .	All theoretical calculations are carried out without any adjustable parameter .	It turns out that the effects of flavor SU ( 3 ) symmetry breaking are essential in reproducing the kaon semileptonic form factors .	The present results are in a good agreement with experiments , and are compatible with other model calculations .
3	In $ C^1 $ domains , solutions are in general not comparable to $ d^s $ , and we prove a boundary Harnack principle in such domains .	We establish sharp boundary regularity estimates in $ C^1 $ and $ C^ { 1 , \alpha } $ domains for nonlocal problems of the form $ Lu=f $ in $ \Omega $ , $ u=0 $ in $ \Omega^c $ .	Here , $ L $ is a nonlocal elliptic operator of order $ 2s $ , with $ s\in ( 0,1 ) $ .	First , in $ C^ { 1 , \alpha } $ domains we show that all solutions $ u $ are $ C^s $ up to the boundary and that $ u/d^s\in C^\alpha ( \bar\Omega ) $ , where $ d $ is the distance to $ \partial\Omega $ .	Namely , we show that if $ u_1 $ and $ u_2 $ are positive solutions , then $ u_1/u_2 $ is bounded and H\ '' older continuous up to the boundary .
1	In this paper , we describe a construction of manifold-valued subdivision schemes for geodesically complete manifolds .	Subdivision schemes have become an important tool for approximation of manifold-valued functions .	Our construction is based upon the adaptation of linear subdivision schemes using the notion of repeated binary averaging , where as a repeated binary average we propose to use the geodesic inductive mean .	We derive conditions on the adapted schemes which guarantee convergence from any initial manifold-valued sequence .	The de ? nition and analysis of convergence are intrinsic to the manifold .
4	Some results , showing properties of the class of games , and an example to show working of the method concludes the paper .	A Nash equilibrium has become important solution concept for analyzing the decision making in Game theory .	In this paper , we consider the problem of computing Nash equilibria of a subclass of generic finite normal form games .	We define `` rational payoff irrational equilibria games '' to be the games with all rational payoffs and all irrational equilibria .	We present a purely algebraic method for computing all Nash equilibria of these games that uses knowledge of Galois groups .
2	Then , the quantum mechanics as it is usually taught is demoted to a mere part of the theory called phenomenology of observations , and the common impression about its contradiction to realism is explained .	The paper attempts to convince that the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics does not contradict philosophical realism by throwing light onto certain properties of quantum systems that seem to have escaped attention as yet .	The exposition starts with the philosophical notions of realism .	The main idea of the paper , the physical notion of intrinsic properties , is introduced and many examples thereof are given .	It replaces the irritating dichotomy of quantum and classical worlds by a much softer difference between intrinsic and extrinsic properties , which concern equally microscopic and macroscopic systems .
2	The fluctuation is induced by a multiplicative colored noise that can be identified as the the particle number density fluctuations and the dissipation is a new effect that may play a role in the trapping with a strong coupling .	We develop a Lagrangian approach based on the influence functional method so as to derive self-consistently the Langevin equation for the inflaton field in the presence of trapping points along the inflaton trajectory .	The Langevin equation exhibits the backreaction and the fluctuation-dissipation relation of the trapping .	In the weak coupling regime , we calculate the power spectrum of the noise-driven inflaton fluctuations for a single trapping point and studied its variation with the trapping location .	We also consider a case with closely spaced trapping points and find that the resulting power spectrum is blue .
1	We consider partial sums of $ k $ th powers of residuals , CUSUM processes and self-normalized partial sum processes .	In this paper we construct high moment partial sum processes based on residuals of a GARCH model when the mean is known to be 0 .	The $ k $ th power partial sum process converges to a Brownian process plus a correction term , where the correction term depends on the $ k $ th moment $ \mu_k $ of the innovation sequence .	If $ \mu_k=0 $ , then the correction term is 0 and , thus , the $ k $ th power partial sum process converges weakly to the same Gaussian process as does the $ k $ th power partial sum of the i.i.d .	innovations sequence .
3	We find that the Universe can be even gravitino-dominated , in which case there will be an entropy dilution by the gravitino decay .	The gravitino may well play an important role in cosmology , not only because its interactions are Planck-suppressed and therefore long-lived , but also because it is copiously produced via various processes such as particle scatterings in thermal plasma , and ( pseudo ) modulus and inflaton decays .	We study a possibility that the early Universe was gravitino-rich from various aspects .	In particular , a viable cosmology is possible , if high-scale supersymmetry is realized in nature as suggested by the recent discovery of the standard-model like Higgs boson of mass about 125-126 GeV .	If the gravitino abundance is proportional to the reheating temperature , both the maximal baryon asymmetry in leptogenesis and the dark matter from the gravitino decay become independent of the reheating temperature .
1	The relevant hadronic matrix elements are fixed at leading order in the 1/N_C expansion , through a matching procedure between the effective short-distance Lagrangian and its corresponding low-energy description in Chiral Perturbation Theory .	We present a detailed analysis of epsilon'/epsilon within the Standard Model , taking into account the strong enhancement through final-state interactions identified in refs . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] .	All large logarithms are summed up , both at short and long distances .	Two different numerical analyses are performed , using either the experimental or the theoretical value for epsilon , with compatible results .	We obtain Re ( epsilon'/epsilon ) = ( 1.7 +- 0.9 ) *10^ { -3 } .
0	A semi-classical Monte Carlo model for studying three-dimensional carrier dynamics in photoconductive switches is presented .	The model was used to simulate the process of photoexcitation in GaAs-based photoconductive antennas illuminated with pulses typical of mode-locked Ti : Sapphire lasers .	We analyzed the power and frequency bandwidth of THz radiation emitted from these devices as a function of bias voltage , pump pulse duration and pump pulse location .	We show that the mechanisms limiting the THz power emitted from photoconductive switches fall into two regimes : when illuminated with short duration ( & lt ; 40 fs ) laser pulses the energy distribution of the Gaussian pulses constrains the emitted power , while for long ( & gt ; 40 fs ) pulses , screening is the primary power-limiting mechanism .	A discussion of the dynamics of bias field screening in the gap region is presented .
1	This production was also calculated , at the tree level , in some extensions of the SM such as the vector singlet , the fermion mirror fermion and the vector doublet models by considering the contributions of new neutral gauge bosons and exotic fermions .	The production of $ W^+ W^- $ pair in hadron colliders was calculated up to loop corrections by some authors in the Electroweak standard model ( SM ) framework .	The obtained results for $ e^+ e^- $ and $ pp $ collisions pointed out that the new physics contributions are quite important .	This motivates us to calculate the production of a more massive charged gauge boson predicted by the $ { SU ( 3 ) _C \times SU ( 3 ) _L \times U ( 1 ) _X } $ model ( 3-3-1 model ) .	Thus , the aim of the present paper is to analyze the role played by of the extra gauge boson $ { Z^\prime } $ and of the exotic quarks , predicted in the minimal version of the 3-3-1 model , by considering the inclusive production of a pair of bileptons ( $ V^\pm $ ) in the reaction $ p + p \longrightarrow V^+ + V^- + X $ , at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) energies .
4	AERQ has several interesting equivalent forms : While it is originally defined as an optimal solution of a specific linear programming problem , hence is a weighted mean of responses corresponding to the optimal base of the pertaining linear program , we give another equivalent form as a maximum residual of responses from a specific R-estimator of the slope components of regression parameter .	Various events in the nature , economics and in other areas force us to combine the study of extremes with regression and other methods .	A useful tool for reducing the role of nuisance regression , while we are interested in the shape or tails of the basic distribution , is provided by the averaged regression quantile and namely by the average extreme regression quantile .	Both are weighted means of regression quantile components , with weights depending on the regressors .	Our primary interest is the averaged extreme regression quantile ( AERQ ) , its structure , qualities and its applications , e.g.in investigation of a conditional loss given a value exogenous economic and market variables .
3	Further we find a necessary condition of 3-ribbon infinitesimal flexibility .	In this paper we study infinitesimal and finite flexibility for generic semidiscrete surfaces .	We prove that generic 2-ribbon semidiscrete surfaces have one degree of infinitesimal and finite flexibility .	In particular we write down a system of differential equations describing isometric deformations in the case of existence .	For an arbitrary $ n\ge 3 $ we prove that every generic $ n $ -ribbon surface has at most one degree of finite/infinitesimal flexibility .
4	Temperature and H dependences of P* are well explained by the increase of the electron temperature in graphene .	We investigated the electrical transport properties of superconductor-graphene-superconductor ( SGS ) Josephson junctions .	In low voltage bias , we observed conventional proximity-coupled Josephson effect , such as the supercurrent flow through the graphene , sub-gap structure of differential conductance due to Andreev reflection , and periodic modulation of the critical current Ic with perpendicular magnetic field H to the graphene .	In high bias above the superconducting gap voltage , however , we also observed an anomalous jump of the differential conductance , the voltage position of which is sensitive to the backgate voltage Vg .	Our extensive study with varying Vg , temperature , and H reveals that the above-gap structure takes place at a characteristic power P* , which is irrespective of Vg for a given junction .
4	The effective potential gives the classical analogue of all static and non-static effects of the one-photon exchange Feynman diagram of scalar electrodynamics .	In the semiclassical approximation in which the electric charges of scalar particles are described by Grassmann variables ( $ Q_i^2=0 , Q_iQ_j\ne 0 $ ) , it is possible to re-express the Lienard-Wiechert potentials and electric fields in the radiation gauge as phase space functions , because the difference among retarded , advanced , and symmetric Green functions is of order Q_i^2 .	By working in the rest-frame instant form of dynamics , the elimination of the electromagnetic degrees of freedom by means of suitable second classs contraints leads to the identification of the Lienard-Wiechert reduced phase space containing only N charged particles with mutual action-at-a-distance vector and scalar potentials .	A Darboux canonical basis of the reduced phase space is found .	This allows one to re-express the potentials for arbitrary N as a unique effective scalar potential containing the Coulomb potential and the complete Darwin one , whose 1/c^2 component agrees for with the known expression .
2	This result was first proved by a random coding scheme over large blocks of transmitted signals .	In the last few years the so -- called `` linear deterministic '' model of relay channels has gained popularity as a means of studying the flow of information over wireless communication networks , and this approach generalizes the model of wireline networks which is standard in network optimization .	There is recent work extending the celebrated max -- flow/min -- cut theorem to the capacity of a unicast session over a linear deterministic relay network which is modeled by a layered directed graph .	We demonstrate the same result with a simple , deterministic , polynomial -- time algorithm which takes as input a single transmitted signal instead of a long block of signals .	Our capacity-achieving transmission scheme for a two -- layer network requires the extension of a one -- dimensional Rado -- Hall transversal theorem on the independent subsets of rows of a row -- partitioned matrix into a two -- dimensional variation for block matrices .
2	Then we develop low complexity adaptive robust version of the conjugate gradient ( CG ) algorithm to both estimate the steering vector mismatch and update the beamforming weights .	This paper proposes low-complexity robust adaptive beamforming ( RAB ) techniques based on shrinkage methods .	We firstly briefly review a Low-Complexity Shrinkage-Based Mismatch Estimation ( LOCSME ) batch algorithm to estimate the desired signal steering vector mismatch , in which the interference-plus-noise covariance ( INC ) matrix is also estimated with a recursive matrix shrinkage method .	A computational complexity study of the proposed and existing algorithms is carried out .	Simulations are conducted in local scattering scenarios and comparisons to existing RAB techniques are provided .
0	The observed amount of lithium for low metallicity population II stars ( known as the Spite plateau ) is a factor of $ \sim 3-5 $ lower than the predictions of the standard cosmology .	Since the observations are limited to the local Universe ( halo stars , globular clusters and satellites of the Milky Way ) it is possible that certain physical processes may have led to the spatial separation of lithium and local reduction of [ Li/H ] .	We study the question of lithium diffusion after the cosmological recombination in sub-Jeans dark matter haloes , taking into account that more than 95 % of lithium remains in the singly-ionized state at all times .	Large scattering cross sections on the rest of the ionized gas leads to strong coupling of lithium to protons and its initial direction of diffusion coincides with that of H $ ^+ $ .	In the rest frame of the neutral gas this leads to the diffusion of H $ ^+ $ and Li $ ^+ $ out of overdensities with the trend of reducing [ Li/H ] in the minima of gravitational wells relative to the primordial value .
1	The new approach is illustrated with an implemented fragment of Modern Hebrew verbs couched in MicroCUF , an expressive constraint logic formalism .	This paper describes a computational , declarative approach to prosodic morphology that uses inviolable constraints to denote small finite candidate sets which are filtered by a restrictive incremental optimization mechanism .	For generation and parsing of word forms , I propose a novel off-line technique to eliminate run-time optimization .	It produces a finite-state oracle that efficiently restricts the constraint interpreter 's search space .	As a byproduct , unknown words can be analyzed without special mechanisms .
0	A torus manifold is an even-dimensional manifold acted on by a half-dimensional torus with non-empty fixed point set and some additional orientation data .	It may be considered as a far-reaching generalisation of toric manifolds from algebraic geometry .	The orbit space of a torus manifold has a rich combinatorial structure , e.g. , it is a manifold with corners provided that the action is locally standard .	Here we investigate relationships between the cohomological properties of torus manifolds and the combinatorics of their orbit quotients .	We show that the cohomology ring of a torus manifold is generated by two-dimensional classes if and only if the quotient is a homology polytope .
3	The results are compared with the recent data measured by the Planck satellite .	We propose a single field inflationary model by generalizing the inverse power law potential from the intermediate model .	We study the implication of our model on the primordial anisotropy of cosmological microwave background radiation .	Specifically , we apply the slow-roll approximation to calculate the scalar spectral tilt $ n_s $ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $ r $ .	We found that by choosing proper values for the parameters , our model can well describe the Planck data .
2	All four are detected with clear significance ( 4-6 sigma ) and values for the central temperature decrements are in good agreement with measurements reported in the literature .	We present 30 GHz Sunyaev Zel'dovich ( SZ ) observations of a sample of four galaxy clusters with a prototype of the One Centimetre Receiver Array ( OCRA-p ) which is mounted on the Torun 32-m telescope .	The clusters ( Cl0016+16 , MS0451.6-0305 , MS1054.4-0321 and Abell 2218 ) are popular SZ targets and serve as commissioning observations .	We believe that systematic effects are successfully suppressed by our observing strategy .	The relatively short integration times required to obtain these results demonstrate the power of OCRA-p and its successors for future SZ studies .
1	When the surface has non-empty boundary , this vector space has a basis of cyclic reduced words in the generators of the fundamental group and their inverses .	Goldman and Turaev found a Lie bialgebra structure on the vector space generated by non-trivial free homotopy classes of curves on a surface .	We give a combinatorial algorithm to compute this Lie bialgebra on this vector space of cyclic words .	Using this presentation , we prove a generalization of Goldman 's result relating the bracket to disjointness of curve representatives when one of the classes is simple .	We exhibit some examples we found by programming the algorithm which answer negatively Turaev 's question about the characterization of simple curves in terms of the cobracket .
4	By contrast , photons emitted between the Ly_gamma and Ly-limit frequencies , produce effective cooling of the gas .	During the epoch of reionization a large number of photons were produced with frequencies below the hydrogen Lyman limit .	After redshifting into the closest resonance , these photons underwent multiple scatterings with atoms .	We examine the effect of these scatterings on the temperature of the neutral intergalactic medium ( IGM ) .	Continuum photons , emitted between the Ly_alpha and Ly_gamma frequencies , heat the gas after being redshifted into the H Ly_alpha or D Ly_beta resonance .
0	In this paper we discuss the potential of emerging spintorque devices for computing applications .	Recent proposals for spinbased computing schemes may be differentiated as all-spin vs. hybrid , programmable vs. fixed , and , Boolean vs. non-Boolean .	All spin logic-styles may offer high area-density due to small form-factor of nano-magnetic devices .	However , circuit and system-level design techniques need to be explored that leverage the specific spin-device characteristics to achieve energy-efficiency , performance and reliability comparable to those of CMOS .	The non-volatility of nanomagnets can be exploited in the design of energy and area-efficient programmable logic .
0	We apply the transformation of mixing azimuthal and internal coordinate or mixing time and internal coordinate to the 11D M-theory with a stack of M2-branes $ \bot $ M2-branes , then , through the mechanism of Kaluza-Klein reduction and a series of the T duality we obtain the corresponding background of a stack of D1-branes $ \bot $ D5-branes which , in the near-horizon limit , becomes the magnetic or electric Melvin field deformed $ AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4 $ .	We find the giant graviton solution in the deformed spacetime and see that the configuration whose angular momentum is within a finite region could has a fixed size and become more stable than the point-like graviton , in contrast to the undeformed giant graviton which only exists when its angular momentum is a specific value and could have arbitrary size .	We discuss in detail the properties of how the electric/magnetic Melvin field will affect the size of the giant gravitons .	We also adopt an ansatz to find the classical string solutions which are rotating in the deformed $ S^3 $ with an angular momentum in the rotation plane .	The spinning string and giant graviton solutions we obtained show that the external magnetic/electric flux will increase the solution energy .
0	If X is a geodesic metric space and $ x_1 , x_2 , x_3\in X $ , a { \it geodesic triangle } $ T=\ { x_1 , x_2 , x_3\ } $ is the union of the three geodesics $ [ x_1x_2 ] $ , $ [ x_2x_3 ] $ and $ [ x_3x_1 ] $ in $ X $ .	The space $ X $ is $ \delta $ -\emph { hyperbolic } $ ( $ in the Gromov sense $ ) $ if any side of $ T $ is contained in a $ \delta $ -neighborhood of the union of the two other sides , for every geodesic triangle $ T $ in $ X $ .	If $ X $ is hyperbolic , we denote by $ \delta ( X ) $ the sharp hyperbolicity constant of $ X $ , i.e. $ \delta ( X ) =\inf\ { \delta\ge 0 : \ , X \ , \text { is $ \delta $ -hyperbolic } \ , \ } \ , . $ Some previous works characterize the hyperbolic product graphs ( for the Cartesian product , strong product and lexicographic product ) in terms of properties of the factor graphs .	In this paper we characterize the hyperbolic product graphs for graph join $ G_1\uplus G_2 $ and the corona $ G_1\diamond G_2 $ : $ G_1\uplus G_2 $ is always hyperbolic , and $ G_1\diamond G_2 $ is hyperbolic if and only if $ G_1 $ is hyperbolic .	Furthermore , we obtain simple formulae for the hyperbolicity constant of the graph join $ G_1\uplus G_2 $ and the corona $ G_1\diamond G_2 $ .
1	Two particular well-documented structures are the hairpin vortices that move longitudinally above the wall and ejections inclined with respect to the wall that bring the fluid from the transient viscous layers underneath these vortices into the outer region of the boundary layer .	Numerous studies in the past 40 years have established that turbulent flow fields are populated by transient coherent structures that represent patches of fluids moving cohesively for significant distances before they are worn out by momentum exchange with the surrounding fluid .	It is proposed that the Karman universal constant in the logarithmic law the sine of the angle between the transient ejections and the direction normal to the wall .	The edge of the buffer layer is represented by a combination of the Karman constant and the damping function in the wall layer .	Computation of this angle from experimental data of velocity distributions in turbulent shear flows matches published traces of fronts of turbulence obtained from the time shifts in the peak of the correlation function of the velocity .
4	The intent of this work is to further investigate the algorithmic properties of switching classes .	Given a graph $ G $ , a vertex switch of $ v \in V ( G ) $ results in a new graph where neighbors of $ v $ become nonneighbors and vice versa .	This operation gives rise to an equivalence relation over the set of labeled digraphs on $ n $ vertices .	The equivalence class of $ G $ with respect to the switching operation is commonly referred to as $ G $ 's switching class .	The algebraic and combinatorial properties of switching classes have been studied in depth ; however , they have not been studied as thoroughly from an algorithmic point of view .
0	Non-repudiation protocols have an important role in many areas where secured transactions with proofs of participation are necessary .	Formal methods are clever and without error , therefore using them for verifying such protocols is crucial .	In this purpose , we show how to partially represent non-repudiation as a combination of authentications on the Fair Zhou-Gollmann protocol .	After discussing its limits , we define a new method based on the handling of the knowledge of protocol participants .	This method is very general and is of natural use , as it consists in adding simple annotations , like for authentication problems .
3	The results of this analysis suggest that promotion of char formation under thermal stress can actually increase the production of flammable volatiles .	A simple dynamical system that models the competitive thermokinetics and chemistry of cellulose decomposition is examined , with reference to evidence from experimental studies indicating that char formation is a low activation energy exothermal process and volatilization is a high activation energy endothermal process .	The thermohydrolysis chemistry at the core of the primary competition is described .	Essentially , the competition is between two nucleophiles , a molecule of water and an -OH group on C_6 of an end glucosyl cation , to form either a reducing chain fragment with the propensity to undergo the bond-forming reactions that ultimately form char or a levoglucosan-end-fragment that depolymerizes to volatile products .	Thus we would like to convey an important safety message in this paper : in some situations where heat and mass transfer is restricted in cellulosic materials , such as furnishings , insulation , and stockpiles , the use of char-promoting treatments for fire retardation may have the effect of increasing the risk of flaming combustion .
3	Extra phonon modes are observed around the wave vector q = ( 0.5,0,0 ) at E = 16.5 meV for the x = 0.27 sample .	The lattice dynamics of Ba1-xKxFe2As2 ( x = 0.00 , 0.27 ) have been studied by inelastic X-ray scattering measurement at room temperature .	K doping induces the softening and broadening of phonon modes in the energy range E = 10-15 meV .	Analysis with a Born-von Karman force-constant model indicates that the softening results from reduced interatomic force constants around ( Ba , K ) sites following the displacement of divalent Ba by monovalent K. The phonon broadening may be explained by the local distortions induced by the K substitution .	These modes may arise either from the local disorder induced by K doping or from electron-phonon coupling .
1	We use eight large dark-matter only simulations onto which we paint the Lyman alpha field using the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation .	We present the first simulation of the signature of baryonic acoustic oscillations ( BAO ) in Lyman alpha forest data containing 180,000 mock quasar sight-lines .	We argue that this approach should be sufficient for the mean signature on the scales of interest .	Our results indicate that Lyman alpha flux provides a good tracer of the underlying dark matter field on large scales and that redshift space distortions are well described by a simple linear theory prescription .	We compare Fourier and configuration space approaches to describing the signal and argue that configuration space statistics provide useful data compression .
1	vol.110 ( 2003 ) , 723 .	Based on the gauge invariant variables proposed in our previous paper [ K. Nakamura , Prog.Theor.Phys .	] , some formulae of the perturbative curvatures of each order are derived .	We follow the general framework of the second order gauge invariant perturbation theory on arbitrary background spacetime to derive these formulae .	These perturbative curvatures do have the same form as the definitions of gauge invariant variables for arbitrary perturbative fields which are previously proposed .
2	The dependence of these band gaps as a function of scatterer density , strength , and water depth is analyzed .	Bloch wavefunctions are used to derive dispersion relations for water wave propagation in the presence of an infinite array of periodically arranged surface scatterers .	For one dimensional periodicity ( stripes ) , band gaps for wavevectors in the direction of periodicity are found corresponding to multiple Bragg scattering .	We find in contrast to band gap behavior in electronic , photonic , and acoustic systems , these gaps can increase with excitation frequency $ \omega $ .	Thus , higher order Bragg scattering can play a dominant role in suppressing wave propagation .
0	We present 14 N^0 measurements from our HIRES/Keck database of damped Lya abundances .	These data are combined with measurements from the recent and past literature to build an homogeneous , uniform set of observations .	We examine photoionization diagnostics like Fe^++ and Ar^0 in the majority of the complete sample and assess the impact of ionization corrections on N/alpha and alpha/H values derived from observed ionic column densities of N^0 , Si^+ , H^0 , and S^+ .	Our final sample of 19 N/alpha , alpha/H pairs appears bimodal ; the majority of systems show N/alpha values consistent with metal-poor emission regions in the local universe but a small sub-sample exhibit significantly lower N/alpha ratios .	Contrary to previous studies of N/alpha in the damped systems , our sample shows little scatter within each sub-sample .
3	We show that the dynamics of the genetic algorithm depend in a critical way on the parameter $ $ \pi \ , =\ , \sigma ( 1-p_C ) ( 1-p_M ) ^\ell\ , . $ $ If $ \pi & lt ; 1 $ , then the genetic algorithm operates in a disordered regime : an advantageous mutant disappears with probability larger than $ 1-1/m^\beta $ , where $ \beta $ is a positive exponent .	We study the simple genetic algorithm with a ranking selection mechanism ( linear ranking or tournament ) .	We denote by $ \ell $ the length of the chromosomes , by $ m $ the population size , by $ p_C $ the crossover probability and by $ p_M $ the mutation probability .	We introduce a parameter $ \sigma $ , called the selection drift , which measures the selection intensity of the fittest chromosome .	If $ \pi & gt ; 1 $ , then the genetic algorithm operates in a quasispecies regime : an advantageous mutant invades a positive fraction of the population with probability larger than a constant $ p^* $ ( which does not depend on $ m $ ) .
3	We obtain these late-time results by developing the so-called MST formalism and by expanding the various MST Fourier-mode quantities for small frequency .	We present an analysis of the behaviour at late-times of linear field perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole space-time .	In particular , we give explicit analytic expressions for the field perturbations ( for a specific multipole ) of general spin up to the first four orders at late times .	These expressions are valid at arbitrary radius and include , apart from the well-known power-law tail decay at leading order ( $ \sim t^ { -2\ell-3 } $ ) , a new logarithmic behaviour at third leading order ( $ \sim t^ { -2\ell-5 } \ln t $ ) .	While we give explicit expansions up to the first four leading orders ( for small-frequency for the Fourier modes , for late-time for the field perturbation ) , we give a prescription for obtaining expressions to arbitrary order within a `perturbative regime ' .
0	The lattice Boltzmann method can be used to simulate flow through porous media with full geometrical resolution .	With such a direct numerical simulation , it becomes possible to study fundamental effects which are difficult to assess either by developing macroscopic mathematical models or experiments .	We first evaluate the lattice Boltzmann method with various boundary handling of the solid-wall and various collision operators to assess their suitability for large scale direct numerical simulation of porous media flow .	A periodic pressure drop boundary condition is used to mimic the pressure driven flow through the simple sphere pack in a periodic domain .	The evaluation of the method is done in the Darcy regime and the results are compared to a semi-analytic solution .
1	From this point of view , the Born rule for light is derived , and the double-slit experiment is analysed in detail .	In this paper , I argue that light is a continuous classical electromagnetic wave , while the observed so-called quantum nature of the interaction of light with matter is connected to the discrete ( atomic ) structure of matter and to the specific nature of the light-atom interaction .	I show that the double-slit experiment can be explained without using the concept of a `` photon '' , solely on the basis of classical electrodynamics .	I show that within this framework , the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for a `` photon '' has a simple physical meaning not related to the fundamental limitations in accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum or time and energy .	I argue also that we can avoid the paradoxes connected with the wave-particle duality of the electron if we consider some classical wave field - an `` electron wave '' - instead of electrons as the particles and consider the wave equations ( Dirac , Klein-Gordon , Pauli and Schrodinger ) as the field equations similar to Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field .
1	Recently , a powerful new algorithm called Affinity Propagation ( AP ) based on message-passing techniques was proposed by Frey and Dueck \cite { Frey07 } .	Motivation : Similarity-measure based clustering is a crucial problem appearing throughout scientific data analysis .	In AP , each cluster is identified by a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to , and exemplars have to refer to themselves .	Albeit its proved power , AP in its present form suffers from a number of drawbacks .	The hard constraint of having exactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped clusters , and leads to suboptimal performance , { \it e.g . } , in analyzing gene expression data .
4	In parallel , stellar distances and extinctions are estimated self-consistently by means of a 2D Bayesian method , from spectroscopically-derived stellar parameters and photometric data .	We study how diffuse interstellar bands ( DIBs ) measured toward distance-distributed target stars can be used to locate dense interstellar ( IS ) clouds in the Galaxy and probe a line-of-sight ( LOS ) kinematical structure , a potential useful tool when gaseous absorption lines are saturated or not available in the spectral range .	Cool target stars are numerous enough for this purpose .	We have devised automated DIB fitting methods appropriate to cool star spectra and multiple IS components .	The data is fitted with a combination of a synthetic stellar spectrum , a synthetic telluric transmission , and empirical DIB profiles .
1	The Hubbard interaction induces Kondo peaks at low temperatures for an odd number of dots .	Using exact-diagonalization of small clusters and Dyson equation embedding techniques , the conductance $ G $ of linear arrays of quantum dots is investigated .	Remarkably , the Kondo peak is split in half by a deep minimum , and the conductance vanishes at one value of the gate voltage .	Tentative explanations for this unusual effect are proposed , including an interference process between two channels contributing to $ G $ , with one more and one less particle than the exactly-solved cluster ground-state .	The Hubbard interaction and fermionic statistics of electrons also appear to be important to understand this phenomenon .
1	In 2004 , it was conjectured by Fendleyet al .	The enumeration of independent sets of regular graphs is of interest in statistical mechanics , as it corresponds to the solution of hard-particle models .	that for some rectangular grids , with toric boundary conditions , the alternating number of independent sets is extremely simple .	More precisely , under a coprimality condition on the sides of the rectangle , the number of independent sets of even and odd cardinality always differ by 1 .	In physics terms , this means looking at the hard-particle model on these grids at activity -1 .
4	Quantitative agreement is obtained with numerical model calculations which include photoinduced absorption and deformation of individual scatterers .	We demonstrate ultrafast dephasing in the random transport of light through a layer consisting of strongly scattering GaP nanowires .	Dephasing results in a nonlinear intensity modulation of individual pseudomodes which is 100 times larger than that of bulk GaP .	Different contributions to the nonlinear response are separated using total transmission , white-light frequency correlation , and statistical pseudomode analysis .	A dephasing time of $ 1.2\pm 0.2 $ ~ps is found .
4	We find that most of these models have difficulties in explaining , by themselves , both the population of the S-stars ( & lt ; 0.05 pc ) , and the population of the young B-stars further away ( up to 0.5 pc ) .	Regular star formation is thought to be inhibited close to the massive black hole ( MBH ) in the Galactic center .	Nevertheless , tens of young main sequence B stars have been observed in an isotropic distribution close to it .	Various models have been suggested for the formation of the B-stars closest to the MBH ( & lt ; 0.05 pc ; the S-stars ) , typically involving the migration of these stars from their original birthplace to their currently observed position .	Here we explore the orbital phase space distribution of the B-stars throughout the central pc expected from the various suggested models for the origin of the B-stars .
1	It is argued that it is in the spirit of the semiclassical wave function formalism to make necessary rationalization of respective quantities accompanied the procedure of the semiclassical quantization in polygon billiards .	A consistent scheme of semiclassical quantization in polygon billiards by wave function formalism is presented .	Unfolding rational polygon billiards ( RPB ) into corresponding Riemann surfaces ( RS ) periodic structures of the latter are demonstrated with 2g independent periods on the respective multitori with g as their genuses .	However it is the two dimensional real space of the real linear combinations of these periods which is used for quantizing RPB .	A class of doubly rational polygon billiards ( DRPB ) is distinguished for which these real linear relations are rational and their semiclassical quantization by wave function formalism is presented .
2	At large enough plasma beta the turbulence breaks out into ideal ballooning modes and saturates only by depleting the free energy in the background pressure gradient .	The competition between drift wave and interchange physics in general E-cross-B drift turbulence is studied with computations in three dimensional tokamak flux tube geometry .	For a given set of background scales , the parameter space can be covered by the plasma beta and drift wave collisionality .	At high collisionality it finds a more gradual transition to resistive ballooning .	At moderate beta and collisionality it retains drift wave character , qualitatively identical to simple two dimensional slab models .
4	We obtain $ S^+ ( D^* \pi ) = +0.057 \pm 0.019 ( \mathrm { stat } ) \pm 0.012 ( \mathrm { sys } ) $ and $ S^- ( D^* \pi ) = +0.038 \pm 0.020 ( \mathrm { stat } ) \pm 0.010 ( \mathrm { sys } ) $ .	We report preliminary results on time-dependent CP asymmetries in $ B \to D^ { *\mp } \pi^ { \pm } $ decays .	The CP asymmetry in these decays is proportional to $ 2R_ { D^ { * } \pi } \sin ( 2\phi_1 + \phi_3 \pm \delta_ { D^ { * } \pi } ) $ , where $ R_ { D^ { * } \pi } $ is the ratio of the magnitudes of the doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed and Cabibbo-favoured amplitudes , $ \delta_ { D^ { * } \pi } $ is the strong phase difference between them , and $ \phi_1 $ and $ \phi_3 $ are two angles of the CKM Unitarity Triangle .	This study is based on a large data sample that contains 657 million $ B\bar { B } $ pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $ e^+ e^- $ collider at the $ \Upsilon ( 4S ) $ resonance .	We use a partial reconstruction technique , wherein signal $ B \to D^ { *\mp } \pi^ { \pm } $ events are identified using information only from the $ \pi^ { \pm } $ from the $ B $ decay and the charged slow pion from the subsequent decay of the $ D^ { *- } $ .
3	After calculating polarized valon distributions and all parton distributions in a valon , polarized parton density in a proton are available .	In this paper polarized valon distribution is derived from unpolarized valon distribution .	In driving polarized valon distribution some unknown parameters exist which must be determined by fitting to experimental data .	Here we have used Bernstein polynomial method to fit QCD predictions for the moments of $ g_1^p $ structure function , to suitably the constructed appropriate average quantities of the E143 and SMC experimental data .	The results are used to evaluate the spin components of proton .
0	Very little has been explored about the narrative as a process when constructing entertainment for interactive media .	Simultaneously , the interest in narrative vehicles increases while certain occupations , seeing the narrative as a structure , obscure the examination of the process of selecting , arranging and rendering story material .	To correct this deficiency , a method for a narrative bridging that encourages research and design while exploring narration as a process , is proposed with the aim to not diminish the properties of the interactive media .	This method focuses on the initial phase where establishing and handling the information takes place and creates a foundation that precedes its systematization and computation .	The aim is to give designers a comfortable design tool that firmly aids the design without interfering with creativity , and at the same time aids the construction of interplay between narration , spatiality and interactivity .
4	We study the interaction of these kinks with disorder that arises from the spatial variations of the friction constant or fracture energy .	We study , both analytically and numerically , the dynamics of elastic boundaries such as crack fronts in fracture and surfaces of contact in solid on solid friction .	The elastic waves in the solid give rise to kinks that move with a characteristic velocity along the boundary .	As stopping kinks pass through they cause moving parts of the boundary to stop .	Starting kinks cause stationary parts of the boundary to move .
0	We present observations of the center of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6273 , obtained with the HST/WFPC2 camera as part of the snapshot program GO-7470 .	A B , V color-magnitude diagram ( CMD ) for ~28,000 stars is presented and discussed .	The most prominent feature of the CMD , identified for the first time in this paper , is the extended horizontal branch blue tail ( EBT ) with a clear double-peaked distribution and a significant gap .	The EBT of NGC 6273 is compared with the EBTs of seven other globular clusters for which we have a CMD in the same photometric system .	From this comparison we conclude that all the globular clusters in our sample with an EBT show at least one gap along the HB , which could have similar origins .
2	Due to the in-plane electric field induced asymmetric momentum distribution in one lead , continuous flows of spin currents are driven through a barrier by a AC field .	We propose a spin cell based on photon-assisted tunneling through a conventional semiconductor barrier .	The Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction is included to break the spin rotation symmetry .	The net charge current remains zero .	The spin current via photon-assisted tunneling can be readily adjusted via tuning the AC frequency or the in-plane electric field .
2	Furthermore we present data for a third quasar , CTCV J0322-4653 , which has also been found in our study , but which has already been included in the list of Maza et al .	We present the discovery of two new quasars , that initially appeared as candidate cataclysmic variables ( CVs ) in a list of the Calan-Tololo objective prism survey .	However , additional spectroscopic and photometric observations revealed their true nature .	( 1996 ) as CTS 0639 .	Here we present the spectra for the first time .
0	A novel factorization formula is presented for the longitudinal structure function $ F_L $ near the elastic region $ x \to 1 $ of deeply inelastic scattering .	In moment space this formula can resum all contributions to $ F_L $ that are of order $ \ln^k N/N $ .	This is achieved by defining a new jet function which probes the transverse momentum of the struck parton in the target at leading twist .	The anomalous dimension $ \gamma_ { J^\prime } $ of this new jet operator generates in moment space the logarithmic enhancements coming from the fragmentation of the current jet in the final state .	It is also shown how the suggested factorization for $ F_L $ is related to the corresponding one for $ F_2 $ in the same kinematic region .
3	This theory is applicable to quantum emulators in thermal equilibrium .	We study a system coupled to external degrees of freedom , called bath , where we assume that the total system , consisting of system and bath is in equilibrium .	An expansion in the coupling between system and bath leads to a general form of the reduced density matrix of the system as a function of the bath selfenergy .	The coupling to the bath results in a renormalization of the energies of the system and in a change of the eigenbasis .	Undesired external degrees of freedom can affect their reliability .
4	We find an iterative and systematic encoding algorithm for Schubert union codes with linear complexity .	In this article we prove that Schubert union codes are Tanner codes constructed with the point -- line incidence geometry that Schubert varieties inherit from the Grassmannian .	We do this by first finding an lengthening algorithm for Tanner codes .	This algorithm finds the entries of a codeword of a Tanner code from the entries in a given subset of its positions .	We find sufficient conditions on the initial set and the initial positions such that a codeword is determined from the component codes only .
0	In this paper we present a rigorous analysis of the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector ( AODV ) routing protocol using a formal specification in AWN ( Algebra for Wireless Networks ) , a process algebra which has been specifically tailored for the modelling of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks and Wireless Mesh Network protocols .	Our formalisation models the exact details of the core functionality of AODV , such as route discovery , route maintenance and error handling .	We demonstrate how AWN can be used to reason about critical protocol correctness properties by providing a detailed proof of loop freedom .	In contrast to evaluations using simulation or other formal methods such as model checking , our proof is generic and holds for any possible network scenario in terms of network topology , node mobility , traffic pattern , etc .	A key contribution of this paper is the demonstration of how the reasoning and proofs can relatively easily be adapted to protocol variants .
4	By choosing various refractive index distribution function $ n ( z ) $ , we can obtain more width or more narrow band gap structure than conventional photonic crystals .	In the paper , we present a new kind of function photonic crystals , which refractive index is a function of space position .	Unlike conventional PCs , which structure grow from two materials , A and B , with different dielectric constants $ \epsilon_ { A } $ and $ \epsilon_ { B } $ .	By Fermat principle , we give the motion equations of light in one-dimensional , two-dimensional and three-dimensional function photonic crystals .	For one-dimensional function photonic crystals , we study the dispersion relation , band gap structure and transmissivity , and compare them with conventional photonic crystals .
4	Our method of proof is very much based on the works of Rakhmanov on the max-min variational problem and of Mart\'inez-Finkelshtein and Rakhmanov on critical measures .	Curves in the complex plane that satisfy the S-property were first introduced by Stahl and they were further studied by Gonchar and Rakhmanov in the 1980s .	Rakhmanov recently showed the existence of curves with the S-property in a harmonic external field by means of a max-min variational problem in logarithmic potential theory .	This is done in a fairly general setting , which however does not include the important special case of an external field given by the real part of a polynomial of degree greater than or equal to 2 .	In this paper we give a detailed proof of the existence of a curve with the S-property in the external field given by the real part of a polynomial V , within the collection of all curves that connect two or more pre-assigned directions at infinity in which the real part of V grows .
3	KATRIN will be built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe on site of the KIT Campus North .	The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment KATRIN will allow a model independent measurement of the neutrino mass scale with an expected sensitivity of 0.2 eV/c^ { 2 } ( 90 % C.L . )	and so will help to clarify the role of neutrinos in the early universe is the direct measurement of the mass of the electron anti-neutrino .	KATRIN investigates spectroscopically the electron spectrum from tritium beta- decay close to the kinematic endpoint of 18.6 keV with a high resolution electro-static filter of unprecedented energy resolution of 0.93 eV .	For such a precise mass-determination a key parameter is the stability of the source in terms of beta-activity und isotopic purity .
2	The analysis of the phenomenon shows that the effect is related to combinatorics in relation with the existence of the two independent species cations and anions .	In this paper , we discuss the phenomenon of a spontaneous polarisation of a neutral hard planar interface for valence asymmetric coulombic systems .	Within a field theoretical description , we account for the existence of non trivial charge density and electric potential profiles .	This simple and basic feature is related to the quantum mechanical properties of the system .	The theoretical results are compared with numerical simulations data and are shown to be in very good agreement , which a fortiori justifies our physical interpretation .
2	Particular emphasis is put on the topological properties of algebraic maps .	This paper has two aims .	The former is to give an introduction to our earlier work on the Hodge theory of algebraic maps and more generally to some of the main themes of the theory of perverse sheaves and to some of its geometric applications .	The latter is to prove a motivic version of the decomposition theorem for the resolution of a threefold Y .	This result allows to define a pure motive whose Betti realization is the intersection cohomology of Y .
0	The present work deals with the two-dimensional incompressible , laminar , steady-state boundary layer equations .	First , we determinea family of velocity distributions outside the boundary layer suchthat these problems may have similarity solutions .	Then , we examenin detail new exact solutions , called Pseudo -- similarity , where the external velocity varies inversely-linear with the distance along the surface $ ( U_e ( x ) = U_\infty x^ { -1 } ) .	The present work deals with the two-dimensional incompressible , laminar , steady-state boundary layer equations .	First , we determine a family of velocity distributions outside the boundary layer such that these problems may have similarity solutions .
1	The growth rate of the fastest growing mode drops rapidly with current sheet thickness but increases slowly with the strength of the guide field .	We examine the effect of an external guide field and current sheet thickness on the growth rates and nature of three dimensional unstable modes of an electron current sheet driven by electron shear flow .	The fastest growing mode is tearing type only for thin current sheets ( half thickness $ \approx d_e $ , where $ d_e=c/\omega_ { pe } $ is electron inertial length ) and zero guide field .	For finite guide field or thicker current sheets , fastest growing mode is non-tearing type .	However growth rates of the fastest 2-D tearing mode and 3-D non-tearing mode are comparable for thin current sheets ( $ d_e & lt ; $ half thickness $ & lt ; 2\ , d_e $ ) and small guide field ( of the order of the asymptotic value of the component of magnetic field supporting electron current sheet ) .
2	We find that this scenario predicts a large , gravitational wave background that should be resolved into individual sources with space interferometers such as the proposed Laser Interferometric Space Antenna ( LISA ) .	We study the gravitational wave background produced from the formation and assembly of supermassive black holes within the cosmological paradigm of hierarchical structure formation .	In particular , we focus on a supermassive black hole formation scenario in which the present-day population of supermassive black holes is built from high-mass seed black holes and we compute the concomitant spectrum of gravitational radiation produced by mergers of the seed black holes .	The number of inspiral , merger and ringdown events above a signal to noise ratio of 5 that result from massive black hole seeds is of order 10^3 .	This prediction is robust and insensitive to several of the details of the model .
2	Examining the star-counts profile of the stream plus contaminating populations , we find no evidence for significant under-densities , and find only a single significant over-density .	We present an analysis of wide-field photometric surveys of the Palomar 5 globular cluster and its stellar stream , based on g- and r-band measures together with narrow-band DDO51 photometry .	In this first study , we use the deep ( g , r ) data to measure the incidence of gaps and peaks along the stream .	This is at odds with earlier studies based on matched-filter maps derived from shallower SDSS data if the contaminating population possesses plausible spatial properties .	The lack of substantial sub-structure along the stream may be used in future dynamical simulations to examine the incidence of dark matter sub-halos in the Galactic halo .
0	Using observations in the COSMOS field , we report an intriguing correlation between the star formation activity of massive ( ~10^ { 11.4 } \msol ) central galaxies , their stellar masses , and the large-scale ( ~10 Mpc ) environments of their group-mass ( ~10^ { 13.6 } \msol ) dark matter halos .	Probing the redshift range z= [ 0.2,1.0 ] , our measurements come from two independent sources : an X-ray detected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation derived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics .	At z=1 , we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two less than in passive centrals at the same halo mass .	This implies that the presence or lack of star formation in group-scale centrals can not be a stochastic process .	By z=0 , the offset reverses , probably as a result of the different growth rates of these objects .
4	We then perform a linear stability analysis of this base flow by considering its triadic resonance with two free Kelvin modes .	Flows forced by a precessional motion can exhibit instabilities of crucial importance , whether they concern the fuel of a flying object or the liquid core of a telluric planet .	So far , stability analyses of these flows have focused on the special case of a resonant forcing .	Here , we address the instability of the flow inside a precessing cylinder in the general case .	We first show that the base flow forced by the cylinder precession is a superposition of a vertical or horizontal shear flow and an infinite sum of forced modes .
2	The spiral shocks also produce structure in the spiral arms , provided the gas is cold ( & lt ; 1000 K ) .	We present ongoing hydrodynamic and MHD simulations of molecular cloud formation in spiral galaxies .	The hydrodynamic results show the formation of molecular gas clouds where spiral shocks compress atomic gas to high densities .	When both hot and cold components of the ISM are modeled , this structure is enhanced .	Properties such as the clump mass spectra and spatial distribution will be compared from clouds identified in these simulations .
0	Effective Lagrangian for pure Yang-Mills gauge fields invariant under the standard space-time and local gauge SU ( 3 ) transformations is considered .	It is demonstrated that a set of twelve degenerated minima exists as soon as a nonzero gluon condensate is postulated .	The minima are connected to each other by the parity transformations and Weyl group transformations associated with the color su ( 3 ) algebra .	The presence of degenerated discrete minima in the effective potential leads to the solutions of the effective Euclidean equations of motion in the form of the kink-like gauge field configurations interpolating between different minima .	Spectrum of charged scalar field in the kink background is discussed .
0	The asteroseismic and planetary studies , like all research related to stars , need precise and accurate stellar atmospheric parameters as input .	We aim at deriving the effective temperature ( Teff ) , the surface gravity ( log g ) , the metallicity ( [ Fe/H ] ) , the projected rotational velocity ( v sin i ) and the MK type for 169 F , G , K , and M-type Kepler targets which were observed spectroscopically from the ground with five different instruments .	We use two different spectroscopic methods to analyse 189 high-resolution , high-signal-to-noise spectra acquired for the 169 stars .	For 67 stars , the spectroscopic atmospheric parameters are derived for the ? first time .	KIC 9693187 and 11179629 are discovered to be double-lined spectroscopic binary systems .
1	Interatomic interactions were modeled by using the effective q-TIP4P/F potential for flexible water .	Structural and thermodynamic properties of high-density amorphous ( HDA ) ice have been studied by path-integral molecular dynamics simulations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble .	Quantum nuclear motion is found to affect several observable properties of the amorphous solid .	At low temperature ( T = 50 K ) the molar volume of HDA ice is found to increase by 6 % , and the intramolecular O -- H distance rises by 1.4 % due to quantum motion .	Peaks in the radial distribution function of HDA ice are broadened respect to their classical expectancy .
4	The median value for |\Delta z|/ ( 1+z ) for the full sample is 0.006 .	We describe redMaPPer , a new red-sequence cluster finder specifically designed to make optimal use of ongoing and near-future large photometric surveys .	The algorithm has multiple attractive features : ( 1 ) It can iteratively self-train the red-sequence model based on minimal spectroscopic training sample , an important feature for high redshift surveys ; ( 2 ) It can handle complex masks with varying depth ; ( 3 ) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies ; ( 4 ) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P ( z ) ; ( 5 ) Similarly , clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies , each with corresponding centering probabilities ; ( 6 ) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient : it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog in ~500 CPU hours ; ( 7 ) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance , the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies , and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs is superb .	We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to ~10,000 deg^2 of SDSS DR8 data , and present the resulting catalog of ~25,000 clusters over the redshift range 0.08 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.55 .	The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian , with a scatter \sigma_z ~ 0.006 at z~0.1 , increasing to \sigma_z~0.02 at z~0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit .
2	This paper deals with calculations with canonical ensembles .	A great many observables seen in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions can be explained on the basis of statistical equilibrium .	Calculations based on statistical equilibrium can be implemented in microcanonical ensemble ( energy and number of particles in the system are kept fixed ) , canonical ensemble ( temperature and number of particles are kept fixed ) or grand canonical ensemble ( fixed temperature and a variable number of particles but with an assigned average ) .	A recursive relation developed recently allows calculations with arbitrary precision for many nuclear problems .	Calculations are done to study the nature of phase transition in intermediate energy heavy ion collision , to study the caloric curves for nuclei and to explore the possibility of negative specific heat because of the finiteness of nuclear systems .
1	The results reveal stable ferroelectric states in thin films less than 10 \AA thick with polarization normal to the surface .	We report studies of ferroelectricity in ultra-thin perovskite films with realistic electrodes .	Under short-circuit boundary conditions , the screening effect of realistic electrodes and the influence of real metal/oxide interfaces on thin film polarization are investigated .	Our studies indicate that metallic screening from the electrodes is affected by the difference in work functions at oxide surfaces .	We demonstrate this effect in ferroelectric PbTiO $ _3 $ and BaTiO $ _3 $ films .
0	Dark matter detectors built primarily to probe elastic scattering of WIMPs on nuclei are also precise probes of light , weakly coupled particles that may be absorbed by the detector material .	In this paper , we derive constraints on the minimal model of dark matter comprised of long-lived vector states V ( dark photons ) in the 0.01-100 keV mass range .	The absence of an ionization signal in direct detection experiments such as XENON10 and XENON100 places a very strong constraint on the dark photon mixing angle , down to $ O ( 10^ { -15 } ) $ , assuming that dark photons comprise the dominant fraction of dark matter .	This sensitivity to dark photon dark matter exceeds the indirect bounds derived from stellar energy loss considerations over a significant fraction of the available mass range .	We also revisit indirect constraints from $ V\to 3\gamma $ decay and show that limits from modifications to the cosmological ionization history are comparable to the updated limits from the diffuse gamma-ray flux .
4	We ascertain the temporal progression of the dust mass , the dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal mass ratios as well as other physical properties of a galaxy and study their dependence on the mass of the galaxy , the IMF , dust production efficiencies and dust destruction in the ISM .	We have developed a numerical galactic chemical evolution model .	The model is constructed such that the effect of a wide range of parameters can be investigated .	It takes into account results from stellar evolution models , a differentiation between diverse types of core collapse SNe and the contribution of AGB stars in the mass range 3-8 Msun .	We consider the lifetime-dependent yield injection into the ISM by all sources as well as dust destruction due to SN shocks in the ISM .
2	Encryption and Decryption blocks of data encryption standard ( DES ) cryptosystem and dependency among themselves are explained in detail with the help of block diagram .	The paper describes the design and hardware implementation of 32-bit encrypted MIPS processor based on MIPS pipeline architecture .	The organization of pipeline stages in such a way that pipeline can be clocked at high frequency .	In order to increase the processor functionality and performance , especially for security applications we include three new instructions 32-bit LKLW , LKUW and CRYPT .	The design has been synthesized at 40nm process technology targeting using Xilinx Virtex-6 device .
2	We detect 31 galaxies , 27 of which are well known cluster members .	We have carried out a fully sampled large area ( $ 4^ { \circ } \times 8^ { \circ } $ ) 21cm \HI line survey of part of the Virgo cluster using the Jodrell Bank multi-beam instrument .	The survey has a sensitivity some 3 times better than the standard HIJASS and HIPASS surveys .	The four new detections have been confirmed in the HIPASS data and by follow up Jodrell Bank pointed observations .	One object lies behind M86 , but the other 3 have no obvious optical counter parts upon inspection of the digital sky survey fields .
3	We show that a VCSP instance consisting of a single boolean predicate $ P ( x , y ) $ ( e.g. , for cut , $ P=\mbox { XOR } $ ) can be sparsified into $ O ( |V|/\epsilon^2 ) $ constraints if and only if the number of inputs that satisfy $ P $ is anything but one ( i.e. , $ |P^ { -1 } ( 1 ) | \neq 1 $ ) .	A valued constraint satisfaction problem ( VCSP ) instance $ ( V , \Pi , w ) $ is a set of variables $ V $ with a set of constraints $ \Pi $ weighted by $ w $ .	Given a VCSP instance , we are interested in a re-weighted sub-instance $ ( V , \Pi'\subset \Pi , w ' ) $ such that preserves the value of the given instance ( under every assignment to the variables ) within factor $ 1\pm\epsilon $ .	A well-studied special case is cut sparsification in graphs , which has found various applications .	Furthermore , this sparsity bound is tight unless $ P $ is a relatively trivial predicate .
1	This allows us to view classical background geometries as quantum Bose-condensates with large occupation numbers of soft gravitons .	We establish a quantum measure of classicality in the form of the occupation number , $ N $ , of gravitons in a gravitational field .	We show that among all possible sources of a given physical length , $ N $ is maximized by the black hole and coincides with its entropy .	The emerging quantum mechanical picture of a black hole is surprisingly simple and fully parameterized by $ N $ .	The black hole is a leaky bound-state in form of a cold Bose-condensate of $ N $ weakly-interacting soft gravitons of wave-length $ \sqrt { N } $ times the Planck length and of quantum interaction strength 1/N .
3	Several tests have been performed under realistic beam conditions to test the feasibility of the measurement and the proof of principle of the trigger system .	Several experiments engaging kaon beams have been carried out to study the existence of deeply bound kaonic state .	We proposed an alternative method , which exploits a p+p reaction at 3.5GeV incoming energy to search for the most elementary of the kaonic states : ppK- .	This experiment is planned with the FOPI spectrometer at GSI and a silicon-based trigger system has been developed to increase the detection capability of the existing system for the reaction of interest .	The positive results of such measurements are shown in this contribution together with the expected rates extracted from simulations .
0	We present a class of chiral non-supersymmetric D=4 field theories in which quadratic divergences appear only at two loops .	They may be depicted as `` SUSY quivers '' in which the nodes represent a gauge group with extended e.g. , N=4 SUSY whereas links represent bifundamental matter fields which transform as chiral multiplets with respect to different N=1 subgroups .	One can obtain this type of field theories from simple D6-brane configurations on Type IIA string theory compactified on a six-torus .	We discuss the conditions under which this kind of structure is obtained from D6-brane intersections .	We also discuss some aspects of the effective low-energy field theory .
3	They are mainly characterized by unusual spatial distributions of wave functions , and their density of states shows many prominent symmetric and weakly asymmetric peaks .	Nonuniform bilayer graphene nanoribbons exhibit rich magnetic quantization .	Their electronic and optical properties strongly depend on the competition among magnetic quantization , lateral confinement , and stacking configuration .	There are four categories of magneto-electronic energy spectra , namely monolayer-like , bilayer-like , coexistent , and highly distorted quasi-Landau-level spectra .	The unusual quantized modes can generate diverse magneto-optical spectra .
2	Their masses , estimated from the comparison of their bolometric luminosities and theoretical models for the age range of the association , are 60+/-20 and 14^ { +2 } _ { -8 } MJup , respectively .	We present the discovery of a companion near the deuterium burning mass limit located at a very wide distance , at an angular separation of 4.6+/-0.1 arcsec ( projected distance of ~ 670 AU ) from UScoCTIO108 , a brown dwarf of the very young Upper Scorpius association .	Optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy confirm the cool nature of both objects , with spectral types of M7 and M9.5 , respectively , and that they are bona fide members of the association , showing low gravity and features of youth .	The existence of this object around a brown dwarf at this wide orbit suggests that the companion is unlikely to have formed in a disk based on current planet formation models .	Because this system is rather weakly bound , they did not probably form through dynamical ejection of stellar embryos .
1	The basic ingredients of our analysis are the NVSS polarization data , the multifrequency study of polarization properties of the B3-VLA sample ( Mack et al .	We investigate the statistical properties of the polarized emission of extragalactic radio sources and estimate their contribution to the power spectrum of polarization fluctuations in the microwave region .	2002 ) which has allowed us to quantify Faraday depolarization effects , and the 15 GHz survey by Taylor et al .	( 2001 ) , which has provided strong constraints on the high-frequency spectral indices of sources .	The polarization degree of both steep- and flat-spectrum at 1.4 GHz is found to be anti-correlated with the flux density .
3	In conclusion a hydrodynamic example of the entropy of a liquid film is considered .	It is shown that the violation of the positiveness of the entropy due to the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction claimed in several papers is an artifact related to an improper interpretation of the `` Casimir entropy '' , which actually is a difference of two positive terms .	It is explained that at definite condition this `` Casimir entropy '' must be negative .	A direct derivation of the low temperature behavior of the surface entropy of a metallic surface in conditions of the anomalous skin effect is given and singular temperature dependency of this quantity is discussed .	It occurs that the entropy of a film of finite thickness and a liquid half-space behave differently at T tends to 0 .
3	We discuss various modifications of this problem .	We study the following open problem , suggested by Barker and Larman .	Let $ K $ and $ L $ be convex bodies in $ \mathbb R^n $ ( $ n\ge 2 $ ) that contain a Euclidean ball $ B $ in their interiors .	If $ \mathrm { vol } _ { n-1 } ( K\cap H ) = \mathrm { vol } _ { n-1 } ( L\cap H ) $ for every hyperplane $ H $ that supports $ B $ , does it follow that $ K=L $ ?	In particular , we show that in $ \mathbb R^2 $ the answer is positive if the above condition is true for two disks , none of which is contained in the other .
3	The coupling between the system and the environment guarantees the translational invariance of the system in the absence of an external potential .	The influence of the environment in the thermal equilibrium properties of a bipartite continuous variable quantum system is studied .	The problem is treated within a system-plus-reservoir approach .	The considered model reproduces the conventional Brownian motion when the two particles are far apart and induces an effective interaction between them , depending on the choice of the spectral function of the bath .	The entanglement between the particles is measured by the logarithmic negativity , which is shown to monotonically decrease with the increase of the temperature .
3	Along the way , the question of the cardinality of the collection of finiteness spaces on N is answered .	This short note presents a new relation between coherent spaces and finiteness spaces .	This takes the form of a functor from COH to FIN commuting with the additive and multiplicative structure of linear logic .	What makes this correspondence possible and conceptually interesting is the use of the infinite Ramsey theorem .	Basic knowledge about coherent spaces and finiteness spaces is assumed .
0	We present preliminary results from a survey of CO emission from members of a volume-limited sample of non-cluster elliptical galaxies .	Our intent is to compare the gas properties of these ellipticals to a sample of lenticulars selected using similar criteria .	The data , although still sparse , suggest that the cool gas in ellipticals shows the same puzzling upper mass cutoff found in the lenticular galaxies .	We find , however , significantly lower detection rates and possibly much lower H2/HI mass ratios in the ellipticals .	The detection rate is higher among the lower-mass galaxies , as has been found previously .
4	In particular , we find an impact probability greater than 10^-6 for an impact in 2068 .	We assess the risk of an Earth impact for asteroid ( 99942 ) Apophis by means of a statistical analysis accounting for the uncertainty of both the orbital solution and the Yarkovsky effect .	We select those observations with either rigorous uncertainty information provided by the observer or a high established accuracy .	For the Yarkovsky effect we perform a Monte Carlo simulation that fully accounts for the uncertainty in the physical characterization , especially for the unknown spin orientation .	By mapping the uncertainty information onto the 2029 b-plane and identifying the keyholes corresponding to subsequent impacts we assess the impact risk for future encounters .
3	The mutual collisions conserve momentum and are inelastic , with a coefficient of restitution $ r $ .	We consider the inelastic Maxwell model , which consists of a collection of particles that are characterized by only their velocities , and evolving through binary collisions and external driving .	At any instant , a particle is equally likely to collide with any of the remaining particles .	The system evolves in continuous time with mutual collisions and driving taken to be point processes with rates $ \tau_c^- { 1 } $ and $ \tau_w^ { -1 } $ respectively .	The velocity change of a particle with velocity $ v $ , due to driving , is taken to be $ \Delta v=- ( 1+r_w ) v+\eta $ , mimicking the collision with a vibrating wall , where $ r_w $ the coefficient of restitution of the particle with the `` wall '' and $ \eta $ is Gaussian white noise .
1	It is believed that the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged RNA and the positively charged viral capsid proteins drive the encapsidation , although there is growing evidence that the sequence of the viral RNA also plays a role in packaging .	Many single-stranded ( ss ) RNA viruses self assemble from capsid protein subunits and the nucleic acid to form an infectious virion .	In particular the sequence will determine the possible secondary structures that the ssRNA will take in solution .	In this work , we use a mean field theory to investigate how the secondary structure of the RNA combined with electrostatic interactions affects the efficiency of assembly and stability of the assembled virions .	We show that the secondary structure of RNA may result in negative osmotic pressures while a linear polymer causes positive osmotic pressures for the same conditions .
0	The first kinetic study of transient growth for a collisionless homogeneous Maxwellian plasma in a uniform magnetic field is presented .	A system which is linearly stable may display transient growth if the linear operator describing its evolution is non-normal , so that its eigenvectors are non-orthogonal .	In order to include plasma kinetic effects a Landau fluid model is employed .	The linear operator of the model is shown to be non-normal and the results suggest that the nonnormality of a collisionless plasma is intrinsically related to its kinetic nature , with the transient growth being more accentuated for smaller scales and higher plasma beta .	The results based on linear spectral theory have been confirmed with nonlinear simulations .
4	To prove the first result , we define a subclass ITA- of ITA , and show that ( 1 ) any ITA can be reduced to a language-equivalent automaton in ITA- and ( 2 ) the reachability problem in this subclass is in NEXPTIME ( without any class graph ) .	We introduce the class of Interrupt Timed Automata ( ITA ) , a subclass of hybrid automata well suited to the description of timed multi-task systems with interruptions in a single processor environment .	While the reachability problem is undecidable for hybrid automata we show that it is decidable for ITA .	More precisely we prove that the untimed language of an ITA is regular , by building a finite automaton as a generalized class graph .	We then establish that the reachability problem for ITA is in NEXPTIME and in PTIME when the number of clocks is fixed .
3	In this paper , we report a detailed experimental study of linear rogue waves in an optical system , using a spatial light modulator to impose random phase structure on a coherent optical field .	There are many examples in physics of systems showing rogue wave behaviour , the generation of high amplitude events at low probability .	Although initially studied in oceanography , rogue waves have now been seen in many other domains , with particular recent interest in optics .	Although most studies in optics have focussed on how nonlinearity can drive rogue wave emergence , purely linear effects have also been shown to induce extreme wave amplitudes .	After free space propagation , different random intensity patterns are generated , including partially-developed speckle , a broadband caustic network , and an intermediate pattern with characteristics of both speckle and caustic structures .
1	We present in this paper a perturbative theory for the structure functions and the response functions of the hydrodynamic velocity field in real space and time .	This paper is the first in a series of three papers that aim at understanding the scaling behaviour of hydrodynamic turbulence .	Starting from the Navier-Stokes equations ( at high Reynolds number Re ) we show that the standard perturbative expansions that suffer from infra-red divergences can be exactly resummed using the Belinicher-L'vov transformation .	After this exact ( partial ) resummation it is proven that the resulting perturbation theory is free of divergences , both in large and in small spatial separations .	The hydrodynamic response and the correlations have contributions that arise from mediated interactions which take place at some space- time coordinates .
3	The new data support the conclusions of Kilkenny et al .	New CCD observations of the pre-cataclysmic binary HW Virginis are presented and discussed .	The R-filtered CCD photometry was supplemented with medium-band ( Cousins VRI ) spectrophotometry based on low-resolution objective-prism spectra .	The period variation is reanalysed by means of the standard O-C technique .	( 2000 ) on the strong and continuous period change .
3	We determine the cutoff parameters in the form factors by fitting the $ NN $ scattering data with the same approach and we obtain four sets of parameters ( a -- d ) .	A potential model for the interaction between a charmed baryon ( $ \Lambda_c $ , $ \Sigma_c $ , and $ \Sigma_c^* $ ) and the nucleon ( $ N $ ) is constructed .	The model contains a long-range meson ( $ \pi $ and $ \sigma $ ) exchange part and a short-distance quark exchange part .	The quark cluster model is used to evaluate the short-range repulsion and a monopole type form factor is introduced to the long-range potential to reflect the extended structure of hadrons .	The most attractive potential ( d ) leads to bound $ \Lambda_c N $ states with $ J^\pi= 0^+ $ and $ 1^+ $ once the channel couplings among $ \Lambda_c $ , $ \Sigma_c $ and $ \Sigma_c^* $ are taken into account .
2	We also identify the physical mechanisms leading to different levels of central stellar mass concentration for galaxies with the same total stellar mass .	The Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies ( S4G ) is a volume , magnitude , and size-limited survey of 2352 nearby galaxies with deep imaging at 3.6 and 4.5um .	In this paper we describe our surface photometry pipeline and showcase the associated data products that we have released to the community .	Finally , we derive the local stellar mass-size relation at 3.6um for galaxies of different morphologies .	Our radial profiles reach stellar mass surface densities below 1 Msun pc-2 .
3	We propose to represent an XML schema as a graph highlighting the structural characteristics of the valide documents .	Currently , XML is a format widely used .	In the context of computer science teaching , it is necessary to introduce students to this format and , especially , at its eco-system .	We have developed a model to support the teaching of XML .	We present in this report different graphic elements of the model and the improvements it brings to data modeling in XML. -- -XML est un format actuellement tr\`es utilis\'e .
3	Our experimental results were compared with the numerically computed ones , by the analysis of the Cole-Cole plots .	We measured the temperature dependence of the 1st and the 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility on some type II superconducting samples at different AC field amplitudes , hAC .	In order to interpret the measurements , we computed the harmonics of the AC susceptibility as function of the temperature T , by integrating the non-linear diffusion equation for the magnetic field with different creep models , namely the vortex glass-collective creep ( single-vortex , small bundle and large bundle ) and Kim-Anderson model .	We also computed them by using a non-linear phenomenological I-V characteristics , including a power law dependence of the pinning potential on hAC .	This method results more sensitive than the separate component analysis , giving the possibility to obtain detailed information about the contribution of the flux dynamic regimes in the magnetic response of the analysed samples .
4	Possible extensions to other random matrix ensembles are commented .	We establish a moderate deviation principle ( MDP ) for the number of eigenvalues of a Wigner matrix in an interval close to the edge of the spectrum .	Moreover we prove a MDP for the $ i $ th largest eigenvalue close to the edge .	The proof relies on fine asymptotics of the variance of the eigenvalue counting function of GUE matrices due to Gustavsson .	The extension to large families of Wigner matrices is based on the Tao and Vu Four Moment Theorem .
1	Each item has one of $ c\geq 2 $ colors and an additional constraint is that we can not pack two items of the same color next to each other in the same bin .	In the Colored Bin Packing problem a sequence of items of sizes up to $ 1 $ arrives to be packed into bins of unit capacity .	The objective is to minimize the number of bins .	In the important special case when all items have size zero , we characterize the optimal value to be equal to color discrepancy .	As our main result , we give an ( asymptotically ) 1.5-competitive algorithm which is optimal .
0	About twenty years ago , Choptuik studied numerically the gravitational collapse ( Einstein field equations ) of a massless scalar field in spherical symmetry , and found strong evidence for a universal , self-similar solution at the threshold of black hole formation .	We prove rigorously the existence of a real analytic solution , that we interpret as the solution observed by Choptuik .	Our construction covers an open neighborhood of the past light cone of the singularity .	The proof is computer assisted .	Starting from an explicit approximate solution , we show that nearby there is a true solution .
1	We take sides about ideas and theories as if that was the right thing to do .	We believe , in the sense of supporting ideas and considering them correct while dismissing doubts about them .	And yet , from a rational point of view , this type of support and belief is not justifiable at all .	The best we can hope when describing the real world , as far as we know , is to have probabilistic knowledge , to have probabilities associated to each statement .	And even that can be very hard to achieve in a reliable way .
0	Solar magnetism is measured with different indexes : for instance the MPSI and the MWSI , number of sunspots , radio flux at 10.7 cm , Ca II K , Mg II K , EUV , He I or L_alpha .	Bachmann & amp ; White ( 1994 ) had compared these indicators of the solar activity showing a hysteresis of the solar cycle variations and a time lag between these indices not related to instrumental effects .	Later on , Ozguc & amp ; Atac ( 2001 ) extended this study of hysteresis phenomenon between Flare index and other solar indices ( mean magnetic field , coronal index ) .	In its original working configuration , GOLF/SoHO was able to measure during 26 days the solar mean magnetic field ( Garcia et al.1999 ) .	We check here if the velocity data could be used as another solar magnetism proxy with the advantage of having a duty cycle & gt ; 95 % during the last 12 years .
1	In addition , it is strong enough to prove the Set Compactness Theorem and the results in formal topology which make use of this theorem .	We propose an extension of Aczel 's constructive set theory CZF by an axiom for inductive types and a choice principle , and show that this extension has the following properties : it is interpretable in Martin-Lof 's type theory ( hence acceptable from a constructive and generalised-predicative standpoint ) .	Moreover , it is stable under the standard constructions from algebraic set theory , namely exact completion , realizability models , forcing as well as more general sheaf extensions .	As a result , methods from our earlier work can be applied to show that this extension satisfies various derived rules , such as a derived compactness rule for Cantor space and a derived continuity rule for Baire space .	Finally , we show that this extension is robust in the sense that it is also reflected by the model constructions from algebraic set theory just mentioned .
0	Let $ H $ be a Krull monoid with class group $ G $ .	Then $ H $ is factorial if and only if $ G $ is trivial .	Sets of lengths and sets of catenary degrees are well studied invariants describing the arithmetic of $ H $ in the non-factorial case .	In this note we focus on the set $ Ca ( H ) $ of catenary degrees of $ H $ and on the set $ \mathcal R ( H ) $ of distances in minimal relations .	We show that every finite nonempty subset of $ \mathbb N_ { \ge 2 } $ can be realized as the set of catenary degrees of a Krull monoid with finite class group .
0	The problem of measuring the resistivity of isotropic samples of finite dimensions in the form of rectangular parallelepipeds using the four-probe technique was considered .	Two variants of contact arrangements were studied : ( 1 ) four collinear probes are positioned on one side of a sample symmetrically with respect to the other sides , and ( 2 ) two probes on one side of a sample and two on the opposite side are placed precisely in opposite positions and symmetrically with respect to the other sides of the sample ( the Schnabel method ) .	Solutions of the problem of the electric field potential distribution in a sample for different positions of the current contacts were found .	The solutions were obtained in the form of double series and methods of their summation are presented .	The obtained results are extended to the case of measuring the resistivity of anisotropic samples when the resistivity tensor has two independent components .
3	We also develop a Galois theory of covering spaces for a ( locally connected semilocally 1-connected ) topological stack .	This is the first in a series of papers devoted to foundations of topological stacks .	We begin developing a homotopy theory for topological stacks along the lines of classical homotopy theory of topological spaces .	In this paper we go as far as introducing the homotopy groups and establishing their basic properties .	Built into the Galois theory is a method for determining the stacky structure ( i.e. , inertia groups ) of covering stacks .
3	Using radiative transfer calculations , we interpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous , parametric model framework by reproducing their SMA visibilities and SEDs .	Circumstellar disks are thought to experience a rapid `` transition '' phase in their evolution that can have a considerable impact on the formation and early development of planetary systems .	We present new and archival high angular resolution ( 0.3 '' = 40-75 AU ) Submillimeter Array ( SMA ) observations of the 880 micron dust continuum emission from 12 such transition disks in nearby star-forming regions .	In each case , we directly resolve a dust-depleted disk cavity around the central star .	The cavities in these disks are large ( R_cav = 15-73 AU ) and substantially depleted of small ( ~um-sized ) dust grains , although their mass contents are still uncertain .
3	Here , using a prototypical example of a bistable self-regulating gene model , we develop a theoretical framework describing the combined effect of intrinsic and extrinsic noise on the dynamics of stochastic genetic switches .	Due to inherent noise in intracellular networks cellular decisions can be random , so genetically identical cells can display different phenotypic behavior even in identical environments .	Most previous work in understanding the decision-making process has focused on the role of intrinsic noise in these systems .	Yet , especially in the high copy-number regime , extrinsic noise has been shown to be much more significant .	Employing our theory and Monte Carlo simulations , we show that extrinsic noise not only significantly alters the lifetimes of the phenotypic states , but can induce bistability in unexpected regions of parameter space , and may fundamentally change the escape mechanism .
2	Hence , to develop robust defense strategies , a promising approach is to utilize game theory to understand the fundamental trade-offs involved .	Stealthy attacks are a major threat to cyber security .	In practice , both attackers and defenders have resource constraints that could limit their capabilities .	Previous works in this direction , however , mainly focus on the single-node case without considering strict resource constraints .	In this paper , a game-theoretic model for protecting a system of multiple nodes against stealthy attacks is proposed .
1	We find that if the inhomogeneous terms break the SU ( 2 ) spin symmetry the binding between holes is tremendously enhanced in the thermodynamic limit .	Starting from a t-J model , we introduce inhomogeneous terms to mimic stripes .	In any other model ( including homogeneous models ) the binding in the thermodynamic limit is small or neglible .	By including these inhomogeneous terms we can reproduce experimental neutron scattering data .	We also discuss the connection of the resulting inhomogeneity-induced superconductivity to recent experimental evidence for a linear relation between magnetic incommensurability and the superconducting transition temperature , as a function of doping .
0	We use recent observations of the HI-mass function to constrain galaxy formation .	The data conflicts with the standard model where most of the gas in a low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disk of cold gas that is depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the disk becomes gravitationally stable .	A consistent model can be found if low-mass haloes are embedded in a preheated medium , with a specific gas entropy ~ 10Kev cm^2 .	Such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function .	We propose a preheating model where the medium around low-mass haloes is preheated by gravitational pancaking .
4	Fortunately , one can and should excise these representations .	We construct the spin foam model for N=2 supergravity in three dimensions .	Classically , it is a BF theory with gauge algebra osp ( 2|2 ) .	This algebra has representations which are not completely reducible .	This complicates the procedure when building a state sum .
3	This generates an orbital potential scattering contribution which is of the same order as the spin exchange interaction .	We study non-equilibrium current and occupation probabilities of a two-orbital quantum dot .	The couplings to the leads are allowed to be asymmetric and orbital dependent as it is generically the case in transport experiments on molecules and nanowires .	Starting from a two-orbital Anderson model , we perform a generalised Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to derive an effective Kondo model .	In a first perturbative analysis we identify a regime of negative differential conductance and a cascade resonance in the presence of an external magnetic field , which both originate from the non-equilibrium occupation of the orbitals .
2	We give a randomized algorithm that finds a minimum cut in an m-edge , n-vertex graph with high probability in O ( m log^3 n ) time .	We significantly improve known time bounds for solving the minimum cut problem on undirected graphs .	We use a `` semi-duality '' between minimum cuts and maximum spanning tree packings combined with our previously developed random sampling techniques .	We also give a simpler randomized algorithm that finds all minimum cuts with high probability in O ( n^2 log n ) time .	This variant has an optimal RNC parallelization .
0	We experimentally demonstrate the control of the spontaneous emission rate and the radiation pattern of colloidal quantum dots deterministically positioned in a plasmonic patch antenna .	The antenna consists of a thin gold microdisk 30 nm above a thick gold layer .	The emitters are shown to radiate through the entire patch antenna in a highly directional and vertical radiation pattern .	Strong acceleration of spontaneous emission is observed , depending of the antenna size .	Considering the double dipole structure of the emitters , this corresponds to a Purcell factor up to 80 for dipoles perpendicular to the disk .
3	The resulting orbital elements of CF Tuc are : $ a_ { 1 } { \sin } i $ = $ 0.0254\pm0.0001 $ AU , $ a_ { 2 } { \sin } i $ = $ 0.0228\pm0.0001 $ AU , $ M_ { 1 } { \sin } i $ = $ 0.902\pm0.005 $ $ M_ { \odot } $ , and $ M_ { 2 } { \sin } i $ = $ 1.008\pm0.006 $ $ M_ { \odot } $ .	New high-resolution spectra , of the chromospherically active binary system CF Tuc , taken at the Mt .	John University Observatory in 2007 , were analyzed using two methods : cross-correlation and Fourier -- based disentangling .	As a result , new radial velocity curves of both components were obtained .	The cooler component of the system shows H $ \alpha $ and CaII H & amp ; K emissions .
2	Existing methods focus on the textual content of tweets and ignore the social aspect of Twitter .	The ever-growing number of people using Twitter makes it a valuable source of timely information .	However , detecting events in Twitter is a difficult task , because tweets that report interesting events are overwhelmed by a large volume of tweets on unrelated topics .	In this paper we propose MABED ( i.e.mention-anomaly-based event detection ) , a novel statistical method that relies solely on tweets and leverages the creation frequency of dynamic links ( i.e.mentions ) that users insert in tweets to detect significant events and estimate the magnitude of their impact over the crowd .	MABED also differs from the literature in that it dynamically estimates the period of time during which each event is discussed , rather than assuming a predefined fixed duration for all events .
3	random coding ensemble shows that the previously-known achievable secrecy exponent using this ensemble is indeed the exact exponent for an average code in the ensemble .	We analyze the exact exponential decay rate of the expected amount of information leaked to the wiretapper in Wyner 's wiretap channel setting using wiretap channel codes constructed from both i.i.d .	and constant-composition random codes .	Our analysis for those sampled from i.i.d .	Furthermore , our analysis on wiretap channel codes constructed from the ensemble of constant-composition random codes , leads to an exponent which , in addition to being the exact exponent for an average code , is larger than the achievable secrecy exponent that has been established so far in the literature for this ensemble ( which in turn was known to be smaller than that achievable by wiretap channel codes sampled from i.i.d .
2	The `` flooding time '' is the number of time steps required to broadcast a message from a source node to every node of the network .	We consider a Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks ( MANET ) formed by `` n '' nodes that move independently at random over a finite square region of the plane .	Nodes exchange data if they are at distance at most `` r '' within each other , where r & gt ; 0 is the node transmission radius .	Flooding time is an important measure of the speed of information spreading in dynamic networks .	We derive a nearly-tight upper bound on the flooding time which is a decreasing function of the maximal `` velocity '' of the nodes .
1	We carefully align image sequences taken with the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer ( TRACE ) in the ultraviolet passbands around 1550 , 1600 , and 1700 A and the extreme ultraviolet passbands at 171 and 195 A .	We study the dynamical interaction of the solar chromosphere with the transition region in mossy and non-mossy active-region plage .	We compute Fourier phase-difference spectra that are spatially averaged separately over mossy and non-mossy plage to study temporal modulations as a function of temporal frequency .	The 1550 versus 171 A comparison shows zero phase difference in non-mossy plage .	In mossy plage , the phase differences between all UV and EUV passbands show pronounced upward trends with increasing frequency , which abruptly changes into zero phase difference beyond 4-6 mHz .
4	E } { \bf 72 } , 041103 ( 2005 ) ] , the analysis in the natural time of the seismicity after the SES initiation allows the estimation of the time window of the impending earthquakes with very good accuracy .	After the submission of the paper , three strong earthquakes with magnitude around 6.0-units occurred on October 17 and October 20 , 2005 , with epicenters in the Aegean Sea , at a distance { \em only } 100km from MYT station at which the intense signals $ M_1 $ to $ M_4 $ -analyzed in the main text- have been recorded .	This confirms experimentally the proposed criterion we used for the classification of these signals as Seismic Electric Signals ( SES ) .	Moreover , we show that , if we follow the procedure described in [ P.A .	Varotsos , N. V. Sarlis , H. K. Tanaka and E. S. Skordas { \it Phys.Rev .
4	we find that tau/B ( pbar- & gt ; e- gamma ) & gt ; 7 x 10^5 yr .	A search for antiproton decay has been made at the Fermilab Antiproton Accumulator .	Limits are placed on thirteen antiproton decay modes .	The results include the first explicit experimental limits on the muonic decay modes of the antiproton , and the first limits on the decay modes e- gamma gamma , and e- omega .	The most stringent limit is for the decay mode pbar- & gt ; e- gamma.At 90 % C.L .
2	We show that the absence of observed stable luminous LMBHB implies that upon RLOF by the low-mass donor angular momentum losses are substantially reduced with respect to the Verbunt and Zwaan `` standard '' prescription for magnetic braking .	We consider evolutionary models for the population of short-period ( & lt ; 10 hr ) low-mass black-hole binaries ( LMBHB ) and compare them with observations of soft X-ray transients ( SXT ) .	Evolution of LMBHB is determined by nuclear evolution of the donors and/or orbital angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking by the stellar wind of the donors and gravitational wave radiation .	Under this assumption masses and effective temperatures of the model secondaries of LMBHB are in a satisfactory agreement with the masses and effective temperatures ( as inferred from their spectra ) of the observed donors in LMBHB .	Theoretical mass-transfer rates in SXTs are consistent with the observed ones if one assumes that accretion discs in these systems are truncated ( `` leaky '' ) .
1	Numerous modern systems indeed generate ranking data , representing for instance ordered results to a query or user preferences .	Though the statistical analysis of ranking data has been a subject of interest over the past centuries , especially in economics , psychology or social choice theory , it has been revitalized in the past 15 years by recent applications such as recommender or search engines and is receiving now increasing interest in the machine learning literature .	Each such ranking usually involves a small but varying subset of the whole catalog of items only .	The study of the variability of these data , i.e.the statistical analysis of incomplete rank-ings , is however a great statistical and computational challenge , because of their heterogeneity and the related combinatorial complexity of the problem .	Whereas many statistical methods for analyzing full rankings ( orderings of all the items in the catalog ) are documented in the dedicated literature , partial rankings ( full rankings with ties ) or pairwise comparisons , only a few approaches are available today to deal with incomplete ranking , relying each on a strong specific assumption .
3	Taking vacuum alignments of relevant gauge singlet scalars , we predict the quark mixing as well as the tri-bimaximal mixing of neutrino flavors .	We have presented a $ S_4 $ flavor model to unify quarks and leptons in the framework of the SU ( 5 ) GUT .	Three generations of $ \bar5 $ -plets in SU ( 5 ) are assigned $ 3_1 $ of $ S_4 $ while the first and the second generations of 10-plets in SU ( 5 ) are assigned to be 2 of $ S_4 $ , and the third generation of 10-plet is to be $ 1_1 $ of $ S_4 $ .	The right-handed neutrinos are also assigned 2 for the first and second generations and $ 1_1 $ for the third generation , respectively .	Especially , the Cabbibo angle is predicted to be $ 15^ { \circ } $ in the limit of the vacuum alignment .
4	We prove that , upon replacing the homogeneity requirement by an invariant-type axiom , one gets a family of quasi-arithmetic means building up a scale , too .	It is well known that if $ \mathcal { P } _t $ denotes a set of power means then the mapping $ \mathbb { R } \ni t \mapsto \mathcal { P } _t ( v ) \in ( \min v , \max v ) $ is both 1-1 and onto for any non-constant sequence $ v = ( v_1 , \dots , \ , v_n ) $ of positive numbers .	Shortly : the family of power means is a scale .	If $ I $ is an interval and $ f \colon I \rightarrow \mathbb { R } $ is a continuous , strictly monotone function then $ f^ { -1 } ( \tfrac { 1 } { n } \sum f ( v_i ) ) $ is a natural generalization of power means , so called quasi-arithmetic mean generated by $ f $ .	A famous folk theorem says that the only homogeneous , quasi-a\-rith\-me\-tic means are power means .
3	However , we do detect some intriguing differences between the envelopes .	We present a comparative study of the circumstellar disks in Be/X-ray binaries and isolated Be stars based upon the H-alpha emission line .	From this comparison it follows that the overall structure of the disks in the Be/X-ray binaries is similar to the disks of other Be stars , i.e.they are axisymmetric and rotationally supported .	The factors for the line broadening ( rotation and temperature ) in the disks of the Be stars and the Be/X-ray binaries seem to be identical .	On average , the circumstellar disks of the Be/X-ray binaries are twice as dense as the disks of the isolated Be stars .
2	The present work is an overview which includes and generalizes all previously known results of partial integrability of this oscillator .	We consider the anharmonic oscillator with an arbitrary-degree anharmonicity , a damping term and a forcing term , all coefficients being time-dependent : u '' + g_1 ( x ) u ' + g_2 ( x ) u + g_3 ( x ) u^n + g_4 ( x ) = 0 , n real .	Its physical applications range from the atomic Thomas-Fermi model to Emden gas dynamics equilibria , the Duffing oscillator and numerous dynamical systems .	We give the most general two conditions on the coefficients under which a first integral of a particular type exists .	A natural interpretation is given for the two conditions .
1	We focus on partitioning problems based explicitly or implicitly on the minimization of Euclidean distortions , which include mean-based change-point detection , K-means , spectral clustering and normalized cuts .	In this paper , we consider unsupervised partitioning problems , such as clustering , image segmentation , video segmentation and other change-point detection problems .	Our main goal is to learn a Mahalanobis metric for these unsupervised problems , leading to feature weighting and/or selection .	This is done in a supervised way by assuming the availability of several potentially partially labelled datasets that share the same metric .	We cast the metric learning problem as a large-margin structured prediction problem , with proper definition of regularizers and losses , leading to a convex optimization problem which can be solved efficiently with iterative techniques .
3	Basic conclusions of a diffusive analysis have been compared to the Lyapunov stability model .	The goal of this investigation was to overcome limitations of a persistency analysis , introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot for fractal Brownian processes : nondifferentiability , Brownian nature of process and a linear memory measure .	We have extended a sense of a Hurst factor by consideration of a phase diffusion power law .	It was shown that pre-catastrophic stabilization as an indicator of bifurcation leads to a new minimum of momentary phase diffusion , while bifurcation causes an increase of the momentary transport .	An extended Reynolds parameter has been introduces as an indicator of phase transition .
2	A consequence is the continued reliance of today 's IDEs on paradigms such as traditional configuration management , which were developed for earlier modes of operation and hamper collaborative projects .	Software development environments ( IDEs ) have not followed the IT industry 's inexorable trend towards distribution .	They do too little to address the problems raised by today 's increasingly distributed projects ; neither do they facilitate collaborative and interactive development practices .	This contribution describes a new paradigm : cloud-based development , which caters to the specific needs of distributed and collaborative projects .	The CloudStudio IDE embodies this paradigm by enabling developers to work on a shared project repository .
2	The noise peak is much higher and broader for unannealed AlO $ _ { x } $ -based MTJ , and besides Lorentzian shape noise spectra in the frequency domain , random telegraph noise ( RTN ) is visible in the time traces .	We report on the low frequency ( LF ) noise measurements in magnetic tunnel junctions ( MTJs ) below 4 K and at low bias , where the transport is strongly affected by scattering with magnons emitted by hot tunnelling electrons , as thermal activation of magnons from the environment is suppressed .	For both CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB and CoFeB/AlO $ _ { x } $ /CoFeB MTJs , enhanced LF noise is observed at bias voltage around magnon emission energy , forming a peak in the bias dependence of noise power spectra density , independent of magnetic configurations .	During repeated measurements the noise peak reduces and the RTN becomes difficult to resolve , suggesting defects being annealed .	The Lorentzian shape noise spectra can be fitted with bias-dependent activation of RTN , with the attempt frequency in the MHz range , consistent with magnon dynamics .
2	The rate of decrease is the highest for large ions , lowest for small ions and in between the two for intermediate ions .	Measurements of the small , intermediate , and large ion concentrations and the airearth current density along with simultaneous measurements of the concentration and size-distribution of aerosol particles in the size ranges 4.4 to 163 nm and 0.5 to 20 micrometer diameters are reported for a drifting snow period after the occurrence of a blizzard at a coastal station , Maitri , Antarctica .	Ion concentrations of all categories and the airearth current simultaneously decrease by approximately an order of magnitude as the wind speed increases from 5 to 10 meter per sec .	Total aerosol number concentration decreases in the 4.4 to 163 nm size range but increases in 0.5 to 20 micrmetr size range with wind speed .	Size distribution of the nanometer particles show a dominant maximum at 30 nm diameter throughout the period of observations and the height of the maximum decreases with wind speed .
4	This structure may explain why portions of the SN1987A ring between the hotspots have not yet brightened after more than 15 years .	SBW1 is a B supergiant surrounded by a ring nebula that is a nearby twin of SN 1987A .	We present images and spectra of SBW1 obtained with HST , Spitzer , and Gemini South .	HST images of SBW1 do not exhibit long Rayleigh-Taylor fingers , which are presumed to cause the hotspots in the SN1987A ring , but instead show a geometrically thin clumpy ring .	The radial mass distribution and size scales of inhomogeneities in SBW1 's ring closely resemble those in the SN1987A ring , but the more complete disk expected to reside at the base of the RT fingers is absent .
2	This is demonstrated with results obtained for the bcc alloy system Fe $ _x $ Co $ _ { 1-x } $ as well as for a series of alloys of permalloy with 5d transition metals .	A Kubo-Greenwood-like equation for the Gilbert damping parameter $ \alpha $ is presented that is based on the linear response formalism .	Its implementation using the fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker ( KKR ) band structure method in combination with Coherent Potential Approximation ( CPA ) alloy theory allows it to be applied to a wide range of situations .	To account for the thermal displacements of atoms as a scattering mechanism , an alloy-analogy model is introduced .	The corresponding calculations for Ni correctly describe the rapid change of $ \alpha $ when small amounts of substitutional Cu are introduced .
4	Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network , it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance .	We present YOLO , a new approach to object detection .	Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection .	Instead , we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities .	A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation .
2	Random mixtures of solids with chondritic composition and packings of spheres are numerically generated .	The construction of models for the internal constitution and the temporal evolution of large planetesimals , the parent bodies of chondrites , requires information on the heat conductivity of the complex mixture of minerals and iron metal found in chondrites .	It is attempted to evaluate the heat conductivity of a multi-component mineral mixture and granular medium from the heat conductivities of its mixture components .	The heat conduction equation is solved in high spatial resolution for a test cube filled with such matter .	From the heat flux through the cube the heat conductivity of the mixture is derived .
0	Astro-WISE is the Astronomical Wide-field Imaging System for Europe .	It is a scientific information system which consists of hardware and software federated over about a dozen institutes throughout Europe .	It has been developed to exploit the ever increasing avalanche of data produced by astronomical surveys and data intensive scientific experiments in general .	The demo explains the architecture of the Astro-WISE information system and shows the use of Astro-WISE interfaces .	Wide-field astronomical images are derived from the raw image to the final catalog according to the user 's request .
1	This approach is somewhat naive , especially for soft-constraint optimization problems in which the soft constraints are mostly satisfied .	Constraint Programming ( CP ) solvers typically tackle optimization problems by repeatedly finding solutions to a problem while placing tighter and tighter bounds on the solution cost .	Unsatisfiable-core approaches to solving soft constraint problems in Boolean Satisfiability ( e.g.MAXSAT ) force all soft constraints to hold initially .	When solving fails they return an unsatisfiable core , as a set of soft constraints that can not hold simultaneously .	Using this information the problem is relaxed to allow certain soft constraint ( s ) to be violated and solving continues .
0	We present the optical narrow line ratios in an SDSS based sample of 3,175 broad Ha selected type 1 AGN , and explore their positions in the BPT diagrams as a function of the AGN and the host properties .	We find the following : 1 .	The luminosities of all measured narrow lines ( Ha , Hb , [ OIII ] , [ NII ] , [ SII ] , [ OI ] ) show a Baldwin relation relative to the broad Ha luminosity L_bHa , with slopes in the range of 0.53-0.72.2 .	About 20 % of the type 1 AGN reside within the `Composite ' and `SF ' regions of the BPT diagrams .	These objects also show excess narrow Ha and UV luminosities , for their L_bHa , consistent with contribution from star formation which dominates the narrow lines emission , as expected from their positions in the BPT diagrams.3 .
3	We also observe in several objects the existence of long-term variability , which seems decoupled from the short-term one .	We analyse the ultraviolet variability time scales in a sample of 15 Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei ( AGN ) observed by IUE .	Using a structure function analysis , we demonstrate the existence in most objects of a maximum variability time scale of the order of 0.02-1.00 year .	We do not find any significant dependence of these maximum variability time scales on the wavelength , but we observe a weak correlation with the average luminosity of the objects .	We interpret the existence of a maximum variability time scale as a possible evidence that the light curves of Type 1 AGN are the result of the superimposition of independent events .
3	The phenomenon unifies a variety of different concepts and observations in quite unusual aspects or conjunctions : ferroelectricity of good conductors , structural instability towards the Mott-Hubbard state , Wigner crystallization in a dense electronic system , the ordered 4K_F density wave , richness of physics of solitons , interplay of structural and electronic symmetries .	The family of molecular conductors TMTTF/TMTSF-X demonstrates almost all known electronic phases in parallel with a set of weak structural modifications of anion ordering and mysterious structureless transitions .	Only in early 2000 's their nature became elucidated by discoveries of a huge anomaly in the dielectric permittivity and by the NMR evidences for the charge ordering ( disproportionation ) .	These observations have been interpreted as the never expected ferroelectric transition .	The corresponding theory of the `` combined Mott-Hubbard state '' deals with orthogonal contributions to the Umklapp scattering of electrons coming from the two symmetry breaking effects : the build-in nonequivalence of bonds and the spontaneous nonequivalence of sites .
2	Fixed points are found in both models .	The Sznajd sociophysics model is generalized on the triangular lattice with pure antiferromagnetic opinion and also with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic opinions .	The slogan of the trade union `` united we stand , divided we fall '' can be realized via the propagation of ferromagnetic opinion of adjacent people in the union , but the propagation of antiferromagnetic opinion can be observed among the third countries between two big super powers or among the family members of conflicting parents .	The distributions of relaxation time of the mixed model are disperse and become loser to log-normal as the initial concentration of down spins approaches 0.5 , whereas for pure antiferromagnetic spins they are collapsed into one master curve which is roughly lognormal .	We do not see the phase transition in the model .
1	The equation of motion is derived and found to have long range position- and velocity-dependent two-body forces .	This paper addressses the kinetics and dynamics of a family of domain wall solutions along classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chains at low energies .	A 'quiescent ' regime is identified where the forces between walls are all repelling .	Outside this regime some of the interactions are attractive , giving rise to wall collisions whereupon the colliding walls annihilate .	The momentum of the system is found to be conserved in the quiescent regime and to suffer discontinuous jumps upon annihilation .
3	The structure and energy of a single kink are found .	We study the effect of thermal fluctuations on homogeneous infinite Bose-Einstein condensate with spin F=2 in the cyclic state , when atoms occupy three hyperfine states with $ m_ { F } =0 , \pm 2 $ .	We use both the approach of small-amplitude oscillations and mapping of our model on the sine-Gordon model .	We show that thermal fluctuations lead to the existence of the rough phase in one- and two-dimensional systems , when presence of kinks is favorable .	We also discuss the effect of thermal fluctuations on spin degrees of freedom in F=1 condensate .
0	Axisymmetric magnetic lines of nanometer sizes ( chiral vortices or skyrmions ) have been predicted to exist in a large group of noncentrosymmetric crystals more than two decades ago .	Recently these magnetic textures have been directly observed in nanolayers of cubic helimagnets and monolayers of magnetic metals .	We develop a micromagnetic theory of chiral skyrmions in thin magnetic layers for magnetic materials with intrinsic and induced chirality .	Such particle-like and stable micromagnetic objects can exist in broad ranges of applied magnetic fields including zero field .	Chiral skyrmions can be used as a new type of highly mobile nanoscale data carriers .
1	It is explicitly shown that $ n $ -instanton contribution to the condensate of the massless flavor in the background of four-observable , exactly coincides with the superpolynomial of the $ T ( n , nk+1 ) $ torus knot where $ k $ - is the level of CS term .	We establish the duality between the torus knot superpolynomials or the Poincar\'e polynomials of the Khovanov homology and particular condensates in $ \Omega $ -deformed 5D supersymmetric QED compactified on a circle with 5d Chern-Simons ( CS ) term .	In contrast to the previously known results , the particular torus knot corresponds not to the partition function of the gauge theory but to the particular instanton contribution and summation over the knots has to be performed in order to obtain the complete answer .	The instantons are sitting almost at the top of each other and the physics of the `` fat point '' where the UV degrees of freedom are slaved with point-like instantons turns out to be quite rich .	Also also see knot polynomials in the quantum mechanics on the instanton moduli space .
1	A generic property of these models is the existence of arbitrarily light bulk modes of charged fields .	In some models with infinite extra dimensions , gauge fields are localized on a brane by gravity .	This property may lead to interesting low-energy effects such as electric charge non-conservation on the brane ( decay of electron to nothing ) .	One may worry that light charged Kaluza -- Klein modes would lead to unacceptable phenomenology due to their copious production in , e.g. , electron-positron annihilation and/or their contribution to QED observables like anomalous magnetic moments .	We argue , however , that both loop effects and production of light charged Kaluza -- Klein modes are suppressed due to screening effect of gapless spectrum of bulk photons .
1	In the presence of a finite magnetic field , these bands condense into highly degenerate Landau levels .	HgCdTe at a critical cadmium doping has a bulk dispersion which includes two linear cones meeting at a single point at zero energy , intersecting a nearly flat band , similar to the pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl system .	We have numerically calculated the frequency-dependent magneto-optical and zero-field conductivity of this material using the Kane model .	The calculations show good agreement with recent experimental measurements .	We discuss the signature of the flat band and the split peaks of the magneto-optics in terms of general pseudospin-s models and propose that the system exhibits a non- { \pi } -quantized Berry phase , found in recent theoretical work .
3	The Kontsevich formula for the star product was given originally in terms of the perturbation expansion and it leads to a non-renormalizable quantum field theory .	It is shown by Connes , Douglas and Schwarz that gauge theory on noncommutative torus describes compactifications of M-theory to tori with constant background three-form field .	This indicates that noncommutative gauge theories on more general manifolds also can be useful in string theory .	We discuss a framework to noncommutative quantum gauge theory on Poisson manifolds by using the deformation quantization .	We discuss the nonperturbative path integral formulation of Cattaneo and Felder as a possible approach to construction of noncommutative quantum gauge theory on Poisson manifolds .
1	The binding force was derived from the Debye temperature , T_D , that , in turn , was calculated from the temperature dependence of the central shift of the Mossbauer spectra recorded in the range of 80 to 330 K. Following a temperature dependence of the line width that shows a minimum at ~155 K , two temperature intervals were considered : a low temperature one ( LT ) ranging from 80 to 155 K , and the T_D - value of 292 ( 12 ) K or 279 ( 34 ) K , and a high temperature one ( HT ) ranging from 155 to 330 K with the T_D - value of 399 ( 15 ) or 399 ( 25 ) K , depending on the fitting procedure .	Binding of 57Fe atoms in a metallic chromium was investigated in a Cr-Fe alloy , containing less than 0.1 at % Fe enriched to ~95 % in 57Fe isotope , using 57Fe-site Mossbauer spectroscopy .	The corresponding values of the harmonic force ( spring ) constant are : 35.4 N/m and 66.1 N/m or 33.8 N/m and 66.1 N/m for the LT and HT , respectively .	This means that in the HT range the binding force of 57Fe atoms by the Cr matrix is by a factor of ~1.9 - 2 stronger than that in the LT range .	This anomaly is possibly related with a different polarization of the spin-density waves in the LT and HT `` phases '' .
2	Pixel locking , also known as peak locking , is an artifact where calculated particle positions are concentrated at certain locations relative to pixel edges .	The moment method is an image analysis technique for sub-pixel estimation of particle positions .	The total error in the calculated particle position includes effects of pixel locking and random noise in each pixel .	We report simulations to gain an understanding of the sources of error and their dependence on parameters the experimenter can control .	We suggest an algorithm , and we find optimal parameters an experimenter can use to minimize total error and pixel locking .
0	We present kinematics and stellar population properties of 17 dwarf early-type galaxies in the luminosity range -14 & gt ; M_B & gt ; -19 .	Our sample fills the gap between the intensively studied giant elliptical and Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies .	The dwarf ellipticals of the present sample have constant velocity dispersion profiles within their effective radii and do not show significant rotation , hence are clearly anisotropic .	The dwarf lenticulars , instead , rotate faster and are , at least partially , supported by rotation .	From optical Lick absorption indices , we derive metallicities and element abundances .
4	These results give the ground-state energy in any vortex sector and thus also the vortex gap , which is relevant for experiments .	We analyze the gapped phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model perturbatively in the isolated-dimer limit .	Our analysis is based on the continuous unitary transformations method which allows one to compute the spectrum as well as matrix elements of operators between eigenstates , at high order .	The starting point of our study consists in an exact mapping of the original honeycomb spin system onto a square-lattice model involving an effective spin and a hardcore boson .	We then derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian up to order 10 which is found to describe an interacting-anyon system , contrary to the order 4 result which predicts a free theory .
4	Extinctions to the H II regions are estimated for the first time from a comparison of radio flux densities to new optical fluxes derived from H-alpha observations by Dutil & amp ; Roy ( 1999 , [ ApJ , 516 , 62 ] ) .	We analyze 3 .	`` 5 resolution , high sensitivity radio continuum images of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258 at 6 and 20 cm derived from multiple observations used to monitor the radio supernova SN 1981K ( Van Dyk et al .	1992 , [ ApJ , 396 , 1995 ] ) .	Seven bright H II region and five supernova remnant candidates are identified .
0	Approximate heavy-quark spin and flavor symmetry and chiral symmetry play an important role in our understanding of the nonperturbative regime of strong interactions .	In this work , utilizing the unitarized chiral perturbation theory , we explore the consequences of these symmetries in the description of the interactions between the ground-state singly charmed ( bottom ) baryons and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons .	In particular , at leading order in the chiral expansion , by fixing the only parameter in the theory to reproduce the $ \Lambda_b ( 5912 ) $ [ $ \Lambda_b^* ( 5920 ) $ ] or the $ \Lambda_c ( 2595 ) $ [ $ \Lambda_c^* ( 2625 ) $ ] , we predict a number of dynamically generated states , which are contrasted with those of other approaches and available experimental data .	In anticipation of future lattice QCD simulations , we calculate the corresponding scattering lengths and compare them to the existing predictions from a $ \mathcal { O } ( p^3 ) $ chiral perturbation theory study .	In addition , we estimate the effects of the next-to-leading-order potentials by adopting heavy-meson Lagrangians and fixing the relevant low-energy constants using either symmetry or naturalness arguments .
4	We also provide a model realization based on strong dynamics at the electroweak scale .	We provide a simple mechanism for reconciling the direct dark matter experimental results .	We consider light asymmetric composite dark matter which scatters off nuclei via Higgs and photon exchange .	We demonstrate that the interference between these two channels naturally accommodates the experimental results .	We discover that this happens for a compositeness scale of the order of the electroweak .
1	The orientation of the quasar with respect to the major axis of the closest cluster was calculated , introducing new information to previous work .	In this thesis , I present an investigation into the environments of quasars with respect to galaxy clusters , and environment evolution with redshift and luminosity .	The aim of this work was i . )	to study the large scale environment over a large redshift range , ii . )	to study the evolution as well as any change in environment with quasar luminosity and redshift , and iii . )
0	Our understanding of blazars has been greatly increased in recent years by extensive multi-wavelength observations , particularly in the radio , X-ray and gamma-ray regions .	Over the past decade the Whipple 10m telescope has contributed to this with the detection of 5 BL Lacertae objects at very high gamma-ray energies .	The combination of multi-wavelength data has shown that blazars follow a well-defined sequence in terms of their broadband spectral properties .	Together with providing constraints on emission models , this information has yielded a means by which potential sources of TeV emission may be identified and predictions made as to their possible gamma-ray flux .	We have used the Whipple telescope to search for TeV gamma-ray emission from eight objects selected from a list of such candidates .
4	The different signs originate as a competition between fluctuations generated near the baths , and fluctuations of the current between the two subsystems .	We study spatial correlations in the transport of energy between two baths at different temperatures .	To do this , we introduce a minimal model in which energy flows from one bath to another through two subsystems .	We show that the transport-induced energy correlations between the two subsystems are of the same order as the energy fluctuations within each subsystem .	The correlations can be either positive or negative and we give bounds on their values which are associated with a dynamic energy scale .
0	We investigate particle production near extra species loci ( ESL ) in a higher dimensional field space and derive a speed limit in moduli space at weak coupling .	This terminal velocity is set by the characteristic ESL-separation and the coupling of the extra degrees of freedom to the moduli , but it is independent of the moduli 's potential if the dimensionality of the field space is considerably larger than the dimensionality of the loci , D & gt ; & gt ; d. Once the terminal velocity is approached , particles are produced at a plethora of nearby ESLs , preventing a further increase in speed via their backreaction .	It is possible to drive inflation at the terminal velocity , providing a generalization of trapped inflation with attractive features : we find that more than sixty e-folds of inflation for sub-Planckian excursions in field space are possible if ESLs are ubiquitous , without fine tuning of initial conditions and less tuned potentials .	We construct a simple , observationally viable model with a slightly red scalar power-spectrum and suppressed gravitational waves ; we comment on the presence of additional observational signatures originating from IR-cascading and individual massive particles .	We also show that moduli-trapping at an ESL is suppressed for D & gt ; & gt ; d , hindering dynamical selection of high-symmetry vacua on the landscape based on this mechanism .
0	We present a phenomenological fluid dynamics model for a dilatant fluid , i.e.a severe shear thickening fluid , by introducing a state variable .	The Navier-Stokes equation is coupled with the state variable field , which evolves in response to the local shear stress as the fluid is sheared .	The viscosity is assumed to depend upon the state variable and to diverge at a certain value due to jamming .	We demonstrate that the coupling of the fluid dynamics with the shear thickening leads to an oscillatory instability in the shear flow .	The model also shows a peculiar response of the fluid to a strong external impact .
4	The oscillator strength of A and B exciton-polaritons is determined as 0.0022 and 0.0016 , respectively .	We refine excitonic parameters of bulk GaN by means of time-of-flight spectroscopy of light pulses propagating through crystals .	The influence of elastic photon scattering is excluded by using the multiple reflections of the pulses from crystal boundaries .	The shapes of these reflexes in the time-energy plane depict the variation of the group velocity induced by excitonic resonances .	Modeling of the shapes , as well as other spectra , shows that a homogeneous width of the order of 10 \mu eV characterizes the exciton-polariton resonances within the crystal .
4	For $ m\geq 2 $ the finite size term related to the conformal anomaly depends on the anisotropy which indicates a multicritical behaviour typical of loop models .	We have diagonalized the transfer matrix of the $ U_ { q } [ osp ( 2|2m ) ] $ vertex model by means of the algebraic Bethe ansatz method for a variety of grading possibilities .	This allowed us to investigate the thermodynamic limit as well as the finite size properties of the corresponding spin chain in the massless regime .	The leading behaviour of the finite size corrections to the spectrum is conjectured for arbitrary $ m $ .	For $ m=1 $ we find a critical line with central charge $ c=-1 $ whose exponents vary continuously with the $ q $ -deformation parameter .
2	Three specific derivatives are described : convective , corotational , and directional .	We present a unified derivation of covariant time derivatives , which transform as tensors under a time-dependent coordinate change .	Such derivatives are essential for formulating physical laws in a frame-independent manner .	The covariance is made explicit by working in arbitrary time-dependent coordinates , instead of restricting to Eulerian ( fixed ) or Lagrangian ( material ) coordinates .	The commutator of covariant time and space derivatives is interpreted in terms of a time-curvature that shares many properties of the Riemann curvature tensor , and reflects nontrivial time-dependence of the metric .
1	It is found that the linear generalized uncertainty principle ( GUP ) approach gives a non-physical result .	The possibility of finding the measurable maximal energy and the minimal time interval is discussed in different quantum aspects .	Based on large scale Schwarzshild solution , the quadratic GUP approach is utilized .	The calculations are performed at the shortest distance , at which the general relativity is assumed to be a good approximation for the quantum gravity and at larger distances , as well .	It is found that both maximal energy and minimal time have the order of the Planck time .
0	It is well-known that photoionization is the major mechanism powering nebulae emission-lines .	For about 30 years , numerical simulations using photoionization codes have been employed to analyze HII regions , planetary nebulae and active galactic nuclei .	Although these models can reproduce most of the observed features , some remain unexplained .	Two possible causes for the discrepancies between observations and model predictions are discussed in this paper : ( a ) the models are not realistic enough ; ( b ) an additional energy source is needed .	The discussion here is mainly based on the results of photoionization models for the NW knot of I Zw 18 .
1	The high spectral resolution of our Fabry-Perot system allows us to separate the Galactic signal from the much larger local sources of H alpha emission , such as the Earth 's geocorona .	We present observations of Galactic H alpha emission along two declination bands where the South Pole cosmic microwave background experiment reports temperature fluctuations .	For the two bands ( at declination -62 and -63 degrees ) , we find a total mean emission of about 1 Rayleigh with variations of about 0.3 R. The variations are within the estimated uncertainty of our total intensity determinations .	For an ionized gas at T around 10**4 K , this corresponds to a maximum free-free brightness temperature of less than 10 microK at 30 GHz ( K-band ) .	Thus , unless there is a hot gas component with T around 10**6 K , our results imply that there is essentially no free-free contamination of the SP91 ( Schuster et al .
2	The flux-number relation is best described by a power-law with a slope of alpha = 1.66+-0.11 .	We have compiled a complete extragalactic sample based on 25,000 deg^2 to a limiting flux of 3E-11 ergs/cm**2/sec ( 7,000 deg^2 to a flux limit of 1E-11 ergs/cm**2/sec ) in the 20 - 40 keV band with INTEGRAL .	We have constructed a detailed exposure map to compensate for effects of non-uniform exposure .	The integration of the cumulative flux per unit area leads to f = 2.6E-10 ergs/cm**2/sec/sr , which is about 1 % of the known 20 - 40 keV X-ray background .	We present the first luminosity function of AGNs in the 20-40 keV energy range , based on 38 extragalactic objects detected by the imager IBIS/ISGRI on-board INTEGRAL .
1	A new single tone signal with frequency hopping has been designed for NB-IoT physical random access channel ( NPRACH ) .	Narrowband internet of things ( NB-IoT ) is an emerging cellular technology that will provide improved coverage for massive number of low-throughput low-cost devices with low device power consumption in delay-tolerant applications .	In this letter we describe this new NPRACH design and explain in detail the design rationale .	We further propose possible receiver algorithms for NPRACH detection and time-of-arrival estimation .	Simulation results on NPRACH performance including detection rate , false alarm rate , and time-of-arrival estimation accuracy are presented to shed light on the overall potential of NB-IoT systems .
2	We suggest an explanation by presenting a new percolation theory model for product propagation , where agents interact over a social network .	Many new products fail , despite preliminary market surveys having determined considerable potential market share .	This effect is too systematic to be attributed to bad luck .	In our model , agents who do not adopt the product spread negative word of mouth to their neighbors , and so their neighborhood becomes less susceptible to the product .	The result is a dramatic increase in the percolation threshold .
4	The relevance of the KTHNY theory in locating melting transition in 2D OCP is briefly discussed .	We summarize several semi-phenomenological approaches to estimate the internal energy of one-component-plasma ( OCP ) in two ( 2D ) and three ( 3D ) dimensions .	Particular attention is given to a hybrid approach , which reproduces the Debye-H $ \ddot { \text { u } } $ ckel asymptote in the limit of weak coupling , the ion sphere ( 3D ) and ion disc ( 2D ) asymptotes in the limit of strong coupling , and provides reasonable interpolation between these two limits .	More accurate ways to estimate the internal energy of 2D and 3D OCP are also discussed .	The accuracy of these analytic results is quantified by comparison with existing data from numerical simulations .
0	We study the stellar discs and spheroids in eight simulations of galaxy formation within Milky Way-mass haloes in a Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology .	A first paper in this series concentrated on disc properties .	Here , we extend this analysis to study how the formation history , structure and dynamics of discs and spheroids relate to the assembly history and structure of their haloes .	We find that discs are generally young , with stars spanning a wide range in stellar age : the youngest stars define thin discs and have near-circular orbits , while the oldest stars form thicker discs which rotate ~2 times slower than the thin components , and have 2-3 times larger velocity dispersions .	Unlike the discs , spheroids form early and on short time-scales , and are dominated by velocity dispersion .
3	The calculated results in $ MnO_6 $ clusters explain the forbidden reflections observed in $ La_ { 0.5 } Sr_ { 1.5 } MnO_4 $ and $ LaMnO_3 $ .	We study theoretically the anomalous X-ray scattering as a new probe to observe the orbital orderings and excitations in perovskite manganites .	The scattering matrix is given by the virtual electronic excitations from Mn $ 1s $ level to unoccupied Mn $ 4p $ level .	We find that orbital dependence of the Coulomb interaction between Mn $ 3d $ and Mn $ 4p $ electrons is essential to bring about the anisotropy of the scattering factor near the K edge .	A possibility of the observation of the orbital waves by the X-ray scattering is discussed .
4	The approach is shown to provide new ecological insights about the stopover behaviour of semipalmated sandpipers but is generally applicable to any population in which animals arrive in groups and potentially exhibit heterogeneity in terms of one or more other processes .	We propose the use of finite mixtures of continuous distributions in modelling the process by which new individuals , that arrive in groups , become part of a wildlife population .	We demonstrate this approach using a data set of migrating semipalmated sandpipers ( Calidris pussila ) for which we extend existing stopover models to allow for individuals to have different behaviour in terms of their stopover duration at the site .	We demonstrate the use of reversible jump MCMC methods to derive posterior distributions for the model parameters and the models , simultaneously .	The algorithm moves between models with different numbers of arrival groups as well as between models with different numbers of behavioural groups .
0	Low accuracy of the Solvation Free Energy ( SFE ) calculation is a known problem of the numerical methods of the Integral Equation Theory of Liquids and the Classical Density Functional Theory ( Classical DFT ) .	Although functionals with empirical corrections can essentially improve the predictability of the methods , their universality is still a question .	In our recent paper we connected the SFE calculation errors with the incorrect pressure in the Classical DFT and proposed the a posteriory correction to improve the results ( J. Phys.Chem .	Lett. , 5 , 1925-1942 ) .	This paper raised a discussion in the community .
2	In this paper , we identify twelve new power laws relating to the static graph structures of Java programs .	Power law distributions have been found in many natural and social phenomena , and more recently in the source code and run-time characteristics of Object-Oriented ( OO ) systems .	A power law implies that small values are extremely common , whereas large values are extremely rare .	The graph structures analyzed represented different forms of OO coupling , namely , inheritance , aggregation , interface , parameter type and return type .	Identification of these new laws provide the basis for predicting likely features of classes in future developments .
1	It has been conjectured that these tachyonic instabilities correspond to decays of the orbifolds into flat space or into orbifolds with smaller deficit angles .	We consider twisted tachyons on C/Z_N orbifolds of bosonic closed string theory .	We examine this conjecture using closed string field theory , with the string field truncated to low-level tachyons .	We compute the tachyon potentials for C/Z_2 and C/Z_3 orbifolds and find critical points at depths that generate about 70 % of the expected change in the deficit angle .	We find that both twisted fields and untwisted modes localized near the apex of the cone acquire vacuum expectation values and contribute to the potential .
4	Depending on the excitation frequency , the clusters rotated ( 10^4 - 10^7 times slower than the rotating field ) or remained stationary .	The structure of driven three-dimensional complex plasma clusters was studied experimentally .	The clusters consisted of around 60 hollow glass spheres with a diameter of 22 microns that were suspended in a plasma of rf discharge in argon .	The particles were confined in a glass box with conductive yet transparent coating on its four side walls , this allowed to manipulate the particle cluster by biasing the confining walls in a certain sequence .	In this work , a rotating electric field was used to drive the clusters .
0	The previous microscopic collective rotation-vibration model is improved to include interaction between collective oscillations in a pair of spatial directions , and to remove many of the previous-model approximations .	As in the previous model , the nuclear Schrodinger equation ( instead of the Hamiltonian ) is canonically transformed to obtain a Schrodinger equation for collective rotation and vibration of a nucleus coupled to an intrinsic motion , with the related constraints imposed on the wavefunction ( rather than on the particle co-ordinates ) .	The resulting equation is then effectively linearized into three self-consistent , time-reversal invariant , cranking-type equations using a variational method .	The relation of the equations to the phenomenological hydrodynamic collective Bohr-Davydov-Faessler-Greiner model is discussed .	To facilitate the solution of the equations and enhance physical insight , we consider in this article the collective oscillations in only two space directions .
3	The strength of this alignment signal is strongest for red , central galaxies , and in good agreement with that of dark matter halos in N-body simulations .	Using a sample of galaxy groups selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 ( SDSS DR7 ) , we examine the alignment between the orientation of galaxies and their surrounding large scale structure in the context of the cosmic web .	The latter is quantified using the large-scale tidal field , reconstructed from the data using galaxy groups above a certain mass threshold .	We find that the major axes of galaxies in filaments tend to be preferentially aligned with the directions of the filaments , while galaxies in sheets have their major axes preferentially aligned parallel to the plane of the sheets .	This suggests that red , central galaxies are well aligned with their host halos , in quantitative agreement with previous studies based on the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies .
4	For comparison , we use a benchmark sparse $ \ell_1 $ trend filter and we illustrate our methodology on traffic data from Chicago 's Interstate I-55 .	We develop a deep learning predictor for modeling traffic flows .	The challenge arises as traffic flows have sharp nonlinearities resulting from transitions from free flow to breakdown and then to congested flow .	Our methodology uses a deep learning architecture to capture nonlinear spatio-temporal flow effects .	We show how traffic flow data , from road sensors , can be predicted using deep learning .
0	When a rotating neutron star loses angular momentum , the reduction of the centrifugal force makes it contract .	This perturbs each fluid element , raising the local pressure and originating deviations from beta equilibrium , inducing reactions that release heat ( rotochemical heating ) .	This effect has previously been studied by Fern\'andez and Reisenegger for neutron stars of non-superfluid matter and by Petrovich and Reisenegger for superfluid matter , finding that the system in both cases reaches a quasi-steady state , corresponding to a partial equilibration between compression , due to the loss of angular momentum , and reactions that try to restore the equilibrium .	However , Petrovich and Reisenegger assumes a constant value of the superfluid energy gap , whereas theoretical models predict density-dependent gap amplitudes , and therefore gaps that depend on the location in the star .	In this work , we try to discriminate between several proposed gap models , comparing predicted surface temperatures to the value measured for the nearest millisecond pulsar , J0437-4715 .
2	We characterise precisely when $ G $ contains a $ K_4 $ -minor rooted at $ a , b , c , d $ by describing six classes of obstructions , which are the edge-maximal graphs containing no $ K_4 $ -minor rooted at $ a , b , c , d $ .	Let $ a , b , c , d $ be four vertices in a graph $ G $ .	A \emph { $ K_4 $ -minor rooted } at $ a , b , c , d $ consists of four pairwise-disjoint pairwise-adjacent connected subgraphs of $ G $ , respectively containing $ a , b , c , d $ .	The following two special cases illustrate the full characterisation : ( 1 ) A 4-connected non-planar graph contains a $ K_4 $ -minor rooted at $ a , b , c , d $ for every choice of $ a , b , c , d $ .	( 2 ) A 3-connected planar graph contains a $ K_4 $ -minor rooted at $ a , b , c , d $ if and only if $ a , b , c , d $ are not on a single face .
2	The lack of a predefined objective precludes premature convergence caused by a deceptive fitness function .	Novelty search is a recent artificial evolution technique that challenges traditional evolutionary approaches .	In novelty search , solutions are rewarded based on their novelty , rather than their quality with respect to a predefined objective .	In this paper , we apply novelty search combined with NEAT to the evolution of neural controllers for homogeneous swarms of robots .	Our empirical study is conducted in simulation , and we use a common swarm robotics task - aggregation , and a more challenging task - sharing of an energy recharging station .
1	2003 , A & amp ; A , v.399 , p.421 ) .	Recently it was found that helical magnetized flows efficiently amplify Alfv\'en waves ( Rogava et al .	This robust and manifold nonmodal effect was found to involve regimes of transient algebraic growth ( for purely ejectional flows ) , and exponential instabilities of both usual and parametric nature .	However the study was made in the incompressible limit and an important question remained open - whether this amplification is inherent to swirling MHD flows per se and what is the degree of its dependence on the incompressibility condition .	In this paper , in order to clear up this important question , we consider full compressible spectrum of MHD modes : Alfv\'en waves ( AW ) , slow magnetosonic waves ( SMW ) and fast magnetosonic waves ( FMW ) .
4	Furthermore , we also consider the case that equalities occur .	Let $ x : M\rightarrow \mathbb { R } ^ { N } $ be an $ n $ -dimensional compact self-shrinker in $ \mathbb { R } ^N $ with smooth boundary $ \partial\Omega $ .	In this paper , we study eigenvalues of the operator $ \mathcal { L } _r $ on $ M $ , where $ \mathcal { L } _r $ is defined by $ $ \mathcal { L } _r=e^ { \frac { |x|^2 } { 2 } } { \rm div } ( e^ { -\frac { |x|^2 } { 2 } } T^r\nabla\cdot ) $ $ with $ T^r $ denoting a positive definite ( 0,2 ) -tensor field on $ M $ .	We obtain `` universal '' inequalities for eigenvalues of the operator $ \mathcal { L } _r $ .	These inequalities generalize the result of Cheng and Peng in \cite { ChengPeng2013 } .
4	Yuen , \textit { Blowup for the Euler and Euler-Poisson Equations with Repulsive Forces } , Nonlinear Analysis Series A : Theory , Methods & amp ; Applications 74 ( 2011 ) , 1465 -- 1470 '' .	The Newtonian Euler-Poisson equations with attractive forces are the classical models for the evolution of gaseous stars and galaxies in astrophysics .	In this paper , we use the integration method to study the blowup problem of the $ N $ -dimensional system with adiabatic exponent $ \gamma & gt ; 1 $ , in radial symmetry .	We could show that the $ C^ { 1 } $ non-trivial classical solutions $ ( \rho , V ) $ , with compact support in $ [ 0 , R ] $ , where $ R & gt ; 0 $ is a positive constant with $ \rho ( t , r ) =0 $ and $ V ( t , r ) =0 $ for $ r\geq R $ , under the initial condition \begin { equation } H_ { 0 } =\int_ { 0 } ^ { R } r^ { n } V_ { 0 } dr & gt ; \sqrt { \frac { 2R^ { 2n-N+4 } M } { n ( n+1 ) ( n-N+2 ) } } % \end { equation } with an arbitrary constant $ n & gt ; \max ( N-2,0 ) , $ \newline blow up before a finite time $ T $ for pressureless fluids or $ \gamma & gt ; 1. $ Our results could fill some gaps about the blowup phenomena to the classical $ C^ { 1 } $ solutions of that attractive system with pressure under the first boundary condition.\newline In addition , the corresponding result for the repulsive systems is also provided .	Here our result fully covers the previous case for $ n=1 $ in `` M.W .
4	These results yield a new evidence for the universality of the GOE distribution in KPZ growth on flat substrates .	We present a numerical study of the evolution of height distributions ( HDs ) obtained in interface growth models belonging to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang ( KPZ ) universality class .	The growth is done on an initially flat substrate .	The HDs obtained for all investigated models are very well fitted by the theoretically predicted Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble ( GOE ) distribution .	The first cumulant has a shift that vanishes as $ t^ { -1/3 } $ , while the cumulants of order $ 2\le n\le 4 $ converge to GOE as $ t^ { -2/3 } $ or faster , behaviors previously observed in other KPZ systems .
2	When preference for new states prevails , the system can show coexistence of states or synchronized collective behavior resulting in long ordering times .	We study the stochastic dynamics of coupled states with transition probabilities depending on local persistence , this is , the time since a state has changed .	When the population has a preference to adopt older states the system orders quickly due to the dominance of the old state .	In this case , the magnetization $ m ( t ) $ of the system oscillates around $ m ( t ) =0 $ .	Implications for social systems are discussed .
1	For numerical semigroups ( additive subsemigroups of the natural numbers ) , several factorization invariants are known to admit predictable behavior for sufficiently large semigroup elements .	Nonunique factorization in commutative semigroups is often studied using factorization invariants , which assign to each semigroup element a quantity determined by the factorization structure .	In particular , the catenary degree and delta set invariants are both eventually periodic , and the omega-primality invariant is eventually quasilinear .	In this paper , we demonstrate how each of these invariants is determined by Hilbert functions of graded modules .	In doing so , we recover the aforementioned eventual behavior results for numerical semigroups , as well as extend these results to affine semigroups .
0	Monte Carlo techniques are used to model nonlinear particle acceleration in parallel collisionless shocks of various speeds , including mildly relativistic ones .	When the acceleration is efficient , the backreaction of accelerated particles modifies the shock structure and causes the compression ratio , r , to increase above test-particle values .	Modified shocks with Lorentz factors less than about 3 can have compression ratios considerably greater than 3 and the momentum distribution of energetic particles no longer follows a power law relation .	These results may be important for the interpretation of gamma-ray bursts if mildly relativistic internal and/or afterglow shocks play an important role accelerating particles that produce the observed radiation .	For shock Lorentz factors greater than about 10 , r approaches 3 and the so-called `universal ' test-particle result of N ( E ) proportional to E^ { -2.3 } is obtained for sufficiently energetic particles .
3	Evaluating the spreading of a droplet on a completely wetting surface , the Voinov-Tanner-Cox law ( $ \theta \propto \text { Ca } ^ { 1/3 } $ ) can be observed .	In this work , an analytical Volume Of Fluid ( VOF ) implementation of the Generalized Navier Boundary Condition is presented based on the Brackbill surface tension model .	The model is validated by simulations of droplets on a smooth surface in a planar geometry .	Looking at the static behavior of the droplets , it is found that there is a good match between the droplet shape resolved in the simulations and the theoretically predicted shape for various values of the Young 's angle .	At later times scaling follows $ r \propto t^ { 1/2 } $ , suggesting spreading is limited by inertia .
2	Special attention is paid to calculating the Fourier integrals .	Wave propagation in a stratified fluid / porous medium is studied here using analytical and numerical methods .	The semi-analytical method is based on an exact stiffness matrix method coupled with a matrix conditioning procedure , preventing the occurrence of poorly conditioned numerical systems .	The numerical method is based on a high order finite-difference time-domain scheme .	Mesh refinement is applied near the interfaces to discretize the slow compressional diffusive wave predicted by Biot 's theory .
1	Model-based investigations are common approaches in simulation and optimization .	The sequential parameter optimization ( SPOT ) package for R is a toolbox for tuning and understanding simulation and optimization algorithms .	Sequential parameter optimization has been developed , because there is a strong need for sound statistical analysis of simulation and optimization algorithms .	SPOT includes methods for tuning based on classical regression and analysis of variance techniques ; tree-based models such as CART and random forest ; Gaussian process models ( Kriging ) , and combinations of different meta-modeling approaches .	This article exemplifies how SPOT can be used for automatic and interactive tuning .
0	We investigate whether the formation mechanism of boxy and peanut-shaped ( B/PS ) bulges could depend on the gas content of the galaxy .	We have performed N-body simulations with and without a gaseous component .	In the second case star formation/feedback recipes have also been implemented to create new stellar populations .	As in many previous studies , in our N-body collisionless simulation , the B/PS is due to the classical break in the z mirror symmetry lasting roughly 200 Myr .	When a gaseous component and star formation recipes are added to the simulation , the bulge-growing mechanism is quite different .
4	The effective charge of oxygen ( Z $ _O $ ) calculated using the measured LO-TO splitting increases below T $ _N $ .	We have measured near normal incidence far infrared ( FIR ) reflectivity spectra of a single crystal of TbMnO3 from 10K to 300K in the spectral range of 50 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ to 700 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ .	Fifteen transverse optic ( TO ) and longitudinal optic ( LO ) modes are identified in the imaginary part of the dielectric function $ \epsilon_2 $ ( $ \omega $ ) and energy loss function Im ( -1/ $ \epsilon $ ( $ \omega $ ) ) , respectively .	Some of the observed phonon modes show anomalous softening below the magnetic transition temperature T $ _N $ ( ~ 46K ) .	We attribute this anomalous softening to the spin-phonon coupling caused by phonon modulation of the super-exchange integral between the Mn $ ^ { 3+ } $ spins .
1	Our architecture achieves this with the help of expert networks : A network is trained on a disjoint subset of a given dataset and then run in parallel to other experts during deployment .	We present a new supervised architecture termed Mediated Mixture-of-Experts ( MMoE ) that allows us to improve classification accuracy of Deep Convolutional Networks ( DCN ) .	A mediator is employed if experts contradict each other .	This allows our framework to naturally support incremental learning , as adding new classes requires ( re- ) training of the new expert only .	We also propose two measures to control computational complexity : An early-stopping mechanism halts experts that have low confidence in their prediction .
1	The loaded quality factors are controlled by appropriately designed input and output coupling capacitors .	We have designed and fabricated superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators with fundamental frequencies from 2 to $ 9 \rm { GHz } $ and loaded quality factors ranging from a few hundreds to a several hundred thousands reached at temperatures of $ 20 \rm { mK } $ .	The measured transmission spectra are analyzed using both a lumped element model and a distributed element transmission matrix method .	The experimentally determined resonance frequencies , quality factors and insertion losses are fully and consistently characterized by the two models for all measured devices .	Such resonators find prominent applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing with superconducting electronic circuits and in single photon detectors and parametric amplifiers .
1	In contrast to most of the previous works , this analysis shows that for masses below ~1 TeV resonant New Physics could accommodate the experimental data .	We present a phenomenological analysis of the recent Tevatron results on the $ t \bar t $ forward-backward asymmetry and invariant-mass spectrum assuming a new contribution from an s-channel gluon resonance with a mass in the range from 700 to 2500 GeV .	In general , we find that axial-like couplings are preferred for light and top quark couplings , and that only top quark couples strongly to New Physics .	We find that composite model scenarios arise naturally from only phenomenological analyses of the experimental results .	We show that our results are compatible with recent LHC limits in dijet and $ t \bar t $ production , and find some tension for large resonance mass ~2.5 TeV .
1	Even in their simplest 1D architectures , they display complex topological phenomena , which can be employed in the systematic study of topological quantum phase transitions [ 1 ] .	Discrete-time quantum walks ( QWs ) represent robust and versatile platforms for the controlled engineering of single particle quantum dynamics , and have attracted special attention due to their algorithmic applications in quantum information science .	Due to the exponential scaling in the number of resources required , most experimental realizations of QWs up to date have been limited to single particles , with only a few implementations involving correlated quantum pairs .	In this article we study applications of quantum walks in the controlled dynamical engineering of entanglement in bipartite bosonic systems .	We show that quantum walks can be employed in the transition from mode entanglement , where indistinguishability of the quantum particles plays a key role , to the standard type of entanglement associated with distinguishable particles .
2	It is argued that the subleading order correction is dominated by purely planar diagrams in the large mass limit .	Inclusive absorption cross section of fundamental IIB string to D-string is calculated perturbatively .	The leading order result agrees with estimate based on stringy Higgs mechanism via Cremmer-Scherk coupling .	The correction represents conversion of binding energy into local recoil process of the fundamental string and D-string bound state .	We show their presence explicitly in the next leading order .
1	It is shown how the method can treat the local spins and phonons quantum-mechanically and how it is equivalent to dynamical mean field theory in the classical limit .	An introduction is given to the many-body coherent potential approximation ( CPA ) for the double-exchange ( DE ) model and the Holstein-DE model , the latter including coupling of the electrons to local phonons as well as to local spins .	In the Holstein-DE model a full discussion is given of the cross-over from weak electron-phonon coupling through intermediate coupling , where small-polaron bands begin to appear , to strong coupling where some results similar to those of standard small-polaron theory are recovered .	The theory is applied to ferromagnetic manganites with a full discussion of magnetic , transport and spectroscopic data .	It is found that many manganites are in the critical regime on the verge of small-polaron formation , which explains their sensitivity to parameters such as applied magnetic field and pressure .
3	At the current level of accuracy it looks reasonable to safely neglect sub-dominant spin WIMP-nucleon contributions analyzing the data from spin-non-zero targets .	The Weakly Interacting Massive Particle ( WIMP ) is one of the main candidates for the relic dark matter ( DM ) .In the effective low-energy minimal supersymmetric standard model ( effMSSM ) the neutralino-nucleon spin and scalar cross sections in the low-mass regime were calculated .	The calculated cross sections are compared with almost all experimental currently available exclusion curves for spin-dependent WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron cross sections .	It is demonstrated that in general about two-orders-of-magnitude improvement of the current DM experiment sensitivities is needed to reach the ( effMSSM ) SUSY predictions .	To avoid misleading discrepancies between data and SUSY calculations it is , however , preferable to use a mixed spin-scalar coupling approach.This approach is applied to estimate future prospects of experiments with the odd-neutron high-spin isotope Ge-73 .
1	Both two- and three-dimensional condensates are considered , for atomic species with either repulsive or attractive interactions .	The cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a lattice potential is used to model a periodic dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensate .	A family of exact solutions and corresponding potential is presented in terms of elliptic functions .	The dynamical stability of these exact solutions is examined using both analytical and numerical methods .	For condensates with repulsive atomic interactions , all stable , trivial-phase solutions are off-set from the zero level .
3	Moreover , we discus the stability of the one-dimensional inverse scattering problem by using Lyapunov exponents .	We present a novel method to estimate the stability of the Marchenko equation for finite data-sets .	We show that we can derive a recursion relationship for the Fourier expansion coefficients of the kernel which is solved by the Marchenko equation .	The method can easily be implemented numerically .	We give conditions on the scattering data to provide stable inversion results .
4	For the case in which $ H_0 $ is the harmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian , $ Q_0 $ is calculated exactly and in closed form and it is shown explicitly to be nonunique .	The C operator in PT-symmetric quantum mechanics satisfies a system of three simultaneous algebraic operator equations , $ C^2=1 $ , $ [ C , PT ] =0 $ , and $ [ C , H ] =0 $ .	These equations are difficult to solve exactly , so perturbative methods have been used in the past to calculate C. The usual approach has been to express the Hamiltonian as $ H=H_0+\epsilon H_1 $ , and to seek a solution for C in the form $ C=e^Q P $ , where $ Q=Q ( q , p ) $ is odd in the momentum p , even in the coordinate q , and has a perturbation expansion of the form $ Q=\epsilon Q_1+\epsilon^3 Q_3+\epsilon^5 Q_5+\ldots $ .	[ In previous work it has always been assumed that the coefficients of even powers of $ \epsilon $ in this expansion would be absent because their presence would violate the condition that $ Q ( p , q ) $ is odd in p. ] In an earlier paper it was argued that the C operator is not unique because the perturbation coefficient $ Q_1 $ is nonunique .	Here , the nonuniqueness of C is demonstrated at a more fundamental level : It is shown that the perturbation expansion for Q actually has the more general form $ Q=Q_0+\epsilon Q_1+\epsilon^2 Q_2+\ldots $ in which { \it all } powers and not just odd powers of $ \epsilon $ appear .
2	This outer shell probably originates in the collisionally excited atoms close to the front of the bow shock .	We present H-alpha and [ O III ] ( 5007 Angstroms ) images of the nebula powered by the jet of the black hole candidate and microquasar Cygnus X-1 , observed with the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope ( INT ) .	The ring-like structure is luminous in [ O III ] and there exists a thin outer shell with a high [ O III ] / H-alpha flux ratio .	Its presence indicates that the gas is shock excited as opposed to photoionised , supporting the jet-powered scenario .	The shock velocity was previously constrained at 20 & lt ; v & lt ; 360 km/s ; here we show that v & gt ; = 100 km/s ( 1 sigma confidence ) based on a comparison of the observed [ O III ] / H-alpha ratio in the bow shock with a number of radiative shock models .
4	We find Ha emission that is well correlated with detected 12CO ( 1-0 ) line emission ( a proxy for molecular hydrogen ) , as well as other easily identified ring-like HI features .	We present here a preliminary report and commentary of recently processed observations of Ha emission towards the Magellanic Bridge .	These data have been analysed in an attempt to quantify the extent to which the stellar population is capable of reshaping the local ISM .	We find that the Ha emission regions are small , weak and sparsely distributed , consistent with a relatively quiescent and inactive ISM where radiative and collisional ionisation is inefficient and sporadic .	This suggests that energetic processes at the small scale ( i.e.~tens of pc ) do not dominate the energy balance within the ISM of the Bridge , which therefore hosts a pristine turbulent structure , otherwise inaccessible within our own Galaxy .
3	Unfortunately , only a handful of radio supernovae are close and bright enough as to permit their study with VLBI .	We give an overview of circumstellar interaction in young Type II supernovae , as seen through the eyes of very-long-baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) observations .	The resolution attained by such observations ( best than 1 mas ) is a powerful tool to probe the interaction that takes place after a supernova goes off .	The direct imaging of a supernova permits , in principle , to estimate the deceleration of its expansion , and to obtain information on the eject and circumstellar density profiles , as well as estimates of the magnetic field intensity and relativistic particle energy density in the supernova .	We present results from our high-resolution observations of the nearby Type II radio supernovae SN1986J and SN2001gd .
4	We describe the behavior of 22 European markets during the medieval period , in particular , during the Maunder minimum ( 1650-1715 ) .	We present the results of study of a possible relationship between the space weather and terrestrial markets of agricultural products .	It is shown that to implement the possible effect of space weather on the terrestrial harvests and prices , a simultaneous fulfillment of three conditions is required : 1 ) sensitivity of local weather ( cloud cover , atmospheric circulation ) to the state of space weather ; 2 ) sensitivity of the area of specific agricultural crops to the weather anomalies ( belonging to the area of risk farming ) ; 3 ) relative isolation of the market , making it difficult to damp the price hikes by the external food supplies .	Four possible scenarios of the market response to the modulations of local terrestrial weather via the solar activity are described .	The data sources and analysis methods applied to detect this relationship are characterized .
0	We perform an exact spherical geometry finite-size diagonalization calculation for the fractional quantum Hall ground state in three different experimentally relevant GaAs-Al_ { x } Ga_ { 1-x } As systems : a wide parabolic quantum well , a narrow square quantum well , and a heterostructure .	For each system we obtain the Coulomb pseudopotential parameters entering the exact diagonalization calculation by using the realistic subband wave function from a self-consistent electronic structure calculation within the local density approximation ( LDA ) for a range of electron densities .	We compare our realistic LDA pseudopotential parameters with those from widely used simpler model approximations in order to estimate the accuracies of the latter .	We also calculate the overlap between the exact numerical ground state and the analytical Laughlin state as well as the excitation gap as a function of density .	For the three physical systems we consider the calculated overlap is found to be large in the experimental electron density range .
0	A particular framework for quantum gravity is the doubly special relativity ( DSR ) formalism that introduces a new observer independent scale ( the Planck scale ) .	We resort to the methods of statistical mechanics in this framework to determine how the deformed dispersion relation effects the thermodynamics of a photon gas .	The ensuing modifications to the density of states , partition function , pressure , internal energy , entropy , free energy and specific heat are calculated .	These results are compared with the outcome obtained in the Lorentz violating model of Camacho and Murcias ( Gen.Relativ.Gravit.39 : 1175-1183 , 2007 ) .	The two types of models predict different results due to different spacetime structure near the Planck scale .
2	We provide numerical evidence that the scaling variables about the two fixed points have overlapping domain of convergence .	We construct series expansions for the scaling variables ( which transform multiplicatively under a renormalization group ( RG ) transformation ) in examples where the RG flows , going from an unstable ( Wilson 's ) fixed point to a stable ( high-temperature ) fixed point , can be calculated numerically .	The examples are Dyson 's hierarchical model and a simplified version of it .	We show how quantities such as the magnetic susceptibility can be expressed in terms of these variables .	This procedure provide accurate analytical expressions both in the critical and high-temperature region .
4	In this regime , we derive leading-order asymptotic approximations for the ( i ) classical bulk space-charge layer and ( ii ) another , nested highly charged boundary layer at the cathode .	We study a model electrochemical thin film at dc currents exceeding the classical diffusion-limited value .	The mathematical problem involves the steady Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for a binary electrolyte with nonlinear boundary conditions for reaction kinetics and Stern-layer capacitance , as well as an integral constraint on the number of anions .	At the limiting current , we find a nested boundary layer structure at the cathode , which is required by the reaction boundary condition .	Above the limiting current , a depletion of anions generally characterizes the cathode side of the cell .
2	The use of different clock ensembles results in measurable changes in some millisecond pulsar timing data .	Terrestrial timescales show instabilities due to the physical limitations of the atomic clocks .	Stricter environmental isolation and increased numbers of improved cesium clocks and cavity-tuned hydrogen masers have resulted in time scales more accurate by a factor of about five .	We investigate the possible application of millisecond pulsars to define a precise long-term time standard and positional reference system in a nearly inertial reference frame .	Although possible quantitative contribution of the two longest studied millisecond pulsars to terrestrial timescales appears minimal , they may prove useful as independent standards in identifying error sources that are difficult to detect due to the finite lifetime and common reference frame of terrestrial clocks .
3	We also derive Goldstone 's theorem on Moyal spacetime .	After briefly reviewing the gauge symmetry in Moyal spacetimes , we analyse aspects of symmetry breaking within a quantisation program preserving the twisted Poincar\'e symmetry .	We develop the LSZ approach for Moyal spacetimes and derive a mapping for scattering amplitudes on these spacetimes from the corresponding ones on the commutative spacetime .	This map applies in the presence of spontaneous breakdown of symmetries as well .	The formalism developed here can be directly applied to the twisted standard model .
2	A fuzzy logic controller is used to control each actuator ; the system is nonlinear and sensitive to initial conditions .	In this paper we present a Fuzzy Logic control approach designed to stabilize a multi-input multi-output magnetic suspension system .	The system has four cubic floaters and four actuators that apply magnetic forces on the floaters , the suspension is performed by changing the voltages applied on the actuators , hence changing their currents , producing vertical magnetic forces that balance with the gravitational force .	Another fuzzy logic controller is used as a supervisory controller in order to increase the dynamic range of the system , enabling it to stabilize the floaters when the initial displacements are relatively big .	Another design consideration was to keep the four floaters in the same plane as much as possible , to perform that task , a PD controller was set to modulate the currents of the four actuators in order to minimize an error signal measuring the relative vertical displacement of all the four floaters .
2	Therefore , it is worth comparing the two for imaging applications .	The new technique of Speckle Stabilization has great potential to provide optical imaging data at the highest angular resolutions from the ground .	While Speckle Stabilization was initially conceived for integral field spectroscopic analyses , the technique shares many similarities with speckle imaging ( specifically shift-and-add and Lucky Imaging ) .	We have modeled observations on a 2.5-meter class telescope to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the two techniques .	While the differences are relatively minor , we find that Speckle Stabilization is a viable competitor to current Lucky Imaging systems .
0	An intrinsic measure of the quality of a variational wave function is given by its overlap with the ground state of the system .	We derive a general formula to compute this overlap when quantum dynamics in imaginary time is accessible .	The overlap is simply related to the area under the $ E ( \tau ) $ curve , i.e.the energy as a function of imaginary time .	This has important applications to , for example , quantum Monte-Carlo algorithms where the overlap becomes as a simple byproduct of routine simulations .	As a result , we find that the practical definition of a good variational wave function for quantum Monte-Carlo simulations , { \it i.e . }
4	The limiting continuum genealogical forests are then studied in detail from both the quenched and annealed points of view .	We consider catalytic branching populations .	They consist of a catalyst population evolving according to a critical binary branching process in continuous time with a constant branching rate and a reactant population with a branching rate proportional to the number of catalyst individuals alive .	The reactant forms a process in random medium .	We describe asymptotically the genealogy of catalytic branching populations coded as the induced forest of $ \mathbb { R } $ -trees using the many individuals -- rapid branching continuum limit .
0	We study Recursive Concurrent Stochastic Games ( RCSGs ) , extending our recent analysis of recursive simple stochastic games to a concurrent setting where the two players choose moves simultaneously and independently at each state .	For multi-exit games , our earlier work already showed undecidability for basic questions like termination , thus we focus on the important case of single-exit RCSGs ( 1-RCSGs ) .	We first characterize the value of a 1-RCSG termination game as the least fixed point solution of a system of nonlinear minimax functional equations , and use it to show PSPACE decidability for the quantitative termination problem .	We then give a strategy improvement technique , which we use to show that player 1 ( maximizer ) has \epsilon-optimal randomized Stackless & amp ; Memoryless ( r-SM ) strategies for all \epsilon & gt ; 0 , while player 2 ( minimizer ) has optimal r-SM strategies .	Thus , such games are r-SM-determined .
4	Unfortunately , our results show that even the NLO corrections to both color-singlet and octet states are accounted , the data can not be understood yet in the framework of the present theory , but there , as observed , still a small window remains , namely a P-wave octet might substantially contribute .	The remarkable discrepancy between theory and data on the p_t distribution of J/psi polarization in the process pp - & gt ; J/psi+X has been standing as a puzzle for a long time .	Our early work indicates that if only considering the color-singlet state , NLO corrections may drastically change the distribution , but are not sufficient to accommodate the data .	The color-octet intermediate state was suggested to make up the gap .	Therefore a direct motivation is to evaluate if the NLO corrections to the J/psi production via a color-octet can indeed remedy the problem .
4	For instance , we characterize their closures , and we determine those bases $ q $ for which $ \mathcal { U } _q $ is closed or even a Cantor set .	It was discovered some years ago that there exist non-integer real numbers $ q & gt ; 1 $ for which only one sequence $ ( c_i ) $ of integers $ c_i \in [ 0 , q ) $ satisfies the equality $ \sum_ { i=1 } ^\infty c_iq^ { -i } =1 $ .	The set of such `` univoque numbers '' has a rich topological structure , and its study revealed a number of unexpected connections with measure theory , fractals , ergodic theory and Diophantine approximation .	In this paper we consider for each fixed $ q & gt ; 1 $ the set $ \mathcal { U } _q $ of real numbers $ x $ having a unique representation of the form $ \sum_ { i=1 } ^\infty c_iq^ { -i } =x $ with integers $ c_i $ belonging to $ [ 0 , q ) $ .	We carry out a detailed topological study of these sets .
1	The emission gas is characterized by an underlying general orderly behaviour , consistent with galactic rotation , over which are superposed kinematically distinct and strongly localized emission structures .	We present the first results of the Hubble Space Telescope/Faint Object Camera long-slit spectroscopy of the inner 8 '' of the Narrow Line Region of NGC 4151 at a spatial resolution of 0 '' .029 .	High velocity components shifted up to ~ 1500 km/s from the systemic velocity are seen , associated with individual clouds located preferentially along the edges of the radio knots .	Off-nuclear blue continuum emission is also observed , associated with the brightest emission line clouds .	Emission line ratios like [ NeIII ] 3869/ [ OII ] 3727 , and [ OII ] 3727/Hbeta are observed to vary substantially between individual clouds .
2	Here , we present evidence and articulate a general framework that allows one to diagnose the fundamental cause of the unfolding financial and economic crisis : the accumulation of several bubbles and their interplay and mutual reinforcement has led to an illusion of a `` perpetual money machine '' allowing financial institutions to extract wealth from an unsustainable artificial process .	The financial crisis of 2008 , which started with an initially well-defined epicenter focused on mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) , has been cascading into a global economic recession , whose increasing severity and uncertain duration has led and is continuing to lead to massive losses and damage for billions of people .	Heavy central bank interventions and government spending programs have been launched worldwide and especially in the USA and Europe , with the hope to unfreeze credit and boltster consumption .	Taking stock of this diagnostic , we conclude that many of the interventions to address the so-called liquidity crisis and to encourage more consumption are ill-advised and even dangerous , given that precautionary reserves were not accumulated in the `` good times '' but that huge liabilities were .	The most `` interesting '' present times constitute unique opportunities but also great challenges , for which we offer a few recommendations .
1	The intelligent relays are able to gather channel state information , perform linear processing and forward signals whereas the dumb relays is only able to serve as amplifiers .	In a multi-user wireless network equipped with multiple relay nodes , some relays are more intelligent than other relay nodes .	As the dumb relays are oblivious to the source and destination nodes , the wireless network can be modeled as a relay network with *smart instantaneous relay* only : the signals of source-destination arrive at the same time as source-relay-destination .	Recently , instantaneous relaying is shown to improve the degrees-of-freedom of the network as compared to classical cut-set bound .	In this paper , we study an achievable rate region and its boundary of the instantaneous interference relay channel in the scenario of ( a ) uninformed non-cooperative source-destination nodes ( source and destination nodes are not aware of the existence of the relay and are non-cooperative ) and ( b ) informed and cooperative source-destination nodes .
2	In this paper , we consider weights of product type , and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the Lorentz spaces , defined with respect to the two-dimensional decreasing rearrangement , to be normable .	In the last decade , the problem of characterizing the normability of the weighted Lorentz spaces has been completely solved ( \cite { Sa } , \cite { CaSoA } ) .	However , the question for multidimensional Lorentz spaces is still open .	To this end , it is also useful to study the mixed norm Lorentz spaces .	Finally , we prove embeddings between all the classical , multidimensional , and mixed norm Lorentz spaces .
1	In this light we propose a spatial attraction cellular network ( SAN ) consisting of macro cells overlaid with small cell base stations that wirelessly charge user batteries .	A strong motivation of charging depleted battery can be an enabler for network capacity increase .	Such a network makes battery depleting users move toward the vicinity of small cell base stations .	With a fine adjustment of charging power , this user spatial attraction ( SA ) improves in spectral efficiency as well as load balancing .	We jointly optimize both enhancements thanks to SA , and derive the corresponding optimal charging power in a closed form by using a stochastic geometric approach .
2	Viscous accretion depletes significant amounts of the mass in gas and solids , while photoevaporative flows driven by internal and external irradiation remove most of the gas .	Protoplanetary disks dissipate rapidly after the central star forms , on time-scales comparable to those inferred for planet formation .	In order to allow the formation of planets , disks must survive the dispersive effects of UV and X-ray photoevaporation for at least a few Myr .	A reasonably large fraction of the mass in solids and some gas get incorporated into planets .	Here , we review our current understanding of disk evolution and dispersal , and discuss how these might affect planet formation .
2	With our model we are able to reproduce the different features of alpha-elements and s-and r-process elements .	The considerable scatter of the s- and r-process elements observed in low-metallicity stars , compared to the small star to star scatter observed for the alpha elements , is an open question for the chemical evolution studies .	We have developed a stochastic chemical evolution model , in which the main assumption is a random formation of new stars , subject to the condition that the cumulative mass distribution follows a given initial mass function .	The reason for this resides in the random birth of stellar masses coupled with the different stellar mass ranges from where alpha-elements and s-and r-process elements originate .	In particular , the sites of production of the alpha elements are the whole range of the massive stars , whereas the mass range of production for the s- and r-process elements has an upper limit of 30 solar masses .
3	As a main benefit , many techniques and results gained in the time domain thus generalize straight away .	Typical features of the Transmission Line Matrix ( TLM ) algorithm in connection with stub loading techniques and prone to be hidden in common frequency domain formulations are elucidated within the propagator approach to TLM .	In particular , the latter reflects properly the perturbative character of the TLM scheme and its relation to gauge field models .	Internal 'gauge ' degrees of freedom are made explicit in the frequency domain by introducing the complex nodal S-matrix as a function of operators that act on external or internal fields or virtually couple the two .	The recently developed deflection method for algorithm synthesis , which is extended in this paper , or the non-orthogonal node approximating Maxwell 's equations , for instance , become so at once available in the frequency domain .
4	This phenomenon is dominated by galaxies and lower-mass halos ( & lt ; ~1e12 Msun ) , and is very sensitive to the inner density profile of the halos .	Gravitational lensing can amplify the apparent brightness of distant sources .	Images that are highly magnified are often part of multiply-imaged systems , but we consider the possibility of having large magnifications without additional detectable images .	In rare but non-negligible situations , lensing can produce a singly highly magnified image ; this phenomenon is mainly associated with massive cluster-scale halos ( & gt ; ~1e13.5 Msun ) .	Alternatively , lensing can produce multiply-imaged systems in which the extra images are either unresolved or too faint to be detectable .
1	The scattering process incorporates boson-phonon interactions that arise due to lattice vibrations .	We examine the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle on the scattering properties of composite bosons ( cobosons ) made of two fermions , such as the exciton quasiparticle .	Composite boson scattering rates increase with the entanglement between the two fermionic constituents , which comes with a larger number of available single-fermion states .	An important role is played by probabilities associated with accommodating an incoming boson among the remaining unoccupied Schmidt modes in the initial composite system .	While due attention is given to bi-fermion bosons , the methodology is applicable to any composite boson made up of smaller boson fragments .
1	Using a novel imaging and analysis technique we estimated pheromone concentrations at all spatial positions in the experimental arena and at different times .	We studied the formation of trail patterns by Argentine ants exploring an empty arena .	Then we derived the response function of individual ants to pheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and changes in speed or direction of the ants .	Ants were found to turn in response to local pheromone concentrations , while their speed was largely unaffected by these concentrations .	Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over time , with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant determining the turning angle .
4	Most of the existing CAD systems use handpicked features to represent a HEp-2 cell image , which may only work in limited scenarios .	The Anti-Nuclear Antibody ( ANA ) clinical pathology test is commonly used to identify the existence of various diseases .	A hallmark method for identifying the presence of ANAs is the Indirect Immunofluorescence method on Human Epithelial ( HEp-2 ) cells , due to its high sensitivity and the large range of antigens that can be detected .	However , the method suffers from numerous shortcomings , such as being subjective as well as time and labour intensive .	Computer Aided Diagnostic ( CAD ) systems have been developed to address these problems , which automatically classify a HEp-2 cell image into one of its known patterns ( eg. , speckled , homogeneous ) .
2	The crystal data from X-ray measurements , as well as the structures where either all atomic , or only hydrogen atom positions are optimized in the density functional theory are analyzed .	Electric field gradients and chemical shielding tensors of the stable monoclinic crystal phase of ethanol are computed .	The projector-augmented wave ( PAW ) and gauge-including projector-augmented wave ( GIPAW ) models in the periodic plane-wave density functional theory are used .	These structural models are also studied by including the semi-empirical Van der Waals correction to the density functional theory .	Infrared spectra of these five crystal models are calculated .
3	The effects of including higher ( electric and magnetic ) multipoles upon the emitted photon pairs beyond the electric-dipole approximation are also discussed .	The two-photon decay in hydrogen-like ions is investigated within the framework of second order perturbation theory and Dirac 's relativistic equation .	Special attention is paid to the angular correlation of the emitted photons as well as to the degree of linear polarization of one of the two photons , if the second is just observed under given angles .	Expressions for the angular correlation and the degree of linear polarization are expanded in terms of $ \cos\theta $ -polynomials , whose coefficients depend on the atomic number and the energy sharing of the emitted photons .	Calculations of the coefficients are performed for the transitions $ 2s_ { 1/2 } \rightarrow1s_ { 1/2 } $ , $ 3d_ { 3/2 } \rightarrow1s_ { 1/2 } $ and $ 3d_ { 5/2 } \rightarrow1s_ { 1/2 } $ , along the entire hydrogen isoelectronic sequence ( $ 1\le Z \le 100 $ ) .
4	For chain growth , our results are compared to the existing simulation literature .	Classical Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) simulations provide insight on the properties of many soft-matter systems .	In some situations it is interesting to model the creation of chemical bonds , a process that is not part of the MD framework .	In this context , we propose a parallel algorithm for step- and chain-growth polymerization that is based on a generic reaction scheme , works at a given intrinsic rate and produces continuous trajectories .	We present an implementation in the ESPResSo++ simulation software and compare it with the corresponding feature in LAMMPS .
1	We study the time evolution property of a tagged particle in TASEP with the step-type initial condition .	The one-dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( TASEP ) is considered .	Calculated is the multi-time joint distribution function of its position .	Using the relation of the dynamics of TASEP to the Schur process , we show that the function is represented as the Fredholm determinant .	We also study the scaling limit .
0	We carry out a systematic study of the X-ray emission from the active nuclei of the 0.02 & lt ; z & lt ; 0.7 2Jy sample , using Chandra and XMM-Newton observations .	We combine our results with those from mid-IR , optical emission line and radio observations , and add them to those of the 3CRR sources .	We show that the low-excitation objects in our samples \redit { show signs } of radiatively inefficient accretion .	We study the effect of the jet-related emission on the various luminosities , confirming that it is the main source of soft X-ray emission for our sources .	We also find strong correlations between the accretion-related luminosities , and identify several sources whose optical classification is incompatible with their accretion properties .
3	Remarkably , this is so not only at the larger values of l , where the gap between the ground state energy and the low-lying excitations becomes small compared to the mass gap , but also down to much shorter lengths where these excitation energies become large compared to sqrt ( K ) , the flux-tube no longer `looks ' anything like a thin string , and an expansion of the effective string action in powers of 1/l no longer converges .	We calculate the energy spectrum of a confining flux tube that is closed around a spatial torus , as a function of its length l. We do so for various SU ( N ) gauge theories in 3+1 dimensions , and for various values of spin , parity and longitudinal momentum .	We are able to present usefully accurate results for about 20 of the lightest such states , for a range of l that begins close to the ( finite volume ) deconfining phase transition , and extends up to l.sqrt ( K ) ~6 ( where K is the string tension ) .	We find that most of these low-lying states are well described by the spectrum of the Nambu-Goto free string theory in flat space-time .	All this is for flux in the fundamental representation .
3	Since large orders are usually executed by splitting into smaller size trades , procedures used by FL give a downward bias for this power law exponent .	We respond to the issues discussed by Farmer and Lillo ( FL ) related to our proposed approach to understanding the origin of power-law distributions in stock price fluctuations .	First , we extend our previous analysis to 1000 US stocks and perform a new estimation of market impact that accounts for splitting of large orders and potential autocorrelations in the trade flow .	Our new analysis shows clearly that price impact and volume are related by a square-root functional form of market impact for large volumes , in contrast to the claim of FL that this relationship increases as a power law with a smaller exponent .	Second , FL analyze 3 stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange , and solely on this basis they claim that the distribution of transaction volumes do not have a power-law tail for the London Stock Exchange .
2	The EB phenomenon is evident of an interface exchange coupling between coexisting antiferromagnetic ( AFM ) and ferromagnetic ( FM ) phases and confirms the phase separated state of the compound at low temperatures .	The exchange bias ( EB ) phenomenon has been found in Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 perovskite .	The phenomenon manifests itself as a negative horizontal shift of magnetization hysteresis loops .	The EB effect is found to be strongly dependent on the cooling magnetic field and the temperature , which is associated with the evolution of spontaneous AFM - FM phase separated state of the compound .	Analysis of magnetic hysteresis loops has shown that ferromagnetic moment $ M_ { FM } $ originating from the FM clusters saturates in a relatively low magnetic field about H ~ 0.4T .
4	The target field for proton-photon collisions is provided by the synchrotron radiation in the acceleration region .	We present a model for high-energy emission in microquasars where the energy content of the jets is dominated by relativistic protons .	We also include a primary leptonic component .	Particles are accelerated up to relativistic energies in a compact region located near the base of the jet , where most of the emission is produced .	We calculate the production spectrum due to proton and electron synchrotron radiation and photohadronic interactions .
1	A fit of background and signal contributions to the J/psi + lepton mass distribution yielded 20.4 +6.2 -5.5 events from B_c mesons .	We have observed bottom-charm mesons B_c via the decay mode Bc - & gt ; J/psi lepton neutrino in 1.8 TeV p-bar p collisions using the CDF detector at the Fermilab Tevatron .	A fit to the same distribution with background alone was rejected at the level of 4.8 standard deviations .	We measured the B_c mass to be 6.40 +- 0.39 +- 0.13 GeVc^2 and the B_c lifetime to be tau ( B_c ) = 0.46 +0.18 -0.16 +- 0.03 ps .	We measured the production cross section times branching ratio for B_c - & gt ; J/psi lepton neutrino relative to that for B+ - & gt ; J/psi K to be 0.132 +0.041 -0.037 ( stat ) +- 0.031 ( syst ) +0.032 -0.020 ( lifetime ) .
0	We analyze the Galactic bulge microlensing event MOA-2003-BLG-37 .	Although the Einstein timescale is relatively short , t_e=43 days , the lightcurve displays deviations consistent with parallax effects due to the Earth 's accelerated motion .	We show that the chi^2 surface has four distinct local minima that are induced by the `` jerk-parallax '' degeneracy , with pairs of solutions having projected Einstein radii , \tilde r_e = 1.76 AU and 1.28 AU , respectively .	This is the second event displaying such a degeneracy and the first toward the Galactic bulge .	For both events , the jerk-parallax formalism accurately describes the offsets between the different solutions , giving hope that when extra solutions exist in future events , they can easily be found .
1	Europhysics Letters 8 , 9 ( 1989 ) .	We consider adsorption of random copolymer chains onto an interface within the model of Garel et al .	By using the replica method the adsorption of the copolymer at the interface is mapped onto the problem of finding the ground state of a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian .	To study this ground state we introduce a novel variational principle for the Green 's function , which generalizes the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method of Quantum Mechanics to nonstationary states .	Minimization with an appropriate trial Green 's function enables us to find the phase diagram for the localization-delocalization transition for an ideal random copolymer at the interface .
4	We match the field theory cascade with supergravity by computing Page charges and interpreting Seiberg dualities as large gauge transformations of the background .	In the context of AdS/CFT , we consider a cascading theory with an arbitrarily large number of chiral flavors .	In the UV the theory can be considered as a chiral flavoring of the Klebanov-Tseytlin solution , and exhibits a duality wall .	Instead in the IR , due to the rich dynamics , it safely flows to a non-cascading theory .	We engineer the field theory through intersecting D7-branes with world-volume gauge flux on a conifold with 3-form fluxes , and we find new fully backreacted solutions of Type IIB Supergravity plus branes .
4	We apply these upshots to two structures of the DHC and provide an exhaustive description of their cohomology .	We introduce the concept of strongly $ r $ -matrix induced ( { \small SRMI } ) Poisson structure , report on the relation of this property with the stabilizer dimension of the considered quadratic Poisson tensor , and classify the Poisson structures of the Dufour-Haraki classification ( DHC ) according to their membership of the family of { \small SRMI } tensors .	One of the main results of our work is a generic cohomological procedure for { \small SRMI } Poisson structures in arbitrary dimension .	This approach allows decomposing Poisson cohomology into , basically , a Koszul cohomology and a relative cohomology .	Moreover , we investigate this associated Koszul cohomology , highlight its tight connections with Spectral Theory , and reduce the computation of this main building block of Poisson cohomology to a problem of linear algebra .
4	Hence , IC 4996 and NGC 6530 are most suitable to search for PMS pulsation among their A- and F-type cluster stars .	Asteroseismology of pulsating pre-main sequence ( PMS ) stars has the potential of testing the validity of current models of PMS structure and evolution .	As a first step , a sufficiently large sample of pulsating PMS stars has to be established , which allows to select candidates optimally suited for a detailed asteroseismological analysis based on photometry from space or ground based network data .	A search for pulsating PMS members in the young open clusters IC 4996 and NGC 6530 has been performed to improve the sample of known PMS pulsators .	As both clusters are younger than 10 million years , all members with spectral types later than A0 have not reached the zero-age main sequence yet .
2	We argue that Planckian relativity must necessarily involve the effect of black hole formation .	A basic inconsistency arises when the Theory of Special Relativity meets with quantum phenomena at the Planck scale .	Specifically , the Planck length is Lorentz invariant and should not be affected by a Lorentz boost .	Recent proposals for resolving the noted inconsistency seem unsatisfactory in that they ignore the crucial role of gravity in the saturation of Lorentz boosts .	Furthermore , an invariant length at he Planck scale amounts to a universal quantum of resolution in the fabric of spacetime .
3	One simple model to describe hadrons is the Constituent Quark Model ( CQM ) , which knows two types of hadrons : mesons , consisting of a quark and an antiquark , and baryons , which are made out of three quarks .	Since Quantum Choromdynamics allows for gluon self-coupling , quarks and gluons can not be observed as free particles , but only their bound states , the hadrons .	This so-called confinement phenomenon is responsible for $ 98\ % $ of the mass in the visible universe .	The measurement of the hadron excitation spectra therefore gives valuable input for theory and phenomenology to quantitatively understand this phenomenon .	More advanced models , which are inspired by QCD as well as calculations within Lattice QCD predict the existence of other types of hadrons , which may be e.g.described solely by gluonic excitations ( glueballs ) or mixed quark and gluon excitations ( hybrids ) .
4	The irreducible components of this TQFT , corresponding to simple representations of $ SL ( 2 , \Z ) $ and $ Sp ( 2g , \Z ) $ , thus yield a large family of homological TQFT 's by taking sums and products .	We develop an explicit skein theoretical algorithm to compute the Alexander polynomial of a 3-manifold from a surgery presentation employing the methods used in the construction of quantum invariants of 3-manifolds .	As a prerequisite we establish and prove a rather unexpected equivalence between the topological quantum field theory constructed by Frohman and Nicas using the intersection homology of U ( 1 ) -representation varieties on the one side and the combinatorially constructed Hennings-TQFT based on the quasitriangular Hopf algebra $ { \cal N } =\Z/2\ltimes \ext *\R^2 $ on the other side .	We find that both TQFT 's are $ SL ( 2 , \R ) $ -equivariant functors and also as such isomorphic .	The $ SL ( 2 , \R ) $ -action in the Hennings construction comes from the natural action on $ \cal N $ and in the case of the Frohman-Nicas theory from the Hard-Lefschetz decomposition of the U ( 1 ) -moduli spaces given that they are naturally K\ '' ahler .
2	However , when common randomness independent of the input is available , the necessary description rate reduces to Shannon 's mutual information .	Two familiar notions of correlation are rediscovered as the extreme operating points for distributed synthesis of a discrete memoryless channel , in which a stochastic channel output is generated based on a compressed description of the channel input .	Wyner 's common information is the minimum description rate needed .	This work characterizes the optimal trade-off between the amount of common randomness used and the required rate of description .	We also include a number of related derivations , including the effect of limited local randomness , rate requirements for secrecy , applications to game theory , and new insights into common information duality .
4	The no-mixing point ( 0,0 ) has a confidence level of 3.9 % .	We report the results of a search for D0-D0bar mixing in D0 - & gt ; K+ pi- decays based on 400 fb^ { -1 } of data accumulated by the Belle detector at KEKB .	Both assuming CP conservation and allowing for CP violation , we fit the decay-time distribution for the mixing parameters x ' and y ' , as well as for the parameter R_D , the ratio of doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed decays to Cabibbo-favored decays .	The 95 % confidence level region in the ( x'^2 , y ' ) plane is obtained using a frequentist method .	Assuming CP conservation , we find x'^2 & lt ; 0.72 x 10^ { -3 } and -9.9 x 10^ { -3 } & lt ; y ' & lt ; 6.8 x 10^ { -3 } at the 95 % confidence level ; these are the most stringent constraints on the mixing parameters to date .
3	The magnetization easy axis is observed to lie in the plane of the film while the magnetic hard axis is found to be along the normal to this .	SSMO5347 thin films ( thicknesses ~200 nm ) were deposited by on-axis dc magnetron sputtering on the single crystal LSAT ( 001 ) substrates .	These films are oriented along the out of plane c-direction .	The ferromagnetic and insulator-metal transition occurs at 96 K and 91 K , respectively .	The magnetotransport of the SSMO films , which was measured as a function of angle ( theta ) between the magnetic field ( H ) and plane of the film , shows colossal anisotropy .
2	A total of 56 bona-fide Cepheids were discovered , with periods ranging from 5 to ~50 days ; five of these are likely Population II Cepheids of the W Virginis class , associated with the bulge or halo of NGC 5128 .	We discuss a new distance to NGC 5128 ( Centaurus A ) based on Cepheid variables observed with the Hubble Space Telescope .	Twelve F555W ( V ) and six F814W ( I ) epochs of cosmic-ray-split Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations were obtained .	Based on the period and V and I-band luminosities of a sub-sample of 42 classical ( Pop I ) Cepheids , and adopting a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus and extinction of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and E ( B-V ) =0.10 mag , respectively , the true reddening-corrected distance modulus to NGC 5128 is mu_0 = 27.67 +/- 0.12 ( random ) +/- 0.16 ( systematic ) mag , corresponding to a distance of 3.42 +/- 0.18 ( random ) +/- 0.25 ( systematic ) Mpc .	The random uncertainty in the distance is dominated by the error on the assumed value for the ratio of total to selective absorption , R_V , in NGC 5128 , and by the possible metallicity dependence of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation at V and I .
1	This is carried out on a $ 16^3 \times 24 $ quenched lattice with Wilson fermion .	We extend the study of lowest moments , $ & lt ; x & gt ; $ and $ & lt ; x^2 & gt ; $ , of the parton distribution function of the nucleon to include those of the sea quarks ; this entails a disconnected insertion calculation in lattice QCD .	The quark loops are calculated with $ Z_2 $ noise vectors and unbiased subtractions , and multiple nucleon sources are employed to reduce the statistical errors .	We obtain 5 $ \sigma $ signals for $ & lt ; x & gt ; $ for the $ u , d , $ and $ s $ quarks , but $ & lt ; x^2 & gt ; $ is consistent with zero within errors .	We provide results for both the connected and disconnected insertions .
3	The data show that magnetic flux density contains a significant amount of intrinsically weak fields that contribute little to brightness .	In addition to the `facular ' brightening of active regions , the quiet Sun also contains a small scale magnetic field with associated brightenings in continuum radiation .	We measure this contribution of quiet regions to the Sun 's brightness from high spatial resolution ( 0 '' 16-0 '' 32 ) observations of the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope ( SST ) and Hinode satellite .	The line-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity near \ion { Fe } { i } 6302.5 \AA\ are used to quantify the correlation between field strength and brightness .	We show that with data of high spatial resolution a calibration of magnetic flux density as a proxy for brightness excess is possible .
2	This identification allows us to formulate a direct mapping between a given subgroup embedding , and the sorts of GSO constraints that are necessary in order to realize the embedding in string theory .	We consider the methods by which higher-level and non-simply laced gauge symmetries can be realized in free-field heterotic string theory .	We show that all such realizations have a common underlying feature , namely a dimensional truncation of the charge lattice , and we identify such dimensional truncations with certain irregular embeddings of higher-level and non-simply laced gauge groups within level-one simply-laced gauge groups .	This also allows us to determine a number of useful constraints that generally affect string GUT model-building .	For example , most string GUT realizations of higher-level gauge symmetries G_k employ the so-called diagonal embeddings G_k\subset G\times G \times ... \times G. We find that there exist interesting alternative embeddings by which such groups can be realized at higher levels , and we derive a complete list of all possibilities for the GUT groups SU ( 5 ) , SU ( 6 ) , SO ( 10 ) , and E_6 at levels k=2,3,4 ( and in some cases up to k=7 ) .
4	If the information on the details of the motion of a stochastic classical system is disregarded , the stationary state of the whole quantum subsystem is found to be a complete mixture in the studied cases , though the transients depend on the properties of the classical motion .	We investigate dynamics of semi-quantal spin systems in which quantum bits are attached to classically and possibly stochastically moving classical particles .	The interaction between the quantum bits takes place when the respective classical particles get close to each other in space .	We find that with Heisenberg XX couplings quantum homogenization takes place after a time long enough , regardless of the details of the underlying classical dynamics .	This is accompanied by the development of a stationary bipartite entanglement .
1	We consider graphs with double-hierarchical connectivity and variable wiring diagram in the universality class of the world-wide Web .	We introduce and simulate the random walk that adapts move strategies according to local node preferences on a directed graph .	The ensemble of walkers reveals the structure of local subgraphs with dominant promoters and attractors of links .	The average access time decays with the distance in hierarchy $ \Delta q $ as a power $ & lt ; t_ { aw } & gt ; \sim ( \Delta q ) ^ { -\theta } $ .	The access to highly connected nodes is orders of magnitude shorter compared to the standard random walk , suggesting the adaptive walk as an efficient message-passing algorithm on this class of graphs .
3	We use results of this sort to show on the Riemann hypothesis that the averages $ $ \frac { 1 } { T } \int_T^ { 2T } \Bigg| \frac { \zeta\Big ( \frac { 1 } { 2 } + \frac { \alpha } { \log T } + it\Big ) } { \zeta\Big ( \frac { 1 } { 2 } + \frac { \beta } { \log T } + it\Big ) } \Bigg|^m\ , dt $ $ remain bounded as $ T\rightarrow\infty $ , for $ \alpha , \beta $ complex numbers with $ \beta\neq 0 $ .	Let $ t $ be random and uniformly distributed in the interval $ [ T,2T ] $ , and consider the quantity $ N ( t+1/\log T ) - N ( t ) $ , a count of zeros of the Riemann zeta function in a box of height $ 1/\log T $ .	Conditioned on the Riemann hypothesis , we show that the probability this count is greater than $ x $ decays at least as quickly as $ e^ { -Cx\log x } $ , uniformly in $ T $ .	We also prove a similar results for the logarithmic derivative of the zeta function , and likewise analogous results for the eigenvalues of a random unitary matrix .	Moreover we show rigorously that the local distribution of zeros asymptotically controls ratio averages like the above ; that is , the GUE Conjecture implies a ( first-order ) ratio conjecture .
2	Extensive wetting experiments with various chemical species and optical measurements were performed in order to assess the bi-functionality .	Two separated levels of functionality are identified in the nanostructure which covers the wings of the grey cicada $ \textit { Cicada orni } $ ( Hemiptera ) .	The upper level is responsible for superhydrophobic character of the wing while the lower level enhances its anti-reflective behavior .	Scanning electron microscopy imaging was used to identify the nanostructure morphology .	Numerical optical simulations and analytical wetting models were used to prove the roles of both levels of the nanostructure .
4	We then highlight different ways to build merger histories from AdaptaHOP haloes and subhaloes , contrasting their various advantages and drawbacks .	Although a fair amount of work has been devoted to growing Monte-Carlo merger trees which resemble those built from an N-body simulation , comparatively little effort has been invested in quantifying the caveats one necessarily encounters when one extracts trees directly from such a simulation .	To somewhat revert the tide , this paper seeks to provide its reader with a comprehensive study of the problems one faces when following this route .	The first step to building merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to identify these structures in each of the time outputs ( snapshots ) produced by the simulation .	Even though we discuss a particular implementation of such an algorithm ( called AdaptaHOP ) in this paper , we believe that our results do not depend on the exact details of the implementation but extend to most if not all ( sub ) structure finders .
4	We tabulate the resulting EOS at over 73,000 grid points in the temperature range $ T $ = 0.158 to 15.8 MeV , the density range $ n_B $ = 10 $ ^ { -8 } $ to 0.1 fm $ ^ { -3 } $ , and the proton fraction range $ Y_P $ = 0.05 to 0.56 .	We study the equation of state ( EOS ) of nuclear matter at subnuclear density in a Virial expansion for a nonideal gas .	The gas consists of neutrons , protons , alpha particles , and 8980 species of nuclei with $ A \ge 12 $ and masses from the finite-range droplet model ( FRDM ) .	At very low density , the Virial expansion reduces to nuclear statistical equilibrium .	At higher density , the Virial results match smoothly to the relativistic mean field results discussed in our previous paper .
0	In the framework of the `` Groupe de Recherches de G\'eod\'esie Spatiale '' ( GRGS ) , a rigorous combination of the data from five space geodetic techniques ( VLBI , GPS , SLR , LLR and DORIS ) is routinely applied to simultaneously determine a Terrestrial Reference Frame ( TRF ) and Earth Orientation Parameters ( EOP ) .	This analysis is conducted with the software package GINS which has the capability to process data from all five techniques together .	Such a combination at the observation level should ultimately facilitate fine geophysical studies of the global Earth system .	In this project , Bordeaux Observatory is in charge of the VLBI data analysis , while satellite geodetic data are processed by other groups .	In this paper , we present ( i ) details about the VLBI analysis undertaken with GINS , and ( ii ) the results obtained for the EOP during the period 2005-2006 .
4	We also calculate the edge-current for a finite sample .	We obtain expressions for the current operator in the lowest Landau level ( L.L.L . )	field theory , where higher Landau level mixing due to various external and interparticle interactions is sytematically taken into account .	We consider the current operators in the presence of electromagnetic interactions , both Coulomb and time-dependent , as well as local four-fermi interactions .	The importance of Landau level mixing for long-range interactions is especially emphasized .
1	Interband transitions occur when dipolar relaxation releases an energy which matches or overcomes the lattice band gap .	We observe interband transitions mediated by the dipole-dipole interaction for an array of 1D quantum gases of chromium atoms , trapped in a 2D optical lattice .	We analyze the role of tunneling in higher lattice bands on this process .	We compare the experimental dipolar relaxation rate with a calculation based on a multiple Fermi Golden Rule approach , when the lattice sites are symmetric , and the magnetic field is parallel to the lattice axis .	We also show that an almost complete suppression of dipolar relaxation is obtained below a magnetic field threshold set by the depth of the lattice : 1D quantum gases in an excited Zeeman state then become metastable .
3	In particular , we investigate the role of chain stiffness on the free energy profile and folding routes .	A microscopic theory of the free energy barriers and folding routes for minimally frustrated proteins is presented , greatly expanding on the presentation of the variational approach outlined previously [ J. J. Portman , S. Takada , P. G. Wolynes , Phys.Rev.Lett .	{ \bf 81 } , 5237 ( 1998 ) ] .	We choose the $ \lambda $ -repressor protein as an illustrative example and focus on how the polymer chain statistics influence free energy profiles and partially ordered ensembles of structures .	We evaluate the applicability of simpler approximations in which the conformations of the protein molecule along the folding route are restricted to have residues that are either entirely folded or unfolded in contiguous stretches .
0	We inspect the initial and the long time evolution of excitations a Fermi liquids by analyzing the time behavior of the electron spectral function .	Focusing on the short-time limit we study the electron-boson model for the homogenous electron gas and apply the first order ( in boson propagator ) cumulant expansion of the electron Green 's function .	In addition to a quadratic decay in time upon triggering the excitation , we identify non-analytic terms in the time expansion similar to those found in the Fermi edge singularity phenomenon .	We also demonstrate that the exponential decay in time in the long-time limit is inconsistent with the GW approximation for the self-energy .	The background for this is the Paley-Wiener theorem of complex analysis .
4	We apply our MN annotation scheme to statistical machine translation using a syntactic framework that supports the inclusion of semantic annotations .	This paper describes the resource- and system-building efforts of an eight-week Johns Hopkins University Human Language Technology Center of Excellence Summer Camp for Applied Language Exploration ( SCALE-2009 ) on Semantically-Informed Machine Translation ( SIMT ) .	We describe a new modality/negation ( MN ) annotation scheme , the creation of a ( publicly available ) MN lexicon , and two automated MN taggers that we built using the annotation scheme and lexicon .	Our annotation scheme isolates three components of modality and negation : a trigger ( a word that conveys modality or negation ) , a target ( an action associated with modality or negation ) and a holder ( an experiencer of modality ) .	We describe how our MN lexicon was semi-automatically produced and we demonstrate that a structure-based MN tagger results in precision around 86 % ( depending on genre ) for tagging of a standard LDC data set .
1	Electrical resistivity measurements reveal metallic behavior and a resistive transition to the superconducting state at a critical temperature T_c ~ 6.6 K. Magnetization measurements also show the onset of superconductivity near 6 K. In contrast , specific heat measurements manifest no discontinuity at T_c .	Single crystals of the compound LaFePO were prepared using a flux growth technique at high temperatures .	These results lend support to the conclusion that the superconductivity is associated with oxygen vacancies that alter the carrier concentration in a small fraction of the sample , although superconductivity characterized by an unusually small gap value can not be ruled-out .	Under applied magnetic fields , T_c is suppressed anisotropically for fields perpendicular and parallel to the ab-plane , suggesting that the crystalline anisotropy strongly influences the superconducting state .	Preliminary high-pressure measurements show that T_c passes through a maximum of nearly 14 K at ~ 110 kbar , demonstrating that significantly higher T_c values may be achieved in the phosphorus-based oxypnictides .
0	Crystal and magnetic structures of the $ x=0.2 $ member of La $ _ { \rm 0.8-x } $ Tb $ _ { \rm x } $ Ca $ _ { 0.2 } $ CoO $ _3 $ perovskite series have been determined from the powder neutron diffraction .	Enhancement of the diffraction peaks due to ferromagnetic or cluster glass ordering is observed below $ T_C=55 $ K. The moments evolve at first on Co sites , and ordering of Ising-type Tb $ ^ { 3+ } $ moments is induced at lower temperatures by a molecular field due to Co ions .	The final magnetic configuration is collinear F $ _x $ for cobalt subsystem , while it is canted F $ _x $ C $ _y $ for terbium ions .	The rare-earth moments align along local Ising axes within \textit { ab } -plane of the orthorhombic $ Pbnm $ structure .	The behavior in external fields up to $ 70-90 $ kOe has been probed by the magnetization and heat capacity measurements .
4	A TON resilience can be measured in terms of either external workloads or intrinsic node fault rates that cause the TON to partially or fully choke .	Abundant examples of complex transaction-oriented networks ( TONs ) can be found in a variety of disciplines , including information and communication technology , finances , commodity trading , and real estate .	A transaction in a TON is executed as a sequence of subtransactions associated with the network nodes , and is committed if every subtransaction is committed .	A subtransaction incurs a two-fold overhead on the host node : the fixed transient operational cost and the cost of long-term management ( e.g.archiving and support ) that potentially grows exponentially with the transaction length .	If the overall cost exceeds the node capacity , the node fails and all subtransaction incident to the node , and their parent distributed transactions , are aborted .
3	We apply the scheme to the phase transition in the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain .	We adapt White 's density matrix renormalisation group ( DMRG ) to the direct study of critical phenomena .	We use the DMRG to generate transformations in the space of coupling constants .	We postulate that a study of density matrix eigenvalues leads to a natural identification of renormalised blocks , operators and Hamiltonians .	In the simplest case where the two most probable states in odd sized blocks are used to construct approximate renormalisation group transformations , we find qualitative improvement upon the standard real space renormalisation group method for the thermal exponent $ \nu $ .
1	These give rise to number fields of degree n , signature ( r , s ) , Galois group S_n , and squarefree discriminant ; we may also force the discriminant to be coprime to any given integer .	For any integer n & gt ; = 2 and any nonnegative integers r , s with r+2s = n , we give an unconditional construction of infinitely many monic irreducible polynomials of degree n with integer coefficients having squarefree discriminant and exactly r real roots .	The number of fields produced with discriminant in the range [ -N , N ] is at least c N^ ( 1/ ( n-1 ) ) .	A corollary is that for each n \geq 3 , infinitely many quadratic number fields admit everywhere unramified degree n extensions whose normal closures have Galois group A_n .	This generalizes results of Yamamura , who treats the case n = 5 , and Uchida and Yamamoto , who allow general n but do not control the real place .
4	We also show that $ \mu_c & lt ; 1 $ for any sleeping rate in any graph in which simple random walk has positive speed .	We consider the activated random walk model on general vertex-transitive graphs .	A central question for this model is whether the critical density $ \mu_c $ for sustained activity is strictly between $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ .	It was known that $ \mu_c & gt ; 0 $ on $ \mathbb { Z } ^d $ , $ d \geq 1 $ , and that $ \mu_c & lt ; 1 $ on $ \mathbb { Z } $ for small enough sleeping rate .	We show that $ \mu_c \to 0 $ as $ \lambda \to 0 $ in all transient graphs , implying that $ \mu_c & lt ; 1 $ for small enough sleeping rate .
2	Because the Second Harmonic Generation ( SHG ) and the Sum-Frequency Generation vibrational Spectroscopy ( SFG-VS ) have been proven as the sensitive probes for interfaces with the submonolayer coverage , the treatment based on the more realistic discrete induced dipole model needs to be developed .	In the currently accepted models of the nonlinear optics , the nonlinear radiation was treated as the result of an infinitesimally thin polarization sheet layer , and a three layer model was generally employed .	The direct consequence of this approach is that an apriori dielectric constant , which still does not have a clear definition , has to be assigned to this polarization layer .	Here we show that following the molecular optics theory approach the SHG , as well as the SFG-VS , radiation from the monolayer or submonolayer at an interface can be rigorously treated as the radiation from an induced dipole lattice at the interface .	In this approach , the introduction of the polarization sheet is no longer necessary .
3	The photo-z error behaviour was analysed to select cleaner subsamples with more secure photo-z estimates .	Aims .	We analyse the relative performance of different photo-z codes in blind applications to ground-based data.Methods .	We tested the codes on imaging datasets with different depths and filter coverages and compared the results to large spectroscopic catalogues .	We consider Hyperz , BPZ , and the code used in the CADIS , COMBO-17 , and HIROCS surveys.Results .
1	A numerical estimation of omega from the susceptibility data within 40 = & lt ; L = & lt ; 2048 yields omega=0.25 ( 33 ) .	Corrections to scaling in the 3D Ising model are studied based on non-perturbative analytical arguments and Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulation data for different lattice sizes L. Analytical arguments show the existence of corrections with the exponent ( gamma-1 ) /nu ( approximately 0.38 ) , the leading correction-to-scaling exponent being omega = & lt ; ( gamma-1 ) /nu .	It is consistent with the statement omega = & lt ; ( gamma-1 ) /nu , as well as with the value omega = 1/8 of the GFD theory .	We reconsider the MC estimation of omega from smaller lattice sizes to show that it does not lead to conclusive results , since the obtained values of omega depend on the particular method chosen .	In particular , estimates ranging from omega =1.274 ( 72 ) to omega=0.18 ( 37 ) are obtained by four different finite-size scaling methods , using MC data for thermodynamic average quantities , as well as for partition function zeros .
0	It appears that most stars are born in clusters , and that at birth most stars have circumstellar discs which are comparable in size to the separations between the stars .	Interactions between neighbouring stars and discs are therefore likely to play a key role in determining disc lifetimes , stellar masses , and the separations and eccentricities of binary orbits .	Such interactions may also cause fragmentation of the discs , thereby triggering the formation of additional stars .	We have carried out a series of simulations of disc-star interactions using an SPH code which treats self-gravity , hydrodynamic and viscous forces .	We find that interactions between discs and stars provide a mechanism for removing energy from , or adding energy to , the orbits of the stars , and for truncating the discs .
3	2012 where the EBL was reconstructed from luminosity functions out to 4.5mic and was shown to recover observed galaxy counts to high accuracy .	We reconstruct \gamma-ray opacity of the Universe out to z & lt ; 3-4 using an extensive library of 342 observed galaxy luminosity function surveys extending to high redshifts .	We cover the whole range from UV to mid-IR ( 0.15-25mic ) providing for the first time a robust empirical calculation of the \gamma\gamma-optical depth out to several TeV .	Here , we use the same database as Helgason et al .	We extend our earlier library of LFs to 25mic such that it covers the energy range of pair production with \gamma-rays 1 ) in the entire Fermi/LAT energy range , and 2 ) at higher TeV energies probed by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes .
3	Here we give a further step by addressing the effect of diffusion in two simple lattice models originally presenting discontinuous absorbing transitions .	Discontinuous transitions into absorbing states require an effective mechanism that prevents the stabilization of low density states .	They can be found in different systems , such as lattice models or stochastic differential equations ( e.g.Langevin equations ) .	Recent results for the latter approach have shown that the inclusion of limited diffusion suppresses discontinuous transitions , whereas they are maintained for larger diffusion strengths .	They have been studied via mean-field theory ( MFT ) and distinct sort of numerical simulations .
1	It offers high steganographic bandwidth , retains good voice quality and is generally harder to detect than other existing VoIP steganographic methods .	TranSteg ( Trancoding Steganography ) is a fairly new IP telephony steganographic method that functions by compressing overt ( voice ) data to make space for the steganogram by means of transcoding .	In TranSteg , after the steganogram reaches the receiver , the hidden information is extracted and the speech data is practically restored to what was originally sent .	This is a huge advantage compared with other existing VoIP steganographic methods , where the hidden data can be extracted and removed but the original data can not be restored because it was previously erased due to a hidden data insertion process .	In this paper we address the issue of steganalysis of TranSteg .
1	In particular , we investigate a system of two solitons with level n and n ' ( the ( n , n ' ) -system ) in the large noncommutativity limit .	We study scattering of noncommutative solitons in 2+1 dimensional scalar field theory .	We show that the scattering of a general ( n , n ' ) -system occurs at right angles in the case of zero impact parameter .	We also derive an exact Kahler potential and the metric of the moduli space of the ( n,1 ) -system .	We examine numerically the ( n,1 ) scattering and find that the closest distance for a fixed scattering angle is well approximated by a function a+b*sqrt { n } where a and b are some numerical constants .
3	The estimated redshift distribution of the cluster candidates is consistent with a constant comoving density over the range 0.2 & lt ; = z_est & lt ; = 0.8 .	We have conducted an automated search for galaxy clusters within a contiguous 16 square degree I-band survey in the north Galactic hemisphere .	A matched filter detection algorithm identifies 444 cluster candidates in the range 0.2 & lt ; = z & lt ; = 1.2 .	The full catalog is presented along with the results from a follow-up spectroscopic survey .	A decline in the cluster space density by more than a factor of 3 over this redshift range is rejected at & gt ; 99.9 % confidence level .
2	FPGAs , as programmable logic devices able to support different types of fine-grained parallelisms , their power and performance advantages were recognized widely .	Today , there is a trend to incorporate more intelligence ( e.g. , vision capabilities ) into a wide range of devices , which makes high performance a necessity for computing systems .	Furthermore , for embedded systems , low power consumption should be generally considered together with high computing performance .	However , designing applications on FPGA-based systems is traditionally far from a task can be carried out by software programmers .	Generally , hardware engineers and even system-level software engineers have more hardware/architectural knowledge but fewer algorithm and application knowledge .
3	Our formulation does not require a matrix factorization , as previous methods do , but instead looks for projections of the natural parameters from the saturated model .	Principal component analysis ( PCA ) for binary data , known as logistic PCA , has become a popular alternative to dimensionality reduction of binary data .	It is motivated as an extension of ordinary PCA by means of a matrix factorization , akin to the singular value decomposition , that maximizes the Bernoulli log-likelihood .	We propose a new formulation of logistic PCA which extends Pearson 's formulation of a low dimensional data representation with minimum error to binary data .	Due to this difference , the number of parameters does not grow with the number of observations and the principal component scores on new data can be computed with simple matrix multiplication .
1	The main focus is the sufficient and necessary conditions on the number of measurements for support recovery to be reliable .	We consider the problem of exact support recovery of sparse signals via noisy measurements .	By drawing an analogy between the problem of support recovery and the problem of channel coding over the Gaussian multiple access channel , and exploiting mathematical tools developed for the latter problem , we obtain an information theoretic framework for analyzing the performance limits of support recovery .	Sharp sufficient and necessary conditions on the number of measurements in terms of the signal sparsity level and the measurement noise level are derived .	Specifically , when the number of nonzero entries is held fixed , the exact asymptotics on the number of measurements for support recovery is developed .
3	However , three mechanisms for flux error suppression have been identified and calculated in the context of Double Chooz , Daya Bay and RENO sites .	This publication provides a coherent treatment for the reactor neutrino flux uncertainties suppression , specially focussed on the latest $ \theta_ { 13 } $ measurement .	The treatment starts with single detector in single reactor site , most relevant for all reactor experiments beyond $ \theta_ { 13 } $ .	We demonstrate there is no trivial error cancellation , thus the flux systematic error can remain dominant even after the adoption of multi-detector configurations .	Our analysis computes the error { \it suppression fraction } using simplified scenarios to maximise relative comparison among experiments .
4	From numerical solutions of a decaying kinetic Alfv\'en wave turbulence model , structure morphology reveals two types of localized structures , filaments and sheets , and shows that they arise in different regimes of resistive and diffusive damping .	The forms of electron density structures in kinetic Alfven wave turbulence are studied in connection with scintillation .	The focus is on small scales $ L \sim 10^8-10^ { 10 } $ cm where the Kinetic Alfv\'en wave ( KAW ) regime is active in the interstellar medium .	MHD turbulence converts to a KAW cascade , starting at 10 times the ion gyroradius and continuing to smaller scales .	These scales are inferred to dominate scintillation in the theory of Boldyrev et al .
4	The macroscopic dispersion relations are of higher order than those for the classical Weibel instability .	The Weibel instability in the quantum plasma case is treated by means of a fluid-like ( moments ) approach .	Quantum modifications to the macroscopic equations are then identified as effects of first or second kind .	Quantum effects of the first kind correspond to a dispersive term , similar to the Bohm potential in the quantum hydrodynamic equations for plasmas .	Effects of the second kind are due to the Fermi statistics of the charge carriers and can become the dominant influence for strong degeneracy .
2	At the prolate minimum , alignment of the low-K states causes the observed first backbending in moment of inertia and we predict a second backbending that has not yet been reported .	The structure of collective states and quasi-particle excitations in $ ^ { 68 } $ Se is analyzed by using the projected shell model .	It is found that the $ g_ { 9/2 } $ orbitals play a decisive role for the structure of this nucleus .	At the oblate minimum , quasi-particles having high-K can form long-lived isomeric states .	The structure of $ ^ { 68 } $ Se is discussed with respect to the isomers and their possible impact on the determination of its nuclear mass .
2	We herein show that local observation is useful to define the phase of such a system in association with the well-defined phase of the system on the Bethe lattice , that is , an infinite regular tree without boundary .	We study bond percolation of the Cayley tree ( CT ) by focusing on the probability distribution function ( PDF ) of a local variable , namely , the size of the cluster including a selected vertex .	Because the CT does not have a dominant bulk region , which is free from the boundary effect , even in the large-size limit , the phase of the system on it is not well defined .	Above the percolation threshold , the PDFs of the vertex at the center of the CT ( the origin ) and of the vertices near the boundary of the CT ( the leaves ) have different forms , which are also dissimilar to the PDF observed in the ordinary percolating phase of a Euclidean lattice .	The PDF for the origin of the CT is bimodal : a decaying exponential function and a system-size-dependent asymmetric peak , which obeys a finite-size-scaling law with a fractal exponent .
0	Edwards curves are a particular form of elliptic curves that admit a fast , unified and complete addition law .	Relations between Edwards curves and Montgomery curves have already been described .	Our work takes the view of parameterizing elliptic curves given by their j-invariant , a problematic that arises from using curves with complex multiplication , for instance .	We add to the catalogue the links with Kubert parameterizations of X0 ( 2 ) and X0 ( 4 ) .	We classify CM curves that admit an Edwards or Montgomery form over a finite field , and justify the use of isogenous curves when needed .
4	Some of the orders we define on F_k are extensions of the usual lexicographic order on the positive monoid and some have word reversible positive cones .	For every finite rank k , k & gt ; 1 , we explicitly construct ( 2k ) !	left orders on the free group F_k of rank k. Each order is induced by a word of length 2k in which each generator of F_k and its inverse appear exactly once .	For each of these ( 2k ) !	words we define a real valued function on F_k , which is shown to be a quasi-character with small relative defect and which is used as a weight function to define the corresponding order ( the elements of F_k which evaluate to positive real numbers are declared positive in the group ) .
4	This re-assessment reveals that for the brightest planet-host stars , an astrophysical bias exists that contaminates the stellar sample with evolved stars : nearly 50 % of the bright planet-host stars are subgiants .	Most extrasolar planets have been detected by their influence on their parent star , typically either gravitationally ( the Doppler method ) or by the small dip in brightness as the planet blocks a portion of the star ( the transit method ) .	Therefore , the accuracy with which we know the masses and radii of extrasolar planets depends directly on how well we know those of the stars , the latter usually determined from the measured stellar surface gravity , logg .	Recent work has demonstrated that the short-timescale brightness variations ( `` flicker '' ) of stars can be used to measure logg to a high accuracy of ~0.1-0.2 dex ( Bastien et al.2013 ) .	Here , we use flicker measurements of 289 bright ( Kepmag & lt ; 13 ) candidate planet-hosting stars with Teff=4500-6650 K to re-assess the stellar parameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties .
0	Result diversification is an important aspect in web-based search , document summarization , facility location , portfolio management and other applications .	Given a set of ranked results for a set of objects ( e.g.web documents , facilities , etc . )	with a distance between any pair , the goal is to select a subset $ S $ satisfying the following three criteria : ( a ) the subset $ S $ satisfies some constraint ( e.g.bounded cardinality ) ; ( b ) the subset contains results of high `` quality '' ; and ( c ) the subset contains results that are `` diverse '' relative to the distance measure .	The goal of result diversification is to produce a diversified subset while maintaining high quality as much as possible .	We study a broad class of problems where the distances are a metric , where the constraint is given by independence in a matroid , where quality is determined by a monotone submodular function , and diversity is defined as the sum of distances between objects in $ S $ .
1	Newtonian extrudate swell arises when viscous liquids exit long die slits .	Spectral/hp element methods and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian ( ALE ) moving-boundary technique are used to investigate planar Newtonian extrudate swell .	The problem is characterised by a stress singularity at the end of the slit which is inherently difficult to capture and strongly influences the predicted swelling of the fluid .	The impact of inertia ( 0 & lt ; Re & lt ; 100 ) and slip along the die wall on the free surface profile and the velocity and pressure values in the domain and around the singularity are investigated .	The high order method is shown to provide high resolution of the steep pressure profile at the singularity .
2	However , the geomagnetic cutoff in the cosmic ray electron-plus-positron ( CRE ) spectrum in low earth orbit does provide such a spectral feature .	The Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) on-board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is a pair-conversion telescope designed to survey the gamma-ray sky from 20 MeV to several hundreds of GeV .	In this energy band there are no astronomical sources with sufficiently well known and sharp spectral features to allow an absolute calibration of the LAT energy scale .	The energy and spectral shape of this cutoff can be calculated with the aid of a numerical code tracing charged particles in the Earth 's magnetic field .	By comparing the cutoff value with that measured by the LAT in different geomagnetic positions , we have obtained several calibration points between ~6 and ~13 GeV with an estimated uncertainty of ~2 % .
4	Thus the result from the JAM hadronic transport model with nuclear mean-field approach is incompatible with the data .	We investigate the effects of nuclear mean-field as well as the formation and decay of nuclear clusters on the directed flow $ v_1 $ in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions from $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } =7.7 $ GeV to 27 GeV incident energies within a transport model .	Specifically , we use the JAM transport model in which potentials are implemented based on the framework of the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics .	Our approach reproduces the rapidity dependence of directed flow data up to $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } \approx 8 $ GeV showing the significant importance of mean-field .	However , the slopes of $ dv_1/dy $ at mid-rapidity are calculated to be positive at $ \sqrt { s_ { NN } } =11.7 $ and 19.6 GeV , and becomes negative above 27 GeV .
2	The algorithm is a lazy posterior sampling method that maintains a distribution over the unknown parameter .	We study Bayesian optimal control of a general class of smoothly parameterized Markov decision problems .	Since computing the optimal control is computationally expensive , we design an algorithm that trades off performance for computational efficiency .	The algorithm changes its policy only when the variance of the distribution is reduced sufficiently .	Importantly , we analyze the algorithm and show the precise nature of the performance vs. computation tradeoff .
4	The data at quark masses heavier than $ m_s^ { \rm phys } /2 $ are fitted including a part of next-to-next-to-leading order terms .	We present a two-flavor QCD calculation of $ B_K $ on a $ 16^3 \times 32 $ lattice at $ a\sim 0.12 $ fm ( or equivalently $ a^ { -1 } \sim $ 1.67 GeV ) .	Both valence and sea quarks are described by the overlap fermion formulation .	The matching factor is calculated non-perturbatively with the so-called RI/MOM scheme .	We find that the lattice data are well described by the next-to-leading order ( NLO ) partially quenched chiral perturbation theory ( PQChPT ) up to around a half of the strange quark mass ( $ m_s^ { \rm phys } /2 $ ) .
2	Tunneling between the two edges of the line junction then leads to a microscopic understanding of a phenomenological description of line junctions introduced some time ago .	We present a microscopic model for a line junction formed by counter or co-propagating single mode quantum Hall edges corresponding to different filling factors .	The ends of the line junction can be described by two possible current splitting matrices which are dictated by the conditions of both lack of dissipation and the existence of a linear relation between the bosonic fields .	The effect of density-density interactions between the two edges is considered , and renormalization group ideas are used to study how the tunneling parameter changes with the length scale .	This leads to a power law variation of the conductance of the line junction with the temperature .
2	We argue that the internal part of this shock plane contains the `` black '' disk of radius R ( E ) ~ E^ { 1/2 } filled by such hard partons with the Planck density .	We propose a parton model of inelastic collisions at transplanckian energies E & gt ; & gt ; G^ { -1/2 } , using the gravitons , whose transverse momenta are cut at the Planck scale , as partons .	For this purpose we represent the gravitational shock-wave accompanying the fast particle in terms of such partons and take into account the higher order multiperipheral-like contributions .	When two fast particles collide the hard graviton production comes from the region of intersection of their black disks .	The corresponding value of inclusive cross-section at the given rapidity and the impact parameter is proportional to the area of this region .
2	In the context of the seesaw mechanism this leads to three light and three heavy neutrinos .	The observation of neutrino masses leads to the possibility of leptonic mixing and CP violation .	One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model giving rise to neutrino masses consists of the introduction of one righthanded neutrino field per generation , singlet of SU ( 2 ) .	The charged current interactions couple the charged leptons to both the light and the heavy physical neutrinos and leptonic CP violation may occur at low energies as well as at high energies giving rise to the possibility of leptogenesis .	There are special scenarios where it is possible to establish a connection between CP violation at the two different scales , an interesting example is included in this work .
0	We explore the continuum limit $ a\rightarrow 0 $ of meson correlation functions at finite temperature .	In detail we analyze finite volume and lattice cut-off effects in view of possible consequences for continuum physics .	We perform calculations on quenched gauge configurations using the clover improved Wilson fermion action .	We present and discuss simulations on isotropic $ N_\sigma^3\times 16 $ lattices with $ N_\sigma=32,48,64,128 $ and $ 128^3 \times N_\tau $ lattices with $ N_\tau=16,24,32,48 $ corresponding to lattice spacings in the range of $ 0.01 fm \lsim a \lsim\ 0.031 fm $ at $ T\simeq1.45T_c $ .	Continuum limit extrapolations of vector meson and pseudo scalar correlators are performed and their large distance expansion in terms of thermal moments is introduced .
3	Such collective motion is supported by the separation of time scale , given by the self-consistent relationship between the collective motion and chaotic dynamics of each element .	Collective behavior is studied in globally coupled maps .	Several coherent motions exist , even in fully desynchronized state .	To characterize the collective behavior , we introduce scaling transformation of parameter , and detect the tongue-like structure of collective motions in parameter space .	It is shown that the change of collective motion is related with the window structure of a single one-dimensional map .
0	Besides their astrophysical interest , compact stars also provide an arena for understanding the properties of theories of gravity that differ from Einstein 's general relativity .	Numerous studies have shown that different modified theories of gravity can modify the bulk properties ( such as mass and radius ) of neutron stars for given assumptions on the microphysics .	What is not usually stressed though is the strong degeneracy in the predictions of these theories for the stellar mass and radius .	Motivated by this observation , in this paper we take an alternative route and construct a stellar structure formalism which , without adhering to any particular theory of gravity , describes in a simple parametrized form the departure from compact stars in general relativity .	This `` post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff ( TOV ) '' formalism for spherical static stars is inspired by the well-known parametrized post-Newtonian theory , extended to second post-Newtonian order by adding suitable correction terms to the fully relativistic TOV equations .
0	Suppose $ k+1 $ runners having nonzero constant speeds run laps on a unit-length circular track starting at the same time and place .	A runner is said to be lonely if she is at distance at least $ 1/ ( k+1 ) $ along the track to every other runner .	The lonely runner conjecture states that every runner gets lonely .	The conjecture has been proved up to six runners ( $ k\le 5 $ ) .	A formulation of the problem is related to the regular chromatic number of distance graphs .
4	Previous searches for remnant companions have revealed one possible case for SN 1572 $ ^ { 8,9 } $ , though that has been criticized $ ^ { 10 } $ .	Type Ia supernovae are thought to occur as a white dwarf made of carbon and oxygen accretes sufficient mass to trigger a thermonuclear explosion $ ^ { 1 } $ .	The accretion could occur slowly from an unevolved ( main-sequence ) or evolved ( subgiant or giant ) star $ ^ { 2,3 } $ , that being dubbed the single-degenerate channel , or rapidly as it breaks up a smaller orbiting white dwarf ( the double- degenerate channel ) $ ^ { 3,4 } $ .	Obviously , a companion will survive the explosion only in the single-degenerate channel $ ^ { 5 } $ .	Both channels might contribute to the production of type Ia supernovae $ ^ { 6,7 } $ but their relative proportions still remain a fundamental puzzle in astronomy .
1	Infinite dimensional manifolds of semi-negative curvature with a p-uniformly convex tangent norm fall in this class on nonpositively curved spaces , and several well-known results , such as existence and uniqueness of best approximations from convex closed sets , or the Bruhat-Tits fixed point theorem , are shown to hold in this setting , without dimension restrictions .	The notion of nonpositive curvature in Alexandrov 's sense is extended to include p-uniformly convex Banach spaces .	Homogeneous spaces G/K of Banach-Lie groups of semi-negative curvature are also studied , explicit estimates on the geodesic distance and sectional curvature are obtained .	A characterization of convex homogeneous submanifolds is given in terms of the Banach-Lie algebras .	A splitting theorem via convex expansive submanifolds is proven , inducing the corresponding splitting of the Banach-Lie group G. Finally , these notions are used to study the structure of the classical Banach-Lie groups of bounded linear operators acting on a Hilbert space , and the splittings induced by conditional expectations in such setting .
4	As an application of the minimality , we prove that for the case where a surface has at least one puncture , the probability that a random walk gives mapping classes with arithmetic mapping tori decays exponentially .	We consider a random walk on the mapping class group of a surface of finite type .	We assume that the random walk is determined by a probability measure whose support is finite and generates a non-elementary subgroup $ H $ .	We further assume that $ H $ is not consisting only of lifts with respect to any one covering .	Then we prove that the probability that such a random walk gives a non-minimal mapping class in its fibered commensurability class decays exponentially .
1	This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet population synthesis calculations.Aims .	Context .	Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of important disk properties , namely disk metallicity , mass and lifetime on fundamental planetary properties.Methods .	For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population of planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration and disk evolution.Results .	We find a large number of correlations : Regarding the planetary initial mass function , metallicity , disk mass and disk lifetime have different roles : For high [ Fe/H ] , giant planets are more frequent .
4	We show that this influence can be predicted by a simple model , replacing time consuming simulations .	We present the design of two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities in thin diamond membranes well suited for coupling of color centers in diamond .	By comparing simulated and ideal field distributions in Fourier and real space and by according modification of air hole positions and size , we optimize the cavity structure yielding high quality factors up to Q = 320000 with a modal volume of V = 0.35 ( lambda/n ) ^3 .	Using the very same approach we also improve previous designs of a small modal volume microcavity in silicon , gaining a factor of 3 in cavity Q .	In view of practical realization of photonic crystals in synthetic diamond films , it is necessary to investigate the influence of material absorption on the quality factor .
2	Soon after , surface anomalous topological orders were proposed to identify different root states of BTI , which even leads to a new BTI root state beyond the group cohomology classification .	Bosonic topological insulators ( BTI ) in three dimensions are symmetry-protected topological phases ( SPT ) protected by time-reversal and boson number conservation { symmetries } .	BTI in three dimensions were first proposed and classified by the group cohomology theory which suggests two distinct root states , each carrying a $ \mathbb { Z } _2 $ index .	In this paper , we propose a universal physical mechanism via \textit { vortex-line condensation } { from } a 3d superfluid to achieve all { three } root states .	It naturally produces bulk topological quantum field theory ( TQFT ) description for each root state .
4	It is found , in particular , that the absorption efficiency can both increase and decrease with a temperature drop .	The effect of the electron temperature on both the light absorption and the scattering by metal nanoparticles ( MNs ) with excitation of the surface plasmon electron vibrations is studied in the framework of the kinetic theory .	The formulae for electroconductivity and polarizability tensors are derived for finite temperatures of an electron gas .	The electrical conductivity and the halfwidth of the surface plasmon resonance are studied in detail for a spherical MN .	Depending on the size of MN , the efficiencies of light absorption and scattering with the temperature change are investigated .
4	The electrical and structural characterization of the irradiated GaMnAs layers indicates that the controlled tailoring of magnetism results from a compensation of holes by generated electrical defects .	Ion irradiation of semiconductors is a well understood method to tune the carrier concentration in a controlled manner .	We show that the ferromagnetism in GaMnAs films , known to be hole-mediated , can be modified by He ion irradiation .	The coercivity can be increased by more than three times .	The magnetization , Curie temperature and the saturation field along the out-of-plane hard axis all decrease as the fluence increases .
1	These equations are natural generalizations of anomalous diffusion equations , fractional conservations laws , local convection diffusion equations , and some fractional Porous medium equations .	We study a class of degenerate convection diffusion equations with a fractional nonlinear diffusion term .	In this paper we define weak entropy solutions for this class of equations and prove well-posedness under weak regularity assumptions on the solutions , e.g.uniqueness is obtained in the class of bounded integrable functions .	Then we introduce a monotone conservative numerical scheme and prove convergence toward an Entropy solution in the class of bounded integrable functions of bounded variation .	We then extend the well-posedness results to non-local terms based on general L\'evy type operators , and establish some connections to fully non-linear HJB equations .
3	Observations by \textit { Optical and Near-infrared Solar Eruption Tracer } and \textit { Solar Dynamics Observatory } reveal that , with the increase of the flare emission and the acceleration of the unsuccessfully erupting MFR , two isolated kernels appear at the WL 3600 { \AA } passband and quickly develop into two elongated ribbon-like structures .	Two-ribbon brightenings are one of the most remarkable characteristics of an eruptive solar flare and are often used for predicting the occurrence of coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) .	Nevertheless , it was called in question recently whether all two-ribbon flares are eruptive .	In this paper , we investigate a two ribbon-like white-light ( WL ) flare that is associated with a failed magnetic flux rope ( MFR ) eruption on 2015 January 13 , which has no accompanying CME in the WL coronagraph .	The evolution of the WL continuum enhancement is completely coincident in time with the variation of \textit { Fermi } hard X-ray 26 -- 50 keV flux .
2	We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS sources , searching for Compact Symmetric Objects ( CSOs ) and studying the absorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources .	Aims and Methods : We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum ( GPS ) radio sources at 1.6 GHz .	Of them , 15 sources are selected from the Parkes Half Jansky ( PHJ ) sample ( Snellen 2002 ) , 4 others are from our previous observation list .	Results : We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for the first time .	Of them , 80 % show mini-double-lobe radio structure , indicating that they are CSOs or candidates , and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us .
2	In this paper we solve some problems previously posed by other authors about independent $ [ 1,2 ] $ -sets .	An independent $ [ 1 , k ] $ -set $ S $ in a graph $ G $ is a dominating set which is independent and such that every vertex not in $ S $ has at most $ k $ neighbors in it .	The existence of such sets is not guaranteed in every graph and trees having an independent $ [ 1 , k ] $ -set have been characterized .	We provide a necessary condition for a graph to have an independent $ [ 1,2 ] $ -set , in terms of spanning trees and we prove that this condition is also sufficient for cactus graphs .	We follow the concept of excellent tree and characterize the family of trees such that any vertex belong to some independent $ [ 1,2 ] $ -set .
4	Our initial calculation of the partition function uses certain approximations that , we show , do not qualitatively affect the expression for the black hole entropy .	We compute the canonical partition for quantum black holes in the approach of Loop Quantum Gravity ( LQG ) .	We argue that any quantum theory of gravity in which the horizon area is built of non-interacting constituents can not yield qualitative corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking ( B-H ) area law , but corrections to the area law can arise as a consequence additional constraints inducing interactions between the constituents .	In LQG this is implemented by requiring spherical horizons .	The canonical approach for LQG favours a logarithmic correction to the B-H law with a coefficient of -1/2 , independently of the area spectrum .
2	Scaling these profiles to coincide in the self-similar case , the lowest mass systems are found to have higher scaled entropy profiles than more massive systems .	Studies of the X-ray surface brightness profiles of clusters , coupled with theoretical considerations , suggest that the breaking of self-similarity in the hot gas results from an `entropy floor ' , established by some heating process , which affects the structure of the intracluster gas strongly in lower mass systems .	Fitting analytical models for the radial variation in gas density and temperature to X-ray spectral images from the ROSAT PSPC and ASCA GIS , we derive gas entropy profiles for 20 galaxy clusters and groups .	This appears to be due to a baseline entropy of 70-140 h50^-1/3 keV cm^2 , depending on the extent to which shocks have been suppressed in low mass systems .	The extra entropy may be present in all systems , but is detectable only in poor clusters , compared to the entropy generated by gravitational collapse .
4	We assume conservation of angular momentum on spherical shells .	We investigate the action of the magnetorotational instability ( MRI ) in the context of iron-core collapse .	Exponential growth of the field on the rotation time scale by the MRI will dominate the linear growth process of field line `` wrapping '' with the same characteristic time .	We examine a variety of initial rotation states , with solid body rotation or a gradient in rotational velocity , that correspond to models in the literature .	A relatively modest value of the initial rotation , a period of ~ 10 s , will give a very rapidly rotating PNS and hence strong differential rotation with respect to the infalling matter .
0	We consider resonant absorption in a spectral line in the outflowing plasma within several tens of Schwarzschild radii from a compact object .	We take into account both Doppler and gravitational shifting effects and re-formulate the theory of P-Cygni profiles in these new circumstances .	It is found that a spectral line may have multiple absorption and emission components depending on how far the region of interaction is from the compact object and what is the distribution of velocity and opacity .	Profiles of spectral lines produced near a neutron star or a black hole can be strongly distorted by Doppler blue- , or red-shifting , and gravitational red-shifting .	These profiles may have both red- and blue-shifted absorption troughs .
2	In this paper , we investigate compressed least-squares problems and propose new models and algorithms that address the issue of error and noise introduced by compression .	Randomized matrix compression techniques , such as the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform , have emerged as an effective and practical way for solving large-scale problems efficiently .	With a focus on computational efficiency , however , forsaking solutions quality and accuracy becomes the trade-off .	While maintaining computational efficiency , our models provide robust solutions that are more accurate -- relative to solutions of uncompressed least-squares -- than those of classical compressed variants .	We introduce tools from robust optimization together with a form of partial compression to improve the error-time trade-offs of compressed least-squares solvers .
4	These different spaces of functions are closely related .	We consider spaces of trial wavefunctions for ground states and edge excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect that can be obtained in various ways .	In one way , functions are obtained by analyzing the entanglement of the ground state wavefunction , partitioned into two parts .	In another , functions are defined by the way in which they vanish as several coordinates approach the same value , or by a projection-operator Hamiltonian that enforces those conditions .	In a third way , functions are given by conformal blocks from a conformal field theory ( CFT ) .
1	Here we focus on detecting a local maxima shaped as a circular ring in the bidimensional galaxy correlation function \xi ( pi , sigma ) , separated in perpendicular \sigma and line-of-sight \pi distances .	In a series of papers we have recently studied the clustering of LRG galaxies in the latest spectroscopic SDSS data release , which has 75000 LRG galaxies sampling 1.1 Gpc^3/h^3 to z=0.47 .	We find a significant detection of such a peak at r ~110 Mpc/h .	The overall shape and location of the ring is consistent with it originating from the recombination-epoch baryon acoustic oscillations ( BAO ) .	This agreement provides support for the current understanding of how large scale structure forms in the universe .
0	We combine the adaptive and multilevel approaches to the BDDC and formulate a method which allows an adaptive selection of constraints on each decomposition level .	We also present a strategy for the solution of local eigenvalue problems in the adaptive algorithm using the LOBPCG method with a preconditioner based on standard components of the BDDC .	The effectiveness of the method is illustrated on several engineering problems .	It appears that the Adaptive-Multilevel BDDC algorithm is able to effectively detect troublesome parts on each decomposition level and improve convergence of the method .	The developed open-source parallel implementation shows a good scalability as well as applicability to very large problems and core counts .
4	Associated Lambda and Sigma hyperons were identified in the missing mass spectra .	At the Institut f\ '' ur Kernphysik in Mainz , Germany , the microtron MAMI has been upgraded to 1.5-GeV electron beam energy .	The magnetic spectrometer Kaos is now operated by the A1 collaboration to study strangeness electro-production .	Its compact design and its capability to detect negative and positive charged particles simultaneously under forward scattering angles complements the existing spectrometers .	In 2008 kaon production off a liquid hydrogen target was measured at & lt ; Q^2 & gt ; = 0.050 ( GeV/c ) ^2 and 0.036 ( GeV/c ) ^2 .
4	The procedure is fairly direct for Laguerre function expansions of Hermite type , due to some monotonicity properties of the kernels involved .	We study negative powers of Laguerre differential operators in $ \R $ , $ d\ge1 $ .	For these operators we prove two-weight $ L^p-L^q $ estimates , with ranges of $ q $ depending on $ p $ .	The case of the harmonic oscillator ( Hermite operator ) has recently been treated by Bongioanni and Torrea by using a straightforward approach of kernel estimates .	Here these results are applied in certain Laguerre settings .
3	Each prime knot component may slide along the unknotted region contributing to the overall configurational entropy with a term proportional to $ \ln N $ .	We estimate by Monte Carlo simulations the configurational entropy of $ N $ -steps polygons in the cubic lattice with fixed knot type .	By collecting a rich statistics of configurations with very large values of $ N $ we are able to analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the partition function of the problem for different knot types .	Our results confirm that , in the large $ N $ limit , each prime knot is localized in a small region of the polygon , regardless of the possible presence of other knots .	Furthermore , we discover that the mere existence of a knot requires a well defined entropic cost that scales exponentially with its minimal length .
3	On a global scale , these effects and the preferential tidal stripping of single stars tend to roughly balance , leading to overall cluster binary fractions that are roughly constant with time .	Using our recently improved Monte Carlo evolution code , we study the evolution of the binary fraction in globular clusters .	In agreement with previous N-body simulations , we find generally that the hard binary fraction in the core tends to increase with time over a range of initial cluster central densities for initial binary fractions & lt ; ~ 90 % .	The dominant processes driving the evolution of the core binary fraction are mass segregation of binaries into the cluster core and preferential destruction of binaries there .	Our findings suggest that the current hard binary fraction near the half-mass radius is a good indicator of the hard primordial binary fraction .
1	Recently , this exotic effect has been discovered experimentally in an ultrathin film of the Bi2Te3 family TI with spontaneous ferromagnetic ( FM ) order .	Quantum anomalous Hall ( QAH ) effect in magnetic topological insulator ( TI ) is a novel transport phenomenon in which the Hall resistance reaches the quantum plateau in the absence of external magnetic field .	An important question concerning the QAH state is whether it is simply a zero-magnetic-field version of the quantum Hall ( QH ) effect , or if there is new physics beyond the conventional paradigm .	Here we report experimental investigations on the quantum phase transition between the two opposite Hall plateaus of a QAH insulator caused by magnetization reversal .	We observe a well-defined plateau with zero Hall conductivity over a range of magnetic field around coercivity , consistent with a recent theoretical prediction .
3	The self consistency is effected by updates of the Poisson equation and the exchange correlation potential at the end of each eigenfunction correction cycle .	We present a multigrid algorithm for self consistent solution of the Kohn-Sham equations in real space .	The entire problem is discretized on a real space mesh with a high order finite difference representation .	The resulting self consistent equations are solved on a heirarchy of grids of increasing resolution with a nonlinear Full Approximation Scheme , Full Multigrid algorithm .	The algorithm leads to highly efficient solution of the equations , whereby the ground state electron distribution is obtained in only two or three self consistency iterations on the finest scale .
2	It turns out that the formula corresponds to an extension of generalized Wick 's theorem and simplifies the combinatorial complexity resulting from practical applications of generalized Wick 's theorem by unifying the transition density and the transition pairing tensor in the HFB theory .	A new formula is presented for the calculation of matrix elements between multi-quasiparticle Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov ( HFB ) states .	The formula is expressed in terms of the Pfaffian , and is derived by using the Fermion coherent states with Grassmann numbers .	The resultant formula is simpler and more compact than the traditional description of matrix elements of general many-body operators .	In addition , through the derivation of our new formula , we found that the Pfaffian version of the Lewis Carroll formula corresponds to the relation conjectrured by Balian and Brezin for the HFB theory in 1969 .
3	We show how to boost the theoretical resolution in a seemingly costless way by several orders of magnitude with respect to the already very efficient algorithms operating on isotopic aggregates .	This paper presents a brand new methodology to deal with isotopic fine structure calculations .	By using the Poisson approximation in an entirely novel way , we introduce mathematical elegance into the discussion on the trade-off between resolution and tractability .	Our considerations unify the concepts of fine-structure , equatransneutronic configurations , and aggregate isotopic structure in a natural and simple way .	We also develop an effective new way to obtain the important peaks in the most disaggregated isotopic structure localised in a precise region in the mass domain .
0	We study a model where two scalar fields , that are subdominant during inflation , decay into radiation some time after inflation has ended but before primordial nucleosynthesis .	Perturbations of these two curvaton fields can be responsible for the primordial curvature perturbation .	We write down the full non-linear equations that relate the primordial perturbation to the curvaton perturbations on large scales , and solve them in a sudden-decay approximation .	We calculate the power spectrum of the primordial perturbation , and finally go to second order to find the non-linearity parameter , fNL .	Not surprisingly , we find large positive values of fNL if the energy densities of the curvatons are sub-dominant when they decay , as in the single curvaton case .
1	This part of the disk is shaped by various forces that influence dust and gas dynamics , and by dust sublimation , which creates abrupt drops in the dust density .	The structure of inner region of protoplanetary disks around young pre-main-sequence stars is still poorly understood .	This region also emits strong near-infrared excess that can not be explained by classical accretion disk models , which suggests the existence of some unusual dust distribution or disk shape .	The most prevalent explanation to date is the puffed-up inner disk rim model , where the disk exhibits an optically thin cavity around the star up to the distance of dust sublimation .	The critical parameter in this model is the inner disk rim height $ z_ { \rm max } $ relative to the rim distance from the star $ R_ { \rm in } $ .
4	The Zernike moments of BPs , granules , and other features are distinctive enough to be separated using a support vector machine ( SVM ) classifier .	In this study , we propose methods for the automatic detection of photospheric features ( bright points and granules ) from ultra-violet ( UV ) radiation , using a feature-based classifier .	The methods use quiet-Sun observations at 214 nm and 525 nm images taken by Sunrise on 9 June 2009 .	The function of region growing and mean shift procedure are applied to segment the bright points ( BPs ) and granules , respectively .	Zernike moments of each region are computed .
2	This basis consists of discretising the VDF in a series of angular bins , with the VDF being only a function of the DM speed $ v $ within each bin .	Dark matter ( DM ) direct detection experiments which are directionally-sensitive may be the only method of probing the full velocity distribution function ( VDF ) of the Galactic DM halo .	We present an angular basis for the DM VDF which can be used to parametrise the distribution in order to mitigate astrophysical uncertainties in future directional experiments and extract information about the DM halo .	In contrast to other methods , such as spherical harmonic expansions , the use of this basis allows us to guarantee that the resulting VDF is everywhere positive and therefore physical .	We present a recipe for calculating the event rates corresponding to the discrete VDF for an arbitrary number of angular bins $ N $ and investigate the discretisation error which is introduced in this way .
4	The kinematics and extreme chemical composition of the ejecta from Sanduleak 's star bear strong resemblance with the low-velocity remnants of SN1987A and with the outer filaments of the most famous supernova progenitor candidate , i.e. , eta Carinae .	Highly-collimated gas ejections are among the most dramatic structures in the Universe , observed to emerge from very different astrophysical systems - from active galactic nuclei down to young brown dwarf stars .	Even with the huge span in spatial scales , there is convincing evidence that the physics at the origin of the phenomenon , namely the acceleration and collimation mechanisms , is the same in all classes of jets .	Here we report on the discovery of a giant , highly-collimated jet from Sanduleak 's star in the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) .	With a physical extent of 14 parsecs at the distance of the LMC , it represents the largest stellar jet ever discovered , and the first resolved stellar jet beyond the Milky Way .
3	Here we report the results of a similar investigation of another 25-mer B-DNA fragment now with a natural base pair sequence found in a bent locus of a minicircle DNA .	The macroscopic curvature induced in the double helical B-DNA by regularly repeated adenine tracts ( A-tracts ) plays an exceptional role in structural studies of DNA because this effect presents the most well-documented example of sequence specific conformational modulations .	Recently , a new hypothesis of its physical origin has been put forward , based upon the results of molecular dynamics simulations of a 25-mer fragment with three A-tracts phased with the helical screw .	Its sequence , however , had never been encountered in experimental studies , but was constructed empirically so as to maximize the magnitude of bending in specific computational conditions .	It is shown that the static curvature of a considerable magnitude and stable direction towards the minor grooves of A-tracts emerges spontaneously in conditions excluding any initial bias except the base pair sequence .
0	We show that there is a very simple approach to determine the 2-adic complexity of periodic binary sequences with ideal two-level autocorrelation .	This is the first main result by H. Xiong , L. Qu , and C. Li , IEEE Transactions on Information Theory , vol.60 , no.4 , pp .	2399-2406 , Apr .	2014 , and the main result by T. Tian and W. Qi , IEEE Transactions on Information Theory , vol.56 , no.1 , pp .	450-454 , Jan. 2010 .
3	We prove the existence of the solution to this equation and give important properties of the optimal control functional .	Initially introduced in the framework of quantum control , the so-called `` monotonic algorithms '' have demonstrated excellent numerical performance when dealing with bilinear optimal control problems .	This paper presents a unified formulation that can be applied to more nonlinear settings compatible with the hypothesis detailed below .	In this framework , we show that the well-posedness of the general algorithm is related to a nonlinear evolution equation .	Finally we show how the algorithm works for selected models from the literature and compare it with the gradient algorithm .
1	For most of the stars we have reliable absolute magnitudes and colors .	We present an analysis and interpretation of oscillation spectra for all 69 SX Phoenicis stars discovered in the field of the cluster .	Except of one , or perhaps two , objects , the stars are cluster members .	Their pulsational behaviour is very diversified .	Multiperiodic variability with at least part of the excited modes being nonradial is most common but there are also many cases of high amplitude , presumably radial mode , pulsators .
4	number of ray classes and this forces a decomposition of $ G $ in cyclic components in a suitable way , cf .	In `` A note on generalized Clifford algebras and representations '' ( Caenepeel , S. ; Van Oystaeyen , F. , Comm .	Algebra 17 ( 1989 ) no.1 , 93 -- 102 . )	generalized Clifford algebras were introduced via Clifford representations ; these correspond to projective representations of a finite group ( Abelian ) , $ G $ say , such that the corresponding twisted group ring has minimal center .	The latter then translates to the fact that the corresponding 2-cocycle allows a minimal ( none ! )
4	Its finite-time numerical approximation fluctuates changing the sign within a wide range of the coupling parameter .	We consider a chain of oscillators with hyperbolic chaos coupled via diffusion .	When the coupling is strong the chain is synchronized and demonstrates hyperbolic chaos so that there is one positive Lyapunov exponent .	With the decay of the coupling the second and the third Lyapunov exponents approach zero simultaneously .	The second one becomes positive , while the third one remains close to zero .
4	Our general formula also suggests that the density of overlap q between initial and final state in an avalanche is rho ( q ) ~ 1/ ( 1-q ) .	We study the distribution of equilibrium avalanches ( shocks ) in Ising spin glasses which occur at zero temperature upon small changes in the magnetic field .	For the infinite-range Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model we present a detailed derivation of the density rho ( Delta M ) of the magnetization jumps Delta M. It is obtained by introducing a multi-component generalization of the Parisi-Duplantier equation , which allows us to compute all cumulants of the magnetization .	We find that rho ( Delta M ) ~ ( Delta M ) ^ ( -tau ) with an avalanche exponent tau=1 for the SK model , originating from the marginal stability ( criticality ) of the model .	It holds for jumps of size 1 & lt ; & lt ; Delta M & lt ; N^ ( 1/2 ) being provoked by changes of the external field by delta H = O ( N^ [ -1/2 ] ) where N is the total number of spins .
1	A vertex $ v\in V_i $ is a Grundy vertex if it is adjacent to at least one vertex in each color class $ V_j $ for every $ j & lt ; i $ .	A coloring of a graph $ G= ( V , E ) $ is a partition $ \ { V_1 , V_2 , \ldots , V_k\ } $ of $ V $ into independent sets or color classes .	A coloring is a Grundy coloring if every vertex is a Grundy vertex , and the Grundy number $ \Gamma ( G ) $ of a graph $ G $ is the maximum number of colors in a Grundy coloring .	We provide two new upper bounds on Grundy number of a graph and a stronger version of the well-known Nordhaus-Gaddum theorem .	In addition , we give a new characterization for a $ \ { P_ { 4 } , C_4\ } $ -free graph by supporting a conjecture of Zaker , which says that $ \Gamma ( G ) \geq \delta ( G ) +1 $ for any $ C_4 $ -free graph $ G $ .
0	A comparison is given between the Newtonian and Einsteinian frames of gravitation .	From this it is shown that there exist a weak connection to gravitation and electromagnetism .	This connection is then studied more thoroughly with the Weyl tensor and with the electromagnetic vacuum \Lambda .	Which dictates General Relativity should be reformulated to confer to a `Einstein-Cartan-Weyl ' geometry .	Where it is seen that the Gravitational Constant is the inverse of the Compton wavelength shown through a Weyl gauge potential of form [ F_ { \alpha\beta } +A_ { a\beta } ^\alpha ] _ { ; \beta } .
2	In practice , a universal entangler is a very powerful device for generating entanglements , and thus provides important physical resources for accomplishing many tasks in quantum computing and quantum information .	A gate is called entangler if it transforms some ( pure ) product states to entangled states .	A universal entangler is a gate which transforms all product states to entangled states .	This Letter demonstrates that a universal entangler always exists except for a degenerated case .	Nevertheless , the problem how to find a universal entangler remains open .
3	the Dirac operator ) with respect to the metric $ \tilde { g } $ .	Let $ ( M , g , \sigma ) $ be a compact Riemmannian surface equipped with a spin structure $ \sigma $ .	For any metric $ \tilde { g } $ on $ M $ , we denote by $ \mu\_1 ( \tilde { g } ) $ ( resp .	$ \lambda\_1 ( \tilde { g } ) $ ) the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian ( resp .	In this paper , we show that $ $ \inf \frac { \lambda\_1 ( \tilde { g } ) ^2 } { \mu\_1 ( \tilde { g } ) } \leqslant { 1/2 } . $ $ where the infimum is taken over the metrics $ \tilde { g } $ conformal to $ g $ .
4	On the other hand , Chirikov 's formula yields unrealistic values of the diffusion coefficient , in particular for very small values of the perturbation , when used in the original Hamiltonian instead of the optimal normal form .	We present theoretical and numerical results pointing towards a strong connection between the estimates for the diffusion rate along simple resonances in multidimensional nonlinear Hamiltonian systems that can be obtained using the heuristic theory of Chirikov and a more formal one due to Nekhoroshev .	We show that , despite a wide-spread impression , the two theories are complementary rather than antagonist .	Indeed , although Chirikov 's 1979 review has thousands of citations , almost all of them refer to topics such as the resonance overlap criterion , fast diffusion , the Standard or Whisker Map , and not to the constructive theory providing a formula to measure diffusion along a single resonance .	However , as will be demonstrated explicitly below , Chirikov 's formula provides values of the diffusion coefficient which are quite well comparable to the numerically computed ones , provided that it is implemented on the so-called optimal normal form derived as in the analytic part of Nekhoroshev 's theorem .
4	Comparing results for the trace formula , spectral statistics and spin-orbit localization on quantum graphs with spin Hamiltonians .	The article surveys quantization schemes for metric graphs with spin .	Typically quantum graphs are defined with the Laplace or Schrodinger operator which describe particles whose intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) is zero .	However , in many applications , for example modeling an electron ( which has spin-1/2 ) on a network of thin wires , it is necessary to consider operators which allow spin-orbit interaction .	The article presents a review of quantization schemes for graphs with three such Hamiltonian operators , the Dirac , Pauli and Rashba Hamiltonians .
1	Under certain assumptions , we show that in attractive force fields a high speed particle with a small mass speeding through space , statistically loses energy by colliding softly with large masses that move slowly and randomly .	This article puts forth a process applicable to central force scatterings .	Furthermore , we show that the opposite holds in repulsive force fields : the small particle statistically gains energy .	This effect is small and is mainly due to asymmetric energy exchange of the transverse ( i.e. , perpendicular ) collisions .	We derive a formula that quantifies this effect ( Eq.12 ) .
3	In that way , new constraints in the $ ( \bar\rho , \bar\eta ) $ plane are derived .	In the heavy-quark limit , the hadronic matrix elements entering nonleptonic $ B $ -meson decays into two light mesons can be calculated from first principles including `` nonfactorizable '' strong-interaction corrections .	The $ B\to\pi K , \pi\pi $ decay amplitudes are computed including electroweak penguin contributions , SU ( 3 ) violation in the light-cone distribution amplitudes , and an estimate of power corrections from chirally-enhanced terms and annihilation graphs .	The results are then used to reduce the theoretical uncertainties in determinations of the weak phases $ \gamma $ and $ \alpha $ .	Predictions for the $ B\to\pi K , \pi\pi $ branching ratios and CP asymmetries are also presented .
2	Our mass resolution limit for sources is M~ 4.0 x 10^7 h^-1 M_sol , which is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than in previous studies of this kind .	We study the reionisation of the Universe by stellar sources using a numerical approach that combines fast 3D radiative transfer calculations with high resolution hydrodynamical simulations .	Ionising fluxes for the sources are derived from intrinsic star formation rates computed in the underlying hydrodynamical simulations .	Our calculations reveal that the reionisation process is sensitive to the inclusion of dim sources with masses below ~10^9 h^-1 M_sol .	We present the results of our reionisation simulation assuming a range of escape fractions for ionising photons and make statistical comparisons with observational constraints on the neutral fraction of hydrogen at z~6 derived from the z=6.28 SDSS quasar of Becker and coworkers .
4	This range encompasses typical input alphabets for a continuous variable quantum information protocol .	A quantum memory for light is a key element for the realization of future quantum information networks .	Requirements for a good quantum memory are ( i ) versatility ( allowing a wide range of inputs ) and ( ii ) true quantum coherence ( preserving quantum information ) .	Here we demonstrate such a quantum memory for states possessing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen ( EPR ) entanglement .	These multi-photon states are two-mode squeezed by 6.0 dB with a variable orientation of squeezing and displaced by a few vacuum units .
4	This study also yields an independent estimate for the bag energy density $ B $ , which is in agreement with the M.I.T bag model value .	The mass formulae for finite lumps of strange quark matter with $ u $ , $ d $ and $ s $ quarks , and non-strange quark matter consisting of $ u $ and $ d $ quarks are derived in a non-relativistic potential model .	The finite-size effects comprising the surface , curvature and even , the Gauss curvature were consistently obtained , which shows a converging trend .	It is found that there is a possibility for the formation of metastable strangelets of large mass .	The model predicts low charge to mass ratio as the characteristic signature of strange matter in agreement with the relativistic studies .
2	Characterizations representing the change in the lattice properties include the variation in the equilibrium lattice constants , bulk modulus and pressure derivative of the bulk modulus , and that of electronic structure include the changes in the , total , partial and $ \mathbf { k } $ -resolved density of states .	The influence of vacancies in the $ C $ sub-lattice of $ MgCNi_ { 3 } $ , on its structural , electronic and magnetic properties are studied by means of the density-functional based Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green 's function method formulated in the atomic sphere approximation .	Disorder is taken into account by means of coherent-potential approximation .	The incipient magnetic properties are studied by means of fixed-spin moment method of alloy theory , together in conjunction with the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau equation for magnetic phase transition .	The first-principles calculations reveal that due to the breaking of the $ C $ - $ Ni $ bonds , some of the $ Ni $ 3d states , which were lowered in energy due to strong hybridization , are transfered back to higher energies thereby increasing the itinerant character in the material .
2	In order to study the relationship between quantum gauge theory of gravity and traditional quantum gravity which is formulated in curved space , it is important to find the differential geometric formulation of quantum gauge theory of gravity .	Differential geometric formulation of quantum gauge theory of gravity is studied in this paper .	The quantum gauge theory of gravity which is proposed in the references hep-th/0109145 and hep-th/0112062 is formulated completely in the framework of traditional quantum field theory .	We first give out the correspondence between quantum gauge theory of gravity and differential geometry .	Then we give out differential geometric formulation of quantum gauge theory of gravity .
3	We prove an abstract , uniform formula for the $ p $ -rank on a KR stratum .	We study the reduction of certain integral models of Shimura varieties of PEL type with Iwahori level structure .	On these spaces we have the Kottwitz-Rapoport and the $ p $ -rank stratification .	We show that the $ p $ -rank is constant on a KR stratum , generalizing a result of Ng\^o and Genestier .	In the symplectic and in the unitary case we derive explicit formulas for its value .
2	We show that the T_ { 13 } symmetry can derive lepton masses and mixings consistently .	We study a new flavor symmetric model with non-Abelian discrete symmetry T_ { 13 } .	The T_ { 13 } group is isomorphic to Z_ { 13 } \rtimes Z_3 , and it is the minimal group having two complex triplets as the irreducible representations .	Moreover , if we assume a gauge-singlet fermionic decaying dark matter , its decay operators are also constrained by the T_ { 13 } symmetry so that only dimension six operators of leptonic decay are allowed .	We find that the cosmic-ray anomalies reported by PAMELA and Fermi-LAT are explained by decaying dark matter controlled by the T_ { 13 } flavor symmetry .
4	We show that the discontinuity remains pronounced even if the observed MF appears to be continuous , even for a BD binary fraction as high as 60 % .	The empirical binary properties of brown dwarfs ( BDs ) differ from those of normal stars suggesting BDs form a separate population .	Recent work by Thies & amp ; Kroupa revealed a discontinuity of the initial mass function ( IMF ) in the very-low-mass star regime under the assumption of a low multiplicity of BDs of about 15 per cent .	However , previous observations had suggested that the multiplicity of BDs may be significantly higher , up to 45 per cent .	This contribution investigates the implication of a high BD multiplicity on the appearance of the IMF for the Orion Nebula Cluster , Taurus-Auriga , IC 348 and the Pleiades .
3	The equation can be solved in terms of the general Heun 's function for generic frequency \omega and wave number k. This allows us to obtain the analytic Green 's function G ( \omega , k ) for both extremal and non-extremal black holes .	We construct T^2-symmetric charged AdS black holes in conformal gravity .	The most general solution up to an overall conformal factor contains three non-trivial parameters : the mass , electric charge and a quantity that can be identified as the massive spin-2 hair .	We study the Dirac equation for the charged massless spinor in this background .	For some special choice of back hole parameters , we find that the Green 's function reduces to simpler hypergeometric or confluent hypergeometric functions .
0	Using new and archival observations made with the Swift satellite and other facilities , we examine 147 X-ray sources selected from the ROSAT All-Sky-Survey Bright Source Catalog ( RASS/BSC ) to produce a new limit on the number of isolated neutron stars ( INSs ) in the RASS/BSC , the most constraining such limit to-date .	Independent of X-ray spectrum and variability , the number of INSs is & lt ; =48 ( 90 % confidence ) .	Restricting attention to soft ( having an effective temperature of & lt ; 200 eV ) , non-variable X-ray sources -- as in a previous study -- yields an all-sky limit of & lt ; =31 INSs .	In the course of our analysis , we identify five new high-quality INS candidates for targeted follow-up observations .	A future all-sky X-ray survey with eROSITA , or another mission with similar capabilities , can be expected to increase the detected population of X-ray-discovered INSs from the 8 to 50 in the BSC , to ( for a disk population ) 240 to 1500 , which will enable a more detailed study of neutron star population models .
1	Our analysis shows that the BAT burst spectrum is consistent with a thermonuclear flash ( type-I X-ray burst ) from the surface of an accreting neutron star in a binary system .	We present an analysis of the Swift BAT and XRT data of GRB060602B , which is most likely an accreting neutron star in a binary system and not a gamma-ray burst .	The X-ray binary nature is further confirmed by the report of a detection of a faint point source at the position of the XRT counterpart of the burst in archival XMM-Newton data approximately 6 years before the burst and in more recent XMM-Newton data obtained at the end of September 2006 ( nearly 4 months after the burst ) .	Since the source is very likely not a gamma-ray burst , we rename the source Swift J1749.4-2807 , based on the Swift/BAT discovery coordinates .	Using the BAT data of the type-I X-ray burst we determined that the source is at most at a distance of 6.7+-1.3 kpc .
1	The model under consideration is composed of two two-level systems which are coupled locally to an environment consisting of nonlocally correlated field modes given by two-mode Gaussian states .	We present a scheme allowing to access the squeezing parameter of multimode fields by means of the dynamics of nonlocal quantum probes .	Introducing independently switchable interactions , one observes revivals of nonlocal coherences of the two-qubit system which are unambiguously connected to the squeezing parameter of the Gaussian environmental states .	Thus , the locally interacting two two-level systems represent a dynamical quantum probe for the squeezing in multimode fields .	It is finally demonstrated that perfectly reviving nonlocal coherences also persists for nonentangled correlated field modes and an explanation for this phenomenon is presented by connecting it to the correlation coefficient of the environmental coupling operators .
0	Motivated by the separability problem in quantum systems $ 2\otimes4 $ , $ 3\otimes3 $ and $ 2\otimes2\otimes2 $ , we study the maximal ( proper ) faces of the convex body , $ S_1 $ , of normalized separable states in an arbitrary quantum system with finite-dimensional Hilbert space $ H=H_1\otimes H_2\otimes\cdots\otimes H_n $ .	To any subspace $ V $ of $ H $ we associate a face $ F_V $ of $ S_1 $ consisting of all states $ \rho\in S_1 $ whose range is contained in $ V $ .	We prove that $ F_V $ is a maximal face if and only if $ V $ is a hyperplane .	If $ V $ is the hyperplane orthogonal to a product vector , we prove that $ \dim F_V=d^2-1-\prod ( 2d_i-1 ) $ , where $ d_i $ is the dimension of $ H_i $ and $ d=\prod d_i $ .	We classify the maximal faces of $ S_1 $ in the cases $ 2\otimes2 $ and $ 2\otimes3 $ .
1	At Van Hove filling and zero temperature the function diverges logarithmically at q=0 .	To assess the strength of nematic fluctuations with a finite wave vector in a two-dimensional metal , we compute the static d-wave polarization function for tight-binding electrons on a square lattice .	Away from Van Hove filling the ground state polarization function exhibits finite peaks at finite wave vectors .	A nematic instability driven by a sufficiently strong attraction in the d-wave charge channel thus leads naturally to a spatially modulated nematic state , with a modulation vector that increases in length with the distance from Van Hove filling .	Above Van Hove filling , for a Fermi surface crossing the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary , the modulation vector connects antiferromagnetic hot spots with collinear Fermi velocities .
4	Then , the application of control-theoretic tools is proposed in order to compute the optimal scheduling of multiple therapies .	We investigate the use of hybrid techniques in complex processes of infectious diseases .	Since predictive disease models in biomedicine require a multiscale approach for understanding the molecule-cell-tissue-organ-body interactions , heterogeneous methodologies are often employed for describing the different biological scales .	Hybrid models provide effective means for complex disease modelling where the action and dosage of a drug or a therapy could be meaningfully investigated : the infection dynamics can be classically described in a continuous fashion , while the scheduling of multiple treatment discretely .	We define an algebraic language for specifying general disease processes and multiple treatments , from which a semantics in terms of hybrid dynamical system can be derived .
4	The turbulent velocity field yields time scales of the turbulence are calculated .	Arecibo spectra of the mainline OH maser emission from U Her over more than a decade show variations of the OH emission over these time scales .	These observations are combined with high spatial resolution VLBA maps to investigate the causes of the variations in the velocities of the maser components .	Global properties of the dust shell , such as accelerations , variations in the pump and shell-wide magnetic field changes are examined as possibilities , and eliminated .	A possible solution to the problem involving plasma turbulence and the local magnetic field is introduced , and the relevant time scales of the turbulence are calculated .
4	When including the irreversibility , we conclude that the front propagation can become history dependent , and thus we consider the value $ \zeta=1/2 $ as a lower bound for the roughness exponent .	We investigate propagating fronts in disordered media that belong to the universality class of wetting contact lines and planar tensile crack fronts .	We derive from first principles their nonlinear equations of motion , using the generalized Griffith criterion for crack fronts and three standard mobility laws for contact lines .	Then we study their roughness using the self-consistent expansion .	When neglecting the irreversibility of fracture and wetting processes , we find a possible dynamic rough phase with a roughness exponent of $ \zeta=1/2 $ and a dynamic exponent of z=2 .
3	In this paper we combine quantum entanglement with nanostructured metal optics in the form of optically thick metal films perforated with a periodic array of subwavelength holes .	The state of a two-particle system is called entangled when its quantum mechanical wave function can not be factorized in two single-particle wave functions .	Entanglement leads to the strongest counter-intuitive feature of quantum mechanics , namely nonlocality .	Experimental realization of quantum entanglement is relatively easy for the case of photons ; a pump photon can spontaneously split into a pair of entangled photons inside a nonlinear crystal .	These arrays act as photonic crystals that may convert entangled photons into surface-plasmon waves , i.e. , compressive charge density waves .
0	We report the first measurement of the neutron electric form factor $ G_E^n $ via $ \vec { d } ( \vec { e } , e'n ) p $ using a solid polarized target .	$ G_E^n $ was determined from the beam-target asymmetry in the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from polarized deuterated ammonia , $ ^ { 15 } $ ND $ _3 $ .	The measurement was performed in Hall C at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility ( TJNAF ) in quasi free kinematics with the target polarization perpendicular to the momentum transfer .	The electrons were detected in a magnetic spectrometer in coincidence with neutrons in a large solid angle segmented detector .	We find $ G_E^n = 0.04632\pm0.00616 ( stat . )
0	For any topological space $ X $ we study the relation between the universal uniformity $ \mathcal U_X $ , the universal quasi-uniformity $ q\mathcal U_X $ and the universal pre-uniformity $ p\mathcal U_X $ on $ X $ .	For a pre-uniformity $ \mathcal U $ on a set $ X $ and a word $ v $ in the two-letter alphabet $ \ { + , -\ } $ we define the verbal power $ \mathcal U^v $ of $ \mathcal U $ and study its boundedness numbers $ \ell ( \mathcal U^v ) $ and $ \bar \ell ( \mathcal U^v ) $ .	The boundedness numbers of the ( Boolean operations over ) the verbal powers of the canonical pre-uniformities $ p\mathcal U_X $ , $ q\mathcal U_X $ and $ \mathcal U_X $ yield new cardinal characteristics $ \ell^v ( X ) $ , $ \bar \ell^v ( X ) $ , $ q\ell^v ( X ) $ , $ q\bar \ell^v ( X ) $ , $ u\ell ( X ) $ of a topological space $ X $ , which generalize all known cardinal topological invariants related to ( star ) -covering properties .	We study the relation of the new cardinal invariants $ \ell^v $ , $ \bar \ell^v $ to classical cardinal topological invariants such as Lindel\ '' of number $ \ell $ , density $ d $ , and spread $ s $ .	The simplest new verbal cardinal invariant is the foredensity $ \ell^- ( X ) $ defined for a topological space $ X $ as the smallest cardinal $ \kappa $ such that for any neighborhood assignment $ ( O_x ) _ { x\in X } $ there is a subset $ A\subset X $ of cardinality $ |A|\le\kappa $ that meets each neighborhood $ O_x $ , $ x\in X $ .
3	For example , it is shown that the linear span of trees carries an enveloping algebra structure and embeds as such in an enveloping algebra of increasing trees .	We first show that increasing trees are in bijection with set compositions , extending simultaneously a recent result on trees due to Tonks and a classical result on increasing binary trees .	We then consider algebraic structures on the linear span of set compositions ( the twisted descent algebra ) .	Among others , a number of enveloping algebra structures are introduced and studied in detail .	All our constructions arise naturally from the general theory of twisted Hopf algebras .
1	These are valid for general classes of potentials and for arbitrary inverse temperatures $ { \rm Re } \ , \beta & gt ; 0 $ and number of eigenvalues $ N $ .	We construct a hierarchy of loop equations for invariant circular ensembles .	Using matching arguments for the resolvent functions of linear statistics $ f ( \zeta ) = ( \zeta+z ) / ( \zeta-z ) $ in a particular asymptotic regime , the global regime , we systematically develop the corresponding large $ N $ expansion and apply this solution scheme to the Dyson circular ensemble .	Currently we can compute the second resolvent function to ten orders in this expansion and also its general Fourier coefficient or moment $ m_ { k } $ to an equivalent length .	The leading large $ N $ , large $ k $ , $ k/N $ fixed form of the moments can be related to the small wave-number expansion of the structure function in the bulk , scaled Dyson circular ensemble , known from earlier work .
1	We detect three thermal radio jets , L1489 , YLW 16A in L1681B and NGC 2264D VLA 7 , associated with molecular and/or HH outflows .	We present multi-frequency VLA continuum observations towards 8 star forming regions with molecular and optical outflows : L1489 , HH 68-69 , HH 94-95 , NGC 2264D , L1681B , L778 , MWC 1080 and V645 Cyg .	The L1489 and NGC 2264D VLA 7 thermal radio jets appear elongated in the direction of the larger scale outflow .	We report the first tentative detection of a non-thermal radio jet , L778 VLA 5 , associated with a low mass Class I protostar and powering a molecular outflow .	For HH68-69 , HH 94-95 and the molecular outflow in NGC 2264D we could not identify a candidate of the exciting source of these outflows .
0	We report the recent results from the computer simulations of a fermion-gauge-scalar model with dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking and chiral transition induced by the scalar field .	This model might be considered to be a possible alternative to the Higgs mechanism of mass generation .	A new scheme is developed for detecting the chiral transition .	Our results show with higher precision than the earlier works that the chiral transition line joins the Higgs phase transition line , separating the Higgs and Nambu ( chiral-symmetry breaking ) phases .	The end point of the Higgs transition with divergent correlation lengths is therefore suitable for an investigation of the continuum limit .
1	In s-wave systems , where the order parameter is a complex scalar , we find that the interference patterns depend on the relative phase of the order parameters of the condensates .	We discuss matter wave interference of Fermi condensates in strongly coupled s-wave and p-wave channels and the time evolution of a single cloud upon release from trap .	In p-wave systems involving the mixture of two-hyperfine states , we show that the interference pattern exhibits a polarization effect depending on the relative orientation of the two vector order parameters .	However , in p-wave systems involving a single hyperfine state , we show that this angular effect reduces to an overall phase difference between the two interfering clouds , similar to s-wave .	Lastly , we also point out that p-wave Fermi condensates exhibit an anisotropic expansion , reflecting the spatial anisotropy of the underlying interaction between fermions and the orbital nature of the vector order parameter .
3	In particular , I expect to determine whether a non-local order parameter associated with a given topological entanglement measure can be determined in order to characterize topological order , and possible applications in entanglement topological protection .	I propose to study the complex physics of topological phases by an all optical implementation of a discrete-time quantum walk .	The main novel ingredient is the use of parametric amplifiers in the random network which can in turn be used to emulate intra-atomic interactions and thus analyze many-body effects in topological phases even when using light as the quantum walker .	I plan to characterize the intensity probability distribution and the spatial correlations of the output interference pattern for different input states , as well the robustness of localized boundary states characterizing topological insulators to different sources of noise .	One of the most promising applications of the proposed research includes the study of topological phases in photosynthetic energy transferring processes characterizing biological systems .
3	The HESS array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes ( IACTs ) has a high sensitivity compared with previous instruments ( ~ 0.01 Crab ) in 25 hours observation time for a 5 sigma point-source detection ) , and with its large field of view , is well suited for scan-based observations .	The detection of gamma rays in the very-high-energy ( VHE ) energy range ( 100 GeV -- 100 TeV ) provides a direct view of the parent population of ultra-relativistic particles found in astrophysical sources .	For this reason , VHE gamma rays are useful for understanding the underlying astrophysical processes in non-thermal sources .	We investigate unidentified VHE gamma-ray sources that have been discovered with HESS in the most sensitive blind survey of the Galactic plane at VHE energies conducted so far .	The on-going HESS survey of the inner Galaxy has revealed a large number of new VHE sources , and for each we attempt to associate the VHE emission with multi-wavelength data in the radio through X-ray wavebands .
3	If the Large Mixing Angle MSW solution correctly describes the solar neutrino deficit , there is a small corner of allowed parameter space in which maximal CP-violation in the lepton sector might be observable at a 1 GeV medium baseline experiment .	We consider the nu_mu to nu_e oscillation measurements that would be possible at upgraded 1 GeV and multi-GeV conventional neutrino sources driven by future megawatt-scale proton drivers .	If these neutrino superbeams are used together with detectors that are an order of magnitude larger than those presently foreseen , we find that the sensitivity to nu_mu to nu_e oscillations can be improved by an order of magnitude beyond the next generation of accelerator based experiments .	In addition , over a limited region of parameter space , the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined with a multi-GeV long baseline beam .	Superbeams with massive detectors would therefore provide a useful tool en route to a neutrino factory , which would permit a further order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity , together with a more comprehensive check of CP-violation and the oscillation framework .
4	This note is intended as a tutorial description of the scheme , and draws heavily on previously published material .	A numerical method for variable coefficient elliptic problems on two dimensional domains is described .	The method is based on high-order spectral approximations and is designed for problems with smooth solutions .	The resulting system of linear equations is solved using a direct solver with $ O ( N^ { 1.5 } ) $ complexity for the pre-computation and $ O ( N \log N ) $ complexity for the solve .	The fact that the solver is direct is a principal feature of the scheme , and makes it particularly well suited to solving problems for which iterative solvers struggle ; in particular for problems with highly oscillatory solutions .
3	To address this issue , we introduce the Entropy Search Portfolio ( ESP ) : a novel approach to portfolio construction which is motivated by information theoretic considerations .	Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient method for black-box global optimization .	How- ever , the performance of a Bayesian optimization method very much depends on its exploration strategy , i.e.the choice of acquisition function , and it is not clear a priori which choice will result in superior performance .	While portfolio methods provide an effective , principled way of combining a collection of acquisition functions , they are often based on measures of past performance which can be misleading .	We show that ESP outperforms existing portfolio methods on several real and synthetic problems , including geostatistical datasets and simulated control tasks .
4	Using the Debye relaxation model , we find that the associated time scale of the disordered motion of both crystals in the cubic phase is a few hundreds femtoseconds .	Hybrid lead-halide perovskites have emerged as an excellent class of photovoltaic materials .	Dynamic disorder induced by the polar methyl ammonium cation has been suggested as the root cause of the novel electronic properties observed near room temperature .	Here , we combine low frequency Raman scattering with first-principles molecular dynamics ( MD ) to study the fundamental nature of this dynamic disorder .	By a comparison of hybrid and all-inorganic lead-halide perovskites , we find that dynamic disorder is intrinsic to the general lead-halide perovskite structure , and not unique to the dipolar organic cation .
4	Our re-analysis of the archival Chandra data shows evidence for an X-ray tunnel ( elongated region of reduced X-ray emission ) extending from near the center of the cD out to the west ghost bubble .	A previous analysis of the Chandra X-ray image of the center of the cooling core cluster Abell 2597 showed two `` ghost holes '' in the X-ray emission to the west and northeast of the central radio galaxy PKS 2322-123 .	Previous radio observations did not detect any radio emission coming from the interior of the X-ray holes .	We present new low frequency radio observations of Abell 2597 .	At 330 MHz , radio emission extends into the interior of the western ghost bubble , but not the northeast one .
3	We explain how we can reduce phase noise by making oversampling or multiple measurements depending on its type .	In this paper we study the origin and the effect of amplitude and phase noise on Laser Optical Feedback Imaging ( LOFI ) associated with Synthetic Aperture ( SA ) imaging system .	Amplitude noise corresponds to photon noise and acts as an additive noise , it can be reduced by increasing the global measurement time .	Phase noise can be divided in three families : random , sinusoidal and drift phase noise ; we show that it acts as a multiplicative noise .	This work can easily be extended to all SA systems ( Radar , Laser or Terahertz ) , especially when raw holograms are acquired point by point .
0	Being able to analyze and interpret signal coming from electroencephalogram ( EEG ) recording can be of high interest for many applications including medical diagnosis and Brain-Computer Interfaces .	Indeed , human experts are today able to extract from this signal many hints related to physiological as well as cognitive states of the recorded subject and it would be very interesting to perform such task automatically but today no completely automatic system exists .	In previous studies , we have compared human expertise and automatic processing tools , including artificial neural networks ( ANN ) , to better understand the competences of each and determine which are the difficult aspects to integrate in a fully automatic system .	In this paper , we bring more elements to that study in reporting the main results of a practical experiment which was carried out in an hospital for sleep pathology study .	An EEG recording was studied and labeled by a human expert and an ANN .
0	We demonstrate the utility of a spectral approximation to fermion loop operators using low-lying eigenmodes of the hermitian Dirac-Wilson matrix , Q .	The investigation is based on a total of 400 full QCD vacuum configurations , with two degenerate flavors of dynamical Wilson fermions at beta =5.6 , at two different sea quark masses .	The spectral approach is highly competitive for accessing both topological charge and disconnected diagrams , on large lattices and small quark masses .	We propose suitable partial summation techniques that provide sufficient saturation for estimating Tr Q^ { -1 } , which is related to the topological charge .	In the effective mass plot of the eta ' meson we achieved a consistent early plateau formation , by ground state projecting the connected piece of its propagator .
0	N00N states -- maximally path-entangled states of N photons -- exhibit spatial interference patterns sharper than any classical interference pattern .	This is known as super-resolution .	However , even with perfectly efficient number-resolving detectors , the detection efficiency of all previously demonstrated methods to measure such interference decreases exponentially with the number of photons in the N00N state , often leading to the conclusion that N00N states are unsuitable for spatial measurements .	Here , we create spatial super-resolution fringes with two- , three- , and four-photon N00N states , and demonstrate a scalable implementation of the so-called `` optical centroid measurement '' which provides an in-principle perfect detection efficiency .	Moreover , we compare the N00N-state interference to the corresponding classical super-resolution interference .
3	Advances in SQUID and conventional magnetometery had led us to reconsider this type of experiment , which can be extended to searches and tests other than EDMs ( e.g. , test of Lorentz invariance ) .	In 1968 , F.L .	Shapiro published the suggestion that one could search for an electron EDM by applying a strong electric field to a substance that has an unpaired electron spin ; at low temperature , the EDM interaction would lead to a net sample magnetization that can be detected with a SQUID magnetometer .	One experimental EDM search based on this technique was published , and for a number of reasons including high sample conductivity , high operating temperature , and limited SQUID technology , the result was not particularly sensitive compared to other experiments in the late 1970 's .	In addition , the complementary measurement of an EDM-induced sample electric polarization due to application of a magnetic field to a paramagnetic sample might be effective using modern ultrasensitive charge measurement techniques .
4	Both the exponential distribution of lengths and the increase in the catastrophe frequency near the cell margin is in excellent agreement with recent experimental observations .	We study the steady state of an assembly of microtubules in a confined volume , analogous to the situation inside a cell where the cell boundary forms a natural barrier to growth .	We show that the dynamical equations for growing and shrinking microtubules predict the existence of two steady states , with either exponentially decaying or exponentially increasing distribution of microtubule lengths .	We identify the regimes in parameter space corresponding to these steady states .	In the latter case , the apparent catastrophe frequency near the boundary was found to be significantly larger than that in the interior .
3	High energy electron/positron particles up-scatter the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) photons into higher energies via the inverse-Compton scattering .	Assuming the dark matter is made entirely from neutralinos , we re-visit the role of their annihilation on the temperature of diffuse gas in the high redshift universe .	We consider neutralinos of particle mass 36 GeV and 100 GeV , respectively .	The former is able to produce ~7 electron/positron particles per annihilation through the fremionic channel , and the latter ~53 particles assuming a purely bosonic channel .	The process produces a power-law electron/positron energy spectrum of index -1 in the energy range of interest , independent of the initial energy distribution .
3	We also found that non-adiabatic pressure perturbations can be possibly generated .	A Lagrangian formulation of perfect fluid due to a non-canonical three-form field is investigated .	The thermodynamic quantities such as energy density , pressure and the four-velocity are obtained and then analyzed by comparing with the k-essence scalar field .	The non-relativistic matter due to the generalized three-form field with the equation of state parameter being zero is realized while it might not be possible for the k-essence scalar field .	The fluid dynamics of the perfect fluid due to the three-form field corresponds to the system in which the number of particles is not conserved .
3	3 ) For all $ k \geq 2 $ , $ GI \leq^ { l } _ { m } k-LVD_c $ .	We investigate the relative complexity of the graph isomorphism problem ( GI ) and problems related to the reconstruction of a graph from its vertex-deleted or edge-deleted subgraphs ( in particular , deck checking ( DC ) and legitimate deck ( LD ) problems ) .	We show that these problems are closely related for all amounts $ c \geq 1 $ of deletion : 1 ) $ GI \equiv^ { l } _ { iso } VDC_ { c } $ , $ GI \equiv^ { l } _ { iso } EDC_ { c } $ , $ GI \leq^ { l } _ { m } LVD_c $ , and $ GI \equiv^ { p } _ { iso } LED_c $ .	2 ) For all $ k \geq 2 $ , $ GI \equiv^ { p } _ { iso } k-VDC_c $ and $ GI \equiv^ { p } _ { iso } k-EDC_c $ .	4 ) $ GI \equiv^ { p } _ { iso } 2-LVC_c $ .
1	In both kind of experiments , helium-like and hydrogen-like spectral lines are used for plasma diagnostics .	In this work , the controversy between the interpretations of recent measurements on dense aluminum plasma created with Linac coherent light sources ( LCLS ) X-ray free electron laser ( FEL ) and Orion laser has been addressed .	However , there exist no precise theoretical calculations for He-like ions within dense plasma environment .	The strong need for an accurate theoretical estimates for spectral properties of He-like ions in strongly coupled plasma environment leads us to perform ab initio calculations in the framework of Rayleigh-Ritz variation principle in Hylleraas coordinates where ion-sphere potential is used .	An approach to resolve the long-drawn problem of numerical instability for evaluating two-electron integrals with extended basis inside a finite domain is presented here .
0	We study the gradient flow equation for the O ( N ) nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions at large N. We parameterize solution of the field at flow time t in powers of bare fields by introducing the coefficient function X_n for the n-th power term ( n=1,3 , ... ) .	Reducing the flow equation by keeping only the contributions at leading order in large N , we obtain a set of equations for X_n 's , which can be solved iteratively starting from n=1 .	For n=1 case , we find an explicit form of the exact solution .	Using this solution , we show that the two point function at finite flow time t is finite .	As an application , we obtain the non-perturbative running coupling defined from the energy density .
2	The density contrast in a slab of thickness of 20 Mpc/h and diameter of 80 Mpc/h aligned with the standard de Vaucouleurs ' Supergalactic coordinates , is delta_sgp =0.5 for both ORS and IRAS .	We re-examine the existence and extent of the planar structure in the local galaxy density field , the so-called Supergalactic Plane ( SGP ) .	This structure is studied here in three dimensions using both the new Optical Redshift Survey ( ORS ) and the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift survey .	The structure of the SGP is not well described by a homogeneous ellipsoid , although it does appear to be a flattened structure , which we quantify by calculating the moment of inertia tensor of the density field .	The directions of the principal axes vary with radius , but the minor axis remains within 30 deg of the standard SGP Z-axis , out to a radius of 80 Mpc/h , for both ORS and \iras .
2	We account for possible tidal stripping of the group galaxies by varying the fraction of total mass apportioned between the group dark matter halo and individual group galaxies .	Using new photometric and spectroscopic data in the fields of nine strong gravitational lenses that lie in galaxy groups , we analyze the effects of both the local group environment and line-of-sight galaxies on the lens potential .	We use Monte Carlo simulations to derive the shear directly from measurements of the complex lens environment , providing the first detailed independent check of the shear obtained from lens modeling .	The environment produces an average shear of gamma = 0.08 ( ranging from 0.02 to 0.17 ) , significant enough to affect quantities derived from lens observables .	However , the direction and magnitude of the shears do not match those obtained from lens modeling in three of the six 4-image systems in our sample ( B1422 , RXJ1131 , and WFI2033 ) .
3	We calculate the critical electron-boson coupling alpha_c as a function of $ U $ and show results for density-density correlation functions in the whole parameter space .	We investigate electron transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems with a coupling of the electronic degrees of freedom to a common bosonic bath .	The model allows to study many-particle effects and the influence of the local Coulomb interaction U between electrons on donor and acceptor sites .	Using the non-perturbative numerical renormalization group approach we find distinct differences between the electron transfer characteristics in the single- and two-particle subspaces .	The possibility of many-particle ( bipolaronic ) and Coulomb-assisted transfer is discussed .
2	As in the zero chemical potential case , we find that a quark-gluon plasma in thermodynamic equilibrium may contain stable bubbles of hadrons of radius $ R \simeq 1 $ fm .	We calculate the thermodynamic potential of bubbles of hadrons embedded in quark-gluon plasma , and of droplets of quark-gluon plasma embedded in hadron phase .	This is a generalization of our previous results to the case of non-zero chemical potentials .	The calculations are performed within the MIT Bag model , using an improved multiple reflection expansion .	The results are of relevance for neutron star phenomenology and for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .
4	Removing the contributions of the motion of the Sun and of the LSR to the measured proper motion yields a Galactic rest-frame proper motion of $ ( \mu_ { \alpha } ^ { Grf } , \mu_ { \delta } ^ { Grf } ) = ( 51.4\pm 6.3 , -18.7 \pm 6.3 ) $ mas century $ ^ { -1 } $ and $ ( \mu_ { \ell } ^ { Grf } , \mu_ { b } ^ { Grf } ) = ( -21.8\pm 6.3 , -50.1 \pm 6.3 ) $ mas century $ ^ { -1 } $ .	We have measured the proper motion of the Draco dwarf galaxy using images at two epochs with a time baseline of about two years taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Advanced Camera for Surveys .	Wide Field Channel 1 and 2 provide two adjacent fields , each containing a known QSO .	The zero point for the proper motion is determined using both background galaxies and the QSOs and the two methods produce consistent measurements within each field .	Averaging the results from the two fields gives a proper motion in the equatorial coordinate system of $ ( \mu_ { \alpha } , \mu_ { \delta } ) = ( 17.7\pm 6.3 , -22.1 \pm 6.3 ) $ mas century $ ^ { -1 } $ and in the Galactic coordinate system of $ ( \mu_ { \ell } , \mu_ { b } ) = ( -23.1\pm 6.3 , -16.3 \pm 6.3 ) $ mas century $ ^ { -1 } $ .
4	For other MSP in the Galactic field where the spectral index of the non-pulsed component has been measured ( i.e. , PSR B1937+21 , J0218+4232 ) the contribution of the pulsar wind to the non-pulsed X-ray luminosity is estimated .	The non-thermal , non-pulsed X-ray emission of MSPs is investigated .	As in young pulsars , MSPs emit a relativistic wind , which interacting with the interstellar medium and/or a binary companion can significantly contribute to the non-pulsed emission of these pulsars .	An application and extension of a simple model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old recycled MSP B1957+20 .	It is found that the pulsar wind can , indeed , contribute to both the resolved and unresolved X-ray emission .
0	Given a point z in P^1 , let F ( z ) be the osculating flag to the rational normal curve at point z .	The study of Schubert problems with respect to such flags F ( z_1 ) , F ( z_2 ) , ... , F ( z_r ) has been studied both classically and recently , especially when the points z_i are real .	Since the rational normal curve has an action of PGL_2 , it is natural to consider the points ( z_1 , ... , z_r ) as living in the moduli space of r distinct point in P^1 -- the famous M_ { 0 , r } .	One can then ask to extend the results on Schubert intersections to the compactification \bar { M } _ { 0 , r } .	The first part of this paper achieves this goal .
0	Previous studies have found that coronal loops have a nearly uniform thickness , which seems to disagree with the characteristic expansion of active region magnetic fields .	This is one of the most intriguing enigmas in solar physics .	We here report on the first comprehensive one-to-one comparison of observed loops with corresponding magnetic flux tubes obtained from cotemporal magnetic field extrapolation models .	We use EUV images from TRACE , magnetograms from the MDI instrument on SOHO , and linear force-free field extrapolations .	For each loop , we find the particular value of the force-free parameter ( alpha ) that best matches the observed loop axis and then construct flux tubes using different assumed cross sections at one footpoint ( circle and ellipses with different orientations ) .
3	The relation between the theories with and without such redundant operators is established in the low-energy expansion .	In a Wilsonian renormalization group ( RG ) analysis , redundant operators , which may be eliminated by using field redefinitions , emerge naturally .	It is therefore important to include them .	We consider a nonrelativisitic effective theory ( the so-called `` pionless '' Nuclear Effective Field Theory ) as a concrete example and show that the off-shell amplitudes can not be renormalized if the redundant operators are not included .	We perform a Wilsonian RG analysis for the \textit { off-shell } scattering amplitude in the theory with the redundant operator .
1	We derive fits for the DM density , velocity dispersion and velocity anisotropy .	Using high-resolution non-radiative hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters we obtain simple analytic formulae for DM and gas distribution in the spherical approximation .	We use these models to test the dynamical equilibrium hypothesis through the Jeans equation : we find that this is satisfied to good accuracy .	This result show that our fits constitute a self-consistent dynamical model .	We then extend our analysis to the gas , studying its density , temperature and velocity structure , with no further hypothesis on the dynamical status or state equation .
4	For one dimensional uniform data , we provide the asymptotic distribution of the relative density of the central similarity PCDs for the entire ranges of centrality and expansion parameters .	We consider the distribution of a graph invariant of central similarity proximity catch digraphs ( PCDs ) based on one dimensional data .	The central similarity PCDs are also a special type of parameterized random digraph family defined with two parameters , a centrality parameter and an expansion parameter , and for one dimensional data , central similarity PCDs can also be viewed as a type of interval catch digraphs .	The graph invariant we consider is the relative density of central similarity PCDs .	We prove that relative density of central similarity PCDs is a U-statistic and obtain the asymptotic normality under mild regularity conditions using the central limit theory of U-statistics .
4	This sequence of the phases is homomorphic as that in the three-dimensional generalized six-state clock model which have the same symmetry of the STAFI model .	We study the ordered phases and the phase transitions in the stacked triangular antiferromagnetic Ising ( STAFI ) model with strong interplane coupling modeling CsCoCl $ _3 $ and CsCoBr $ _3 $ .	We find that there exists an intermediate phase which consists of a single phase of so-called partial disordered ( PD ) type , and confirm the stability of this phase .	The low temperature phase of this model is so-called two-sublattice ferri magnetic phase .	The phase transition between the PD phase and two-sublattice ferri magnetic phase is of the first order .
3	We show how an effective Hamiltonian which contains both the RKKY coupling and the Kondo interaction can be written after high energy degrees of freedom away from the Fermi surface are traced out .	In this paper we review the current experimental and theoretical situation of the description of non-Fermi liquid behavior ( NFL ) in U and Ce intermetallics .	We focus on the magnetic and thermodynamic properties .	We also discuss a recent theoretical interpretation of this behavior in terms of Griffiths-McCoy singularities close to the magnetic quantum critical point ( QCP ) .	We argue that dissipation due to particle-hole excitations close to the Fermi surface is a relevant perturbation at low temperatures and we estimate the crossover temperature T^* above which power law behavior in specific heat and magnetic response occurs ( $ C_V/T \sim \chi ( T ) \propto T^ { -1+\lambda } $ with $ \lambda & lt ; 1 $ ) .
1	Strong stellar feedback , in the form of galactic winds , is expected to play an important role in the evolution of these regions .	We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in order to analyze galaxy evolution at redshifts z~6-12 in highly-overdense 5 sigma density peaks .	We investigate the effects of these winds by comparing different galactic outflow prescriptions , including ( i ) a constant velocity model ( CW ) , ( ii ) a variable velocity model scaling with galaxy properties ( VW ) , and ( iii ) a model with no outflows ( NW ) .	The CW model is also applied to a simulation of an average density region to study the impact of environment on galaxy evolution .	A direct consequence of the overdensity is a shallow galaxy mass function slope at the low-mass end and an accelerated evolution of dark matter and baryonic structures .
2	At present , 161 of them have individual distance estimates .	We explore the structure and kinematics of a dispersed filament of galaxies residing between the Local Void and the Virgo cluster .	For such purpose , we consider a sample of 361 galaxies with radial velocities $ V_ { LG } & lt ; 2000 $ km/s inside the sky area of RA = [ 13.0 ... 18.0 ] $ ^h $ and Dec. = [ $ - $ 5 ... $ + $ 10 ] $ ^\circ $ .	The galaxy distribution on peculiar velocities along the strip exhibits the known Virgo-centric infall at RA & lt ; 14 $ ^h $ and some signs of outflow from the Local Void at RA & gt ; 17 $ ^h $ .	Majority of the Bootes strip galaxies ( 56 % ) belong to 13 groups and 11 pairs , with the most prominent group around NGC5846 .
1	On the way we prove various ( old and new ) facts about knots .	This paper has two-fold goal : it provides gentle introduction to Knot Theory starting from 3-coloring , the concept introduced by R. Fox to allow undergraduate students to see that the trefoil knot is non-trivial , and ending with statistical mechanics .	We relate Fox 3-colorings to Jones and Kauffman polynomials of links and we use this connection to sketch the method of approximating the unknotting number of a knot .	We discuss some elementary open problems in knot theory and show that Fox colorings can be useful in trying to solve them .	Finally we demonstrate how analysis of Fox colorings can lead us to understand homology and the fundamental group of branched coverings along links .
1	The average shift of Leo I stars with respect to ~100 background galaxies implies a proper motion of ( mu_W , mu_N ) = ( 0.1140 +/- 0.0295 , -0.1256 +/- 0.0293 ) mas/yr .	We present the first absolute proper motion measurement of Leo I , based on two epochs of HST ACS/WFC images separated by ~5 years .	The implied Galactocentric velocity vector , corrected for the reflex motion of the Sun , has radial and tangential components V_rad = 167.9 +/- 2.8 km/s and V_tan = 101.0 +/- 34.4 km/s , respectively .	We study the detailed orbital history of Leo I by solving its equations of motion backward in time for a range of plausible mass models for the Milky Way and its surrounding galaxies .	Leo I entered the Milky Way virial radius 2.33 +/- 0.21 Gyr ago , most likely on its first infall .
0	In a previous work we showed that large nongaussianities and nonscale-invariant distortions in the CMB power spectrum can be generated in hybrid inflation models , due to the contributions of the tachyon ( waterfall ) field to the second order curvature perturbation .	Here we clarify , correct , and extend those results .	We show that large nongaussianity occurs only when the tachyon remains light throughout inflation , whereas n=4 contamination to the spectrum is the dominant effect when the tachyon is heavy .	We find constraints on the parameters of warped-throat brane-antibrane inflation from nongaussianity .	For F-term and D-term inflation models from supergravity , we obtain nontrivial constraints from the spectral distortion effect .
2	Rules to change the hands are self-organized in a society through evolution .	A non-zero-sum 3-person coalition game is presented , to study the evolution of complexity and diversity in cooperation , where the population dynamics of players with strategies is given according to their scores in the iterated game and mutations .	Two types of differentiations emerge initially ; biased one to classes and temporal one to change their roles for coalition .	The co-evolution of diversity and complexity of strategies and interactions ( or communications ) are found at later stages of the simulation .	Relevance of our results to the biological society is briefly discussed .
4	Analytic relationships were obtained for the phase transition temperatures and for elastic modulus changes through the phase transitions .	The Landau theory was applied to treat the phase diagrams for a multiferroic with two second order phase transitions taking into account the coupling of the primary order parameters with strain .	Two order parameters are coupled biquadratically which corresponds to the magnetoelectric materials .	The coupling with strain is assumed to be linear in strain and quadratic in order parameters .	Three ordered phases are discussed .
0	The superconductivity in high temperature superconductors ordinarily arises when doped with hetero-valent ions that introduce charge carriers .	However , in ferropnictides , `` iso-valent '' doping , which is generally believed not to introduce charge carriers , can induce superconductivity as well .	Moreover , unlike other ferropnictides , the superconducting gap in BaFe2 ( As1-xPx ) 2 has been found to contain nodal lines .	The exact nature of the `` iso-valent '' doping and nodal gap here are key open issues in building a comprehensive picture of the iron-based high temperature superconductors .	With angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( ARPES ) , we found that the phosphor substitution in BaFe2 ( As1-xPx ) 2 induces sizable amount of holes into the hole Fermi surfaces , while the dxy-originated band is relatively intact .
0	In this paper , the holographic dark energy model with new infrared cut-off proposed by Granda and Oliveros has been investigated in spatially non flat universe .	The dependency of the evolution of equation of state , deceleration parameter and cosmological evolution of Hubble parameter on the parameters of new HDE model are calculated .	Also , the statefinder parameters $ r $ and $ s $ in this model are derived and the evolutionary trajectories in $ s-r $ plane are plotted .	We show that the evolutionary trajectories are dependent on the model parameters of new HDE model .	Eventually , in the light of SNe+BAO+OHD+CMB observational data , we plot the evolutionary trajectories in $ s-r $ and $ q-r $ planes for best fit values of the parameters of new HDE model .
2	The theory with both Z2 vortices and monopoles and SO ( 3 ) -Z2 monopoles eliminated is simulated in the strong coupling ( $ \beta = 0 $ ) limit on lattices up to $ 60^4 $ .	Further evidence is presented for the existence of a non-confining phase at weak coupling in SU ( 2 ) lattice gauge theory .	Using Monte Carlo simulations with the standard Wilson action , gauge-invariant SO ( 3 ) -Z2 monopoles , which are strong-coupling lattice artifacts , have been seen to undergo a percolation transition exactly at the phase transition previously seen using Coulomb-gauge methods , with an infinite lattice critical point near $ \beta = 3.2 $ .	Here , as in the high- $ \beta $ phase of the Wilson action theory , finite size scaling shows it spontaneously breaks the remnant symmetry left over after Coulomb gauge fixing .	Such a symmetry breaking precludes the potential from having a linear term .
4	For longer junctions a numerical analysis is carried out after the derivation of the appropriate motion equation for the Josephson phase .	The physics of Josephson tunnel junctions drastically depends on their geometrical configurations and here we show that also tiny geometrical details play a determinant role .	More specifically , we develop the theory of short and long confocal annular Josephson tunnel junctions in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field of arbitrary orientations .	The behavior of a circular annular Josephson tunnel junction is then seen to be simply a special case of the above result .	For junctions having a normalized perimeter less than one the threshold curves are derived and computed even in the case with trapped Josephson vortices .
0	We consider finite energy and $ L^2 $ differential forms associated with strongly local regular Dirichlet forms on compact connected topologically one-dimensional spaces .	We introduce notions of local exactness and local harmonicity and prove the Hodge decomposition , which in our context says that the orthogonal complement to the space of all exact 1-forms coincides with the closed span of all locally harmonic 1-forms .	Then we introduce a related Hodge Laplacian and define a notion harmonicity for finite energy 1-forms .	As as corollary , under a certain capacity-separation assumption , we prove that the space of harmonic 1-forms is nontrivial if and only if the classical \v { C } ech cohomology is nontrivial .	In the examples of classical self-similar fractals these spaces typically are either trivial or infinitely dimensional .
4	This signature is unique in the sense that it does not depend on a measurement of the value of the equation of state of dark energy .	I discuss the work of Maor and Lahav [ 1 ] , in which the inclusion of dark energy into the spherical collapse formalism is reviewed .	Adopting a phenomenological approach , I consider the consequences of - a ) allowing the dark energy to cluster , and , b ) including the dark energy in the virialization process .	Both of these issues affect the final state of the system in a fundamental way .	The results suggest a potentially differentiating signature between a true cosmological constant and a dynamic form of dark energy .
4	The relevant parameters of the loop were matched to the observations where possible .	We investigate the temporal evolution of magnetic flux emerging within a granule in the quiet-Sun internetwork at disk center .	We combined IR spectropolarimetry performed in two Fe I lines at 1565 nm with speckle-reconstructed G-band imaging .	We determined the magnetic field parameters by a LTE inversion of the full Stokes vector using the SIR code , and followed their evolution in time .	To interpret the observations , we created a geometrical model of a rising loop in 3D .
1	Using the method , we investigate theoretically quantum pumping driven by a series of time-periodic potentials in graphene monolayer both in the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes .	We applied the Floquet scattering-matrix formalism to studying the electronic transport properties in a mesoscopic Dirac system .	Our numerical results demonstrate that adding harmonic modulated potentials can break the time reversal symmetry when no voltage bias is applied to the graphene monolayer .	Thus , when the system is pumped with proper dynamic parameters , these scatterers can produce a nonzero dc pumped current .	We also find that the transmission is anisotropic as the incident angle is changed .
1	We report results of the first computer simulation studies of physically adsorbed hydrocarbons on a quasicrystalline surface : methane , propane , and benzene on decagonal Al-Ni-Co .	Lubricants can affect quasicrystalline coatings surfaces by modifying commensurability of the interfaces .	The grand canonical Monte Carlo method is employed , using novel Embedded Atom Method potentials generated from it ab initio calculations , and standard hydrocarbon interactions .	The resulting adsorption isotherms and calculated structures show the films ' evolution from submonolayer to condensation .	We discover the presence and absence of the 5- to 6-fold topological transition , for benzene and methane , respectively , in agreement with a previsouly formulated phenomenological rule based on adsorbate-substrate size mismatch .
2	Physical time evolution requires the latter symmetry to be broken .	We present a suggestion on the interpretation of canonical time evolution when gravitation is present , based on the nonlinear gauge approach to gravity .	Essentially , our proposal consists of an internal-time concept , with the time variable taken from the dynamical fields characteristic of the nonlinear realization of the internal time-translational symmetry .	After disregarding other breaking mechanisms , we appeal to the Jordan-Brans-Dicke action , conveniently interpreted , to achieve that goal .	We show that nontrivial time evolution follows , the special relativistic limit being recovered in the absence of gravity .
2	We justify this mechanism by the following novel strategy based on inflation of spectrum by the nonlinearity .	The long-time asymptotics is analyzed for all finite energy solutions to a model U ( 1 ) -invariant nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in one dimension , with the nonlinearity concentrated at a single point : each finite energy solution converges as time goes to plus or minus infinity to the set of all `` nonlinear eigenfunctions '' of the form $ \psi ( x ) e\sp { -i\omega t } $ .	The global attraction is caused by the nonlinear energy transfer from lower harmonics to the continuous spectrum and subsequent dispersive radiation .	We show that any omega-limit trajectory has the time-spectrum in the spectral gap [ -m , m ] and satisfies the original equation .	This equation implies the key spectral inclusion for spectrum of the nonlinear term .
4	Furthermore the Weyl group admits a natural ordering in terms of L ( T ) , the number of reflections with respect to the simple roots and the direction of time flows is always towards increasing L ( T ) , which plays the unexpected role of an entropy .	In this paper we show that all supergravity billiards corresponding to sigma-models on any U/H non compact-symmetric space and obtained by compactifying supergravity to D=3 are fully integrable .	The key point in establishing the integration algorithm is provided by an upper triangular embedding of the solvable Lie algebra associated with U/H into SL ( N , R ) which always exists .	In this context we establish a remarkable relation between the arrow of time and the properties of the Weyl group .	The asymptotic states of the developing Universe are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the Weyl group which is a property of the Tits Satake universality classes and not of their single representatives .
0	Let $ G_ { M } ^ { + } $ be the Artin monoid of finite type generated by the letters $ a_i , i\in I $ with respect to a Coxeter matrix $ M $ that is equipped with the degree map $ \deg\ !	: \ ! G_ { M } ^ { + } \to\ ! \Z_ { \ge0 } $ defined by assigning to each equivalence class of words the length of the words , and let $ N_ { M , \deg } ( t ) \ !	: =\ ! \ ! \sum_ { J \subset I } ( -1 ) ^ { \ # J } t^ { \deg ( \Delta_ { J } ) } $ be the skew-growth function , where the summation index $ J $ runs over all subsets of $ I $ and $ \Delta_ { J } $ is the fundamental element in $ G_ { M } ^ { + } $ associated to the set $ J $ .	In this article , we will calculate the derivative at $ t = 1 $ of the polynomial $ N_ { M , \deg } ( t ) $ .	As a result , we show that the polynomial $ N_ { M , \deg } ( t ) $ has a simple root at $ t = 1 $ .
2	Series-parallelisation adds precedence constraints to an activity network , usually increasing its makespan ( execution time ) .	We use activity networks ( task graphs ) to model parallel programs and consider series-parallel extensions of these networks .	Our motivation is two-fold : the benefits of series-parallel activity networks and the modelling of programming constructs , such as those imposed by current parallel computing environments .	The slowdown ratio describes how additional constraints affect the makespan .	We disprove an existing conjecture positing a bound of two on the slowdown when workload is not considered .
3	In addition , optical tracking of individual contacts provides the in-plane deformations of the tangentially loaded interface , yielding the shear force distribution .	We report on the multi-contact frictional dynamics of model elastomer surfaces rubbed against bare glass slides .	The surfaces consist of layers patterned with thousands spherical caps ( radius of curvature 100 $ \mu $ m ) distributed both spatially and in height , regularly or randomly .	Use of spherical asperities yields circular micro-contacts whose radius is a direct measure of the contact pressure distribution .	We then investigate the stick-slip frictional dynamics of a regular hexagonal array .
0	We study a rapidly rotating gas of unpolarized spin-1/2 ultracold fermions in the two-dimensional regime when all atoms reside in the lowest Landau level .	Due to the presence of the spin degree of freedom both s-wave and p-wave interactions are allowed at ultralow temperatures .	We investigate the phase diagram of this system as a function of the filling factor in the lowest Landau level and in terms of the ratio between s- and p-wave interaction strengths .	We show that the presence of attractive interactions induces a wide regime of phase separation with formation of maximally compact droplets that are either fully polarized or composed of spin-singlets .	In the regime with no phase separation , we give evidence for fractional quantum Hall states .
2	Although GLP ( \Lambda ) has no Kripke models , Ignatiev showed that indeed one can construct a Kripke model of the variable-free fragment with natural number modalities .	For any ordinal \Lambda , we can define a polymodal logic GLP ( \Lambda ) , with a modality [ \xi ] for each \xi & lt ; \Lambda .	These represent provability predicates of increasing strength .	Later , Icard defined a topological model for the same fragment which is very closely related to Ignatiev 's .	In this paper we show how to extend these constructions for arbitrary \Lambda .
0	We have monitored twelve T dwarfs with the Kitt Peak 2.1m telescope using an f814w filter ( 0.7-0.95 microns ) to place in context the remarkable 10-20 % variability exhibited by the nearby T dwarf Luhman 16B in this wavelength regime .	The motivation was the poorly known red optical behavior of T dwarfs , which have been monitored almost exclusively at infrared wavelengths , where variability amplitudes greater than 10 % have been found to be very rare .	We detect highly significant variability in two T dwarfs .	The T2.5 dwarf 2MASS 13243559+6358284 shows consistent ~17 % variability on two consecutive nights .	The T2 dwarf 2MASS J16291840+0335371 exhibits ~10 % variability that may evolve from night to night , similarly to Luhman 16B .
0	A classical condition for fast learning rates is the margin condition , first introduced by Mammen and Tsybakov .	We tackle in this paper the problem of adaptivity to this condition in the context of model selection , in a general learning framework .	Actually , we consider a weaker version of this condition that allows one to take into account that learning within a small model can be much easier than within a large one .	Requiring this `` strong margin adaptivity '' makes the model selection problem more challenging .	We first prove , in a general framework , that some penalization procedures ( including local Rademacher complexities ) exhibit this adaptivity when the models are nested .
2	To investigate the cause of this , the influence of social interactions and advertisements are studied in an agent-based model of consumers in a social network .	Empirical data of supermarket sales show stylised facts that are similar to stock markets , with a broad ( truncated ) Levy distribution of weekly sales differences in the baseline sales [ R.D .	Groot , Physica A 353 ( 2005 ) 501 ] .	The influence of network topology was varied by using a small-world network , a random network and a Barabasi-Albert network .	The degree to which consumers value the opinion of their peers was also varied .
1	If R is local , and socle ( R ) is central in R , we show that length ( M/J ( R ) M ) +length ( socle ( M ) ) $ \leq $ length ( socle ( R ) ) +1 , strengthening a result of T. Gulliksen .	Let R be a left Artinian ring , and M a faithful left R-module which is minimal , in the sense that no proper submodule or proper homomorphic image of M is faithful .	Most of the rest of the paper is devoted to the situation where the Artinian ring R is not necessarily local , and does not necessarily have central socle .	In the case where R is a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field , we get an inequality similar to the above , with the length of socle ( R ) interpreted as its length as a bimodule , and with the final summand +1 replaced by the Euler characteristic of a bipartite graph determined by the structure of socle ( R ) .	More generally , that inequality holds if , rather than assuming k algebraically closed , we assume that R/J ( R ) is a direct product of full matrix algebras over k , and exclude the case where k has small finite cardinality .
2	For seesaw II we concentrate on the likely scenario where the new scalars decay to two leptons .	We investigate the LHC discovery potential for electroweak scale heavy neutrino singlets ( seesaw I ) , scalar triplets ( seesaw II ) and fermion triplets ( seesaw III ) .	For seesaw I we consider a heavy Majorana neutrino coupling to the electron or muon .	For seesaw III we restrict ourselves to heavy Majorana fermion triplets decaying to light leptons plus gauge or Higgs bosons , which are dominant except for unnaturally small mixings .	The possible signals are classified in terms of the charged lepton multiplicity , studying nine different final states ranging from one to six charged leptons .
3	Analytical and numerical results are given in the Collins-Soper and in the Gottfried-Jackson frame .	The polar and azimuthal angular distributions for the lepton pair arising from the decay of a J/psi meson produced at transverse momentum p_T balanced by a photon [ or gluon ] in hadronic collisions are calculated in the color singlet model ( CSM ) .	It is shown that the general structure of the decay lepton distribution is controlled by four invariant structure functions , which are functions of the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the J/psi .	We found that two of these structure functions [ the longitudinal and transverse interference structure functions ] are identical in the CSM .	We present a Monte Carlo study of the effect of acceptance cuts applied to the leptons and the photon for J/psi+ gamma production at the Tevatron .
3	In this case the indirect exchange between the adatoms mediated by the 2D carriers appears to be substantially enhanced compared to the results known from Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida ( RKKY ) theory .	We present a theoretical study of indirect exchange interaction between magnetic adatoms in graphene .	The coupling between the adatoms to a graphene sheet is described in the framework of tunneling Hamiltonian .	We account for the possibility of this coupling being of resonant character if a bound state of the adatom effectively interacts with the continuum of 2D delocalized states in graphene .	Moreover , unlike the results of RKKY calculations in the case of resonant exchange the magnetic coupling between the adatoms sitting over different graphene sublattices do not cancel each other .
4	Although we neglect the rotational degrees of freedom of the colloids , and employ a very simple coupling between the colloids and the flow field , we can reproduce the experimental data and partly explain why it differs from theory .	Particles that are immersed in a fluid exchange momentum via the fluid , hence their Brownian motion is correlated .	By means of multiparticle-collision dynamics simulations we study the interactions between two colloidal beads in a sheared fluid suspension .	Recently , this topic has been addressed in experiments on colloidal particles trapped by optical tweezers in a microfluidic device [ PRL , 103 , 230602 ( 2009 ) ] and theoretically by means of a Langevin model [ Eur.Phys .	J E , 33 , 313 ( 2010 ) ] .
3	Known techniques no longer guarantee the correctness of the output in the presence of such correlations .	Linear sketches are powerful algorithmic tools that turn an n-dimensional input into a concise lower-dimensional representation via a linear transformation .	Such sketches have seen a wide range of applications including norm estimation over data streams , compressed sensing , and distributed computing .	In almost any realistic setting , however , a linear sketch faces the possibility that its inputs are correlated with previous evaluations of the sketch .	We therefore ask : Are linear sketches inherently non-robust to adaptively chosen inputs ?
2	Fitting with unitarity phase phi_3 as a fit parameter gives phi_3 ~ 96 degree , the CP asymmetries A_ { pi pi } , S_ { pi pi } agree better with BaBar , and the sigma phase is slightly lower .	The current wealth of charmless B decay data may suggest the presence of final state rescattering .	In a factorized amplitude approach , better fits are found by incorporating two SU ( 3 ) rescattering phase differences , giving delta ~ 65 degree and sigma ~ 90 - 100 degree .	Keeping phi_3 = 60 degree fixed in fit gives S_ { pi pi } ~-0.9 , which agrees better with Belle .	With the sizable delta , sigma rescattering phases as fitted , many direct CP asymmetries flip sign , and B0 -- & gt ; pi0 pi0 , K- K+ rates are of order 10^ { -6 } , which can be tested soon .
3	Within the clusters , baryons are distributed among ( i ) a cold neutral phase , with a relative contribution that increases from less than 1 to 3 per cent at higher redshift , ( ii ) stars which contribute with about 20 per cent and ( iii ) the X-ray emitting plasma that contributes by 80 ( 76 ) per cent at z=0 ( 1 ) to the total baryonic budget .	( ABRIDGED ) We analyze the X-ray properties of a sample of local and high redshift galaxy clusters extracted from a large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation .	This simulation has been realized using the Tree+SPH code GADGET-2 for a LambdaCDM model .	In our analysis , we consider only objects with T_ew & gt ; 2 keV and adopt an approach that mimics observations , associating with each measurement an error comparable with recent observations and providing best-fit results via robust techniques .	A depletion of the cosmic baryon fraction of ~7 ( at z=0 ) and 5 ( at z=1 ) per cent is measured at the virial radius , R_vir , in good agreement with adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations .
4	For this purpose , we introduce three triton wave functions .	We focus on a characteristic non-alpha cluster structure in light neutron-rich nuclei ; three triton structure in 9Li .	This is an analogy to the case of three alpha state in 12C ( Hoyle state ) .	The alpha clusters behave as bosons .	however tritons have Fermionic nature , and how the three cluster structure is different from 12C is an intriguing problem .
0	Recent results on physics in the charm energy region are reviewed .	( 1 ) The new data and puzzles in exclusive hadronic decays of $ J/\psi $ and $ \psi ' $ give new challenges to the theory of hadronic decays .	( 2 ) With the new observation for $ \xi ( 2230 ) $ and $ f_0 ( 1500 ) $ in $ J/\psi $ radiative decays and other experiments , the situation in searching for glueballs is encouraging , but theoretical uncertainties related to the properties of glueballs still remain and need to be further reduced .	( 3 ) For the prompt production of charmonium at large transverse momentum , gluon and quark fragmentations dominate over leading-order parton fusions .	Color-singlet fragmentation is not the dominant mechanism for $ J/\psi $ and $ \psi ' $ production .
2	The magnetization reversal is a result of a field-induced antiferromagnetic coupling between the Ru- and Fe-magnetic sublattices that have different temperature dependence .	We report physical and structural properties of single-crystal Ca2Ru1-xFexO4 ( 0 & lt ; x & lt ; 0.20 ) as functions of temperature , magnetic field and pressure .	Ca2RuO4 is a structurally-driven Mott insulator with a metal-insulator ( MI ) transition at TMI = 357 K , which is well separated from antiferromagnetic order at TN = 110 K. Fe substitution for Ru in Ca2RuO4 causes a pronounced magnetization reversal and giant negative volume thermal expansion ( NVTE ) .	The NVTE is closely associated with the orthorhombic distortion , and becomes smaller as the orthorhombicity weakens due to either Fe doping or application of pressure .	The study highlights an intriguing interplay between lattice , orbital and spin degrees of freedom that is at the root of the novel phenomena in Ca2RuO4 .
4	Our results show that Bi2OS2 and LaOBiS2 are semiconductors containing direct band gaps of 0.8-1.0 eV , and they are suggested to be candidates for optoelectronic materials in the near-infrared region without highly toxic elements .	The band gaps of isostructural Bi2OS2 and LaOBiS2 were examined using optical absorption and discussed with the band structures calculated based on the crystal structures determined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction .	The Bi 6p and S 3p orbitals in the Bi-S plane were computationally predicted to constitute the bands near the Fermi level .	The optical reflectance spectra of Bi2OS2 and LaOBiS2 showed optical band gaps of ca .	1.0 eV , which were close to the computationally calculated direct band gaps of ca.0.8 eV .
1	In this work , we report a photoluminescence study of different samples of isotopically pure b-ZnS crystals , and crystals with the natural isotopic abundances , at 15 and 77 K. The derivatives of the free and bound exciton energies on isotopic mass have been obtained .	Zinc sulfide is a wide bandgap semiconductor which crystallizes in either the wurtzite modification ( a-ZnS ) , the zincblende modification ( b-ZnS ) or as one of several similar tetrahedrally coordinated polytypes .	They allow us to estimate the contribution of the zinc and sulfur vibrations to the bandgap renormalization energy by electron-phonon interaction .	A two-oscillator model based on the zinc and sulfur renormalization energies has been used to account for the temperature dependence of the bandgap energy in ZnS .	The results are compared with those found for other tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors .
1	Existing treatments of the problem were incorrect because they ignored the disturbance of measurement by identical particles and standard quantum mechanics had to be modified to obey the cluster separability principle .	In our previous work , a new approach to the notorious problem of quantum measurement was proposed .	The key tool was the notion of separation status .	Changes of separation status occur during preparations , registrations and scattering on macroscopic targets .	Standard quantum mechanics does not provide any correct rules that would govern these changes .
4	Also , the phase transition from a solid herringbone phase into an orientationally ordered intermediate phase is found to exhibit some differences as compared to a recent study of hexane monolayers , which may be interpreted as originating from the greater influence of gauche defects .	The melting transition in solid monolayers of a series of short-chained n-alkanes , n-octane ( n-C8H18 ) , n-decane ( n-C10H22 ) , and n-dodecane ( n-C12H26 ) physisorbed onto the graphite basal plane are studied through use of molecular dynamics simulations .	Utilizing previous experimental observations of the solid phase behavior of these monolayers , this study investigates the temperature dependence of the phases and phase transitions in these three monolayers during the solid-fluid phase transition , and compares the observed melting behavior to previous studies of hexane and butane monolayers .	In particular , this study seems to indicate a greater dependence of the melting transition on the formation of gauche defects in the alkyl chains as the chain length is increased .	In light of the previously proposed footprint reduction mechanism and variations where the formation of gauche defects are energetically negated , simulations seem to suggest that decane and dodecane monolayers are generally equally as dependent upon the formation of gauche defects for the melting transition to take place , whereas octane monolayers seem to have less dependence , but follow a trend that is established in previous studies of melting in butane and hexane monolayers .
4	In the second part we study the field-induced magnetic ordering in TlCuCl $ _3 $ on a quantitative level .	In the first part we discuss how the BEC picture for magnons is modified by anisotropies induced by spin-orbit coupling .	In particular we focus on the effects of antisymmetric spin interactions and/or a staggered component of the $ g $ ( gyromagnetic ) tensor .	Such terms lead to a gapped quasiparticle spectrum and a nonzero condensate density for all temperatures so that no phase transition occurs .	We contrast this to the effect of crystal field anisotropies which are also induced by spin-orbit coupling .
3	In the degenerate case , where the templates have the same replication rate , we find that a vanishingly small migration rate suffices to eliminate the segregation effect of random drift and so to promote coexistence .	The compartmentalization of distinct templates in protocells and the exchange of templates between them ( migration ) are key elements of a modern scenario for prebiotic evolution .	Here we use the diffusion approximation of population genetics to study analytically the steady-state properties of such prebiotic scenario .	The coexistence of distinct template types inside a protocell is achieved by a selective pressure at the protocell level ( group selection ) favoring protocells with a mixed template composition .	In the non-degenerate case , a small migration rate greatly boosts coexistence as compared with the situation where there is no migration .
4	Implications for adiabatic quantum computation is discussed .	The adiabatic theorem provides the basis for the adiabatic model of quantum computation .	Recently the conditions required for the adiabatic theorem to hold have become a subject of some controversy .	Here we show that the reported violations of the adiabatic theorem all arise from resonant transitions between energy levels .	In the absence of fast driven oscillations the traditional adiabatic theorem holds .
3	Gradual collapse , gradual purification , and quantum Zeno effect are naturally described by the equation .	We consider the continuous measurement of a double quantum dot by a weakly coupled detector ( tunnel point contact nearby ) .	While the conventional approach describes the gradual system decoherence due to the measurement , we study the situation when the detector output is explicitly recorded that leads to the opposite effect : gradual purification of the double-dot density matrix .	Nonlinear Langevin equation is derived for the random evolution of the density matrix which is reflected and caused by the stochastic detector output .	We also discuss the possible experiments to confirm the theory .
1	This is a system realizable with fermionic alkaline-earth-metal atoms such as $ ^ { 173 } $ Yb , which displays an exact SU ( $ \kappa $ ) spin symmetry with $ \kappa\geqslant2 $ and behaves like a spinless interacting Bose gas in the limit of infinite spin components $ \kappa\rightarrow\infty $ , namely high-spin bosonization .	We calculate the frequency of collective modes of a one-dimensional repulsively interacting Fermi gas with high-spin symmetry confined in harmonic traps at zero temperature .	We solve the homogeneous equation of state of the high-spin Fermi system by using Bethe ansatz technique and obtain the density distribution in harmonic traps based on local density approximation .	The frequency of collective modes is calculated by exactly solving the zero-temperature hydrodynamic equation .	In the limit of large number of spin-components , we show that the mode frequency of the system approaches to that of a one-dimensional spinless interacting Bose gas , as a result of high-spin bosonization .
2	On the other hand , their quantum capacity when combined with a zero private ( and zero quantum ) capacity erasure channel , becomes larger than the previous classical capacity .	Recently there has been considerable activity on the subject of additivity of various quantum channel capacities .	Here , we construct a family of channels with sharply bounded classical , hence private capacity .	As a consequence , we can conclude for the first time that the classical private capacity is non-additive .	In fact , in our construction even the quantum capacity of the tensor product of two channels can be greater than the sum of their individual classical private capacities .
0	We present a novel approach to accurate real-time estimation of wireless link quality using simple matched-filtering techniques .	Our approach is based on the simple observation that there is a portion of each packet transmission from any given node that does not change from one packet to another ; this includes preamble sequences used to synchronize the receiver and also address information in the packet header used for medium access control and routing .	Our approach can be thought of as a generalized and simplified variant of standard signal processing techniques that are commonly used for preamble detection , automatic gain control , carrier sensing and other functions in many packet wireless networks .	By using a combination of energy detection and correlation techniques , we show that we can effectively detect packet transmissions in real-time with low complexity , without decoding the packets themselves , and indeed , even without detailed knowledge of the packet format .	We present extensive experimental results from a software-defined radio testbed to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for 802.15.4 ( Zigbee ) networks even in the presence of strong interference signals and low SNR .
3	The critical interaction strength , which is necessary to induce the symmetry breaking in the latter approach is found in the static approximation to be $ \alpha _ { c } =e^ { 2 } / ( \epsilon v_ { F } ) \approx 1.05 $ without considering the Fermi velocity renormalization , and $ \alpha _ { c } =3.7 $ with accounting the renormailzation of the Fermi velocity .	In this paper we consider the possibility of chiral ( charge or spin density wave ) symmetry breaking in graphene due to long-range Coulomb interaction by comparing the results of the Bethe-Salpeter and functional renormalization-group approaches .	The former approach performs summation of ladder diagrams in the particle-hole channel , and reproduces the results of the Schwinger-Dyson approach for the critical interaction strength of the quantum phase transition .	The renormalization-group approach combines the effect of different channels and allows to study the role of vertex corrections .	The latter value is expected to be however reduced , when the dynamic screening effects are taken into account , yielding the critical interaction , which is comparable to the one in freely suspended graphene .
4	We also found evidences of the formation of a built-in potential in T6 / PDI8-CN2 and PDI8-CN2 / T6 interfaces , mainly from the T6 side .	We report on the study of the electronic properties in PDI8-CN2 / Au , PDI8-CN2 / Si , PDI8-CN2 - T6 interfaces investigated by X-Ray ( XPS ) and Ultraviolet ( UPS ) Photoemission Spectroscopy .	In order to verify the consistency with the results on field effect devices , heated substrates have been considered , while only in the case of PDI8-CN2 / Au interface also sputter-cleaned Au has been used as a reference .	We found a small interface dipole between PDI8-CN2 and sputter-cleaned Au , which reverses its sign as a consequence of the 'pillow effect ' due to the presence of the contamination layer in the heated substrates .	This result is in agreement with the transport measurements on PDI8-CN2 field effect transistors , which show an 'always on ' behavior .
1	Our design exploits the fact that full-duplex ( FD ) secondary users ( SUs ) can perform spectrum sensing and access simultaneously , and we employ the randomized dynamic channel selection for load balancing among channels and the standard backoff mechanism for contention resolution on each available channel .	In this paper , we propose a multi-channel full-duplex Medium Access Control ( MAC ) protocol for cognitive radio networks ( MFDC-MAC ) .	Then , we develop a mathematical model to analyze the throughput performance of the proposed MFDC-MAC protocol .	Furthermore , we study the protocol configuration optimization to maximize the network throughput where we show that this optimization can be performed in two steps , namely optimization of access and transmission parameters on each channel and optimization of channel selection probabilities of the users .	Such optimization aims at achieving efficient self-interference management for FD transceivers , sensing overhead control , and load balancing among the channels .
1	Such logic is particularly useful in probabilistic systems , where some undesirable events such as random failures may occur and are acceptable if they are rare enough .	We study frequency linear-time temporal logic ( fLTL ) which extends the linear-time temporal logic ( LTL ) with a path operator $ G^p $ expressing that on a path , certain formula holds with at least a given frequency p , thus relaxing the semantics of the usual G operator of LTL .	Frequency-related extensions of LTL have been previously studied by several authors , where mostly the logic is equipped with an extended `` until '' and `` globally '' operator , leading to undecidability of most interesting problems .	For the variant we study , we are able to establish fundamental decidability results .	We show that for Markov chains , the problem of computing the probability with which a given fLTL formula holds has the same complexity as the analogous problem for LTL .
0	In smart-metered systems , fine-grained power demand data ( load profile ) is communicated from a user to the utility provider .	The correlation of the load profile with a user 's private activities leaves open the possibility of inference attacks .	Using a rechargeable battery , the user can partially obscure its load profile and provide some protection to the private information using various battery charging policies .	Using the mutual information as the privacy metric we study a class of optimal battery charging policies .	When the power demand is a first-order Markov process , we propose a series of reductions on the optimization problem and ultimately recast it as a Markov decision process .
3	The disk parameters are reconstructed via a quantitative comparison of observational and theoretical intensity maps .	Observations of the circumstellar disk in the Bok globule CB 26 at 110 , 230 , and 270 GHz are presented together with the results of the simulations and estimates of the disk parameters .	These observations were obtained using the SMA , IRAM Plateau de Bure , and OVRO interferometers .	The maps have relatively high angular resolutions ( 0.4-1 '' ) , making it possible to study the spatial structure of the gas-dust disk .	The disk model used to construct the theoretical maps is based on the assumption of hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium in the vertical direction , while the radial surface density profile is described phenomenologically .
1	However , it is possible to have interactions located at only one of the two fixed points of the $ S_1/\ztwo $ orbifold .	The minimal Universal Extra Dimension ( mUED ) model respects the Kaluza-Klein ( KK ) parity $ ( -1 ) ^n $ , where $ n $ is the KK number .	Such asymmetric interactions violate the KK parity .	This kills the cold dark matter component of UED but also removes the upper bound on the inverse compactification radius , and thus non-observation of the KK excitations even at the Large Hadron Collider does not necessarily invalidate the model .	Apart from the decay of the lightest $ n=1 $ KK excitation , this leads to collider signals which are markedly different from those in the mUED scenario .
2	We are able to single out generic features such as singularity formation , isotropisation at particular values of the flow parameter and evolution characteristics .	We analyse Ricci flow ( normalised/un-normalised ) of product manifolds -- unwarped as well as warped , through a study of generic examples .	First , we investigate such flows for the unwarped scenario with manifolds of the type $ \mathbb S^n\times \mathbb S^m $ , $ \mathbb S^n\times \mathbb H^m $ , $ \mathbb H^m\times \mathbb H^n $ and also , similar multiple products .	Subsequently , motivated by warped braneworlds and extra dimensions , we look at Ricci flows of warped spacetimes .	Here , we are able to find analytic solutions for a special case by variable separation .
2	Calculating these rates relies on accurate bound-bound oscillator strengths , which can be cast in terms of the Gaunt factor .	Comparison of observations of radio recombination lines in the interstellar medium with theoretical models can be used to constrain electron temperature and density of the gas .	An important component of the models is spontaneous transition rates between bound levels .	The Gaunt factor contains terminating hypergeometric functions that can not be calculated with sufficient accuracy for high quantum levels ( $ n \gtrsim 50 $ ) by standard machine-precision methods .	Methods to overcome the accuracy problem have been developed , which include asymptotic expansions and recursion relations .
1	The relic density of neutralinos has been calculated using sophisticated routines for integrating the annihilation cross section and the Boltzmann equation .	Neutralino dark matter , and in particular different aspects of its detection at neutrino telescopes , has been studied within the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model , the MSSM .	As a new element , so called coannihilation processes between the lightest neutralino and the heavier neutralinos and charginos have also been included for any neutralino mass and composition .	The detection rates at neutrino telescopes have been evaluated for neutralino annihilation in both the Sun and the Earth using detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the whole chain of processes from the neutralino annihilation products in the core of the Sun or the Earth to detectable muons at a neutrino telescope .	A comparison with other searches for supersymmetry at accelerators and direct dark matter searches is also given .
4	Then the strong-weak semicontinuity ( respectively the subdifferentiability ) are studied in relation with the Ioffe 's criterion .	This article deals with the lower compactness property of a sequence of integrands and the use of this key notion in various domains : convergence theory , optimal control , non-smooth analysis .	First about the interchange of the weak epi-limit and the symbol of integration for a sequence of integral functionals .	These functionals are defined on a topological space $ ( \mathcal { X , T } ) $ where $ \mathcal { X } $ is a subset of measurable functions and the $ \mathcal { T } $ convergence is stronger than or equal to the convergence in the Bitting sense .	Given a sequence $ ( f_ { n } ) _n $ of integrands , if the integrand $ f $ is the weak lower sequential epi-limit of the integrands $ f_n $ one of the main results of this article asserts that under the Ioffe 's criterion , the $ \mathcal { T } $ -lower sequential epi-limit of the sequence of integral functionals at the point $ x $ is bounded below by the value of the integral functional associated to the Fenchel-Moreau-Rockafellar biconjugate of $ f $ at the point $ x $ .
3	However , in the second order it induces birefringence ; the nonbirefringence observations constrain the Type II skewon part to 10^ ( -19 ) .	After reviewing the construction of metric from premetric electrodynamics with empirical improvement of accuracy in the skewonless case , we explore the role of skewons in the construction of spacetime metric in the full premetric electrodynamics .	For metric principal part plus skewon part , we have shown that the Type I skewon part is constrained to & lt ; a few x 10^ ( -35 ) in the weak field/weak EEP violation limit .	Type II skewon part is not constrained in the first order .	Nevertheless , an additional nonmetric induced second-order contribution to the principal part constitutive tensor compensates the Type II skewon birefringence and makes it nonbirefringent .
0	We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the 1S0 NN scattering amplitude using an effective field theory ( EFT ) expansion .	The expansion we advocate is a modification of what has been used previously ; it is no a chiral expansion in powers of the pion mass .	We use dimensional regularization throughout and the MS-bar subtraction scheme ; our final result depends only on physical observables .	We show that the EFT expansion of the quantity |p|cot delta ( p ) converges at momenta much greater than the scale that characterizes the derivative expansion of the EFT Lagrangian .	Our conclusions are optimistic about the applicability of an EFT approach to the quantitative study of nuclear matter .
2	Moreover , it unifies two recent independent attempts towards a stochastic description of non-Markovian open systems , based on path integrals on the one hand and coherent states on the other .	We present the non-Markovian generalization of the widely used stochastic Schrodinger equation .	Our result allows to describe open quantum systems in terms of stochastic state vectors rather than density operators , without approximation .	The latter approach utilizes the analytical properties of coherent states and enables a microscopic interpretation of the stochastic states .	The alternative first approach is based on the general description of open systems using path integrals as originated by Feynman and Vernon .
0	One may consider three types of statistical inference : Bayesian , frequentist , and group invariance-based .	The focus here is on the last method .	We consider the Poisson and binomial distributions in detail to illustrate a group invariance method for constructing inferred distributions on parameter spaces given observed results .	These inferred distributions are obtained without using Bayes ' method and in particular without using a joint distribution of random variable and parameter .	In the Poisson and binomial cases , the final formulas for inferred distributions coincide with the formulas for Bayes posteriors with uniform priors .
2	The latest census of Chamaeleon I now contains 158 members , 8 of which are later than M6 and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs .	Optical spectroscopy has been obtained for 179 objects that have been previously identified as possible members of the cluster , that lack either accurate spectral types or clear evidence of membership , and that are optically visible ( I & lt ; 18 ) .	I have used these spectroscopic data and all other available constraints to evaluate the spectral classifications and membership status of a total sample of 288 candidate members of Chamaeleon I that have appeared in published studies of the cluster .	I find that many of the objects identified as members of Chamaeleon I in recent surveys are actually field stars .	Meanwhile , 7 of 9 candidates discovered by Carpenter and coworkers are confirmed as members , one of which is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I at a spectral type of M8 ( ~0.03 M_sun ) .
1	Under a background temperature beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime , we extend the standard cooling analysis by separately studying the classical motion and the quantum dynamics of the oscillator .	We study the laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator through the coupling with a dissipative three-level system .	In Ladder-system cooling , the cooling rate degrades by orders of magnitude at large classical motion .	This phenomenon causes a critical transition of the final temperature at a hot background .	In stark contrast , electromagnetic-induced-transparency ( EIT ) cooling with a $ \Lambda $ -system produces significant negative cooling rate at high motional excitation .
4	In App.B we show that a line is not just a collection of points and we will have to introduce one-dimensional line-intervals as fundamental geometric elements .	In this article we discuss a few aspects of the space-time description of fields and particles .	In sectionn II and III we demonstrate that fields are as fundamental as particles .	In section IV we discuss non-equivalence of the Schwarzschild coordinates and the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates .	In section V we discuss that it is not possible to define causal structure in discrete space-time manifolds .
1	We introduce Convex Analysis of Mixtures ( CAM ) for separating non-negative well-grounded sources , which learns the mixing matrix by identifying the lateral edges of the convex data scatter plot .	Blind Source Separation ( BSS ) has proven to be a powerful tool for the analysis of composite patterns in engineering and science .	We prove a sufficient and necessary condition for identifying the mixing matrix through edge detection , which also serves as the foundation for CAM to be applied not only to the exact-determined and over-determined cases , but also to the under-determined case .	We show the optimality of the edge detection strategy , even for cases where source well-groundedness is not strictly satisfied .	The CAM algorithm integrates plug-in noise filtering using sector-based clustering , an efficient geometric convex analysis scheme , and stability-based model order selection .
4	The analysis of the costs is confirmed by the numerical testing , where we show that surprisingly , for $ p $ large enough , the time required by the floating point operations is even less than the time spent in the unavoidable memory operations ( the sparse matrix allocation and memory write ) .	In this paper we propose an algorithm for the formation of matrices of isogeometric Galerkin methods .	The algorithm is based on a loop on the rows of the matrix and on the calculation of the row entries by weighted quadrature .	The test function is incorporated in the integration weight while the trial function , the geometry parametrization and the PDEs coefficients form the integrand function .	This approach is very effective in reducing the computational cost , while keeping the optimal order of approximation of the method .
2	We critically compare these theories and assess their accuracy against available photoabsorption and photoelectron spectroscopy data .	We investigate the accuracy of first-principles many-body theories at the nanoscale by comparing the low energy excitations of the carbon fullerenes C_20 , C_24 , C_50 , C_60 , C_70 , and C_80 with experiment .	Properties are calculated via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter Equation ( GW-BSE ) and diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo ( QMC ) methods .	The first ionization potentials are consistently well reproduced and are similar for all the fullerenes and methods studied .	The electron affinities and first triplet excitation energies show substantial method and geometry dependence .
0	Our poor understanding of the boundaries of convective cores generates large uncertainties on the extent of these cores and thus on stellar ages .	Our aim is to use asteroseismology to consistently measure the extent of convective cores in a sample of main-sequence stars whose masses lie around the mass-limit for having a convective core .	We first test and validate a seismic diagnostic that was proposed to probe in a model-dependent way the extent of convective cores using the so-called $ r_ { 010 } $ ratios , which are built with $ l=0 $ and $ l=1 $ modes .	We apply this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets to optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic .	For this purpose , we compute grids of stellar models with both the CESAM2k and MESA evolution codes , where the extensions of convective cores are modeled either by an instantaneous mixing or as a diffusion process .
4	Further we devise an alternative model to study the similar paradox .	Parrondo 's paradox is about a paradoxical game and gambling where two probabilistic losing games can be combined to form a winning game .	While the counter intuitive game is interesting in itself , it can be thought of a discrete version of Brownian flashing ratchet which are employed to understand noise induced order .	There are plenty of examples from physics to biology and social sciences where the stochastic thermal fluctuations actually help achieving positive movements .	In our study , we study various combinations of losing games in order to understand how and how far the losing combinations result in winning .
4	Similar treatment is given for Maxwell equations in hyperbolic Lobachevsky model , the complete basis of electromagnetic solutions in corresponding cylindrical coordinates has been constructed as well , no quantization of frequencies of electromagnetic modes arises .	Complex formalism of Riemann - Silberstein - Majorana - Oppenheimer in Maxwell electrodynamics is extended to the case of arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian space - time in accordance with the tetrad recipe of Tetrode - Weyl - Fock - Ivanenko .	In this approach , the Maxwell equations are solved exactly on the background of static cosmological Einstein model , parameterized by special cylindrical coordinates and realized as a Riemann space of constant positive curvature .	A discrete frequency spectrum for electromagnetic modes depending on the curvature radius of space and three parameters is found , and corresponding basis electromagnetic solutions have been constructed explicitly .	In the case of elliptical model a part of the constructed solutions should be rejected by continuity considerations .
2	The BEST is a small aperture telescope with a wide field of view ( FOV ) .	In this paper , we report on observations of the CoRoT LRa1 field with the Berlin Exoplanet Search Telescope ( BEST ) .	The current paper is part of a series of papers describing the results of our stellar variability survey .	It is dedicated to searching for stellar variability within the target fields of the CoRoT space mission to aid in minimizing false-alarm rates and identify potential targets for additional science .	The LRa1 field is CoRoT 's second long run field located in the galactic anticenter direction .
3	The theorem states that $ Q_ { t_0 , t_1 } ... Q_ { t_ { n-1 } , t_n } $ converges to an evolution family $ U ( s , t ) $ solving a non-autonomous Cauchy problem .	A generalized version of Chernoff 's theorem has been obtained .	Namely , the version of Chernoff 's theorem for semigroups obtained in a paper by Smolyanov , Weizsaecker , and Wittich is generalized for a time-inhomogeneous case .	The main theorem obtained in the current paper , Chernoff 's theorem for evolution families , deals with a family of time-dependent generators of semigroups $ A_t $ on a Banach space , a two-parameter family of operators $ Q_ { t , t+\Delta t } $ satisfying the relation : $ \frac { \partial } { \partial \Delta t } Q_ { t , t+\Delta t } |_ { \Delta t = 0 } =A_t $ , whose products $ Q_ { t_i , t_ { i+1 } } ... Q_ { t_ { k-1 } , t_k } $ are uniformly bounded for all subpartitions $ s = t_0 & lt ; t_1 & lt ; & gt ; ... & lt ; t_n = t $ .	Furthermore , the theorem is formulated for a particular case when the generators $ A_t $ are time dependent second order differential operators .
0	After 33 years of extensive studies of SS 433 , we have learnt much about this unique system with moving emission lines in the spectrum .	The orbital inclination is known from spectroscopic observations of moving lines ; the distance is derived from radio interferometry of relativistic jets ; the mass ratio of its components is determined from X-ray observations of jets ' eclipses .	In 2005 , the accretion donor was detected as an A4 - A8 giant , and its contribution to eclipse light was measured spectroscopically .	In the present paper , the A-type star was detected via multicolor photometry on the basis of its Balmer jump .	A method is proposed to estimate the interstellar reddening , able to measure the individual law of interstellar absorption for SS 433 from spectrophotometry .
1	We present several translations between formal argumentation frameworks and nonmonotonic logics for reasoning with plausible assumptions .	In this paper we make a contribution to the unification of formal models of defeasible reasoning .	More specifically , we translate adaptive logics into assumption-based argumentation and ASPIC+ , ASPIC+ into assumption-based argumentation and a fragment of assumption-based argumentation into adaptive logics .	Adaptive logics are closely related to Makinson 's default assumptions and to a significant class of systems within the tradition of preferential semantics in the vein of KLM and Shoham .	Thus , our results also provide close links between formal argumentation and the latter approaches .
0	Let s_q ( n ) denote the base q sum of digits function , which for n & lt ; x , is centered around ( q-1 ) /2 log_q x .	In Drmota , Mauduit and Rivat 's 2009 paper , they look at sum of digits of prime numbers , and provide asymptotics for the size of the set { p & lt ; x , p prime : s_q ( p ) =alpha ( q-1 ) log_q x } where alpha lies in a tight range around 1/2 .	In this paper , we examine the tails of this distribution , and provide the lower bound | { p & lt ; x , p prime : s_q ( p ) & gt ; alpha ( q-1 ) log_q x } | & gt ; & gt ; x^ { 2 ( 1-alpha ) } e^ { -c ( log x ) ^ { 1/2+epsilon } } for 1/2 & lt ; alpha & lt ; 0.7375 .	To attain this lower bound , we note that the multinomial distribution is sharply peaked , and apply results regarding primes in short intervals .	This proves that there are infinitely many primes with more than twice as many ones than zeros in their binary expansion .
1	Clustered networks have been proposed in many researches to reduce the power consumption in sensor networks .	Wireless sensor network comprises of small sensor nodes with limited resources .	LEACH is one of the most interested techniques that offer an efficient way to minimize the power consumption in sensor networks .	However , due to the characteristics of restricted resources and operation in a hostile environment , WSNs are subjected to numerous threats and are vulnerable to attacks .	This research proposes a solution that can be applied on LEACH to increase the level of security .
4	It is shown that the splitting angle and the splitting distance between E- and H- polarized beam is the function of anisotropic parameters , incident angle and slab thickness .	The propagation of electromagnetic waves in the anisotropic medium with a single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation is investigated .	It is found that in such an anisotropic medium E- and H-polarized waves have the same dispersion relation , while E- and H-polarized waves exhibit opposite amphoteric refraction characteristics .	E- ( or H- ) polarized waves are positively refracted whereas H- ( or E- ) polarized waves are negatively refracted at the interface associated with the anisotropic medium .	By suitably using the properties of anomalous refraction in the anisotropic medium it is possible to realize a very simple and very efficient beam splitter to route the light .
3	The strong blazar emission indicates that the relativistic radio jet is presently active .	In this article , we demonstrate that PKSJ 1037-2705 has a weak accretion flow luminosity , well below the Seyfert1/QSO dividing line , weak broad emission lines ( BELs ) and moderately powerful FRII extended radio emission .	It is one of the few documented examples of a broad-line object in which the time averaged jet kinetic luminosity , $ \bar { Q } $ , is larger than the total thermal luminosity ( IR to X-ray ) of the accretion flow , $ L_ { bol } $ .	The blazar nucleus dominates the optical and near ultraviolet emission and is a strong source of hard X-rays .	The implication is that even weakly accreting AGN can create powerful jets .
3	The pinning angle , which characterizes the obstacle strength , approaches zero when the void radius exceeds 3 nm .	Interactions between an edge dislocation and a void in copper are investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation .	The depinning stresses of the leading partial and of the trailing partial show qualitatively different behaviors .	The depinning stress of the trailing partial increases logarithmically with the void radius , while that of the leading partial shows a crossover at 1 nm above which two partials are simultaneously trapped by the void .	No temperature dependence is found in the critical stress and the critical angle .
4	We also give a simple example of a Hausdorff space $ X $ such that $ |\mathrm { cl } _\theta ( A ) | & gt ; |A|^ { \chi ( X ) } U ( X ) $ and $ |\mathrm { cl } _\theta ( A ) | & gt ; ( |A|\cdot U ( X ) ) ^ { \chi ( X ) } $ , where $ U ( X ) $ is the Urysohn number of $ X $ , recently introduced by Bonanzinga , Cammaroto and Matveev .	We call a nonempty subset $ A $ of a topological space $ X $ finitely non-Urysohn if for every nonempty finite subset $ F $ of $ A $ and every family $ \ { U_x : x\in F\ } $ of open neighborhoods $ U_x $ of $ x\in F $ , $ \cap\ { \mathrm { cl } ( U_x ) : x\in F\ } \ne\emptyset $ and we define the non-Urysohn number of $ X $ as follows : $ nu ( X ) : =1+\sup\ { |A| : A $ is a finitely non-Urysohn subset of $ X\ } $ .	Then for any topological space $ X $ and any subset $ A $ of $ X $ we prove the following inequalities : ( 1 ) $ |\mathrm { cl } _\theta ( A ) |\le |A|^ { \kappa ( X ) } \cdot nu ( X ) $ , ( 2 ) $ | [ A ] _\theta|\le ( |A|\cdot nu ( X ) ) ^ { \kappa ( X ) } $ , ( 3 ) $ |X|\le nu ( X ) ^ { \kappa ( X ) sL_\theta ( X ) } $ , and ( 4 ) $ |X|\le nu ( X ) ^ { \kappa ( X ) aL ( X ) } $ .	In 1979 , A. V. Arhangelskii asked if the inequality $ |X|\le 2^ { \chi ( X ) wL_c ( X ) } $ was true for every Hausdorff space $ X $ .	It follows from the third inequality that the answer of this question is in the affirmative for all spaces with $ nu ( X ) $ not greater than the cardinality of the continuum .
1	While for a massive field this is a good approximation for all modes when the mass of the field m is larger than the Hubble parameter H , for a massless field only the subhorizon modes with comoving wave-numbers larger than some fixed k* obeying k*/a & gt ; H can be analyzed in this way .	We compute the leading order contribution to the stress-energy tensor corresponding to the modes of a quantum scalar field propagating in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with arbitrary coupling to the scalar curvature , whose exact mode functions can be expanded as an infinite adiabatic series .	As infinities coming from adiabatic zero , second and fourth order expressions are removed by adiabatic regularization , the leading order finite contribution to the stress-energy tensor is given by the adiabatic order six terms , which we determine explicitly .	For massive and massless modes these have the magnitudes H^6/m^2 and H^6a^2/k*^2 , respectively , and higher order corrections are suppressed by additional powers of ( H/m ) ^2 and ( Ha/k* ) ^2 .	When the scale factor in the conformal time \eta is a simple power a ( \eta ) = ( 1/\eta ) ^n , the stress-energy tensor obeys P=w\rho with w= ( n-2 ) /n for massive and w= ( n-6 ) / ( 3n ) for massless modes .
2	In the fields as in the stocks , the seeds are destroyed by pests ( bruchids ) .	Ni\'eb\'e is a food leguminous plant cultivated in tropical Africa for its seeds rich in proteins .	The main problem setted by its production is the conservation of harvests .	These bruchids are always associated with several entomophagous species of hymenoptera .	Four entomophagous species were listed : an egg parasitoid ( U lariophaga Stephan ) , and three solitary larval and pupal ectoparasitoids ( D. Basalis Rondoni , Pteromalidae ; E. vuilleti Crawford and E. orientalis Crawford , Eupelmidae ) .
1	Here we turn on the pion mass and note that the current algebra formula no longer holds exactly .	An earlier calculation in a generalized linear sigma model showed that the well-known current algebra formula for low energy pion pion scattering held even though the massless Nambu Goldstone pion contained a small admixture of a two-quark two-antiquark field .	We discuss this small deviation and also study the effects of an SU ( 3 ) symmetric quark mass type term on the masses and mixings of the eight SU ( 3 ) multiplets in the model .	We calculate the s wave scattering lengths , including the beyond current algebra theorem corrections due to the scalar mesons , and observe that the model can fit the data well .	In the process , we uncover the way in which linear sigma models give controlled corrections ( due to the presence of scalar mesons ) to the current algebra scattering formula .
2	The main idea is to start from bilinear forms for the local average of discontinuous approximations which are rewritten using the theory of distributions .	A mathematical analysis is presented for a class of interior penalty ( IP ) discontinuous Galerkin approximations of elliptic boundary value problems .	In the framework of the present theory one can derive some overpenalized IP bilinear forms in a natural way avoiding any heuristic choice of fluxes and penalty terms .	It is pointed out that a class of overpenalized IP bilinear forms can be obtained using a lower order perturbation of these .	Also , error estimations can be derived between the local averages of the discontinuous approximations and the analytic solution in the $ H^1 $ -seminorm .
1	In this class of theories black holes can be as light as M_ { Planck } /\sqrt { N } and be produced in particle collisions above this energy .	Relying solely on unitarity and the consistency with large-distance black hole physics , we derive model-independent properties of the microscopic black holes and of short-distance gravity in theories with N particle species .	We show , that the micro black holes must come in the same variety as the species do , although their label is not associated with any conserved charge measurable at large distances .	In contrast with big Schwarzschildian ones , the evaporation of the smallest black holes is maximally undemocratic and is biased in favor of particular species .	With an increasing mass the democracy characteristic to the usual macro black holes is gradually regained .
0	We present time-dependent numerical hydrodynamic models of line-driven accretion disk winds in cataclysmic variable systems and calculate wind mass-loss rates and terminal velocities .	The models are 2.5-dimensional , include an energy balance condition with radiative heating and cooling processes , and includes local ionization equilibrium introducing time dependence and spatial dependence on the line radiation force parameters .	The radiation field is assumed to originate in an optically thick accretion disk .	Wind ion populations are calculated under the asumption that local ionization equilibrium is determined by photoionization and radiative recombination , similar to a photoionized nebula .	We find a steady wind flowing from the accretion disk .
4	Hence , the full phase diagram of this paradigmatic model becomes accessible to cold-atom experiments , departing from the region $ t\gg J $ allowed by standard single-band Hubbard Hamiltonians in the strong-repulsion limit .	We introduce a scheme that combines photon-assisted tunneling by a moving optical lattice with strong Hubbard interactions , and allows for the quantum simulation of paradigmatic quantum many-body models .	We show that , in a certain regime , this quantum simulator yields an effective Hubbard Hamiltonian with tunable bond-charge interactions , a model studied in the context of strongly-correlated electrons .	In a different regime , we show how to exploit a correlated destruction of tunneling to explore Nagaoka ferromagnetism at finite Hubbard repulsion .	By changing the photon-assisted tunneling parameters , we can also obtain a $ t $ - $ J $ model with independently controllable tunneling $ t $ , super-exchange interaction $ J $ , and even a Heisenberg-Ising anisotropy .
1	Moreover , each English entry is accompanied by its French and Persian equivalents .	This online dictionary presents the definition of classical as well as advanced concepts of modern astronomy .	The dictionary is intended to be helpful to professional as well as amateur astronomers .	As a notable particularity , it also provides a detailed etymology of English and Persian terms .	The etymological material contained in this work may interest linguists , in particular those concerned with the evolution of Indo-European languages , especially with that of their Iranian branch .
0	Splines are useful building blocks when constructing priors on nonparametric models indexed by functions .	Recently it has been established in the literature that hierarchical priors based on splines with a random number of equally spaced knots and random coefficients in the B-spline basis corresponding to those knots lead , under certain conditions , to adaptive posterior contraction rates , over certain smoothness functional classes .	In this paper we extend these results for when the location of the knots is also endowed with a prior .	This has already been a common practice in MCMC applications , where the resulting posterior is expected to be more `` spatially adaptive '' , but a theoretical basis in terms of adaptive contraction rates was missing .	Under some mild assumptions , we establish a result that provides sufficient conditions for adaptive contraction rates in a range of models .
0	A number of studies have suggested using comparisons between DNA sequences of closely related bacterial isolates to estimate the relative rate of recombination to mutation for that bacterial species .	We consider such an approach which uses single-locus variants : pairs of isolates whose DNA differ at a single gene locus .	One way of deriving point estimates for the relative rate of recombination to mutation from such data is to use composite likelihood methods .	We extend recent work in this area so as to be able to construct confidence intervals for our estimates , without needing to resort to computationally-intensive bootstrap procedures , and to develop a test for whether the relative rate varies across loci .	Both our test and method for constructing confidence intervals are obtained by modeling the dependence structure in the data , and then applying asymptotic theory regarding the distribution of estimators obtained using a composite likelihood .
2	The identification of five- and six-body resonances attached to an excited Efimov trimer provides strong support to the premise of Efimov universality in bosonic systems .	We explore the properties of weakly bound bosonic states in the strongly interacting regime .	Combining a correlated-Gaussian ( CG ) basis set expansion with a complex scaling method , we extract the energies and structural properties of bosonic cluster states with $ N\le6 $ for different two-body potentials .	Our study also reveals a rich structure of bosonic cluster states .	Besides the lowest cluster states which behave as bosonic droplets , we identify cluster states weakly bound to one or two atoms forming effective cluster-atom `` dimers '' and cluster-atom-atom `` trimers . ''
3	Three human pathogens were used to evaluate the performance of the SCM at predicting antimicrobial resistance .	The Set Covering Machine ( SCM ) is a greedy learning algorithm that produces sparse classifiers .	We extend the SCM for datasets that contain a huge number of features .	The whole genetic material of living organisms is an example of such a case , where the number of feature exceeds 10^7 .	Our results show that the SCM compares favorably in terms of sparsity and accuracy against L1 and L2 regularized Support Vector Machines and CART decision trees .
3	The crossover time is estimated as $ t_x \approx 16 hours $ .	We reconsider a number of measurements for the overall hydration kinetics of tricalcium silicate pastes having an initial water to cement weight ratio close to 0.5 .	We find that the time dependent ratio of hydrated and unhydrated silica mole numbers can be well characterized by two power-laws in time , $ x/ ( 1-x ) \sim ( t/t_x ) ^\psi $ .	For early times $ t & lt ; t_x $ we find an `accelerated ' hydration ( $ \psi = 5/2 $ ) and for later times $ t & gt ; t_x $ a `deaccelerated ' behavior ( $ \psi = 1/2 $ ) .	We interpret these results in terms of a global second order rate equation indicating that ( a ) hydrates catalyse the hydration process for $ t & lt ; t_x $ , ( b ) they inhibit further hydration for $ t & gt ; t_x $ and ( c ) the value of the associated second order rate constant is of magnitude 6x10^ { -7 } - 7x10^ { -6 } liter mol^ { -1 } s^ { -1 } .
4	In this paper , we show that thermal neutrons with vanishing kinetic energy can induce nuclear fission when high voltage is applied to fissionable materials .	In nuclear power generation , fissile materials are mainly used .	For example , $ U^ { 235 } $ is fissile and therefore quite essential for use of nuclear energy .	However , the material $ U^ { 235 } $ has very small natural abundance less than 1 % .	We should seek possibility of utilizing fissionable materials such as $ U^ { 238 } $ because natural abundance of such fissionable materials is generally much larger than fissile ones .
4	The resulting distribution and evolution of such antimatter regions could cause every galaxy to be a harbour of an anti -- star globular cluster .	The whole set of astrophysical data indicates that our Universe is globally baryon asymmetrical .	Nevertheless a possibility of existence of relatively small amount of sufficiently large antimatter regions is not excluded .	Such regions can survive the annihilation with surrounding matter only in the case if their sizes exceed a certain scale .	It is shown that quantum fluctuations of a complex scalar field caused by inflation can generate large antimatter domains progenitors , which contribute insignificantly to the total volume of the Universe .
2	The recursive structure of the graph accounts for the exponential power decay and the avalanche effect .	In measurements of in-room radio channel responses an avalanche effect can be observed : earliest signal components , which appear well separated in delay , are followed by an avalanche of components arriving with increasing rate of occurrence , gradually merging into a diffuse tail with exponentially decaying power .	We model the channel as a propagation graph in which vertices represent transmitters , receivers , and scatterers , while edges represent propagation conditions between vertices .	We derive a closed form expression for the graph 's transfer matrix .	This expression is valid for any number of interactions and is straightforward to use in numerical simulations .
2	Based on general grounds as symmetries and relevance we introduce a field theoretic Hamiltonian for semi-infinite random resistor networks .	We study the effects of surfaces on resistor percolation at the instance of a semi-infinite geometry .	Particularly we are interested in the average resistance between two connected ports located on the surface .	We show that the surface contributes to the average resistance only in terms of corrections to scaling .	These corrections are governed by surface resistance exponents .
2	Unfortunately their computational complexity is prohibitive for any practical application .	In this paper we propose a new approach for learning local descriptors for matching image patches .	It has recently been demonstrated that descriptors based on convolutional neural networks ( CNN ) can significantly improve the matching performance .	We address this problem and propose a CNN based descriptor with improved matching performance , significantly reduced training and execution time , as well as low dimensionality .	We propose to train the network with triplets of patches that include a positive and negative pairs .
3	It gives an imperfectly canceled J_2 signal of 10.8 milliarcseconds per year corresponding to 23 % of the Lense-Thirring signature .	The strategy followed so far in the performed or proposed tests of the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitational field of the Earth with laser-ranged satellites of LAGEOS type relies upon the cancelation of the disturbing huge precessions induced by the first even zonal harmonic coefficient J_2 of the multipolar expansion of the Newtonian part of the terrestrial gravitational potential by means of suitably designed linear combinations of the nodes \Omega of more than one spacecraft .	Actually , such a removal does depend on the accuracy with which the coefficients of the combinations adopted can be realistically known .	Uncertainties of the order of 2 cm in the semimajor axes a and 0.5 milliarcseconds in the inclinations I of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II , entering the expression of the coefficient c_1 of the combination of their nodes used so far , yield an uncertainty \delta c_1 = 1.30 10^-8 .	Uncertainties of the order of 10-30 microarcseconds in the inclinations yield \delta c_1=7.9 10^-9 which corresponds to an uncanceled J_2 signature of 6.5 milliarcseconds per year , i.e.14 % of the Lense-Thirring signal .
3	We then re-express the R+f ( G ) action , where G is the Gauss-Bonnet term , as a second order theory with a new set of field variables , four tensor fields and one scalar and study its dynamics .	We revisit the dynamical equivalence between different representations of vacuum modified gravity models in view of Legendre transformations .	The equivalence is discussed for both bulk and boundary space , by including in our analysis the relevant Gibbons-Hawking terms .	In the f ( R ) case , the Legendre transformed action coincides with the usual Einstein frame one .	For completeness , we also calculate the conformal transformation of the full Jordan frame R+f ( G ) action .
